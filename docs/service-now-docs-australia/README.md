Australia release family documentation.

## Refresh cadence

This repository is updated whenever the ServiceNow AI Platform documentation
is republished to [the product documentation site](https://www.servicenow.com/docs),
normally at least monthly, sometimes more often.

## Tips

* Point your AI at `llms.txt` and it should be able to find everything, i.e. "Read [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/README.md) and explain AI Control Tower".
* **Windows Users:** If you encounter "filename too long" errors when cloning, run:
  ```
  git config --global core.longpaths true
  ```
