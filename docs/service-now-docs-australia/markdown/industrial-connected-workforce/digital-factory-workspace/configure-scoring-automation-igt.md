# Configure scoring and automation in Industrial Guided Tasks

Configure scoring and automation for guided tasks to provide a measure of task performance and automation of processes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_icw\_igt.standard\_author

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Standards hub** &gt; **Standards**.

2.  Open the standard that you want to configure.

3.  Select **Advanced configuration**.

    You’re in the Smart Assessment Workspace.

4.  Configure the following advanced features in the Smart Assessment Workspace:

    1.  Configure automation of guided tasks by selecting the **Automations** tab.

        The availability of the Automation feature is dependent on the installation of Automation plugins described in [Smart Assessment Engine automation plugin dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/sae-automation-plugin-dependencies.md). For the detailed information about configuring automations in Smart Assessment Engine, see [Configure post-assessment actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-post-assessment-actions.md).

    2.  Configure scoring for guided tasks by selecting the **Scoring** tab.

        For detailed information about configuring Scoring in Smart Assessment Engine, see [Configure scoring for an assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-scoring-for-assessments.md).

    3.  Enable normalized scoring for the standard.

        Normalized scoring applies advanced calculations that adjust raw assessment scores for guided tasks. To enable normalized scoring on a standard:

        1.  In the Smart Assessment Workspace, navigate to the scoring configuration for the standard.
        2.  Enable the normalization option for the standard.
        **Note:** Normalization must first be enabled on the assessment template category by an ICW administrator. To enable normalization, select **Enable Normalization** on the Industrial Guided Task category. For more information, see [Create an assessment template category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/create-assessment-template-category-icw.md).

        When normalization is enabled, a normalized score is calculated on the assessment metric. The normalized score is saved to the guided task instead of the raw score.
