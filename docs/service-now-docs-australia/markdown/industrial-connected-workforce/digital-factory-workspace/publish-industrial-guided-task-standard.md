# Publish an Industrial Guided Task standard

Use Industrial Guided Task \(IGT\) standards to create and publish custom industrial standards tailored to your industry and operations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_icw\_igt.standard\_author

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Standards hub**.

2.  Select **New standard**.

3.  On the Guided task tile, select **New standard**.

4.  On the Industrial Guided Task Standard form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Industrial Guided Task standard form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/industrial-guided-task-standard-form.md).

5.  Save the draft version of the standard by selecting **Save**.

    The tile for the created standard appears in the Standards hub.

6.  Navigate to the **Task authoring tab**.

7.  Create an assessment template for your standard.

    The Industrial Guided Tasks uses the Smart Assessment Engine for designing the templates for standards. To learn how to create an assessment template, see [Add instructions and questions to an assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/sae-asmnt-template-populate.md).

    The following authoring rules are in place.

    -   A standard must have a template with sections and optionally, subsections and questions to be able to move to the next state.
    -   A question can be added directly to a section.
    -   A subsection can’t be added to a section that already contains questions.
8.  When the standard is ready to be reviewed for publishing, select **Request approval**.

    If there’s no assigned owner group or the group has no active users, the standard can’t be approved and published. To learn more about approval states and the life cycle of a standard, see [Industrial Guided Task standard and task life cycles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/industrial-guided-task-life-cycle.md).

9.  Select **Save**.


## Result

A new standard is created and displayed in the Standards hub. Depending on its state, the standard displays a label of either Draft or Published.

Some settings configured in the Workspace have their limitations and don't apply to both workspace and mobile.
