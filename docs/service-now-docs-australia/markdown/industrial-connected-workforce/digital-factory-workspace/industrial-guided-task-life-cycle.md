</table>## Industrial Guided Task life cycle

When you start a task, you can make changes and select **Save**. The task then changes to Work in Progress but you can still change the state to On Hold. When you cancel the task, you must fill in the justification and then select **Cancel task**. If the task is a work in progress, the **Continue task** button is available. Once you select **Submit**, the state changes to Closed Complete.

When the state of a task changes it triggers an automatic tracking of task duration. The actual start time is recorded when the task moves to Work in Progress, and the actual end time is recorded when the task is submitted. The system captures the total duration spent on the task, from Work in Progress state till Submitted state. The duration value is then recorded in the business duration field.
