# Create a standard schedule plan

Create a plan for the scheduled creation of standard tasks.

## Before you begin

To create a template schedule, you must define a schedule first. For more information about defining schedules, see [Define a schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_DefineASchedule.md). To create a custom template that is based on shifts, refer to [Define a shift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/define-shifts.md) to configure shifts.

Role required: sn\_icw\_std.standard\_author

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Factory Workspace** &gt; **Select the Standards hub menu \(\[Omitted image "icw-standards-hub-icon.png"\] Alt text:\)**

2.  Open the standard for which you want to create a plan.

3.  Navigate to the tab **Scheduled Plans**.

4.  Select **New schedule**.

5.  On the Scheduled plan form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of field values, see [Schedule plan form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/scheduled-plan-form.md).

6.  Select **Save**.

7.  For custom schedules, select **Custom schedule** to configure the scheduled plan.

8.  To create a shift-based schedule, enable the **Shift** option before filling in the Custom schedule form fields.

    **Note:** If you enable shift-based scheduling, the form hides the **Start date/time** and **End date/time** fields and displays a **Start date** field instead. The system automatically calculates the start and end time frames from the shift configuration. For more information, see [Create a shift-based schedule plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/create-shift-based-schedule.md).

9.  On the Custom schedule form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of field values, see [Custom schedule plan form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/digital-factory-workspace/custom-schedule-plan-form.md).

10. Select **Save**.


## Result

The new schedule plan is displayed in the list of schedule plans for the standard.
