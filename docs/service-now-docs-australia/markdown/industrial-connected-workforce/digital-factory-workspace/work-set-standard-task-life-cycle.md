# Work set standard and task life cycles

A life cycle is the list of states that a work set standard or work set task can go through from creation to closure.

## Work set standard states

|State|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Draft|The standard can be edited by users with the work set standard author role.|
|Review|An approval request has been sent to the owner group. The standard can't be edited.|
|Published|The standard is active and can be scheduled or run from the Standards hub. The standard can't be edited.|
|Retired|The standard is inactive and can't be requested. The standard is read-only and can't be edited.|
|Revised|End state for an older version that has been replaced by a newer version. The standard is read-only and can't be edited.|

## Approval states

|State|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Not yet requested|The standard has not been submitted for approval.|
|Requested|The approval request is awaiting review. Any active user in the owner group can approve the request.|
|Approved|The request has been approved. The state of the standard changes to **Published**.|
|Rejected|The request has been rejected. The state of the standard moves back to **Draft**.|
|Canceled|The request was withdrawn before a decision was made.|

## Work set task states

|State|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Ready|The work set task is created and waiting to be picked up.|
|Work in Progress|The work set task is executing. The system records the actual start time when the task enters this state. The task moves here automatically when a child task starts or a child action closes.|
|On Hold|The work set task is paused. Operators can resume it by setting it back to **Work in Progress**.|
|Closed Complete|All child records are submitted or closed and the operator has submitted the work set task. The system records the actual end time.|
|Closed Skipped|The work set task has expired. Active child tasks move to **Closed Skipped** and active child actions move to **Canceled**.|
|Canceled|The work set task has been canceled by a work set expert. Active child tasks move to **Canceled** and active child actions move to **Canceled**.|

**Important:** A work set task can't be closed while it has active child tasks. Complete or cancel the remaining child records first.
