# AI Search in Digital Factory Workspace

Access the AI Search for Digital Factory Workspace by using the search bar. The system interprets queries to return the most relevant results across configured record types, such as standards, tasks, and knowledge articles.

## AI Search in the Digital Factory Workspace

AI Search in the Digital Factory Workspace interprets user queries to return the most relevant results across configured record types, such as standards, tasks, and knowledge articles. The system processes the search input and identifies associated terms. For example, searching for `brew` may also return results for `brewery`. When a person's name is entered, the system first checks for direct matches in the configured records. If no direct match is found, the system searches for closely linked records.

The search returns the following result types.

-   Standards: Only published standards are shown.
-   Knowledge articles: Only published knowledge articles are shown.
-   Tasks: All tasks are shown, except those with a Canceled status.

Faceted filters appear on the side of the results page and help refine search results. Available filters include:

-   Functional Location
-   Equipment
-   Assignment Group
-   Assigned To
-   Category \(for standards\)

**Note:** Available filters depend on the context and only appear when they're relevant. For smaller result sets, some filters may not be displayed.

The following sorting options are supported:

-   Most relevant
-   Updated \(Oldest\)
-   Updated \(Newest\)

For knowledge articles, two additional options are available:

-   Created \(Newest\)
-   Created \(Oldest\)

Synonym matching is predefined. You can also configure custom keywords, synonyms, and related words for better accuracy.
