## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Assessment Workspace**.

The Purpose field lets you select from the list of assessment template categories.

    **Note:**

    -   Don’t select the Industrial Guided Task category because it’s reserved for creating standards without the use of templates.

        To check categories and their roles, navigate to **All** &gt; **Smart Assessment Engine** &gt; **Template Categories**.

    -   Don’t set the Assessment target, as setting this field breaks the execution.
4.  Select **Create**.

    The template is now created and available in the list of assessment templates in the Assessment Workspace.

    For a description of the field values, see [Add instructions and questions to an assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/sae-asmnt-template-populate.md).
