# Create a deviation in the Industrial Connected Workforce Mobile application

Create a deviation in the mobile app to report an issue that deviates from standard operations, such as an equipment malfunction. This way the issue can be tracked, investigated, and resolved.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_icw.deviation\_user or sn\_icw.deviation\_expert

## About this task

A deviation is any type of equipment or work anomaly that has an impact on work safety, performance, or quality. Creating a deviation means reporting an issue that deviates from the expected standard of operation and starting the resolution process needed to address the issue.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Home page**.

2.  From the Actions menu, select **New deviation**.

    \[Omitted image "actions-icw-mobile.png"\] Alt text: New deviation menu option

3.  On the Deviation form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Deviation form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/industrial-connected-workforce-mobile-experience/deviation-form-mobile.md).

4.  Select **Next**.

5.  On the Deviation form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Deviation form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/industrial-connected-workforce/industrial-connected-workforce-mobile-experience/deviation-form-mobile.md).

6.  Select **Next**.

7.  If applicable, select the origin.

8.  Select the active material that relates to the deviation.

9.  If applicable, select a resolution code.

    The resolution code can be one of the following:

    -   None
    -   Not fixed
    -   Fixed by operator
    -   Fixed by maintenance
10. Select **Submit**.


## Result

The deviation is displayed in the list of industrial tasks and can be viewed or edited. If a resolution code is provided while creating a deviation, the deviation is created in the Closed state by default. In all other cases, the deviation is created in the Found state.

The opened deviation can be:

-   Edited
-   Scheduled for a different time
-   Delayed
-   Fixed
-   Closed
-   Canceled

**Note:** The actions Close, Cancel, and Reopen are restricted to users with the sn\_icw.deviation\_expert role. Other actions are supported for both the sn\_icw.deviation\_user and sn\_icw.deviation\_expert role.
