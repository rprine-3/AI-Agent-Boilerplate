# Core Business Suite Analytics overview

The Core Business Suite \(CBS\) Analytics dashboard provides a unified view of performance metrics and resolution trends across all Business Units in your organization.

## Dashboard data points

\[Omitted image "cbs-dashboard-pa.png"\] Alt text: Core Business Suite Analytics dashboard showing the main tab with performance metrics and resolution trends.

The CBS Analytics dashboard organizes data across a set of tabs and metric sections. The following data points are available on the main **Core Business Suite** tab.

|Data point|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|Dashboard summary|A summary section at the top of the dashboard. Select **Generate Summary** to produce an AI-generated overview of current dashboard data. Review the output carefully, as AI-generated content may not reflect all context and requires human verification before use.|
|Performance trends|Tracks resolution rates over a selected period. Use this section to identify trends, spot emerging bottlenecks, and evaluate whether process changes are having an effect. Adjust the date range filter to compare periods and surface patterns that a daily snapshot does not show.|
|Date range filter|Controls the time window applied to the Performance trends section. Adjust the filter to compare different periods and surface longer-term patterns.|
|AI \(Now Assist\) Resolution Rate|Displays the percentage of requests resolved by AI \(Now Assist\) over the selected date range, shown as a trend line chart with an average value for the period. This metric reflects AI-assisted resolution and should be reviewed alongside human-handled resolution data for a complete picture. AI-generated values may not reflect all context — apply human review before acting on this data.|
