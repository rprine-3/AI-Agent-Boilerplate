# Create a notification

Create notifications for Core Business Suite business units through the Now Assist conversational experience.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the following are activated:

-   AI search \([Activate AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/core-business-suite/activate-ai-search.md)\)
-   Now Assist panel \([Manage ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/core-business-suite/enable-now-assist-panel.md)\)

Role required: admin, sn\_cbs.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Admin Home**.

2.  On the Core Business Suite Foundation card, select **View product overview**.

3.  In the Configuration insights section, select **Configure**.

    The Configure Core Business Suite page opens in the Configuration Console.

4.  Select **Notifications** under the business unit that you want to configure \(for example, Human Resources, Legal, Finance, Health and Safety, Workplace Services, or Source-to-Pay\).

5.  Select **Configure with Now Assist**.

    Now Assist opens the conversational panel, detects the current page context, and invokes the Notification agent.

    **Note:** Now Assist guides you through follow‑up questions and requests confirmation before creating the notification.

6.  Select **Create a new notification**, or enter a natural‑language prompt.

    Example prompts:

    -   `Notify the fulfiller when a [BU name] case is assigned`
    -   `Notify the employee when a [BU name] case is resolved or closed`
    -   `Set up a notification for managers when their direct reports open a [BU name] request`
7.  Respond to the follow‑up questions provided by Now Assist, such as:

    -   The table the notification applies to
    -   The trigger criteria \(on create, update, or both\)
    -   The recipients \(users, groups, or fields\)
    Now Assist processes your responses and prepares the notification details.

8.  Review the notification details.

9.  Select one of the following options:

    -   **No, looks good** to confirm
    -   **Yes, I’d like to make changes** to update the details
10. If you select **Yes, I’d like to make changes**, enter the changes when prompted.

    Now Assist revises the notification and presents the updated details.

11. Review the updated notification details and confirm.

    Now Assist creates the notification and displays a success message.
