# Bulk edit

Edit records in bulk for Core Business Suite business units through the Now Assist conversational experience.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the following are activated:

-   AI search \([Activate AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/core-business-suite/activate-ai-search.md)\)
-   Now Assist panel \([Manage ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/core-business-suite/enable-now-assist-panel.md)\)

Role required: admin, sn\_cbs.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Admin Home**.

2.  On the Core Business Suite Foundation card, select **View product overview**.

3.  In the Configuration insights section, select **Configure**.

    The Configure Core Business Suite page opens in the Configuration Console.

4.  Select **Workplace locations** under Workplace Services.

5.  Select **Configure with Now Assist**.

    Now Assist opens the conversational panel, detects the current page context, and invokes the CBS Bulk Upload agent.

    **Note:** The CBS Bulk Upload Agent supports Workplace Locations for bulk edit.

6.  Select **Bulk edit** or enter a natural‑language prompt.

    Example prompts:

    -   `Bulk edit workplace locations`.
    -   `Edit workplace locations using a template`.
    -   `Bulk edit records for workplace locations`.
    Now Assist processes your request, identifies the relevant template based on the selection, and provides it for download.

7.  Download the template.

    The template downloads as a .csv file.

8.  Open the file in Excel \(.xlsx or .xls\), make the required changes, and save the file.

9.  Upload the updated template when prompted.

    Now Assist analyzes the uploaded file and validates the data.

10. Review the validation results.

11. If errors are reported, review and update the template file as needed, and re‑upload it.

12. If validation is successful, select **Process all rows**.

    Now Assist processes the updates and provides access to the import set.

13. Select **Import Set** to review the updated records.

14. Confirm that the changes are reflected.

15. Select **Mark as configured** when prompted.

    Now Assist confirms that the bulk edit is complete with a success message.

16. Refresh the Core Business Suite Configuration Console to verify that the records are updated successfully.
