# Employee Slate configuration for CBS

Core Business Suite provides two setup options for configuring Employee Slate as the default employee support portal. You can select any one according to your organizational requirement.

Starting with Core Business Suite Foundation version 3.0.5, Employee Slate is the default employee support portal.

The Employee Slate setup options are as follows:

-   Employee Slate for Moveworks
-   Employee Slate for Now Assist

**Note:**

Employee Slate for Moveworks is the recommended path as is mentioned in your instance in terms of overall capabilities. Only in situations where Employee Slate for Moveworks is not available, should you select the Employee Slate for Now Assist option.

If you configure both Employee Slate for Moveworks and Employee Slate for Now Assist, both options appear, each linking to its **Configuration Console**. The following table describes both options.
