# Edit a notification

Edit notifications for Core Business Suite business units through the Now Assist conversational experience.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the following are activated:

-   AI search \([Activate AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/core-business-suite/activate-ai-search.md)\)
-   Now Assist panel \([Manage ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/core-business-suite/enable-now-assist-panel.md)\)

Role required: admin, sn\_cbs.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Admin Home**.

2.  On the Core Business Suite Foundation card, select **View product overview**.

3.  In the Configuration insights section, select **Configure**.

    The Configure Core Business Suite page opens in the Configuration Console.

4.  Select **Notifications** under the business unit that you want to configure \(for example, Human Resources, Legal, Finance, Health and Safety, Workplace Services, or Source-to-Pay\).

5.  Select **Configure with Now Assist**.

    Now Assist opens the conversational panel, detects the current page context, and invokes the Notification agent.

    **Note:** Now Assist guides you through follow‑up questions and requests confirmation before saving changes.

6.  Select **Edit an existing notification**, or enter a natural‑language prompt.

    Example prompts:

    -   `Update the notification for a [BU name] case assignment to fulfiller`.
    -   `Update the notification for a [BU name] case resolution or closure to employee`.
    -   `Update the notification for managers when direct reports open a [BU name] request`.
7.  Enter the name of the email notification when prompted.

    Now Assist retrieves the notification record and displays a link for review.

8.  Review the notification record.

9.  Enter the changes that you want to make.

    Now Assist applies your updates and presents the revised notification details.

10. Review the updated notification details and confirm.

    Now Assist saves the changes and displays a success message.
