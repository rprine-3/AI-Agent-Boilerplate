# Enable Core Business Suite Foundation business units

If you’re using any standard business unit included in Core Business Suite Foundation, update the system properties to enable the Core Business Suite business units for installation.

## Before you begin

**Note:**

-   If you are already using a standard business unit such as Human Resources, Finance, Health and Safety, Legal, Workplace Services, or Source‑to‑Pay that is included in Core Business Suite Foundation, the Core Business Suite business unit does not appear in the installation section.
-   After you update the required system properties, the Core Business Suite business unit appears in the installation section.
-   After you install a Core Business Suite business unit and apply the default configurations, the existing business unit customizations such as notifications and intake forms are overridden.

Role required: admin

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.
