# Synchronize past reservations

Sync reservations made in the past, that is, before configuring the reservation synchronization setup.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the calendar provider is active.

**Note:** In case of Microsoft Exchange On-Premises, ensure that the reservations that you want to sync from the past are not above 1000 per room/resource. If in cases the expected number of past events are more than 1000, it is recommended to modify the system property **sn\_wsd\_rsvsync.ewsPastSyncPeriodInMonths**. Specify the value in months keeping in mind the expected past reservations. A single sync syncs reservations from those many months. Ensure that the specified number of months do not have more than 1000 reservations per room/resource.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Calendar Synchronization** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Calendar Providers**.

2.  Select the calendar provider for which you want to synchronize past reservations.

3.  On the Provider form, ensure that the **Active** option is enabled.

4.  Enable the **Sync past reservations** field.

5.  In the **Sync start time**, specify the start time from the past from when you want to synchronize reservations.

    **Note:** For Microsoft Exchange Online calendar provider, specify the **Sync start time** manually from the subscription record of the reservable sync record for which you are synchronizing the past reservations.

6.  In the **Sync end time**, specify the end time from the past until when you want to synchronize reservations.

    **Important:** The past sync duration must not exceed 1825 days.

7.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The past reservations are synchronized.
