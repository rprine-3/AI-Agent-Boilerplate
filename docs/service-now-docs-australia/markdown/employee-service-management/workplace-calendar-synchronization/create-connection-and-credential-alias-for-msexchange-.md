# Configure Connection and credential alias for Microsoft Exchange Online using the default credentials and connections

Establish connection and credential alias for Microsoft Exchange Online so that you can synchronize reservations. Configure the default credentials and connections. Ensure that the values for the connection and credentials alias are set as specified.

## Before you begin

-   [Configure Microsoft Azure in normal mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-calendar-synchronization/authenticate-mxexchange-with-azure.md)
-   [Set up OAuth connection with Microsoft Exchange Online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-calendar-synchronization/setup-connectivity-with-msexchange-for-calendar-sync.md).

Ensure that the application scope is set to **Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke**. Otherwise, do the following:

1.  Select the Application scope icon \(\[Omitted image "application-scope-globe-icon.png"\] Alt text: Application scope icon.\) on the top-right corner of your Employee Center homepage.
2.  In the drop- down, select the option consisting **Application scope:**.
3.  In the filter navigator, search and select **Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke**.
4.  Refresh the page.

**Note:** Starting from Workplace Calendar Synchronization version 2.0.1, to synchronize the reservations automatically with Microsoft Exchange Online, create a connection with Microsoft Exchange Online spoke version 3.2.1. If you have upgraded to Workplace Calendar Synchronization version 2.0.1, then the following procedure is no longer required. For more information on how to install Microsoft Exchange Online spoke and to set up a connection, refer to [Create a connection with Microsoft Exchange Online spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-calendar-synchronization/create-connection-with-msspoke.md).

    Perform the following actions individually:
