# Create single or multiple calendar providers with Microsoft Exchange Online

For the Microsoft Exchange Online provider, configure single or multiple calendar providers.

## Before you begin

You must have Microsoft Exchange Online spoke version 3.2.4 or later installed.

**Important:** Multi-provider is not supported or is not the same as Exchange hybrid configurations.

**For strict mode:**

-   Ensure that every delegated user \(in the calendar provider\) has a different connection &amp; credential alias, connection, and credential records. However, you can reuse the same OAuth Entity profile in all the credential records.
-   While performing the **Get OAuth token** action for each credential, you must be prompted for credential. When asked, specify the delegated user email credentials.

    **Note:** If you are not prompted for the credential, it may use the credential of the logged-in user on the same browser, which is incorrect. You must close the browser and refresh to be prompted about the credentials.


Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  For normal mode user:
