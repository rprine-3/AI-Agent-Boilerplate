|Process reservations stuck in sync required|Workplace Calendar Synchronization|True|Repeats every 15 minutes|This flow triggers synchronization for reservations that have been waiting for a third party data for more than 15 minutes \(for example Virtual Meeting details\) before triggering a sync call to the calendar.|
|Renew Subscriptions|Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke|True|Daily|This flow retrieves all the subscription records and renews them if renewal is required, based on their expiration time. If a subscription is marked with status as Being deleted, then the record is deleted and is not considered for renewal.|
