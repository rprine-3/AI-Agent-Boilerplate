# Configure Microsoft Exchange Online calendar provider

Configure Microsoft Exchange Online as a calendar provider in normal mode to synchronize reservations.

## Before you begin

**Important:** If you do not want to use the default alias provided by the application for the calendar provider, you can create your own connection and credential alias.

Ensure that the application scope is set to **Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke**. Otherwise, do the following:

1.  Select the Application scope icon \(\[Omitted image "application-scope-globe-icon.png"\] Alt text: Application scope icon.\) on the top-right corner of your Employee Center homepage.
2.  In the drop- down, select the option consisting **Application scope:**.
3.  In the filter navigator, search and select **Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke**.
4.  Refresh the page.

**Note:** For calendars to synchronize successfully, you must have an email address that matches that of the provider.

## About this task
