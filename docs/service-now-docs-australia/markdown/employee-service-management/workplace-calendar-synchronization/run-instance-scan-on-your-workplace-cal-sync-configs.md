# Run Instance scan to check Microsoft Exchange Online synchronization configuration

Execute an Instance scan on your ph keyref="var.workplace-calendar-sync"/&gt; configuration with Microsoft Exchange Online. The Instance Scan application diagnoses the configurations with the calendar provider by running a series of checks using suites.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_rsvsync.admin

## About this task

Run the instance scan using the Instance Scan application to check if there are any incorrect configurations while configuring the Microsoft Exchange Online calendar provider. The scan runs and notifies about any incorrectness.

The ph keyref="var.workplace-calendar-sync"/&gt; application provides you the **Workplace Calendar Synchronization Configurations** suite in the Instance Scan application. For more information about Instance scan, refer to [Instance Scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/hs-landing-page.md). You can run the suite at any time to diagnose the configurations. The suite runs the following configuration checks:

-   **Reservable Sync Configurations Check**: Checks if the reservation sync configurations are correct.
-   **Calendar Sync Active Providers Check**: Checks if there are no active providers as the sync can’t be configured.
-   **Webhook Registry Configurations Check**: Checks for callback URL and the client state in the webhook registry.
-   **Calendar Provider Configurations Check**: Checks if the active calendar provider configurations are correct.
