# Set up personal authentication mode OAuth connectivity with Microsoft Exchange Online

Create a personal authentication mode application registry for Microsoft Exchange Online with your instance for OAuth authorization.

## Before you begin

Configure Microsoft Azure. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-calendar-synchronization/configure-azure-personal-auth-mode.md).

Confirm that the application scope is set to **Workplace Calendar Synchronization**.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System OAuth** &gt; **Application Registry**.

2.  Select the **Microsoft Exchange Online\_personalAuth** OAuth provider created for personal authentication.

3.  On the Third-party OAuth Provider form, fill in the fields:

    For a description of the field values, see [Third-party OAuth Provider form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-calendar-synchronization/wsd-third-party-oauth-provider-form.md).

4.  Right-click in the form header and select **Save**.

    A system-generated OAuth entity profile is created and displayed in the OAuth Entity Profiles related list. For example, Microsoft Exchange Online\_personalAuth default profile.

5.  Select the OAuth Entity Scopes list and verify that the following OAuth scopes are already defined for the OAuth provider profile:

    1.  Calendars.ReadWrite

    2.  Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared

    3.  Offline\_access

6.  Select **Update**.
