## About this task

The application by default providers connection and credential. Perform this procedure if you want to create your own connection and credential alias instead of using the default alias. If you want to use the default alias then refer to [Configure strict mode Connection and Credential alias for Microsoft Exchange Online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-calendar-synchronization/configure-strict-mode-connection-and-credential-alias-for-msex.md).
