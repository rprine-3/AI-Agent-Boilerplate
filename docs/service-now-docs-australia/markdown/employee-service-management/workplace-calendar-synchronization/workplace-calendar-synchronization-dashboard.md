# Synchronization Health Dashboard

Use this dashboard to track the reservation synchronization. Monitor number of events and calendar items created in the application and other details related to them.

**Note:** The Workplace Calendar Synchronization dashboard is migrated to Workplace Central. You can start using the migrated dashboards from Workplace Central. The out-of-the-box dashboards are also migrated to Workplace Central. Old dashboards are not supported for new Workplace Service Delivery customers. For existing customers, old dashboards are currently available but will be deprecated soon.

For more information about the migrated dashboard, see [Reservation Management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/reservation-management-dashboard.md).
