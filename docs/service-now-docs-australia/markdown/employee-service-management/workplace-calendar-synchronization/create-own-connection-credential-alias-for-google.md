2.  In the drop- down, select the option consisting **Application scope:**.
3.  In the filter navigator, search and select **Google Calendar Spoke**.

    8.  Select **Update**.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential aliases**.

    2.  Select the connection and credential record that you created in the initial steps.

    3.  On the form, in the Connections related list, select **New**.
