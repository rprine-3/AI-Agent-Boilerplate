# Configure your own connection and credential alias for personal authentication mode

Configure your own connection and credential alias if you don’t want to use the default alias created during the personal authentication mode application registration. You can configure your calendar to use the alias as an override alias.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Configure your own connection and credential alias only when multiple delegated user emails are required. Ensure that the alias is specified on the calendar provider as well.

Confirm that the application scope is set to **Workplace Calendar Synchronization**.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The application by default provides a connection and credential. Perform this procedure if you want to create your own connection and credential alias instead of using the default alias. If you want to use the default alias, refer to [Configure a personal authentication mode Connection and Credential alias for Microsoft Exchange Online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-calendar-synchronization/configure-personal-auth-mode-connection-and-credential-alias.md).
