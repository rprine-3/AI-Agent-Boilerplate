# No request handling

Make a 'No request' call to test the configuration with the calendar provider.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

No request is a mechanism to validate the generated syntax of the payload of an event created for the calendar. But, instead of sending the event to the calendar provider, it is only created. The admin can validate the payload content of the event \(JSON\) to ensure that is generated as expected. 'No request' ensures that the application does not make any API calls to the calendar provider when you create, update, or cancel a reservation in the Workplace Reservation Management application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Calendar Synchronization** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Reservable Sync Configuration**.

2.  Select the reservable sync record for which you want to enable 'No request.

3.  On the form, ensure that the **Active** option is enabled.

4.  Enable the **No request** option.

5.  Select **Update**.
