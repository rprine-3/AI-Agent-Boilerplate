# Activate Virtual Agent for Workplace Service Delivery

Activate Virtual Agent for Workplace Service Delivery to provide user assistance to employees through a chat interface.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

-   Activate the Glide Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\) that provides the Virtual Agent framework.
-   Activate the Workplace Core plugin \(sn\_wsd\_core\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the application using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you cannot find an application, you may have to request it from ServiceNow store. Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release note information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  Click **Install**.

4.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    If your application requires other applications, install them first if they are not already installed.

    Installing your application also automatically installs the dependent applications or plugins if they are not installed already.

5.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, click **Load demo data**.

    Some applications include demo data, which are sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

    **Note:** If you don't load the demo data for a store application during installation, it is not available to load later.

6.  Click **Install**.

    **Important:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`
