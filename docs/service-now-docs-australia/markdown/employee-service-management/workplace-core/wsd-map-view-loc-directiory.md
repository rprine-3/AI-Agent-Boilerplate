# Work with the Map view on the Location Directory

Work with Map view to search for workplace users, locations, spaces, and neighborhoods. Get directions to a workplace location, meeting rooms, or an employee to collaborate quickly and effectively. Filter spaces based on reservation and occupancy states, space types, or neighborhoods.

## Before you begin

\[Omitted video\] Description: Wayfinding using the Location directory

-   Workplace Core
-   Workplace Reservation Management \(Optional\)

    Filter and display the reservation status for a selected location on the Location directory.

-   Workplace Connectors \(Optional\)

    Filter and display the occupancy status for a selected location on the Location directory.

-   Indoor Mapping
-   Workplace Space Mapping

**Note:** Confirm that the map properties for the Location directory are configured by your administrator. Map properties for the Location directory provide options to:

-   Filter spaces based on reservation and occupancy states
-   Automatically refresh reservation and occupancy data on the Location directory
-   Control the Map display setting options to display permanent and private workplace profile users.
-   Show or hide neighborhoods for a location.

For more information, see [Configure map properties for Location Directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/configure-map-properties-location-directory.md).

The latitude and longitude of your regions, sites, campuses, and buildings must be created. If the latitude and longitude aren’t specified, you can’t view a campus or its buildings on the map. Contact your administrator for more information.

While reserving or viewing a space, the employee can see if a space is part of a neighborhood. The neighborhood icon \(\[Omitted image "neighborhood-icon.png"\] Alt text: Neighborhood icon.\) is displayed on the space card.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Workplace Services**.

2.  From the **Workplace Services** list, select **Browse Workplace services**.

3.  From the **Support resources** section, select **Location directory**.

    By default, the Location directory home page opens on the World map.

    Your location is displayed with a location pin \(\[Omitted image "wsd-location-pin-icon.png"\] Alt text: Location pin that shows the selected location on the map.\).

    .

4.  To select a campus on the map, enter the name of a campus or select a campus name from the **Select Campus** list.

    1.  Select a campus from the list or search for a campus in the search bar.

        If you search for a Neighborhood, all the campuses that contain the neighborhood are displayed on the map and the neighborhood card. You can copy the neighborhood URL from the context menu.

    2.  Additionally, use the zoom in \(\[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-zoom-in-icon-new-loc-directory.jpeg"\] Alt text: Zoom in control icon to focus on the map artifacts.\) controls on the map to bring into focus your location or select the location pin marker icon \(\[Omitted image "wsd-location-pin-icon.png"\] Alt text: Location pin marker on map.\).

        The campus when selected or zoomed into shows the buildings within a campus.

        The selected campus is displayed on the map.

        \[Omitted image "wsd-loc-directory-homepage-with-campus-selected-use.png"\] Alt text: Map view showing selected campus tab.

5.  When you select a campus, the **Select Building** tab is enabled on the menu.

    If you search for a Neighborhood, all the buildings that contain the neighborhood are displayed on the neighborhood card. You can copy the neighborhood URL from the context menu.

6.  Select a building from the **Select Building** list option.

    For example: Building A

    You can also use the Zoom in controls on the map to select a building from a campus.

7.  When you select a building, the **Floor**, and **Neighborhood** menu options are enabled on the menu.

    If you search for a Neighborhood, all the floors that contain the neighborhood are displayed on the neighborhood card. You can copy the neighborhood URL from the context menu.

    The **Show filters** option is enabled when a floor is selected from the **Floor** tab.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-new-loc-directory-campus-buidling-menu.png"\] Alt text: Location Directory home page displaying selected campus, building

    **Note:** The **Last updated &lt;time interval&gt;** label is shown on the map after selecting a building. For example,**Last updated 1 min ago**. The map is automatically refreshed if your administrator has enabled the map property \(**Auto Refresh time interval \(in mins\) for showing Reservation and/or Occupancy information on the Location directory**\). This property fetches the latest reservation and occupancy data on the map.

8.  Select a floor from the **Floor** list option.

    Floors that don't have Indoor Mapping maps are tagged as **Floor &lt;number&gt;- No map** in the Floor tab list. For example, **Floor 5 - No map**.

    **Note:** When a floor doesn’t have a map associated with it, you’re redirected to the Card view. If a location doesn’t have Indoor Mapping, the Card view is displayed by default.

9.  Select the **Neighborhood** check box to show designated neighborhoods for a selected location.

    Neighborhoods are color-coded based on the assigned department, cost center, or workplace entity. For more information, see Step 17.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-neighborhoods-map-new-loc-directory.png"\] Alt text: Map view showing neighborhoods for a selected location..

10. Select the **Refresh view** icon on the map \(\[Omitted image "wsd-refresh-icon-loc-directory.png"\] Alt text: Refresh view icon to manually refresh the map and fetch reservation and occupancy status.\) to refresh the map.

    When you manually refresh the map, the application fetches the latest reservation and occupancy status for a selected location.

11. Select **Show Filters** to filter spaces on the map by reservation states, occupancy states, and space types \(rooms, gym, elevator, and so on\).

    **Note:** The **Show filters** button is displayed on the map when **Show Reservation and/or Occupancy information on the Location directory** \[sn\_wsd\_space\_map.show\_rsv\_occ\_data\_loc\_dir\] map property is set to **Yes** by your administrator. Filters can be applied at a floor or space level. When this property is set to **No**, only space type filters are available for you to select.

    Select and filter any of the following available options in the All filters dialog box:

    -   View space availability and reservation status on the map, select the **Reservation status** check box.

        The map displays reservation status and spaces are shown with color-coded icons for different reservation states on the map. For more information, see Legends in Step 17.

        -   Booked
        -   Available

    -   Select the **Occupancy status** check box to view only occupancy sensor data icons on the map.

        The map displays reservation status and spaces are shown with color-coded icons for different reservation states on the map. For more information, see Legends in Step 17.

    -   Select any of the following occupancy states and filter spaces on the map with occupancy data.
        -   Occupied
        -   Not Occupied
        -   Sensor not installed
        -   Sensor not working
    -   Selecting the **Select All** option to filter all occupancy states on the map.
    **Note:** Occupancy states are only shown on the map if Workplace Connectors is installed and configured for a selected location. Your administrator must also configure the map property **Show Reservation and/or Occupancy information on Location directory \[sn\_wsd\_space\_map.show\_rsv\_occ\_data\_loc\_dir\]**.

    Spaces on the map with matching the filter conditions are highlighted. Spaces that don’t fulfill the filter conditions or that don’t have a filter applied are shown in white \(polygon color\).

    -   When both reservation and occupancy filters are applied, then maps shows both reservation and occupancy states for a selected floor.
    -   When only reservation or occupancy filters are applied, then only reservation or occupancy states are displayed.
    -   Select the **Spaces** check box to filter selected space types on the map. For example, the following space types can be selected:
