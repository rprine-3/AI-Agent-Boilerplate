# Add or edit a neighborhood assignment of a workplace profile

Add a user or edit a user's neighborhood assignment from their workplace profile directly.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.admin, sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager, sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.space\_planner

## About this task

You can also add a user or modify a user's neighborhood assignment from their workplace profile directly instead of making changes to the neighborhood. The changes are applied on both the neighborhood and the workplace profile. You can edit a user's **Neighborhood**, neighborhood's **Workplace location**, the **Profile type** and other details.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Core** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Workplace profiles**.

2.  Select the user whose neighborhood assignment you want to add or edit.

    1.  On the User Workplace Profiles list, select the Preview icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-preview.png"\] Alt text: Preview icon.\) next to the **Employee** name.

    2.  Select **Open Record**.

3.  On the User Workplace Profile form, go to the Workplace Profile Location Assignments related list.

4.  To edit the existing user assignment, do the following:

    1.  Double click the field that you want to edit.

    2.  Select **Save**.

    3.  Select **Update** to update the profile.

5.  To add a neighborhood assignment, do the following:

    1.  Select **New**.

    2.  On the Workplace Profile Location Assignment form, do the following:

        1.  Set the **Profile type** as **Neighborhood assignment**.
        2.  In the **Neighborhood** field, select the neighborhood to which you want to assign the user.
        3.  In the **Workplace location** field, select the workplace location in the neighborhood to which you want to assign the user.
        4.  Select **Submit**.
        The neighborhood assignment is updated.

6.  Select **Update** to update the workplace profile.


## Result

The user's neighborhood assignment and the neighborhood to which the user belongs is updated. Neighborhood assignments are applicable if **Neighborhood** is selected as the group by or view by option in a scenario or building overview. Location assignments are applicable for all other options.
