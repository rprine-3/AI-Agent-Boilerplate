        -   Occupied
        -   Not Occupied
        -   Sensor not installed
        -   Sensor not working
        -   When both reservation and occupancy filters are applied, then spaces fulfilling both these conditions are shown.
        -   When only reservation or occupancy filters are applied then only reservation or occupancy states are displayed.
        -   Spaces on the map that are matching the filter conditions are highlighted.
        -   Spaces that don’t fulfill the filter conditions or that don’t have a filter applied are shown in white \(polygon color\).
    1.  Select the **Spaces** check box to filter selected space types on the Card view.

        **Note:** Indoor Mapping place types are available as space types on the Location directory.

    2.  Select the required spaces.

        -   Cafe
