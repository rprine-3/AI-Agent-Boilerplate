# Create records for your workplace data

Create individual records of your workspaces, floors, office buildings, and workplace locations within the Workplace Core application. Either insert new data or add records to the existing workplace data.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have the following details:

-   Workplace data for your organization.
-   Data of workspaces that can be marked as available.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.admin

## About this task

If you have a small number of workspaces, you can enter information individually for each workspace down to the Spaces level.

If you have many work sites, you might want to do the following:

1.  Create a skeleton of repeated global information.
2.  Add the individual spaces information in a spreadsheet.
3.  Import the spreadsheet into the application.

    For more information on importing, see [Configuring spreadsheets to import workplace data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/importing-workspace-data-wsd.md).


If you have floor plans, you can create records of data until the Buildings level. Uploading the floor plans loads the data of floors and of the spaces associated with these floors.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Core** &gt; **Space Administration**.

2.  Select the applicable module.

    Create the records in the following order:

    -   Regions
    -   Sites
    -   Campuses
    -   Buildings
    -   Floors
    -   Areas
    -   Spaces
    -   Order
    For example, if you want to create locations of your offices, select **Sites**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:**

    -   The visibility of some of the following fields depends on the module that you selected.
    -   You can leave a field that does not apply to your organization empty.
    The fields on the form differ based on what module you selected. For example, the following form is for Building.
