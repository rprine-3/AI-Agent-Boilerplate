</table>9.  Select **Submit**.

    The employee is added \(auto-assigned\) to a selected neighborhood. Employees belonging to an indicated hierarchy \(auto-assigned\), or employees that are added manually \(on demand\) can interact with a neighborhood.

10. Select the **Execute User Assignments** tab to trigger all assignment rules \(users to added or removed space allocation\) to this neighborhood directly.

    \[Omitted image "neighborhood-auto-assigned.png"\] Alt text: Neighborhood with assigned users and spaces

    **Note:** Neighborhood assignments are applicable if **Neighborhood** is selected as the group by or view by option in a scenario or building overview. Location assignments are applicable for all other options.

    By default, the **Execute User Assignment** scheduled job runs daily or weekly on an instance. You may want to run it for the first time directly. When you run the scheduled job for each user, a workplace profile record is created \(if it's not in your instance already\), and the neighborhood is assigned to that workplace profile.

    -   When an employee is assigned to a neighborhood, a workplace profile is created.
    -   Neighborhoods are assigned to a workplace profile, even if an employee has multiple workplace profiles. All neighborhood assignments are done only on one workplace profile.
    -   An employee can be assigned to multiple neighborhoods. Each assignment is a separate record in the Workplace Profile Location Assignment Related list on the workplace profile form.
    -   The changes are captured in the execution details table and the changes are mentioned as type **Allocation**.
    -   If new spaces are assigned to a neighborhood, the spaces are updated in the neighborhood record.
    -   If spaces are removed from a neighborhood, the neighborhood record is updated when you run the execute user assignment task.

        Workplace Profile records are updated, added, or removed. A move task is initiated for employees who have a new space allocation and who are moved from one floor to another.
