# Migrate locations from Location table to Workplace locations table

After you configure the location migration records, perform the migration action to migrate the locations from the ServiceNow® Location table \[cmn\_location\] to the Workplace Location \[sn\_wsd\_core\_workplace\_location\] table in Workplace Service Delivery.

## Before you begin

Ensure the following:

-   The location migration configurations are active. For more information, refer to [Configure location migration hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/add-location-migration-hierarchy.md).
-   The location migration configuration from Campus to lower levels must always be in the Campus &gt; Building &gt; Floor &gt; Area &gt; Room/Space order. You can also have an optional hierarchy for a location migration configuration.

If you want to change the location type of a location created in the Location table \[cmn\_location\], see [Set the location type in Location table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/set-loc-type-in-loc-table.md).

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Core** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Location migration configuration**.

2.  On the Location Migration Configurations page, select the location migration configurations that you want to migrate.

    **Note:** Ensure that the location migration configurations are active.

3.  Click **Migrate Locations**.

4.  In the confirmation dialog box, click **OK**.


## Result
