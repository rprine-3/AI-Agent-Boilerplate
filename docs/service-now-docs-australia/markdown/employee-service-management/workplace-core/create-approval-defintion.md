# Create an approval definition

Add an approval definition so that you can implement an approval process that is over that definition. The approval is applied on reservations that match the conditions.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with Workplace Reservation Management version 2.1.2, the approval options function as follows:

-   For existing customers, it was possible to configure approval functionality on the Reservable module to approve reservations. After the upgrade, this possibility remains the same until a new approval definition is configured using the following procedure. After you configure a new approval definition, the approval process will run based on the upgrade.

    After the upgrade, disable the **WSD Reservation Approval Flow** in the **Flow designer**.

-   For new customers, the following procedure explains how to configure an approval definition to approve a reservation.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.admin

1.  Navigate to **Workplace Core** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Approval Definitions**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
