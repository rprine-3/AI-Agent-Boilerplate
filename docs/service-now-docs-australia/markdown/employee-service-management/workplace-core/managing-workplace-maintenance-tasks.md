# Managing workplace tasks

Using workplace tasks in Workplace Core, workplace managers can monitor workplace activities that are created and scheduled in the workplace for each shift. They can also schedule planned or on-demand maintenance tasks and generate reports to track the progress of these activities.

## Workplace task creation

You can create workplace tasks in the Workplace Core application for various situations.

-   **Automatically created pre-cleaning and post-cleaning tasks**

    Workplace managers can create shifts and associate employees and spaces to the shift. After workspaces are assigned to a shift and the shift's state is set to Ready, the system automatically creates pre-cleaning and post-cleaning tasks for that shift. These tasks are generated using the respective templates available with the application.

    **Note:** If a shift doesn't have a space associated to it, pre-cleaning and post-cleaning tasks are not auto-generated for it.

-   **Planned tasks**

    Tasks for recurring planned activities that are independent of shifts.

-   **Ad hoc tasks**

    Ad hoc tasks when on-demand cleaning is required.


## Task assignment

Assignments for tasks depend on the task type:

-   Pre-cleaning and post-cleaning tasks are automatically assigned based on their templates.
-   Planned tasks are automatically assigned based on the planned task definition that is used to generate these tasks.
-   Ad hoc tasks can be assigned manually by workplace managers when they create these tasks.

## Signature of completion

For audit and compliance of workplace activities, workplace managers can electronically sign the completed workplace tasks. This action generates a PDF of the signed form and attaches it to the task.
