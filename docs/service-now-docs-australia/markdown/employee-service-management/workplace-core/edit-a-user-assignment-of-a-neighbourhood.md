# Edit a user assignment of a neighborhood

Edit an existing user's workplace profile assigned to the neighborhood.

## Before you begin

If you’re using Workplace Space Management version 1.11.1 or later, you can also edit or remove a user from a neighborhood from their workplace profile directly. Refer to [Add or edit a neighborhood assignment of a workplace profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/add-a-user-to-the-neighbourhood-from-the-workplace-profile.md).

**Important:** From Workplace Space Management version 1.11.1, the **Neighbourhood User Assignments** table is no longer available. Instead, the user assignment can be performed on a workplace profile directly using the **Workplace Profile Location Assignment** table \(displayed a related list on the form\) in the Workplace Core application. The **Workplace Profile Location Assignment** in the Workplace Core is now configured with additional fields such as **Profile type**, **Neighborhood**, and **Source** where all the data is saved. This table helps a space manager to perform scenario planning and save any user assignment-related changes performed on a neighborhood directly on the workplace profile.

On a neighborhood, when you configure a user assignment rule, the neighborhood assignment changes on the workplace profile are automatically saved on the user's workplace profile. On the user's workplace profile, you can know the type of assignment from the **Profile type** field.

If you’re an existing customer, on upgrading, the entities in the **Neighbourhood User assignments** table are automatically migrated to the **Workplace Profile Location Assignment** of the user's workplace profile.
