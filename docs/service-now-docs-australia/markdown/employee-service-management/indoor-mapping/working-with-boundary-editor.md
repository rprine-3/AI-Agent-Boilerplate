# Working with boundary editor

Boundary editor helps to define the mapped area of a campus on the global map by adjusting the campus boundaries to visualize the location of a campus and building on a map. Boundaries are used to differentiate between outdoor maps and indoor mapped areas.

## Before you begin

Floor plans, places, and directions must be within the boundaries in order to be properly displayed. If the boundaries were automatically computed by the system, you can uncheck **Auto compute boundary** to modify the boundaries.

Role required: map admin, map editor, map editor limited

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Indoor Mapping** &gt; **Map Studio**.

2.  Select a Campus.

    The campus is displayed on Map studio.

3.  Navigate to **Manage Workplace**, **Campus &amp; Buildings**.

4.  Adjust or change the boundary of a campus, if changes or updates were made to the campus, and if places, floor plans or directions are now out of the initial boundary set during the campus creation.

    1.  Ensure that the campus is selected on the left panel.

    2.  Move the big dots on the campus or building boundary to edit the shape of a polygon.

    3.  Move the small dots to add a new vertex.

    4.  Double-click on a big dot to remove it

5.  Click **Save boundary** to save the changes.

    The **Save boundary** button is enabled when some changes are made to the campus or map objects boundary.

6.  You can also change or adjust the building boundaries if updates or modifications were made, and if floor plans or directions are now outside of the original building boundary.

    1.  On the left panel, make sure the building is selected.

    2.  Move the big dots on a building to edit the shape of a polygon, and move the small dots to add a new vertex.

    3.  Double-click on a big dot on the polygon to remove it.

    4.  Click **Save boundary** after adjusting campus boundaries.

    The **Auto compute boundary** option is also available adjacent to the **Save boundary** button for both campus and building boundaries.

    \(Enabled by default\) Enabling this option helps to automatically adjust the boundaries when new floor plans, places, or directions are added and they are outside of their initial boundaries. When this option is enabled, the boundaries cannot be manually adjusted. Disable it to manually adjust the building boundaries.
