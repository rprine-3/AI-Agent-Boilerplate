# Synchronize Indoor Mapping map data with CMN location

Synchronize the CMN Locations and Location place types with Indoor Mapping map data, places, and place types.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Make sure that you have configured Indoor Mapping locations, floor plan, and map object:

    -   Add campus, building, and floors in Map studio. For more information, see [Create a campus with buildings and floors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/create-a-campus-building-and-floor.md).
    -   Add floor plan to a floor. For more information, see and [Manage CAD source files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/manage-autocad-files.md).
    -   Add places in Map studio. For more information, see [Manage places](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/manage-buildings.md)
    -   Enable the Default view in the Indoor Mapping Map studio. In the Indoor Mapping select **View editor** &gt; **Default**. Select **All content**.

        **Note:** Enabling the default view in Indoor Mapping is a mandatory step. The Default view is required to render the floor maps in Workplace Service Delivery. For more information, see [Edit with view editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/edit-with-view-editor.md).

2.  Navigate to **Indoor Mapping** &gt; **Campuses**.

3.  From the Campus page, select a campus.

    For example: Demo campus

4.  To create a CMN campus, navigate to **All** &gt; **CMN Location** and open the open the Location table \(cmn\_location\) and select **New**.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-ind-mapping-cmn-sync-form.png"\] Alt text: Building synchronization page showing the proposed Create operation.

    Following options are available:

    -   **Create**: Indicates that a corresponding CMN building doesn’t exist in Indoor Mapping, and a new record should be created. The location name used in CMN location should match with the the location name in Indoor Mapping.
    -   **Link**: Indicates that a matching record from CMN location is found in Indoor Mapping. Select this option to link the CMN building with Indoor Mapping.
    -   **Ignore**: Indicates that the CMN location can be ignored and won't be available in Indoor Mapping.
    -   **Keep**: Indicates that the CMN location is already linked to a corresponding record in Indoor Mapping. This record can’t be changed in the synchronization process.
17. Select **Apply &amp; Next**.

18. If you selected **Create** operation in Step 16, a building is created in the CMN location and the status is shown as **Queued**.

    The synchronization is executed according to the selection operation \(Create, Link, Keep, or Ignore\).

    **Note:** The synchronization process is executed and the operation is Queued till it completes. A synchronization operation must complete before starting a new one. Don't select **Update** as synchronization of location records at this stage is incomplete. Wait for the operation to complete or till the page is refreshed with status **Complete**.
