-   Map editor \(sn\_map\_core.map\_editor\): Map editors can set up maps in the Indoor Mapping Map Studio, import floor plans, and can manage maps \(edit or delete\) in the Map Studio.
-   Map editor limited \(sn\_map\_core.map\_editor\_limited\): This role has limited access to a campus or only few campuses. Users with this role can view and edit campuses that are assigned to them. The Indoor Mapping **All** &gt; **Indoor Mapping** &gt; **Map Studio** menu is hidden and is not available for this role.

    Map administrators can add user criteria record to provide access to a campus for the map editor limited role. Users with map editor limited role cannot view a Campus in the application context menu search **All** &gt; **Indoor Mapping** &gt; **Campuses**.
