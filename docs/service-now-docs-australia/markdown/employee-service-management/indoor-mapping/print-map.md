You can use your web browser to print the map or save it as a PDF.

-   If the map is shifted on the printed page, or the position of icons or the pin is not the same as your instance, set the margins in the print dialog of your browser to **None**.
-   The license text is automatically added to the outdoor map and is included in the printed map. To remove the license text, you must remove the outdoor map by using the **Remove Outdoor Background** option.
