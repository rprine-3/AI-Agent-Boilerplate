# Create a campus with buildings and floors

Create your first Indoor Mapping campus and add a few buildings and floors to it using the Indoor Mapping Map Studio. Import your CAD and raster image source files to complete your campus configuration.

## Before you begin

Install Indoor Mapping and configure basic information about your campus, building, or floors in the Map Studio by importing the floor plan sources.

**Note:** Upload and Import AutoCAD \(DWF or DXF\) or raster image \(PNG\) source files in the Map Studio.

Before you begin to use the Map Studio, ensure that your floor plans meet the following guidelines:
