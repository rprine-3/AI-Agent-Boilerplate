# Create a group reservation

Reserve multiple spaces for different users in a single group reservation.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Workplace users can make a group reservation only if the Reservable Module configuration property **Allow group reservation** is set by your workplace administrator. Make sure that the **Allow invitees** property is unchecked in the Reservation Widget Configuration. You cannot add or invite attendees to a group reservation. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md).

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## About this task

Reserve multiple spaces at a time for different employees in a single group reservation. After you submit the reservation, the reservations are created individually for each employee along with a parent reservation. You can view all the individual reservations in a single parent reservation and modify any details if required.

For example, if you are reserving four workplaces for four different employees. After you submit the reservation, a total of five reservations are created. The fifth reservation is the parent reservation where you can see all the child reservation details and update these reservations as required.
