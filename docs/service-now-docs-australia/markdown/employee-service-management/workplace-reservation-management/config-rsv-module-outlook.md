**Note:** If you’re updating or migrating from Microsoft Outlook Add-in 1.12.2 version or earlier to Workplace Reservation Management 3.0.2, the **sn\_wsd\_msaddin.default\_reservable\_module** is updated automatically. The sys\_id of the default Reservable Module in this property is updated to the latest version of the Outlook Add-in Manifest file. After installing Workplace Reservation Management 3.0, employees can select the updated Reservable Module \(for example, Desks\). They can also opt to use any other Reservable Module assigned to them.
