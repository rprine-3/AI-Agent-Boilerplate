# Create a multi-day reservation

Workplace users can now reserve a space covering multiple days. Employees can reserve a space that spans across multiple days.

## Before you begin

Multi-day reservations can be made when **Max days for multi-day** Reservable Module property value is set in the Reservable module configuration. Default value of this property is set to 1. If the value for **Max days for multi-day** property is set to 1, then it will be considered a single day reservation and multi-day reservation will not be allowed. If the **Max days for multi-day** value is more than 1, the **All day** or single day reservation option is disabled on the reservation portal.

For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md).

This property is dependent on the **Max days in future** value. If the value of **Max days for multi-day** is more than **Max days in future** Reservable Module property, application will show a validation error and will not create a multi-day reservation.

## What to do next

Review your reservation details on the Reservation summary page.

1.  On the Reservation summary page, select **Actions** &gt; **Share reservation**.
2.  In the **Send reservation details to** field, select the users that you want to share the reservation with.
3.  In the **Include a note**, enter a note if required.

5.  When you share a reservation, invitees will receive an email notification.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-shared-email-options.png"\] Alt text: Shared email notification for a reservation with Browse all spaces and Reserve a space for me clickable link options.

    You can perform the following from a shared reservation email:

    -   Login as System Administrator.
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Emails** &gt; **Open shared reservation**.
    -   Two clickable links **Browse all spaces** and **Reserve a space for me** are shown:
        -   **Browse all spaces**: Click the **Browse all spaces** link to open the Reservation portal search page.

            If the shared reservation start date \(current date\) is within the number of days specified in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable Module property, then the **Browse all spaces** clickable link from a shared email notification will show pre-filled dates for a selected team member or colleague on the reservation portal search page.

            \[Omitted image "wsd-shared-email-browse-all-spaces.png"\] Alt text: Browse all Spaces clickable link from shared email showing pre-filled dates on the reservation portal.

            -   On the Reservation portal search page, the **Browse near a person** is selected by default.

                If this path is not available, then, the **Browse all** path is used.

            -   All the fields are pre-filled for a selected team member or colleague.
            -   In case of multi-day reservation, the first day of a multi-day reservation is pre-filled. If the first day is in the past but the current date is still within the reservation time, the current date is selected. In case of multi-day reservation, consider the following:

                -   Start date and time: The first day of the multi-day reservation is shown. Start time is the start time of the reservation.
                -   End date and time: The End date and time of the reservation is pre-filled.
                For more information about multi-day reservation, see [Create a multi-day reservation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/create-multi-day-reservation.md).

            **Note:** If the start day \(current date\) of a shared reservation is past the value set in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable module property, the **Browse all spaces** clickable link will not show pre-filled dates on the Make a reservation search page. Application shows a validation error message "**Reservation date for the selected user has changed. Select a date**'. In this case, employees must manually, select the **Start date and time** and **End date and time**.

        -   **Reserve a space for me**: When an employee clicks open the **Reserve a space for me** link from an email, the space reserved for a colleague or team member is selected by default. The system will create a reservation with the same start and end date and time. If the start date of the reservation falls prior to the current date, then the current date will be taken as the start date of the reservation. For example, if the start date is October 15, 2023 and the current date is October 17, 2023, the system will use the current date \(October 17, 2023\).

            **Note:** When making a reservation directly by using the **Reserve a space for me** clickable link option, application ignores the value set in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable module property and creates a reservation.

    -   Two clickable links **Browse all spaces** and **Reserve a space for me** are shown:
        -   **Browse all spaces**: Click the **Browse all spaces** link to open the Reservation portal search page.

            If the shared reservation start date \(current date\) is within the number of days specified in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable Module property, then the **Browse all spaces** clickable link from a shared email notification will show pre-filled dates for a selected team member or colleague on the reservation portal search page.

            -   On the Reservation portal search page, the **Browse near a person** is selected by default.

                If this path is not available, then, the **Browse all** path is used.

            -   All the fields are pre-filled for a selected team member or colleague.
            -   In case of multi-day reservation, the first day of a multi-day reservation is pre-filled. If the first day is in the past but the current date is still within the reservation time, the current date is selected. In case of multi-day reservation, consider the following:

                -   Start date and time: The first day of the multi-day reservation is shown. Start time is the start time of the reservation.
                -   End date and time: The End date and time of the reservation is pre-filled.
                For more information about multi-day reservation, see [Create a multi-day reservation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/create-multi-day-reservation.md).

            **Note:** If the start day \(current date\) of a shared reservation is past the value set in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable module property, the **Browse all spaces** clickable link will not show pre-filled dates on the Make a reservation search page. Application shows a validation error message "**Reservation date for the selected user has changed. Select a date**'. In this case, employees must manually, select the **Start date and time** and **End date and time**.

        -   **Reserve a space for me**: When an employee clicks open the **Reserve a space for me** link from an email, the space reserved for a colleague or team member is selected by default. The system will create a reservation with the same start and end date and time. If the start date of the reservation falls prior to the current date, then the current date will be taken as the start date of the reservation. For example, if the start date is October 15, 2023 and the current date is October 17, 2023, the system will use the current date \(October 17, 2023\).

            **Note:** When making a reservation directly by using the **Reserve a space for me** clickable link option, application ignores the value set in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable module property and creates a reservation.
