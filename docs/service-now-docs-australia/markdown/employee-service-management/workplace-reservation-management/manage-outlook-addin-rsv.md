# Manage Workplace Reservations for Microsoft Outlook Add-in

Employees can create reservations using the Microsoft Outlook Add-in. They can calendar events or meetings to the Workplace Reservation Management 3.0.2 manifest add-in file.

As of Workplace Reservation Management version 3.0.2, you’re no longer required to install the Microsoft Outlook Add-in plugin. The advanced search widget in the Workplace Reservation Management 3.0.2 version is used for Outlook Add-in reservations. The advanced search widget in the Workplace Reservation Management 3.0.2 version is used for Microsoft Outlook Add-in reservations. To use Microsoft Outlook Add-in, install and configure Workplace Calendar Synchronization. Administrators can configure the manifest add-in file to complement integration with Workplace Calendar Synchronization.

Employees can enable advanced search to filter spaces, work with a reservable module, and make multi-building space selection. Employees can search for a space using the **Map** or **Card** options while making reservations. Employees can update current or existing reservations quickly by updating date, time, location, or workplace services.

When a meeting is created in Microsoft Outlook, the meeting event on the resource is synchronized with Workplace Reservation Management to create a reservation.

Workplace Reservation Management administrators can enable the Reservable module configuration for Microsoft Outlook Add-in. They can migrate or update existing Microsoft Outlook add-in version 1.12.2 or earlier versions to the latest Workplace Reservation Management 3.0.2 For more information, see [Configure Reservable Module for Microsoft Outlook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-rsv-module-outlook.md).

Employees can perform the following using Workplace Reservation Management 3.0.2.
