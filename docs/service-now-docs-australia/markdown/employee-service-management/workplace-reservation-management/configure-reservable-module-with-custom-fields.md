Role required: sn\_wsd\_rsv.admin

## About this task

Configure a reservable module to use the additional details fields that you want to display on the reservation form when employees make a reservation. The fields appear under an additional details section, along with the existing form fields provided by the application based on your configuration. For more information about the reservable module configuration, refer to [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md).

The additional details are displayed when an employee requests a single, multi, recurring and a group reservation. The details entered in the additional details are also displayed in the Reservation summary of the reservation.

To add custom fields:

-   You must create a record producer with the fields. Refer to [Create a record producer to add additional details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/create-a-record-producer-to-add-additional-fields.md).
-   Link the reservable module with the record producer.

## Procedure
