3.  Select **Browse near a person** to search for available spaces near a colleague or team member.

    **Note:** This option appears only if the **Enable browse near a person** Reservable Module property is enabled. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md).

    The **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable Module property can be configured to reserve a space near a colleague for a maximum number of days. The default value of this property is 7. The **Browse near a person** is displayed only when the **Enable browse near a person** option is selected on the Reservable Module. The system counts **Max number of days for browse near a person** from the current date \(day 1\). Here, seven days includes current date \(day 1\) and the next six available calendar days.

    **Note:** When browsing near a person, if there are any private spaces, the private spaces aren’t displayed in the reservation search result.

    **Note:** Enable or update a cost center or department in the user profile location. Only spaces or desks with the same cost center or department are displayed in the user profile locations. Spaces or desks that are assigned as flexible or none are displayed. The search results doesn't display permanent spaces or desks.

    All required fields must be updated in the Make a reservation form when the auto-search option is enabled by your administrator. The auto-search option doesn't work if the required field inputs are missing in the reservation form.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-browse-near-a-person-rsv.png"\] Alt text: Browse near a person reservable path selected with inputs provided in the Browse near a person form fields.

    1.  **Who would you like to sit near?**: Select the user or colleague that you want to reserve a space nearby.

    2.  Specify the following details to search for the most suitable space near a colleague or team member.

        **Note:** You can’t create a Recurring reservation if you're making a reservation near a team member or colleague.

        -   **Select one of their reservation dates**: Reservation dates to make a reservation.

            **Note:** In case, if your colleague has a workplace profile, all dates \(date range\) specified in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** are displayed. In case, if there’s no workplace profile, only the available reservation dates, if applicable, are shown for a colleague or team member. After selecting the dates, you can reserve available spaces. Spaces with privacy enabled \(Private\) spaces aren’t available for selection.

            The dates are visible, based on the following considerations:

            -   Maximum days specified in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable Module property. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md).
            -   Start date and End date: If a multi-day reservation is enabled, you can select a date in the range of a colleague's multi day reservation when making a reservation.

                For example, if **Max days for multi-day** is 10 and you try to make a reservation for 15 days, the application shows a validation error. You’re only allowed to make a reservation for the next 10 days from the current date.

                For more information, see [Create a multi-day reservation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/create-multi-day-reservation.md)

        -   **Select one of their reserved spaces**: Option to show dedicated spaces and reserved spaces that aren’t marked as private for a colleague or team member with a workplace profile. In case, if the selected user or colleague doesn’t have a workplace profile, only the available reserved spaces \(if applicable\) are displayed.

            **Note:** If a colleague has a permanently assigned space and has also had a reservation for the same day or has multiple reservations, you can select either of these spaces to make a reservation near their colleague.

        -   **From**: Reservation start date. The time is displayed based on the selected building's time zone.
        -   **To**: Reservation end date. The time is displayed based on the selected building's time zone.
        -   **All day**: Select this option to reserve the workplace item for an entire day. The start date and time of the reservation depends on the date and time set by your organization. This option appears if your Workplace administrator has enabled the **All day** reservation setting for a selected workplace location.
        -   For a multi-day reservation, the **From** and **To** fields show the date range specified for a multi-day reservation.

4.  Select **Search** to select available spaces from the Card View, Map View, or Scheduled view.

    **Note:** You can’t sort workplace items in alphabetical order or by your favorite locations if you're browsing spaces near a person. The spaces near a person are searched based on proximity.

5.  Select Add to add a space.

6.  Select **Next** to proceed with reserving the selected space.

7.  Review the Reservation details.

8.  Add workplace services as required.
