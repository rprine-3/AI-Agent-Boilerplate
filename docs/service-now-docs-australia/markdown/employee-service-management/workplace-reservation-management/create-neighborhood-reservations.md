# Create neighborhood reservations

Reserve neighborhood spaces using Advanced reservation.

## Before you begin

The option to reserve neighborhood spaces is available only if your administrator has enabled the **Enable browse by neighborhood** option on the Reservable Module Configuration. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md).

The employee can see and select neighborhoods on the reservation portal only when:

-   The employee is assigned to the neighborhood, and the neighborhood is restricted.
-   The employee is assigned to the neighborhood, and the neighborhood is not restricted.
-   The neighborhood is not restricted and the employee is not assigned to it.
