## About this task

When you submit a reservation, you receive an email notification with the details of your reservation and its status. However, you can also view the details of your reservations, modify or cancel your reservation, and track the progress of your reservation using the **My Reservations** page.

**Note:** As an admin or reservation manager, you cannot edit a reservation opened manually using a URL.

You can also view, edit, or cancel a reservation using the Virtual agent chat support. Navigate to **Workplace Core** &gt; **Workplace service portal**, then select the chat icon \(\[Omitted image "chat-icon.png"\] Alt text: Chat icon.\). Enter your question or select **Show Me Everything** to select from a list of available options to make your reservation changes.

You can also update the reserved workplace item in your reservation and change the date and time of the reservation.

2.  On the form, update the information that you want to change.
3.  Select **Update reservation details**.
 **Note:**

-   If you’re changing the location of a reservation, ensure that you change the location name in the subject in case it’s mentioned.
-   If you have additional services in the reservation, the workplace service case is closed and a new one is created.

Based on the software version installed by the admin, the case can remain open and only the child cases are created again.

-   If you have additional services in the reservation, the workplace service case remains open until all the service item requests are fulfilled. Based on the configuration set by the admin, unfulfilled service item requests are either updated, or canceled and recreated.
