# Create a reservation waitlist

When work spaces in a location are fully booked, and employees are unable to find a space, they can join a reservation waitlist.

## Before you begin

\[Omitted video\] Description: Join or create a waitlist to reserve a space.

Employees can join a waitlist when spaces are fully booked or reserved in a location. When a space is freed up or is available, application assigns the space to an employee in the waitlist. The space allocation is done on the basis of weight \(priority\), created date \(start time when the reservation record was created\), and alphabetical order. Email and push notifications are sent when a waitlist is Queued, Confirmed, Canceled, or Expired.

Make sure you have installed and configured the following:

-   Workplace Reservation Management
-   Workplace Core
-   Workplace Central
-   The **Enable waitlist** and **Enable browse by neighborhood** Reservable Module configuration options are enabled by your workplace administrator. For more information, see [Configure Workplace Reservation Management portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/wsd-reservation-setup.md).

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## About this task

You can directly join a waitlist by submitting a reservation waitlist request on the Employee Center portal. When employees join a waitlist, they are added to the waitlist queue. When a Queued space is freed up and is available, a space is assigned for reservation. Status of the waitlist record changes from **Queued** to **Confirmed**.

## Procedure

1.  Create a reservation and if no spaces are available for your preferred location and selected date and time, join a waitlist.

2.  Join a waitlist by navigating to **All** &gt; **Self-service** &gt; **Employee Center**.

3.  Select **Help Center** &gt; **Workplace Services** &gt; **Reservation Waitlist**.

    You can also navigate to the Reservation Waitlist record form by searching for **Reservation Waitlist** or **waitlist** in the search box.

4.  The Reservation Waitlist form opens.

    Fill in the form fields:

    Workplace reservation event planners can prioritize a waitlist that is queued. They can increase the weight of a Queued waitlist record to move it up in the queue for faster space assignment. They can update the weight of a waitlist record to prioritize it in the queue. They can also assign a space on behalf of others for waitlisting a space.
