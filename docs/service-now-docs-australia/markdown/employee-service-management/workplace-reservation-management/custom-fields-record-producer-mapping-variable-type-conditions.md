# Additional details record producer - Mapping Variable types and limitations

When you create a record producer to configure additional details on a reservation form, the variables types and column type must be set differently. In case of reservations, the record producer supports only a few UI policies and client scripts.

## Mapping Variable 'Type' with column type

When you add variables to the record producer, based on the type of field you want, select the **Type** of the variable as follows. For example, In the Workplace Reservation table, in the Columns related list, to set the column **Type** as a **String**, on the record producer, select the variable **Type** as **Multi Line Text**:

|Workplace Reservations Table, Column - 'Type'|Record producer, Variable - 'Type'|

|Choice|Select Box|
|String|Single Line Text|
