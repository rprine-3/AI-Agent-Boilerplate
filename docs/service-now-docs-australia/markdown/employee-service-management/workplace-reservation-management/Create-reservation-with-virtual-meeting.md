</td></tr><tr><td id="d175538e98">

**Employee Center**

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to the Employee Center \(**All** &gt; **Self-service** &gt; **Employee Center\)**\). On the home page, navigate to **Workplace** &gt; **Browse all Workplace** and select the workplace service.
2.  Open the reservation portal and do one of the following:
    -   Click **Reservations** &gt; **Make a reservation**.
    -   On the homepage, select **Make a reservation** directly.
    -   From the Workplace services catalog, select **New general reservation**.

**Note:** If there are multiple catalogs configured on the portal, go to the Catalogs list and select **Workplace Services Catalog**.

        2.  Select **Reservation Management** &gt; **New general reservation**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    The Make a Reservation page opens in a new tab.

2.  Select the type of workplace item that you want to reserve.

    The types are displayed as tabs, such as a meeting room or desk.

3.  Select **Browse all**.

    The **Browse all** reservable path is selected by default.

    1.  Search for a workplace item that you want to reserve using the following available criteria.

4.  Click **Search**.

    The workplace items which match the search criteria and which are available for reservation are displayed.

    **Note:** While browsing near a person, if there are any private spaces, then they are not displayed in the search result.

    **Note:** You can switch between the **Card view** tab and **Schedule view** tab to review the availability of workplace items. If your company uploads floor maps, view the maps using Mappedin or Indoor Mapping. For more information on how to use floor maps, refer to [Workplace Space Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/wsm-mappedin-admin.md).

Your favorite locations are displayed first in an alphabetical order followed by the other locations that match the search criteria.

    **Note:** You cannot sort workplace items in alphabetical order or by your favorite locations if you are browsing spaces near a person. The spaces near a person are searched based on proximity.

## Result

The reservation is created with a virtual meeting link. If you have invited attendees to the reservation, the meeting link is provided to them along with the reservation details.

To view the reservation recording, go to Reservation summary of the reservation and select **Additional details**. If passcode is configured for virtual meeting provider, then, in the **Additional details**, you can also view the relevant passcode. Only the organizer and the user specified in the **This reservation is for** field can view the passcode.

-   Zoom: If a Zoom meeting link is added, the link appears in the **Location** field of the email containing the meeting invite.
-   Microsoft Teams: When a reservation is created with a virtual meeting link, the application retrieves the meeting link and the joining-related details. When this reservation is synchronized with Microsoft Outlook calendar, the meeting link and the joining-related details are added to the body of the calendar event. Similarly, when a reservation is created in the Microsoft Outlook calendar using the **Teams meeting** toggle button, the meeting link is retrieved and saved as a virtual meeting link.

    **Note:** As the meeting link appears in the body of the email, in any case, if you want to update or change the meeting details, you must do it only using the Workplace Reservation Management. Because when a reservation synchronization is performed, the details \(in this case, the meeting link and details\) are synchronized only in one way, that is, from Workplace Reservation Management to the calendar provider\(in this case Microsoft Teams\). If you already made any changes to the meeting details or the notes from the calendar provider, it is overwritten by Workplace Reservation Management when a synchronization is performed.

-   **Any other virtual meeting providers**: The meeting link is added in the **Location** field of the email containing the meeting invite.
