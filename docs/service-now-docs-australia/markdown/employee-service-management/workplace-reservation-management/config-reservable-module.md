# Configure a reservable module

Create a Reservable Module to add a group of similar reservable workplace items. These workplace items are displayed in a single category on the Reservation portal.

## Before you begin

**Warning:** Starting with Workplace Reservation Management version 2.1.2, to create or view approvers or performer criteria, navigate to **Workplace Core** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Performer Criteria**.

-   After the upgrade, the Reservable module's **Require approval** option is changed to **Override approval policy**.

    Before the upgrade, if a reservable module has the **Require approval** option enabled, then, after the upgrade, it is migrated as **Always require approval** in the **Override approval policy** option. Otherwise, the **Override approval policy** is set to **Never require approval**.

-   For existing customers, the Reservable module's approval functionality that were configured earlier to approve reservations remain the same until a new approval definition is configured. After you configure a new approval definition, the approval process will run according to the upgrade.

    After the upgrade, disable the **WSD Reservation Approval Flow** in the **Flow designer**.


Ensure that you have the following details:

-   Workplace data for your organization.
-   Data of workspaces that can be marked as available.
-   Configure approvers/performer criteria

See [Create records for your workplace data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/create-records-of-workplace-data-wsd.md) to add workplace data.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_rsv.admin

## About this task

A Reservable module groups similar types of workplace items. Employees can view these similar items in one category. For example, a room is a reservable module and it contains similar workplace items like meeting rooms, conference rooms, and other rooms.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Reservation Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Reservable Module**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name for the reservable module. For example, for meeting rooms, the name should be categorical like `Desks`, `Meeting rooms`, or `Rooms` and so on.|
    |Inline title|Title for the reservable module. The title is displayed inline with a descriptive text on the Workplace Service Portal.|
    |Order|Order in which the reservable module must appear on the Reservation portal.|
    |Active|Option to make the module available for reservation.|
    |Active from|Date from when the reservable module must be active and available for reservation.|
    |Image|Image of the reservable module.|

4.  Select the Reservable Table Configuration tab.

    On the form, fill in the fields.

Selection type

</td><td>

Type of selection to display in the search results when employees searche. Select one of the following options:-   **Specific unit**: The search result displays every workplace item.
-   **Container**: The search result displays the parent or container of the workplace items. If you select **Container**, the search results are displayed in groups with a defined quantity available for reservation. Employees can select a container to reserve and any available space from the container is assigned for reservation.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Reservable type

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reservable filter

</td><td>

Filter conditions on the reservable items in the Reservable table. The reservable items are displayed on the application based on the given conditions. You can do the following:-   To add a condition, select **Add Filter Condition**.
-   To add an OR condition, select **Add "OR" Clause**.
 **Note:** If you are adding a filter on a location, ensure that the **Active** and **Is reservable** fields are set to **True**. If you do not, then inactive items that are not reservable will be displayed as reservable.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reservable quantity field

</td><td>

Reservable quantity for workplace spaces. The **Reservable Quantity** field determines the number of times a container can be booked within a specific reservation time period. This setting provides with flexibility in setting up space reservations without out the need to create individual space records for reservation. For example, if you select **Reservable Quantity**, the container can be reserved as many times as the combined reservable quantity values of all spaces within that container allow. The reservable quantity depends on the number of spaces provided in the Capacity column of the Workplace Core Space table.

Option to automatically resolve recurring reservation conflicts. This option is available when you have enabled the **Allow recurring reservations** option

Resolving a conflict uses one of the following proximity calculations:

-   If a floor map is available, in that case, the application tries to find a space that is closest by using proximity.
-   If in case a floor map is not available, then the application tries to find a space within the same area or floor.

**Note:** Favorite spaces are always preferred in both the options.

-   Lastly, the application searches for an alternative space either with:
    -   same capacity
    -   more capacity
    -   less capacity
