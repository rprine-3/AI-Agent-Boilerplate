# Customize field labels in a Journey Accelerator plan header

Customize the labels for fields that are available in the Journey Accelerator Plan \[sn\_ja\_plan\] table so that users have a customized and consistent experience. You can use customized plan headers for different plan types.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ja.admin

## About this task

Journey Accelerator plans use three different roles:

-   Manager
-   Employee
-   Mentor

You can customize the plan header for each role. You can also customize role-based permissions, field labels, and role-based plan preferences. Plan header fields are available in the Journey Accelerator Plan \[sn\_ja\_plan\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Journey Accelerator** &gt; **Manage Plan Header Configuration** , and click **New**.

2.  In the **Name** field, enter a meaningful name.

    The name should be meaningful to the role that you are creating the custom header for. For this task, enter `Support Manager Plan Header`.

3.  Click **Submit**.

4.  Open the plan header configuration that you created.

5.  Click **New** .

6.  In the Details list, select **Mentors can edit**.

7.  In the **Custom label** field, enter `buddy` and click **Update**.

8.  Click **Update** again.

    Any plan type role that uses this plan header displays the label buddy in the plan header. Labels apply to individual roles. Each role can have its own customized labels.

    Configure unique plan headers for different plan types. For more information, see [Create and manage Journey Accelerator plan types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/journey-accelerator/create-manage-ja-plans.md).
