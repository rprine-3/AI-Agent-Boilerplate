# Domain separation for Emergency Self Report

The following table lists the domain separation use cases for service providers \(SPs\) using this application.

|Use case|Functions|Limitations|
|--------|---------|-----------|
|SP Internal - SP uses the application for internal employees to self-report their status via a dedicated service portal or web page.|Yes|None|
|SP External - SP uses the application for tenant employees to self-report their status via a dedicated service portal or web page.|Yes|None|
|Tenant - Tenant uses the application for their sub-domain for their employees to self-report their status via a dedicated service portal or web page.|Yes|None|

Some modules in the Emergency Self Report application are affected by domain separation. These modules can be used by SPs and tenants.

-   **ALL HEALTH RECORDS &amp; HR TASKS module \(Crisis Tasks\)**
    -   Domain column row protections exist.
