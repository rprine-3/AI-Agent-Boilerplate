# Emergency Self Report

During a crisis, the ServiceNow® Emergency Self Report application gives users a way to notify their organization of their health status. It also provides a workflow for qualified users to safely return to work. Managers and response teams can track user reporting.

In contrast to email or phone reporting and manual data consolidation, Emergency Self Report provides a digital workflow that captures and automatically rolls up user reporting data for analysis and action. The application offers benefits for various people within the organization, with different views displayed for various roles.

-   **Use guided setup to implement Safe Workplace suite apps**

    The Safe Workplace guided setup provides a sequence of tasks that help you configure the Safe Workplace and Emergency Response Management applications on your ServiceNow instance. To open the Safe Workplace guided setup, navigate to **Guided Setup** &gt; **Safe Workplace Guided Setup**. For more information about using the guided setup interface, see [Using guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/guided-setup.md).


## Users can report their status

A menu-driven interface enables users to report their status to their managers. Users can use the same interface to update their manager and global response team when they are ready to return to work. Managers can notify users when they may return.

If ServiceNow® [Contact Tracing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contact-tracing/contact-tracing.md) is installed, a case is created automatically for a user who self-reports as being in quarantine. If an active case exists for the user at the time of reporting, a note is added to the case for the self-reporting.

## Managers can monitor the status of their teams

Managers can view a summary of their team’s reported status and the details of an individual person. They can reassign an affected user’s work to others on the team if the work is tracked in the ServiceNow instance. If users don't have access to the application, the manager can submit a report on their behalf.

\[Omitted image "employee-self-report-dashboard-manager-view-fullscreen.png"\] Alt text: Managers can see status for all direct reports, and see what tasks they need to reassign

## Response teams can view the status of all teams

Response teams can view an overview dashboard that summarizes the status for all self-reported users. Data can be viewed and sorted in multiple ways for analysis and action.

## Response team can work with HR tasks

HR tasks are created when a user self-reports. Each HR task is associated with a self-reported crisis task. The response team member can navigate to **Emergency Self Response** &gt; **HR tasks** to view the list.

\[Omitted image "esr-hr-tasks-list-import-tasks.png"\] Alt text: HR task list

HR tasks do not have a specific workflow associated with them. They are created in the Open state, and closing the associated crisis task does not affect the HR task. Your organization can determine how to use or manage HR tasks, if at all. Review the HR task form to determine whether it can be of use within your response strategy.

## Use with other Emergency Response Management applications

Emergency Self Report was originally developed to monitor and aid in stopping the community spread of COVID-19 among users. It is part of the suite of ServiceNow® Emergency Response Management applications built on the ServiceNow AI Platform® to assist companies in their emergency response efforts. With the [Emergency Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-exposure-management/emergency-exposure-management.md) application, you can identify users who might have been exposed. You can then contact affected users through the [Emergency Outreach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-outreach/emergency-outreach.md) application. Both applications are available in the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

## Emergency Response Management for federal customers

Federal customers using IL4 or FedRAMP environments will see the Emergency Response Management applications ready and available to install on their instances without having to make any special requests. Customers are responsible for configuring the apps to meet U.S. federal regulations and guidelines.
