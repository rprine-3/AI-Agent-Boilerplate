# Install Legal Matter Management

You can install the Legal Matter Management application \(sn\_lg\_matter\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   If the application requires plugins or other store applications, install them first if they are not already installed.
-   Review the [Legal Matter Management](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/8570d70bb32313007a6de81816a8dcf3) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.

Role required: admin
