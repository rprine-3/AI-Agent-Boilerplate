# Create an artifact for a legal matter

Create an artifact for a legal matter to upload and store documents, emails, and files related to the matter.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_matter.matter\_fulfiller

## About this task

As a collaborator added to a legal matter, you can access and work on the legal matter just as matter owners can. However, you can't modify the **Matter owner**, **Assignment group**, and **Assignment group permission** fields.

Apart from the matter owner, a collaborator or a task fulfiller can also add an artifact to a matter task from the **Tasks** tab.

**Note:** If any files were attached to the request before it was promoted to a matter, a default artifact containing those files is created in that matter. If the external storage option is enabled, the documents in the artifact created from the requests are shared. So, the addition or deletion of any documents in this shared artifact is reflected in both request and matter. Also, the document permission for this shared artifact is managed at the legal request level and not at the legal matter level.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Legal Request** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center**.

2.  In the Legal Counsel Center tab, select the list icon \[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.

3.  In the **Lists** tab, open a legal matter by selecting an option under **Matters**.

    The artifact with the specified details is created.

    1.  Click **New** to add a new storage path.

    2.  Enter a valid link to the storage folder and a short description.

    3.  Click **Save**.

8.  Associate the artifact with a matter task.

    **Note:** If you create an artifact from a matter task, the artifact is associated to the task by default.

    1.  In the **Matter Task** tab, select an artifact and click **Add**.

    2.  In the Add Legal Task dialog box, select a matter task and click **Add**.

    When the matter owner assigns this task to a group or a user, they get the access to the artifact automatically. Users who can access the artifact are listed in the **Artifact Users** tab.

9.  Revoke the access permission of users who were given default access through the associated matter task.

    1.  In the **Artifact Users** tab, select one or more users to whom you want to deny access to the artifact.

    2.  Click **Revoke permissions**.

    3.  Click **Save**.
