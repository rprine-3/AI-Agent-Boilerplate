# Configure data to enable matter creation in Legal Tracker

Configure the data that is required to create a matter in Legal Tracker.

Matter type template in Legal Tracker helps define the fields and default options that are tracked for each matter type. This enables administrators to determine what data will be tracked in Legal Tracker matters. The current integration supports the minimal fields required by the Legal Tracker to create matter. Administrators should identify matter type templates with additional required fields for matter creation and create the records for them in the table Legal Tracker Matter Template \[sn\_lg\_matter\_legal\_tracker\_matter\_template\].

Data configured in tables serve as values, which submitters select when submitting an outside engagement request form. The values are used in the Legal Tracker to generate a matter.

To avoid failures while creating matter in Legal Tracker, administrators should maintain the same data as in Legal Tracker in the following tables.
