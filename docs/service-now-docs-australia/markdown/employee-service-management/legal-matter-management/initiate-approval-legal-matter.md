# Initiate an ad hoc approval for a legal matter or its artifact

Initiate an ad hoc approval for a legal matter or its artifacts from a user or a user group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_ops.legal\_fulfiller

## About this task

Some cases where approvals can be requested for a legal matter or its artifact include:

-   Approval for legal contract documents from stakeholders.
-   Ad hoc approval for a legal matter that needs an authorization from the privacy team before it can be processed.

You can assign these approvals to any user or user group in your organization who have the legal\_user role. When you initiate an approval, the approvers receive an email notification and can review and act on the approval.

**Note:**

-   If a legal matter or artifact already has a pending approval record, you cannot initiate another approval for the same item.
-   Attachments that have an ad hoc approval record in the Requested state cannot be removed from a legal matter. To remove such attachments, either cancel the ad hoc approval request or obtain the approval first.
-   When you remove an attachment from a legal matter, it also deletes the associated ad hoc approval records.

As a collaborator added to a legal matter, you can access and work on the legal matter just as matter owners can. However, you can't modify the **Matter owner**, **Assignment group**, and **Assignment group permission** fields.
