# Document access in a legal matter

Documents attached to legal matters are uploaded to the configured external storage system when the external storage option is enabled on an intake form with All or matter type selected.

-   Users added to the matter can request on-demand access to documents if they need access before the scheduled job is run.
-   The legal admin can revoke a user's access to documents of a legal matter and legal requests.
