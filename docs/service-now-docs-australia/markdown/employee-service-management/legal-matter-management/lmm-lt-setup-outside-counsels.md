# Add outside counsel details

Add outside counsel details for an outside firm to enable matter creation in Legal Tracker.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have installed and activated Legal Tracker spoke. For more information, see [Legal Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/legal-tracker-spoke.md).

Verify the schedule job **Fetch Firms Data** has been executed once before you add the outside counsel details for an outside firm.

Role required: sn\_lg\_matter.matter\_config, sn\_lg\_matter.matter\_fulfiller

## About this task

To create a matter in Legal Tracker, the information related to an outside firm and its outside counsels should be present in both Legal Tracker and Legal Matter Management.

The scheduled job **Fetch Firms Data** pulls the data for outside firms from Legal Tracker into Legal Matter Management, but there is no scheduled job to pull the name and email of the outside counsels. For enabling matter creation, manually add the outside counsel name and email for the outside firm in Legal Matter Management.

## Procedure

1.  Collect the outside counsel name and email address for the outside firm from Legal Tracker.

2.  Open the outside counsels list.
