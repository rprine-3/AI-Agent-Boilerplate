</table>4.  Click **Submit**.

    A legal matter template is created in the Draft state. The Phases, Tasks, Approvals, and Approver Groups related lists are displayed.

5.  In the Phases related list, [create phase templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/create-phase-template-for-matter-template.md).

6.  In the Tasks related list, [create task templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/create-task-template-for-matter-phase-template.md).

    You can also create matter task templates from the Tasks related list on the Matter Phase Template form.

7.  In the Approver Groups related list, add user groups to whom the matter template is sent for approval.

    1.  In the Approver Groups related list, click **Edit**.

    2.  On the Edit Members form, select a user group from the **Collection** list and click **Add** to add it to the **Approver Groups List**.

        Only the user groups from the Legal department are listed in the **Collection** list.

    3.  Click **Save**.

        The selected approver groups are added to the Approver Groups related list. The members of these groups are listed in the Approvals related list. An email notification is sent to these members for approval of the matter template.

        **Note:** Any user who belongs to multiple groups will only receive one notification and will only appear once in the Approvals list.

8.  Click **Submit for approval**.

    -   If an approver group is selected, the template is sent to the group for approval. The state of the matter template updates to Waiting Approval. Anyone from the approver group can [review and approve the matter template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/approve-reject-matter-template.md) to publish it.
    -   If an approver group is not selected, the matter is directly published and its state is Published.
    **Note:** When an existing matter template is updated and published, any associated intake forms reflect the latest version of the template.
