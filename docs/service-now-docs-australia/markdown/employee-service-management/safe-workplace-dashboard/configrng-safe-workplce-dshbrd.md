# Create a campus to appear on the Safe Workplace Dashboard

You can create a campus from existing locations to appear on the Safe Workplace Dashboard.

Route the following information to the Safe Workplace Dashboard and display this information by campus:

-   User health and willingness to return to work.
-   Building readiness.
-   Personal protective equipment inventory.
-   Active contact tracing cases.
-   Potentially exposed contacts under investigation.

Ensure that you install and use the following applications for the Safe Workplace Dashboard. Each application has a reference to a location.

-   ServiceNow® Emergency Self Report references the location in the user's profile.
-   ServiceNow® Emergency Outreach with Employee Readiness Surveys installed. These applications reference the location in the user's profile.
-   ServiceNow® Workplace PPE Inventory Management has defined stockrooms, and the location is a required field for a stockroom.
-   ServiceNow® Employee Health Screening has a form for selecting a location and a user to submit the compliance values.
-   The Space Administration module of ServiceNow Workplace Core is where organization facilities are defined. Within a building, floors, areas, and workspaces are defined. These definitions provide for proximity screening, cleaning assignments, and workspace reservations.

    One or more buildings are assigned to a campus. The location icons displayed on the Safe Workplace Dashboard overview show the campus and any associated buildings when you point to an icon.

-   ServiceNow Contact Tracing references the affected person's campus from a case. If the campus information is not available, then Contact Tracing references the location in the affected person's user profile.

**Note:** When selecting locations for users, stockrooms, and entry requests, select a company location that existed before you installed Workplace Core. Don't select a site, campus, or building created in the Workplace Core application.

For Workplace PPE Inventory Management, Employee Health Screening, and others, the location must be tied to a Workplace Core campus or building for the location to appear on the Safe Workplace Dashboard.

The locations \[cmn\_location\] defined for the organization are the reference that Performance Analytics uses to generate alerts. Configure the building definitions in Workplace Core with a parent location and the corresponding latitude and longitude.

To associate locations with infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 data, from the COVID-19 Global Health Data Set, verify that all locations are associated with a state or country.

## Create a campus to appear on the Safe Workplace Dashboard

There are multiple methods that you can use to create a campus that appears on the Safe Workplace Dashboard.

The campuses appear on the Safe Workplace Dashboard.
