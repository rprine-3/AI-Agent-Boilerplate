# Install the Safe Workplace Dashboard

Install the Safe Workplace Dashboard application. You can install this application If you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow® Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

The Map existing campus with locations fix script creates the initial mapping entries between the Campus \[sn\_wsd\_core\_campus\] table and the Location \[cmn\_location\] table.

**Note:** Check that all existing campuses have sites and regions populated before running this script.

Use the default setting **active=false** to avoid incorrect mappings in the Campus \[sn\_wsd\_core\_campus\] table.

Run this script after activating the Safe Workplace Dashboard \(sn\_imt\_dashboard\) plugin and ensuring that your existing campuses have sites and regions populated.

After running the Map existing campus with locations fix script, validate that all campuses and locations are accurate. For inaccurate data, remove entries and see [Manually map a location and campus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/safe-workplace-dashboard/man-create-campus.md) for more information.

</table>## Safe Workplace Dashboard properties

Set up Safe Workplace Dashboard properties to add your Mapbox API tokenand configure how indicators are displayed across timezones.

You can obtain a token from Mapbox to add features to the Safe Workplace Dashboard map. The base system map is from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative, open source map application.

Mapbox requires a subscription, and their documentation site describes how to obtain an API token to add the extra features. For more information, open the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) web site and select **Documentation** in the header.

To set properties , navigate to **Safe Workplace Dashboard** &gt; **Properties**.

When enabled, the Performance Analytics \(PA\) indicators shown on the Safe Workplace Dashboard are displayed using the time zone of the indicator's data collection job. If the indicator job time zone is not set, the instance time zone is used instead. The indicators are displayed identically for all users viewing the dashboard, regardless of the user's time zone.When not enabled, the PA indicators are displayed based on the user's time zone. The indicators may show different daily data to users in different time zones. For example, an event occurs in the evening in Seattle, which is the next day's morning in Berlin. A user in Seattle sees the event in the data for October 5, while a user in Berlin sees the event in the data for October 6.
