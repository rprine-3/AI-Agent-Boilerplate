# Integrating Employee Center and Virtual Agent with Microsoft Teams for GCC-H or DoD

You can integrate Employee Center and the Virtual Agent bot with Microsoft Teams to enable Government Community Cloud High \(GCC-H\) and US Department of Defense \(DoD\) customers to interact with agents through Virtual Agent and access the attached files in Employee Center.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Employee Center with your Microsoft Teams tenant, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

-   Your ServiceNow instances have been upgraded to the Vancouver release.
-   You have not previously attempted to install the Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams app on your instances.
-   You have the admin permissions on ServiceNow and Microsoft Azure instances.

## Integration process

The overall process to integrate Employee Center with your Microsoft Teams tenant involves the following tasks:

1.  Activate the IT Service Management integration with Microsoft Teams plugin \(sn\_now\_teams\_it\) and Glide Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\).

    **Note:** For more information on activating plugins, see [Activate a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md).
