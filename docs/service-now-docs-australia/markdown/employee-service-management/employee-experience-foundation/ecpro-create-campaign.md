# Create a campaign

Create a campaign to push communications and important information to your employees.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ca.campaign\_manager

If you would like to use Content Analytics to track the success of your campaign, you must set up a tracking profile and activate it. For more information, see [Content Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-content-automation-analytics.md).

## About this task

Campaigns are organized in a hierarchical structure.

Create a campaign by defining a title, state, audience, start and end times, and other information. For example, you can create a campaign that promotes open enrollment for health benefits, targeting new hires, and runs through the open enrollment period.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Experiences** &gt; **Content Experience Builder**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Fill in the following fields:

<table id="table_tkb_lzx_xfb"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

State of the campaign. This field automatically updates as you move through the campaign configuration process.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Audience

</td><td>

Audience that will view the content of a campaign. Click the Unlock Audience icon to select the audience that you want the campaign to target.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approvers

Users responsible for approving content before the campaign is published. When you click the Lookup using list icon, only users with the Campaign Approver sn\_ca.campaign\_approver role appear.

The approvers receive an email notification that you require their approval. For more information, see [Notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/notifications.md) and [Email templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_EmailTemplates.md).

Re-evaluate campaign

</td><td>

Option for reviewing the audience for a campaign.

 Check the box to display the **Re-evaluate frequency** field to define how often you want the **Content Experiences: Update Campaign Audience** scheduled job to run.

 When your campaign is re-evaluated, it removes or adds users depending on the current audience criteria.

 If the **Re-evaluate campaign** box is unchecked, the **Content Experiences: Update Campaign Audience** scheduled job runs one time after which the targeted audience is never re-evaluated or changed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Re-evaluate frequency

</td><td>

The frequency, in days, that you want to re-evaluate the audience. **Important:** To ensure that campaigns reflect any audience changes occurring since the last publication date, it is necessary to set the re-evaluation frequency.

Audiences are re-evaluated after the **Content Experiences: Update Campaign Audience** scheduled job runs based on the value you enter here.This field appears only after you select the **Re-evaluate campaign** check box.

 The value you set in this field overrides the default \(7 days\) value that is set in the **Campaign Re-evaluation** field in the Content Experiences system property.
