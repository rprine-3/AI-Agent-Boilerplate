# Next Experience theme for Now Mobile

Next Experience delivers a next generation, intuitive, personalized experience to drive productivity, improve engagement, and surface insights across the ServiceNow AI Platform.

You can configure Next Experience on Now Mobile.

-   Provide a better accessible Next Experience on Now Mobile.
-   Offer consistent experiences across web and Now Mobile.
-   Provide a unified design experience across applications.

## Summary of enhancements

The following list provides a quick summary of the improvements as part of Next Experience.

-   Use the new layout, screens, and card designs for accessibility and intuitive experience.
-   Provide a consistent experience on web and mobile with the updated MESP portal theme that aligns with the next experience theme.
-   Set the value of glide.ui.polaris.experience to true to enable the new color variables. A fallback color hex code is used when the new experience is not enabled.
-   Use the color variables for UI rules, card templates, and icons.
-   Enhance the search and discovery of the content and people.
-   Improve accessibility with the new input form screens for functions instead of UI parameters.
-   Convert the Content section to the Record section \(sys\_sg\_item\_section\) to enable the display of each item as a card \(mobile view\)​.
-   Make the MESP portal record editable. Admin can now configure and apply the custom theme for MESP portal to provide a unified experience across native mobile and MESP.

## Enable AI Search upgrade considerations

From Utah, AI Search is the default search engine on Now Mobile.

For existing customers, when you upgrade to Utah, you continue to use your existing search engine for Now Mobile as it was before the upgrade.

-   Glide fix runs before the plugin upgrade where the current search engine is stored in a system property sn\_me\_search.search\_engine.
-   After plugin upgrade, another glide fix runs to set the value of search engine to sn\_me\_search.search\_engine property value, provided this value is not empty.

## MESP \(Webviews\) upgrade considerations

From Utah, Next Experience is the new theme on the MESP. For the existing customers, when you upgrade to Utah, the theme adoption works in the following manner:

-   When you have not branded the Now Mobile app and enable the Next Experience option, the new theme applies automatically on the MESP portal record.
-   When you have not branded the Now Mobile app and do not turn on the Next Experience option, the new theme is not applicable on the MESP portal record.
-   When you have branded the Now Mobile app; irrespective of the turning on or off the Next Experience option, the new theme is not applicable on the MESP portal record.
