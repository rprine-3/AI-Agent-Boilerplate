# Create an audience

Create or modify an audience record to define the conditions or criteria that users must meet to view content.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_admin, sn\_cd.content\_manager

Each audience record is configured based on user conditions, user criteria, HR profile conditions, HR criteria, or an uploaded file. You can apply them to portal content or lifecycle event activities. For example, a lifecycle event activity for a work visa transfer is targeted only to employees that need a visa transfer.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Publishing** &gt; **Re-usable Components** &gt; **Audiences**.

2.  Click **New** or open a record.

3.  Fill in the fields on the form.

    **Note:** Content Managers can create audiences. To enable this, the **Allow Ownership for Audiences** option must be turned off. If the **Ownership Property** is enabled, the Content Manager will not have permission to create audiences. Refer to the example below.
