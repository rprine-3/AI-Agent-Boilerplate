# Request-based chat access for a guest user

Request-based self-configured app chat access enables a guest user to start and import chats in a single ServiceNow® for Microsoft Teams instance.

Guest sharing is enabled by default in Microsoft Entra ID and in ServiceNow for Microsoft Teams. As a result, users can invite guests to teams and sites, and share files with guests without having to request assistance from the IT department.

Guests can take the following actions:

-   Initiate a chat with people from outside their organization.
-   Import their chat conversations with people from outside their organization.

For information about configuring access for guest users, see [Guest access in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/guest-access).

Guest access configuration is applicable to the following tables in both IT Service Management integration with Microsoft Teams and HR Service Delivery integration with Microsoft Teams applications:

-   HR Core task \(sn\_hr\_core\_task\)
-   HR Life events Case \(sn\_hr\_le\_case\)
-   HR Core case \(sn\_hr\_core\_case\)
-   Request Item \(sc\_req\_item\)
-   Task \(sc\_task\)
-   Incident \(incident\)
-   Request \(sc\_request\)
-   Change request \(change\_request\)

The ServiceNow system admin can extend guest access to other tables.
