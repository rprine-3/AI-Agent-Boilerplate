# Include On-call scheduling users to initiate Microsoft Teams chat

Users who are associated with On-Call Scheduling will be displayed on the Selected column in **Start Microsoft Teams Chat** modal.

When initiating a Microsoft Teams chat, users who are part of On-Call Scheduling groups are automatically included in the Selected column of the Start Microsoft Teams Chat modal.

**sn\_tcm\_collab\_hook.on\_call\_tables\_for\_start\_chat\_action** system property is created to support this functionality. You can extend this functionality to modify the tables and requests that determine which on-call users are included.

For more information on On-Call Scheduling, see [On-Call Scheduling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/c_OnCallScheduling.md).
