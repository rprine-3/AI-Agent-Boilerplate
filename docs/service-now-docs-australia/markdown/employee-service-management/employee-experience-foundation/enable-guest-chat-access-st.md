# Enable chat access for guest users

Enable chat access for a guest user while configuring ServiceNow® for Microsoft Teams settings for a self-configured app.

## Before you begin

Role required: External admin \(external\_app\_install\_admin\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ServiceNow for Microsoft 365** &gt; **Teams Guest User Chat Configuration**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_udz_vc4_f5b"><thead><tr><th>

Enable Guest access

</td><td>

Option to enable the Client Credentials token to fetch user type details that were set during the process of [Enable authentication of guest users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/update-verify-app-registry-guest.md).

 If you do not select this option, an error occurs when the guest tries to start or import a Microsoft Teams chat.

 **Note:** When the guest access is enabled, the sn\_tcm\_collab\_hook.MS\_Teams\_Chat\_App\_Credentials value in the sys\_alias table configured in Connection &amp; Credential Aliases fetches the Azure user details. When the guest access is inactive, the sn\_tcm\_collab\_hook.MS\_Teams\_Chat\_Credentials value in the sys\_alias table configured in Connection &amp; Credential Aliases fetches the Azure user details.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allowed Guest domains

</td><td>

The guest user domains where invited guests can start or import a chat. Only the tenants in these domains can start or import a chat.

 List multiple guest domain names as comma-separated values.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

Guests belonging to the selected guest domains can start or import chats.
