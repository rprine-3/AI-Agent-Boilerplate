# Configure Localization Framework for Content Publishing

Configure the translation workflow to enable Content managers to request translation via the Localization Framework. The basic workflow relies on manual translation; you can integrate with a third-party service to receive automatic translation.

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

-   [Activate Localization Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/activate-lf-plugin.md)
-   [Activate a language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateALanguage.md)
-   \(Optional\) Configure a translation mode, such as machine translations, send to a translation management system, send via email, or export/import: [Translation modes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/translation-modes.md).
-   Create a user group to perform translation:
    -   [Create a user group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateAGroup.md)
