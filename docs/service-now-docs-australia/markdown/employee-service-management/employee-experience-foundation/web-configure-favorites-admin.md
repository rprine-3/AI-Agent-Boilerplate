# Configure favorites option

Configure the favorites option to help employees personalize the content and easily access the content they frequently use.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin and sp\_admin

## About this task

You can set up the favorite card details and use the default favorite icon \[Omitted image "myfav-no-selection.jpg"\] Alt text: default favorite icon default without selection to bookmark content as your favorites. When your employees mark content as favorites, the favorite icon appearance changes to \[Omitted image "myfav-selection.jpg"\] Alt text: default favorite icon default with selection.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Favorites** &gt; **Favorite content configuration**.

2.  Select **New** or update an existing configuration.

    **Note:** The my **Favorites** widget syncs instantly with other widgets in real-time on the web. However, when adding favorites items across devices \(example: mobile to the web\), a manual refresh is required to reflect the latest changes — **Reload the page** on web or **Pull to refresh** on mobile.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

-   **Internal** You can specify the portal page and parameters for navigation.

4.  Click **Submit**.
