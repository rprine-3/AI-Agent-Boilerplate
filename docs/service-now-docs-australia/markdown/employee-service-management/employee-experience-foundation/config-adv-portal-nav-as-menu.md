# Configure advanced portal navigation

Advanced Portal Navigation \(APN\) helps you design and configure an intuitive navigation for better information architecture and topic discovery.

## Before you begin

Before you start, ensure you understand the useful information available in [EC Information architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-information-architecture.md).

Role required: Admin and SP Admin

## About this task

Using the advanced portal navigation, you can enable single-click sync across all APN hierarchy levels, replacing level-by-level sync. You can design the primary navigation menu and configure the navigation setup as per employee needs and content priorities. Here is an overview of the navigation workflow:

\[Omitted image "apn-architecture-workflow.png"\] Alt text: APN sync hierarchy workflows

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Advanced Portal Navigation**.

2.  Click **Take a tour** to understand the APN process.

    Understand more about APN process and configuration from the explainer tour.

3.  Click **New** to create a new record or view the list of the available APN record.

4.  Select **Active** to replace the current Employee Center with the new navigation menu.

    **Note:** Only one Advanced portal navigation record \[sn\_ex\_sp\_portal\_extensible\_navigation\] can be active per portal. When you have one active record, you must first deactivate the other one first.

5.  Click **Submit** or **Save**.

    A pop-up appears with the following message.

    ```
    To help you get started, we can bring over your existing navigation menu items and you can edit from there. 
    You can also skip this and start from scratch. Do you want to bring over your current menu now?
    ```

6.  On the **Start with current navigation menu**, select one of the following options.

    -   **Skip**: When you click skip, the existing associated navigation menu items and topics are not fetched and you can start building your hierarchy afresh.
    -   **Yes**: When you click yes, the existing associated navigation menu items, topics, and associated quick links are fetched instantly and you can refine the hierarchy.
    The **Menu items** related list appears.

    **Note:** An empty list appears when you click the skip option.

7.  Use one of the options to create new or fetch the existing hierarchy.

    1.  Click **New** to create or add from the available list.

    2.  Click **Sync hierarchy** to fetch existing items.

        Topics and menu items which are in the **Active** state are synced. Confirm sync popup appears with info on email notification.

        **Note:** Quick links are not fetched. Add quick links manually.

10. Notify the sync status through email.

    On completion, you receive information on the sync status update with the count of changes.

    **Note:** If you face issues with the sync, contact your administrator.

11. Click **Update** for changes to reflect.


## Result

Advanced portal navigation record is saved and your employees can view the new mega menu design.

## What to do next

All active navigation items associated with the portal and taxonomy are fetched and displayed in the related list.

-   While creating the record or for subsequent syncs, all the fetched navigation menu items are in the **Active** state by default.
-   To include any future changes in the service portal menu or root topics in the active taxonomy, you can use **Sync hierarchy** to bring any new topics or menu items.
-   Newly synced items are **active** by default with the existing order. When the order is not available for topic, the order is 999999.
-   You can make edits, if necessary, after the sync is complete.
-   All taxonomy updates across all APN hierarchy levels are in sync with a single-click.​

**Note:** For successful sync, ensure that the SP Menu Items are associated with the portal for which the Advanced Portal navigation record is configured.
