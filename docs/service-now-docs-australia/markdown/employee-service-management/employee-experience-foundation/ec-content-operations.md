# Understand the Content Operations dashboard

The Content Operations dashboard is a launchpad for content authors, where they can create content, view engagement metrics for published content, content publishing calender, incoming content requests, and review ownership for pages and widgets.

## Dashboard overview

Users with the Content Manager role can access the **My Content Operations** dashboard from Content Publishing, Content Experiences, or Content Governance as their starting point for creating or managing content.

**Note:** The admin must install the following plugins \(August 2024 store release or later\) to enable this dashboard:

-   Content Publishing
-   Content Governance
-   Content Experiences \(optional\)

For more information, see [Employee Center plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/install-plugins.md).

## My Content

The my content tab contains metrics on the content you created. The display may vary depending on the plug-ins in your instance.

</table>## Publishing Calendar

The publishing calender provides a single interface where content managers can view what content will be published and where, upcoming campaigns, and content requests by due date.

The Content request appears on the Content request item due date. For more information, see [Managing content requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-governance.md).

-   Content Library

Content appears based on the content schedule record, with the exception of news articles and to-do content, which are explained in the **Channel type** section below.

**Note:** The calendar only displays content with configured start date. Content set to "Always active" will not appear in the calendar.

The calendar displays content that is in a published campaign and in a bundle with either an immediate or fixed date trigger. For more information, see [Campaign bundle triggers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-triggers.md). The content appears in the calendar based on the bundle date, not the campaign start date.

**Note:** This option appears only if the Content Experiences plugin is installed.

-   Campaign Content

The calendar displays campaign content based on the bundle trigger configuration. For more information, see [Campaign bundle triggers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-triggers.md).

**Note:** This option appears only if the Content Experiences plugin is installed.
