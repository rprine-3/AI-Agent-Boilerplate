# Define how a Zoom chat is closed

Define the way a Zoom chat is closed.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When a ticket is set to inactive, the system does one final poll for any messages in the Zoom Team Chat. The participants are removed so no further messages about the ticket can be exchanged in the chat. The system then stops polling that chat.

If your custom application doesn’t provide an **Active** option for determining whether the ticket remains active, you must either add that option \(preferred\) or define an alternate condition denoting the ticket as being closed or inactive.

Alternately, to adhere to platform standards, consider adding an active field to your custom application and maintaining the state of that field according to the business logic of your application.

When a parent ServiceNow record is closed, associated Zoom channel is archived, and only an admin user or that chat creator can post new messages on a closed chat or a channel. The users who are removed from a chat can only see the chat messages history.
