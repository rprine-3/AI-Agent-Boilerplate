# Calendar and schedule management

Calendar and schedule management in EmployeeWorks Web App includes calendar widgets and AI-powered scheduling. Features include an AI assistant for scheduling tasks, a My Calendar widget for meeting access, and an Upcoming Holiday widget based on employee work location.

EmployeeWorks Web App provides time-aware information through the following capabilities. The My Calendar widget in Canvas displays upcoming meetings with direct join functionality. The Upcoming Holiday widget displays the next relevant holiday on the home page. These capabilities work together to support both active scheduling and passive time awareness.

## Upcoming holiday widget

The Upcoming Holiday widget appears on the EmployeeWorks Web App home page and helps employees stay informed about upcoming time off. Unlike the My Calendar widget which focuses on daily meetings, this widget specifically highlights company holidays relevant to each employee work location.

The Upcoming Holiday widget automatically determines which holiday to display through the following process:

-   Identifies the work location from the employee profile.
-   Searches the holiday calendar table for the next upcoming holiday matching that location.
-   Displays the holiday name, date, and day of the week in a clear format.
-   Shows only the most immediate upcoming holiday relevant to the employee.

Administrators populate the holiday calendar table per work location and control widget visibility from the admin console.

**Note:** A widget hidden in the admin console does not appear on any employee home page. When no holiday is found for the work location or when the work location is not available, the widget falls back to the default location set on the holiday calendar table.

## My calendar widget

The My Calendar widget appears in the **Canvas** module and provides employees with immediate access to their meeting schedule. This widget eliminates the need to switch between applications. Upcoming meetings display directly within EmployeeWorks Web App, complete with join functionality.

The My Calendar widget offers the following key features for meeting management:

-   Displays upcoming meetings in chronological order with titles and times.
-   Highlights the next immediate meeting for quick identification.
-   Provides direct join buttons that launch meetings without external navigation.
-   Integrates with Outlook to open detailed meeting views when needed.
-   Includes a **Refresh** option to manually sync the latest meeting updates.
-   Shows meeting participant information and conference details.

Meeting data synchronizes automatically based on administrator-configured intervals. The widget pulls information from connected calendar systems to maintain current meeting schedules. Employees can view their meeting commitments alongside other **Canvas** widgets. Meetings can be joined directly from the interface.

**Note:** Administrators control synchronization frequency, which determines how often the widget updates with new or modified meetings from external calendar systems. Employees can use the **Refresh** option for immediate updates when needed.
