# Add a Table with Rich Content Editor

Add a table to your content to organize information in rows and columns.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_manager

Fill in the New content form fields. See [Create rich content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-library-portal-rich-content.md)

Create the page layout using modules or columns.

-   Modules are predefined content layouts comprised of header, paragraph text, and images. See [Add predefined content layouts with the Rich Content Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/add-modules-rich-content-editor.md)
-   Columns are containers that enable you to define a custom layout. See [Add columns with the Rich Content Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-rich-content-canvas.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the canvas by selecting the **Open editor** button from the **Design** tab of the **New content** form.

2.  Drag and drop the table component into the canvas.

3.  In the **Create new table** window, enter the number of columns and rows.

4.  Create a table header row by navigating to **Settings** &gt; **Properties** and selecting **Enable header**.

5.  To format the header title text, click the text box in the header row and configure the following settings:

-   **Top and bottom**: Image appears above the other component.
**Note:** For best results, set the same display for the components. For example, if you have an image and text components in a column and want the image to appear on the left and the text to appear at the right, change the **Display** settings for both components to **Side by side**.

## What to do next

-   \(Optional\) Translate your content.

    Request language translation for your content. For more information, see [Multilingual support in the Content Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-switch-language.md).

    **Note:** Only translate content after you are done modifying the content. For best results, we do not recommend that you add or remove components or change the formatting after translation.

    To create rich content that is formatted differently in different languages, duplicate the content and modify the formatting as needed. Then, use Audiences to target the content to users by language. See [Audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-audience.md)

-   Preview your content from the **Publish** tab.

    **Note:** Content Preview is designed to provide a general idea of how your content looks. Content may look different once published due to variations in device resolution, theme difference, or mobile app style configuration.

-   Configure a publish plan to control where the content is delivered, the audience, and the period of time it is available: [Create a publish plan for your content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-library-publish2.md).
