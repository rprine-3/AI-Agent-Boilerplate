# Create and download the manifest file for pre-published apps

Create and download the ServiceNow for Microsoft Teams manifest file from your instance to enable Microsoft Teams to use the ServiceNow for Teams app.

## Before you begin

Role required: external\_app\_install\_admin

## About this task

You can connect multiple ServiceNow instances to one Microsoft Teams tenant. For more information, see [Integrating multiple ServiceNow instances with a single Microsoft Teams tenant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/va-integ-single-teams.md).

Only one pre-published app setup can be connected to the Microsoft Teams tenant.

**Note:** You can connect multiple self-configured app environments to the Microsoft Teams tenant as you can create separate Azure apps for each self-configured app environment. For information about creating a manifest file for self-configured apps, see [Create and download the manifest file for self-configured apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/download-manifest-file-st.md).
