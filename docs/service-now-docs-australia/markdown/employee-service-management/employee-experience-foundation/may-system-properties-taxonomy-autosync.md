# Enable connected content autosync system property

Content updates are automatically synced when you enable the autosync system property.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By enabling this property, you can gain visibility into new and outdated content and manage content life cycle through automation for performance improvement.

-   Auto-sync content additions and removals on topic pages in bulk.
-   Eliminate the need to manually update the content additions and deletions. For more information, see [Run the scheduled job for content association](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/schduld-job-link-cntnt.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    The entire list of properties in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table appears.

2.  Search for the `Taxonomy.category.content_auto_sync` property and open.

3.  Set the property value to **true**.

    **Note:** Default value is **false**.


## Result

The system property syncs updates automatically.

However, to check the updated content in categories manually, see [Check for updated content in categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/may-associate-updated-content-categories-topics.md).
