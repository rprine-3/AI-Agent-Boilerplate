## Before you begin

Ensure that you

-   Download the ServiceNow Otto for Employee Experience plugin.
-   Learn about AI agents and have read access to the record to auto-process approvals.
-   Ensure you are on Zurich patch 4 or above.
-   The agent supports only REQ and RITM.

Role required: approver\_user, sn\_request\_read, sn\_write

## About this task

Use the Approval Assistance Agent to manage your assigned approvals. Using an AI agent, you can

-   Pull all the information and records for approvals automatically.
-   Review the policies, checklist, and evaluation criteria.
-   Approve the requests based on the ServiceNow Otto recommended decision.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **My tasks**.

2.  Select the request from the available list that you want to work on.

    The details are displayed on the card with the summary.

3.  Select the **Review with ServiceNow Otto** button.

    ServiceNow Otto performs the following actions:

    -   Triggers an AI agent to review the request.
    -   Verifies the request for policy compliance.
    -   Generates an eligibility checklist and criteria.
    -   Shows the criteria for match or mismatch.
    -   Provides an option to act on approval such as **Approve** and **Reject**

        **Note:** You can select **View AI Agent Processing Steps** to see the details.

4.  Select **Approve** or **Reject**.

    **Note:** Currently, HR requests aren't supported out-of-the-box.

    The response appears `I am ready to process your approval request for <request description>. Is it okay to proceed?`

5.  Select **Yes** or **No**.

    **Note:** The agent supports only REQ and RITM. HR requests aren’t supported. However, by configuring the `sp_approval_configuration` record, you can set up support for HR case too.

6.  Request is approved and moved from **Open** to the **Completed** tab.
