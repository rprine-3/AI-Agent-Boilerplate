# Configure task scope and action widget

Configure the applicable task scope and the actions with a custom AIX action widget. Use this when you need task-specific actions that differ from the standard action group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin or admin

## About this task

Configure task scope and a custom AIX action widget to suit your needs for a task type.

-   The **AIX action widget** field accepts a custom widget built for your organization and replaces the action group on both list and detail views.
-   The **AI insights** tab appears only when **Applies to** is set to **All** or EmployeeWorks Web App. AI insights apply only to EmployeeWorks Web App. A banner on the tab indicates that this configuration has no effect in Employee Center.
-   After an upgrade, existing task configuration records automatically set **Applies to** to **All** and clear the **Use custom script** check box. Your existing AI insights skill configurations continue to work without modification.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **To-dos Configurations**, select a to-dos configuration, and open the **Task Configuration** related list.

2.  Open the task configuration for the required record type, such as **Request**.

3.  In the **Applies to** field, specify the experience that uses this task configuration.

    Applies to options:

    |Scope|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**All** \(default\)|Applies the configuration to both Employee Center and EmployeeWorks Web App. When **Use widget** is selected on the **Primary Info** tab, both the **Widget** field \(for Employee Center\) and the **AIX widget** field \(for EmployeeWorks Web App\) are mandatory, each with its own widget parameters.|
    |Employee Center|Only the **Widget** field and **Widget parameters** appear on the **Primary Info** tab. The **AI insights** tab and the EmployeeWorks Web App **Card Info** tab don't appear, because AI insights apply only to EmployeeWorks Web App.|
    |EmployeeWorks Web App|Only the **AIX widget** field \(mandatory\) and **AIX Widget parameters** appear on the **Primary Info** tab. Select the out-of-the-box widget or a custom widget built for your organization.|

4.  Go to the **Action** tab.

    \[Omitted image "es-insights-action-group.png"\] Alt text: Task Configuration Action tab with Action group set to Approvals action group and AIX action widget set to Custom action.

    -   Search and select an existing an action group such as `Approvals action group`.
    -   Select a custom action widget built for your organization
    For new task configurations targeting only EmployeeWorks Web App, configure only the AIX Action Widget.

    **Note:** When you don't add a custom action to the AIX action widget, the action group falls back to Employee Center action behavior.
