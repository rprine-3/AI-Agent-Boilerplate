# Content engagement

Content engagement enhances news articles by providing users with a way to comment and react to articles. Managers can measure the effectiveness of their content using engagement metrics.

## Overview of Content engagement

Content engagement features are seamlessly embedded in news articles. Employees can view engagement summaries at the top of the article, select a reaction icon, or post a comment. \[Omitted image "emp-engagement.png"\] Alt text: Content engagement delivers engagement summary, reaction icons, and commenting capabilities to the portal

Content managers can choose which content engagement features to enable when creating a news article. To enable faster news article publishing, content admins can set Content engagement features in a content template. \[Omitted image "mgr-engagement.png"\] Alt text: Enable comments, reactions, and view count from the Content Template or New Content forms

## Reporting content

Content engagement includes a comment reporting workflow, where employees can report a comment and content managers can view the reports and take appropriate action.

## Engagement analytics

Content analytics provides visualizations for employee engagement metrics in the [Content engagement dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-pro-content-engagement-dashboard.md).

Additionally, you can review visualizations for a specific news article, including total views count, engagement trends by day, and unique views by day. Navigate to the news article content item and select **View analytics report** in the form context menu.
