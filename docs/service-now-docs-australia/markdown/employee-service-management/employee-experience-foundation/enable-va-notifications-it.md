# Enable Virtual Agent notifications for IT Service Management

Configure system properties to enable Virtual Agent notifications in Microsoft Teams.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** If your first installation of [IT Service Management for Microsoft 365](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/14eb9da8c3f310102986a81c8640dd08) is version 2.7.0, Virtual Agent notifications are enabled by default. The following scenario is only applicable if you upgrade from older versions of the plugin.

After upgrading to [IT Service Management for Microsoft 365](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/14eb9da8c3f310102986a81c8640dd08) version 2.7.0, you must configure system properties to enable Virtual Agent notifications.

The following tables are supported for Virtual Agent notifications in the base system.

-   Incident
-   Change
-   Requested Item

## Procedure

1.  In the **All** menu, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    The System Properties table appears.

2.  In the name column, search for `*sn_now_teams`.

3.  For the following properties, set the value to `true`.

    -   **sn\_now\_teams.enable\_va\_approval\_notification**: This property enables Virtual Agent notifications for approvals.
    -   **sn\_now\_teams\_it.enable\_va\_comment\_notification**: This property enables Virtual Agent notifications for comments.
    The default value of these properties is **true**. If you've upgraded from an earlier version of [IT Service Management for Microsoft 365](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/14eb9da8c3f310102986a81c8640dd08), the value is **false**.
