# Enable prioritization by filter

If you are ordering the to-dos by filter instead of due date, you must enable the **sn\_hr\_sp.todos\_config\_display\_with\_priority** property, add the **Display priority** field to the to-dos configuration form, and assign each to-dos filter a priority number.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin

The to-dos will then be sorted by the filter they are associated with. Within each filter, the to-dos will be sorted by due date.

When defining conditions like case sensitivity or null values, see API [GlideFilter - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideFilterScopedAPI.md).
