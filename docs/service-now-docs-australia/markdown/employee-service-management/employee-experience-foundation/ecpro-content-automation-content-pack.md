# Campaign overview and Campaign analytics dashboards

Content Analytics collects data on user interactions and generates visualizations to help campaign managers determine the effectiveness of campaigns.

Use Content Analytics to measure the effectiveness of a campaign and the content provided to your employees. Content Analytics is one of several resources to help you improve your campaigns. To learn about the other resources, see [Analyzing your campaign for effectiveness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-content-automation-reevaluate-audience.md).

When tracking is enabled for a campaign, Content Analytics generates data visualizations. For more information on how to enable tracking, see [Create a campaign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-create-campaign.md).\[Omitted image "campaign-tracking.png"\] Alt text: Enable tracking for a campaign

**Note:** We recommend waiting at least 24 hours after publishing for data to appear on the dashboards.

## Interaction tracking

Dashboards display data visualizations for specific parameters, such as user interactions with content.

**Note:**

-   An interaction is an action performed by the user, such as a download, link click, to-do completion, or video play.
-   An impression is an instance of content appearing for a user. Each time a user views the content, it is counted as an interaction.

Content Analytics tracks the following user interactions \(depending on content type\). When content is rendered in the portal, the system counts that as an impression. When an employee clicks on content, the system counts that as a clickthrough, download, or played \(depending on the content type\).

-   Banner clickthrough
-   Banner impression
-   Calendar download
-   Calendar impression
-   Email clickthrough

## Campaign analytics dashboard

The Campaign analytics dashboard displays data on campaign engagement, to-dos, and impact. Use filters to specify the metrics to include in the visualizations. Choose from **Campaign** and **Campaign Success Goal**, then specify which campaign or campaign success goal.

This metric provides statistics on how many employees are interacting with the campaign. It shows the percentage of campaign targets who have visited the destination portal and have engaged with content by clicking or viewing. Those campaign targets who have never been to the portal are not part of this calculation.**Note:** Currently, email link clicks are tracked as anonymous and do not affect the campaign engagement score.

Campaign impact shows data related to your established campaign success goals. For more information on creating campaign success goals, see [Create campaign success goals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-create-campaign-success-criteria.md).

 Select a campaign success goal to view a chart that shows how your campaign is progressing. The campaign impact chart shows:

-   Evaluation count: Shows current data during campaign duration. Use this information to compare against your baseline and target count shows how your campaign is progressing.
-   Baseline count: Shows historical data based on past, similar campaigns.
-   Target count: The count you hope to reach when no historical data is available.
-   Trend: Depends on how you set your campaign success goal type. If you select Deflection, your trend should point down. If you select Drive action, your trend should point up.
-   Forecast Evaluation Count: Shows how close the campaign is to the target count and when it might be reached.
