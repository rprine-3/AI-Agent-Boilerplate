# Add Tabs with Rich Content Editor

Add tabs to your rich content to help your users navigate efficiently by allowing them to select the various tabs to reveal the associated content within them.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_manager

Fill in the New content form fields. See [Create rich content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-library-portal-rich-content.md)

Create the page layout using modules or columns.

-   Modules are predefined content layouts comprised of header, paragraph text, and images. See [Add predefined content layouts with the Rich Content Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/add-modules-rich-content-editor.md)
-   Columns are containers that enable you to define a custom layout. See [Add columns with the Rich Content Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-rich-content-canvas.md)

## About this task

You can add other components under a tab, like an Image, Video, Text, Text section, Link, Link block, or Button. When you drop the **Tabs** component into your canvas, an area below the tabs appears that allows you to drop other components into it.

**Note:** When the **Tabs** functionality is not enabled, try reinstalling the Content Publishing application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the canvas by selecting the **Open editor** button from the **Design** tab of the **New content** form.

2.  From the **Rich Content Editor** canvas, you can use a drag-and-drop method to add tabs.

## What to do next

-   \(Optional\) Translate your content.

    Request language translation for your content. For more information, see [Multilingual support in the Content Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-switch-language.md).

    **Note:** Only translate content after you are done modifying the content. For best results, we do not recommend that you add or remove components or change the formatting after translation.

    To create rich content that is formatted differently in different languages, duplicate the content and modify the formatting as needed. Then, use Audiences to target the content to users by language. See [Audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-audience.md)

-   Preview your content from the **Publish** tab.

    **Note:** Content Preview is designed to provide a general idea of how your content looks. Content may look different once published due to variations in device resolution, theme difference, or mobile app style configuration.

-   Configure a publish plan to control where the content is delivered, the audience, and the period of time it is available: [Create a publish plan for your content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-library-publish2.md).
