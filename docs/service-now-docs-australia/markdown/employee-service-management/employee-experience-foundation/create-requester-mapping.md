# Create requester mapping

Create a requester mapping to extend the auto-import functionality to other tables.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:**

If there is no requestor mapping defined for a table, the interaction records will not be created. An error log is created for the admin to notify that the requestor mapping is not defined for a table.

A requestor-mapping record defines which field, in any given table, is the field representing the requestor of a ticket.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ServiceNow for Microsoft 365** &gt; **Chat Administration** &gt; **Requestor Mapping**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |:----|:----------|
    |Table|Table to which the requestor mapping \(auto-import feature\) should be applicable.|
    |Requestor field|Field to select the requestor for a record.|
    |Inherit|Extend and apply the auto-import feature to the child tables.|
    |Active|Option to activate the requestor-mapping record.|

4.  Click **Submit**.
