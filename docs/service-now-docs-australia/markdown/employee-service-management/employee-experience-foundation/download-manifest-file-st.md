# Create and download the manifest file for self-configured apps

Create and download the ServiceNow for Microsoft Teams manifest file from your instance to enable Microsoft Teams to use the ServiceNow for Teams app.

## Before you begin

Role required: external\_app\_install\_admin

## About this task

You can connect multiple ServiceNow instances to one Microsoft Teams tenant. For more information, see [Integrating multiple ServiceNow instances with a single Microsoft Teams tenant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/va-integ-single-teams.md).

Multiple self-configured app environments can be connected to the Microsoft Teams tenant as you can create separate Azure apps for each self-configured app environment.

This process is for configuring a Microsoft Teams manifest file, which dictates how an application would behave in Microsoft Teams. For information about the manifest generation provided by ITSM/HR, see [Auto-generate the manifest file for uploading on Microsoft Teams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/generate-manifest-file-msteams.md), which includes more available configurations.

**Note:** You can only connect one pre-published app setup to the Microsoft Teams tenant. For information about creating a manifest file for pre-published apps, see [Create and download the manifest file for pre-published apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/download-manifest-file-mt.md).
