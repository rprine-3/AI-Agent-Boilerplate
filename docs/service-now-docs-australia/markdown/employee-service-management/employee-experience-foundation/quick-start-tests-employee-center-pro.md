# Quick start tests for Employee Center Pro

Validate the continued functionality of Employee Center Pro after any configuration change such as an upgrade or after developing an application. Copy and customize these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

All test suites and tests should pass on a default implementation. To validate a custom implementation, copy the automated tests and configure them for your customizations.

Quick start tests are disabled and read-only test templates. By default, they only produce a pass result when you run them with the default demo data that is provided with the application or feature plugin.

To make quick start tests produce a pass result when you run them with your instance-specific data, copy and configure them to use your instance data.

Use Performance Profiling to compare tests to detect performance degradation when you upgrade your instance, so you can investigate and fix the issues. See [Performance profiling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/atf-perf-prof.md).

The Agile Development 2.0 \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0\) and the Agile Development 2.0 - ATF Tests \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0.atf\) plugins must be enabled.

**Note:** When running, demo data is required.
