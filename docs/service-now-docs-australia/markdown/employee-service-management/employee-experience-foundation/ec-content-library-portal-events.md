# Create events content

Using Content Library, you can create content that announce events to your employees.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_manager, sn\_cd.content\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Content Publishing** &gt; **Content Library**.

2.  Select **New** or existing content.

3.  Select **Portal** under the **Select the Platform** column.

4.  Select **Events** under the **Choose a content format** section.

5.  Select **Continue**.

6.  Fill in the fields in the **New content** form.

<table id="table_opy_zsv_hrb"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Content name

</td><td>

The name that describes the content you are creating or editing.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

When you have multiple pieces of content that appear in a carousel, you can define the order they appear.Enter a number defining the order the content appears on the service portal or Employee Center. Content appears closer to the beginning of the carousel when assigned a lower number.

**Note:** Use increments of 100 when determining the order. This method makes it easier to edit. For example, you numbered your links 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and wanted to place a new content after 2. You would have to renumber 3, 4, and 5. If you use 100, 200, and 300 and wanted to place content from 100 through 200, you would simply use any number from 101 through 199.
