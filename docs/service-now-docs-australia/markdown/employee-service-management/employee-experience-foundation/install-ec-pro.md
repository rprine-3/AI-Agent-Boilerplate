# Install Employee Center Pro

Employee Center Pro extends the standard Employee Center capabilities and provides a platform for employees to communicate and be engaged.

## Before you begin

Employee Center Pro requires a separate subscription from the rest of the ServiceNow AI Platform. If you are already using Employee Center and want to upgrade to Employee Center Pro, contact your ServiceNow account manager to purchase the subscription.

**Note:** Before purchasing a subscription, you can evaluate the feature on a non-production instance without charge by requesting it from the Now Support Service Catalog. For more information, see [Request a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_RequestAPlugin.md).

The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

Install the Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework \(sn\_hr\_integ\_fw\) plugin to enable Employee Center Pro to integrate with third-party systems. See [Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-integrations-framework.md).
