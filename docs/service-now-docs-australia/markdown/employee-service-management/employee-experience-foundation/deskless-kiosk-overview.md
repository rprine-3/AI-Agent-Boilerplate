# Employee Center Pro Kiosk

Enable the field workers and shift workers with the in-context information for operational efficiency.

A deskless worker is an employee who typically doesn’t sit behind a desk or use a computer to perform the job. Empowering deskless workers with resources is crucial for enhancing productivity, engagement, and overall organizational success.

A new plugin Employee Center Pro Kiosk enables all such deskless workers with simplified access to information and services for self-serve and improved productivity.

## Kiosk overview

Using the Kiosk application, deskless employees can manage their time off, schedule, and requests.
