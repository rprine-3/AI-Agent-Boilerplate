# Customize data display in Kiosks

Create implementations to customize the display of data in the **Schedule** and **Time off** tabs based on your location or any other criterion according to your organizational requirement.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

    The names of the two API methods for the **Schedule** tab and the **Time off** tab are:

    -   sn\_ex\_sp\_pro\_kiosk.RetrieveEXKioskEmpSchedule
    -   sn\_ex\_sp\_pro\_kiosk.EXKioskEmployeeTimeOffBalance
2.  From the Extension Points list, select any of the API methods mentioned in step 1.

3.  In the sn\_ex\_sp\_pro\_kiosk.RetrieveEXKioskEmpSchedule method page, select **Create implementation** from the Related Links section.

4.  In the Script Include page, add the unique location sys\_id in the `this.LOCATIONS` array in **Script**.

    -   For more information on location tracking, see [Enabling and selecting location tracking options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/location-tracking-enable.md).
    -   For more information on script include customizations, see [Script includes and customization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/customize-script-includes-itsm.md).
    1.  The location sys\_id enables a `fixed_match`. The `fixed_match` enables you to show location-based data to your users.
    2.  If `fixed_match` isn’t available, then the data available is for a `global_match`. The data remains the same regardless of location.
    3.  If it’s a `no_match`, there isn't a **Schedule** or **Time off** tab visible.

## Result

You can view data on the **Schedule** and **Time off** tabs based on your location or any other user criterion you've set.
