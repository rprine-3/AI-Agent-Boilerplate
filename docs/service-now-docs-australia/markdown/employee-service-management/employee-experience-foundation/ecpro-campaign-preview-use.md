The page on your Service Portal you want to preview.A page is a pre-existing record that contains code and structure that define how to display content you want to schedule and make available to your employees.

**Note:** Templates are contained in a topic and references a page. Templates have a direct relationship with a page, but multiple topics can be associated with a template/page. For example, the base system provides the emp\_employee-taxonomy page and most of the topics are associated with that page. For more information, see [Create topic page template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/customise-topic-pages-with-templates.md).

 When a page has topics associated with it, the **Taxonomy** field appears and you can filter by it and you can select topics associated with the taxonomy.

 A taxonomy is the top-level of the hierarchy and can have multiple topics under it.

 For example, you can have taxonomies for HR and IT so you can group specific topics under each.

 When you use **Select a page** or **Select a topic** to filter your preview, the value in this field can change because the topic might not be under the taxonomy or on the page you selected. When this field is greyed out, it indicates for the page and topic selected, there is only one taxonomy.
