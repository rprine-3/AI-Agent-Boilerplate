# Add menu items to primary navigation

Add non-taxonomy menu items to the primary navigation bar by configuring the Employee Center Menu record. The non-taxonomy menu items are displayed as a simple list.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The topics and child topics you create in the taxonomy are displayed as mega menu items in the Employee Center home page. The default non-taxonomy menu items that are displayed depend on the plugins that you installed. For example, the Employee Center displays the Org Chart menu item when you install the Content Delivery \(com.sn\_content\_delivery\) plugin. The Employee Center Pro displays the Employee Forums menu item when you install the Communities \(com.sn\_communities\) plugin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Menus**.

2.  Change the **Application scope** to **Employee Center**.

    You must set the application scope to add a menu item.

3.  Next to the **Title** field, click **Preview this record** and open the record.

6.  Click **Submit**.

    The non-taxonomy menu items are displayed next to the taxonomy menu items in the primary navigation bar.
