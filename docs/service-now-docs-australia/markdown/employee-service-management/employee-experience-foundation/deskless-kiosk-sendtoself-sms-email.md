# Configure the mail and SMS send to self

Help employees access information easily by sending required information as an SMS or email.

## Before you begin

Ensure you set up the email and SMS notifications first.

-   Configure email as explained in [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).
-   Configure SMS notification with Twilio as explained in [Configure Notify with Twilio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureNotifyWithTwilio.md).

    **Important:** Work with the notify\_admin user for Twilio **Account SID** and **Auth Token** to set up Notify with Twilio. Follow the instructions from [Configure Notify with Twilio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureNotifyWithTwilio.md) and verify [Verified Caller IDs](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified).
