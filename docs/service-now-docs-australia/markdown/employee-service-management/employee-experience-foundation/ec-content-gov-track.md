# Tracking content requests

After a content request is submitted, Content Governance enables the content requester, content managers, and content admins to track the status of the request and associated content.

## Tracking as the content requester

After submitting a content request, the employee can track the status of the request by navigating to **My requests** and opening the content request. They can add a comment for the content manager, attach files, and review the details they submitted.\[Omitted image "content-gov-request-view.png"\] Alt text: The content requester can track the request status from the My Request tab

The state field of a content request provides a quick status update to the requester and content team, as well as triggers system actions. For more information, see [Understanding content request states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-gov-track.md).

## Tracking as a content manager or content admin

Content managers and content admins can view content requests by navigating to **Content Governance** &gt; **All Requests**. Each time an employee submits a content request, the system creates a record with the prefix CONREQ. This record can be assigned either to an individual content manager or to a group. The record is used for the following purposes:

-   Holds the request details, such as the type of content that needs to be created and the intended audience
-   Communicate with the employee who made the request
-   Holds the associated content once it's created in the Content Request Items list
-   Tracks the request status

Content admins and content managers can view all the content requests and associated content, even if they aren't assigned to that record.

## Understanding content request states

The content request state provides a quick update on the current status to the employee who made the content request, approvers, and the content team.

The status bar at the top of a content request record displays all the states, with the current state highlighted.\[Omitted image "ec\_status\_bar.png"\] Alt text: Content request status bar

After the content manager creates the content and publishing plan and clicks **Send for review**, the system updates the state to "In Review" and assigns a task to the content requester and approvers to review the content**Note:** Once a content request item is **In Review**, the content cannot be edited. The content manager must revert the state to "Work in Progress" to edit the content.
