# Map email fields to a catalog item

Map email fields to catalog item fields to pre-fill information and reduce the time taken to raise a request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_outlook\_addin.outlook\_addin\_setup, sn\_hr\_sp.admin, sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ServiceNow Add-Ins for Office** &gt; **Catalog Mapping Configurations**.

    **Note:** The fields from Microsoft Outlook are based on the Extension Point Type selected in the manifest file.
