# Configure branding and theme

In the admin console, configure branding, data sources, internal and external search sources, conversational assistant settings, canvas, and other features.

## Before you begin

Before you configure Employee Slate \(built for Now Assist\), verify the following prerequisites:

-   You have the administrator role on the instance.
-   The Employee Slate \(built for Now Assist\) foundational plugin is installed from the Product Hub page.
-   The EmployeeWorks Web App Extended plugin is installed if the deployment requires the advanced experience.
-   Now Assist is provisioned on the instance.

Role required: Administrator

## About this task

The Product Configuration console organizes the configuration work into modules and displays progress in the configuration summary. Data Sources and Conversational Assistant modules are specific to Now Assist deployments.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your **Admin Home** page on your instance.

    The system dynamically renders application and plugin cards based on your admin entitlement status.

2.  From the platform administrator home page, select **View product overview** on the Employee Slate \(built for Now Assist\) card.

    The Product Hub page opens and lists the plugins associated with EmployeeWorks Web App for Now Assist and links to documentation and release notes.

3.  Upload a prepared update set with the **Upload Batch** option.

    Use this option to reuse configurations exported from another environment.

4.  Select **Configure** to open the Product Configuration console.

5.  In the **Appearance** module, set the branding and theming for the experience.

    Set the portal name, URL suffix, light and dark mode logos, the favicon, and the primary, accent, and neutral palette colors. Preview the experience in desktop, mobile, light mode, and dark mode, then save and mark the module as configured.

6.  [Configure additional themes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/es-configure-multi-theme.md) based on your requirements.

7.  In the **Data Sources** module, configure the following internal search sources for the experience.

    1.  In the **Internal sources** module, configure the internal search sources for the experience.

        The internal sources list shows the default sources. Edit the conditions on an existing source, add an existing source that isn't yet linked to the search profile, or create a new internal source. Add, exclude, and map the fields per your requirements. For more information, see [Add internal search sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/eslate-add-internal-search.md).

    2.  In the **External sources** module, configure the external search sources for the experience.

        By default, no external sources are linked to the search profile. You can add an existing source that isn't yet linked to the search profile, or create a new external source by following on-screen instructions. For more information, see [Add external search sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/eslate-add-external-search.md).

8.  In the **Conversational Assistant** module, configure the chat header and the chat logo.

    You can go with one of the two options.

    -   \[Omitted image "es-admin-now-assistant-config.png"\] Alt text: conversational chat assistant now assist

        The module also offers a redirection to the Now Assist Assistant Designer admin console to configure advanced assistant behavior.

9.  In the **Canvas Configuration** module, configure the default canvas view and the widget library.

    -   Select **Edit default view** to configure the default canvas dashboard.
    -   Use the **Widget library** to toggle the visibility of widgets that employees can add to their personal canvas. You can also create widgets and add to the library.
10. In the **Notifications** module, review notifications in the **Needs update** tab and select **Update to Employee Slate** so that those notifications redirect an employee to the Employee Slate experience.

    Following notifications are available in each tab:

    -   Needs update: Notifications in the base system that are not customized
    -   Updated: Notifications that are updated for Employee Slate experience
    -   Custom: Notifications that are created or customized by the administrator
    For information about Employee Slate notifications, see [EmployeeWorks notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/emp-slate-notifications.md).

11. To make AI agent discoverable in Now Assist in the **AI Agent Discovery** section, enable the `sn_aia.enable_aiagents_discovery` system property.

    Do the following:

    1.  Navigate to **System Administration** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **System Property Grid**.
    2.  In the filter field, search for `sn_aia.enable_aiagents_discovery`.
    3.  Locate the property row and set the value to `true`.
    4.  Click **Save** to apply the change.
    The following AI agents will be discoverable within Now Assist conversations:

    -   Request Tracker AI Agent — Enables employees to query and manage their requests
    -   Policy Validation AI Agent — Validates employee requests against company policies
    -   Company News and Events AI Agent — Provides access to organizational announcements and events
    -   Approvals AI Agent — Manages approval workflows and status
12. In the **Documentation** module, go to **Documentation and references** for an overview of resources.

    Review and learn from product documentation reference content.

13. Select **Mark as configured** for each completed configuration section in the **Admin Console**.

    This action records that you reviewed and configured the section, and updates the overall completion status.

14. Select **Package and download** to export the configuration updates as an XML update set.

    Upload the exported file on the Product Hub page of another environment to promote configurations from a lower environment to production.


## Result

EmployeeWorks Web App portal is configured with your organization branding and is ready for employee access.

## What to do next

Log in as a non-administrator employee, open EmployeeWorks Web App in a browser session. Verify that the branding, content, and conversational assistant work as expected.
