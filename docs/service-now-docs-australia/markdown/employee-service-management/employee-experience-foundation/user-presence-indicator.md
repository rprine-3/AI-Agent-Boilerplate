# User Presence Indicator

User presence indicator helps the agents to know the status of the users in Microsoft Teams before the agent can initiate a chat using Microsoft Teams.

By default, the agents can view the status of the users when they launch the Start chat modal in the ServiceNow instance.

Ensure that the API permission is added to the already created Request Based Chat application from the Azure Portal, when you are upgrading the application. For more information on required permissions for Request Based Chat, see [Add permissions to the Microsoft Azure application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/authenticate-users-req-based-chat.md).

The system takes 60 minutes to display the user presence status in the start chat modal for the first use when you upgrade to IT Service Management integration with Microsoft Teams v2.5.0 or Collaboration Services v3.5 applications.

The status of the user from Microsoft Teams is mapped into the ServiceNow instance as depicted in the table.

|User status in Microsoft Teams|Status shown in Start Chat modal|
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|'Available', 'AvailableIdle'|available|
|'Busy', 'BusyIdle', 'DoNotDisturb'|busy|
|'Offline', 'PresenceUnknown'|offline|
|'Away', 'BeRightBack'|away|

The user presence status is cached for 180 seconds, this implies if a user is “online” in Microsoft Teams, the Start Chat modal displays the user status as “online” until 180 seconds. If the user status is modified, the system fetches the user status after the interval of 180 seconds and updates the status in the Start Chat modal.

The time interval to cache the user status is configurable by a system property `sn_tcm_collab_hook.teams.presence_status_cache_invalidate_duration`. You can modify the time interval to retain the user presence status. For more information, refer [Configure cache duration for the user presence status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/configure-cache-duration.md).

You can modify the system property to configure the cache duration to retain the user presence status of the Microsoft Teams user.
