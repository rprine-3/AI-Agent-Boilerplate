# Manage connected content from topic pages

Link your desired categories to the topics and track the additions and removals to have easier management of unconnected content.

## Before you begin

Role required: taxonomy\_admin

User criteria required: Taxonomy Manager, Taxonomy Contributor, Topic Manager, Topic Contributor.

## About this task

A Fix script is shipped with the feature that automatically runs when you upgrade. Link your desired categories to the topics manually, for new installations, for new taxonomy created, or for new categories required on the existing taxonomies.

-   The script goes through all the connected content on the topics and identifies the categories for the connected content.
-   The fix script works for all the active taxonomies.
-   The **Catalog and knowledge Categories** tab displays the identified categories to be linked to the topics, after the fix script is successfully executed.
-   Linking a category to a topic bulk-connects all its connected content to the topic.

A weekly scheduled job runs to recognize new content added or removed from the category that can be associated to the topics.

For more information on the execution and modification of the scheduled job, see

-   [Run the scheduled job for content association](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/schduld-job-link-cntnt.md) and [Check for updated content in categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/may-associate-updated-content-categories-topics.md) for manual checking and updation of each record.
-   [Enable connected content autosync system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/may-system-properties-taxonomy-autosync.md) for autosync.

**Important:** The connected content management is available from the Zurich family release.
