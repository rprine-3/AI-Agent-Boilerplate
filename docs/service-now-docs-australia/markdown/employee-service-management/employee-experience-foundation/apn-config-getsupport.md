# Get support

Get support helps you with a centralized and easy-to-navigate section for quick help from the employee center.

## Before you begin

Role required: SP admin or ESC admin

## About this task

Admins provide a central place for employees to get help quickly without having to switch context. You can include useful resources available for your employees.

-   Enable the widget for an enhanced get support experience.
-   Populate the modal with quick link, static content, or a custom widget.

You can render **Get Support** as a widget on the home page or as a modal window. For more information, see [Configure advanced portal navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/config-adv-portal-nav-as-menu.md)
