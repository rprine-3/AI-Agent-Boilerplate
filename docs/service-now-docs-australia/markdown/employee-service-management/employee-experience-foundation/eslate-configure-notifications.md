# Configure notifications

Configure the content, the trigger conditions, and the recipients for the default notifications shipped with Employee Slate \(built for Now Assist\).

## Before you begin

Activate Employee Slate \(built for Now Assist\) in the instance.

Role required: admin.

## About this task

Each notification has a content template, an icon, a set of trigger conditions, and a recipient list. Each notification moves through three states: new, viewed, and open. Notifications on the same item group automatically. Employees can mark all as read with a bulk action.

**Note:** Notifications for Moveworks use a separate configuration path.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Portal Notifications**.

    The page lists the default notifications shipped for Employee Slate \(built for Now Assist\).

2.  Select a notification, such as **Incident commented**.

    The notification folder opens and displays the content template, icon, trigger conditions, and recipient list.

3.  Edit the content under **Notification content**.

    Declare the sentences that appear when the notification fires. Use short sentences and active voice.

4.  Set the icon for the notification.

    The icon appears next to the notification and identifies the source.

5.  Set the trigger conditions under **When to send**.

    The trigger conditions describe the system event or the record change that fires the notification.

6.  Set the recipient list under **Who will receive**.

    The recipient list resolves at run time and identifies the employees who receive the notification.

7.  Open the logs table to review notification activity.

    The logs table records every notification sent and the state for each recipient: new, viewed, or open.

8.  Verify the experience from an employee account.

    Trigger the source event, select the notifications and confirm that the notification appears with the configured content and icon. Select **Mark all as read** to confirm the toast message and the state change in the log.

9.  Save the configuration.

    The configuration is saved with the updated content, icon, trigger conditions, and recipient list.


## Result

Employees view the configured notifications in the **bell tray** with the chosen content, icon, and recipient scope. Group updates collapse into one entry. The bulk mark-as-read action clears the tray. The **logs table** records the activity for review.
