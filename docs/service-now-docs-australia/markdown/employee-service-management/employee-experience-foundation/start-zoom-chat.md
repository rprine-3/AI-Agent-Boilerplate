# Start a Zoom Team Chat

Start a Zoom Team Chat with an employee through an open ticket to resolve an incident, request item, and change request.

## Before you begin

You must have the write role to use the  Start Zoom chat  feature for incident, request, and change request tasks. This role is available when you activate the IT Service Management role plugins or for all instances by default.

|Record|Role|Plugin|
|------|----|------|
|Incident|sn\_incident\_write|ITSM Roles - Incident Management \(com.snc.itsm.roles.incident\_management\) plugin|
|Change Request|sn\_change\_write|ITSM Roles — Change Management \(com.snc.itsm.roles.change\_management\) plugin|
|Request|sn\_request\_write|ITSM Roles — Request Management \(com.snc.itsm.roles.request\_management\) plugin|

Ensure you’ve installed the fix script to enable the display of the Zoom chat icon associated with the Caller field. For more information, see [Install fix-script for Collaboration services for Zoom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/install-fix-script-cs.md).

Role required: agent

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to an open task record \(incident, change request, or request item\) in your ServiceNow instance.

2.  Start the chat by selecting **Start Zoom Chat** or the Start Zoom chat icon \[Omitted image "icon-start-zoom-chat.png"\] Alt text: Start Zoom chat icon associated with the Caller field.

3.  In the Start Zoom chat dialog box, select the participants.

    All users from the assigned group for the ticket are in the Recommended section of the dialog box by default. The user who initiates the chat is added to the Selected list of participants.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

If the On-Call Scheduling \(com.snc.on\_call\_rotation\) plugin is activated, the On-Call Scheduling users are added when you select a group. When On-Call Scheduling \(com.snc.on\_call\_rotation\) plugin isn’t activated, it adds all users from the selected group.

</table>5.  Select **Start Chat**.

    When the user validation is complete and a Zoom Channel is created for the current instance of the ticket, you are directed to the chat channel in the Zoom application.

    Zoom Team Chat displays the chat title and the opening message provided by the agent.

6.  Interact with the ticket requester in Zoom Team Chat.

    You can send files supported by the Zoom application.

    On the ServiceNow instance, the system captures work notes about the chat details.

    A Zoom chat Interaction record is automatically created if the requester is a participant in the chat conversation. The requester can then access chat details in the **Activities** section. For information about a ticket requester mapping, see [Create requester mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/create-requester-mapping-zoom.md).

    1.  In the Activities section of the record, find the comment that contains a link to access the chat interaction.
    2.  Select the link.

        The chat transcript is stored in the  Activities  section.

## Reassign a ticket
