# Getting started with Otto Chat Integration

Moveworks integration adds an AI assistant to Employee Center replacing the standard Virtual Agent with Moveworks conversational AI.

A new plugin, ServiceNow Otto Chat Integration \(sn\_ex\_mw\_chat\_int\) assistant, lets your entire workforce ask questions, get instant answers, and complete tasks end-to-end.

Using the Moveworks chat assistant, you can access knowledge articles, requests, and tasks. Verify that you activate the EC applications before installing the Moveworks app from ServiceNow Store.

-   Employee Center \(sn\_ex\_sp\)
-   Employee Center Pro \(sn\_ex\_sp\_pro\)

You can complete the integration process in three steps:

-   Install the plugin from store \(`sn_ex_mw_chat_int`\).
-   Upload the Java KeyStore \(JKS\) certificate and create JWT provider.
-   Configure the bot ID and Embedded AI Assistant.

**Note:** You must have purchased Moveworks and implemented it for the self-signing to work.

## Understand Moveworks basics

Familiarity with the following Moveworks concepts helps with successful configuration:

-   User identity management: How Moveworks identifies and authenticates users.
-   Content ingestion: Process for indexing knowledge articles.
-   Group actions: Configuring bulk operations for common tasks.
-   Hand-off configuration: Setting up live agent escalation.
-   Multilingual support: Enabling conversations in multiple languages.
