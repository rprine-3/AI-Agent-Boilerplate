# Add content destination

A content destination defines the page and widget for publishing news articles. It is a component of a content template, which auto-generates publish plans for new articles.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_admin

## About this task

The Employee Center Pro provides the following content destinations:

-   All News: the news feed widget on the News Center page
-   Featured News: the featured news widget on the top of the News Center page
-   Featured News Mobile: the news section on the mobile app
-   Latest News Home Page: the news widget on the portal Home page
-   Other News: the news feed widget on the article detail page

To view a graphic of these content destinations, see the Publishing News articles section of [News articles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-news-articles.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Publishing** &gt; **Re-usable Components** &gt; **Content Destinations**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Fill in the following fields:
