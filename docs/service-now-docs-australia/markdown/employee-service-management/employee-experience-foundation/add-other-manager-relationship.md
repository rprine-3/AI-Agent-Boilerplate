# Add other manager relationships for an employee

Add other manager relationships to set up dotted-line reporting for an employee.

## Before you begin

An employee profile definition must be created and opted in to add other manager relationships. For more information, see [Opt in to the employee profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/profile-opt-in.md).

Role required: sn\_employee.admin

## About this task

Use the Other Manager Relationships module to create many-to-many dotted-line relationships between employees and managers. You can define custom relationships for the managers, such as supervisor, project lead, and so on. The other managers and other reports are displayed in the employee profile teams widget and the [organization chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/view-org-chart.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Profile** &gt; **Other Manager Relationships**.

2.  On the other manager relationships page, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Employee|Employee profile record of the employee.|
    |Other manager|Employee profile record of the other manager.|
    |Relationship type|Type of relationship of the manager to the employee. You can define custom relationships such as supervisor or project lead.|

    **Note:**

    The specified employee, manager, and relationship type shouldn’t match with an existing other manager relationship record.

4.  Select **Submit**.
