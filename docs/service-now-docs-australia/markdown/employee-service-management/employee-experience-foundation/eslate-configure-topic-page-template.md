# Assign a custom topic page template

Assign a custom layout template to a topic page and optionally apply the template to child topics.

## Before you begin

Clone the default topic template widget and customize your sub-widget layout.

Role required: admin or aix\_widget\_admin

## About this task

A topic page template controls the layout of widgets on a topic page, such as the topic header, subtopics, quick links, and support resource content. Employee Slate includes a default template that renders on every topic page. You can assign a custom template to an individual topic when that topic requires a different layout.

-   App checks for templates in this order: a custom template assigned to the topic and experience, the default topic template set on the experience record, or the default template.
-   You can apply a custom template to a single topic or extend it to all child topics for consistent layout across a subtree.
-   You can use template extension to maintain consistent layouts for related topics, such as all topics under a department-owned parent topic.
-   By default, you get an out-of-the-box **Topic template directory** template that displays subtopic cards. Assign this template to topics that have subtopics but no content of their own.
-   Cards display a banner image when configured. When no banner image is set, cards display the topic icon instead. When a topic has no subtopics, the template shows an empty state.

## Procedure

1.  In the topic record, open the **Experience Topic Template Mapping** related list.

    \[Omitted image "es-topic-template-mapping.png"\] Alt text: Experience Topic Template Mapping form for a topic showing Template, Topic, Experience, and Active fields.

2.  Complete the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Template**|The default topic template widget to render for this topic.|
    |**Topic**|Topic to which this custom template applies.|
    |**Experience**|Experience to which this custom template applies.|
    |**Apply to children**|When selected, extends the custom template to all child topics under the selected topic.|
    |**Application**|This field is automatically set to Employee experience taxonomy.|
    |**Active**|When selected, activates the custom template.|

3.  Select **Save**.

4.  To change the default template for every topic in an experience, set the **Default topic template** property on the experience record.

    The default topic template is applied to any topic that has no custom template assigned.


## Result

The topic page for the selected topic renders using the assigned template. When **Apply to children** is selected, child topics also render using the assigned template.
