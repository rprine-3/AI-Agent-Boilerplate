# Create an announcement using Chat

Use conversational authoring with Chat to create Employee Slate announcements from existing knowledge articles or catalog items.

## Before you begin

Ensure Now Assist Chat is configured and available in your instance.

Role required: content\_manager or content\_admin

## About this task

Conversational authoring streamlines announcement creation by using AI to generate draft content from existing knowledge articles or catalog items. The AI assistant supports you through the configuration process.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the knowledge article or catalog item you want to promote or provide the article ID or URL directly to Chat.

2.  Open **Chat** and enter a natural language prompt to create an announcement.

    For example, use a prompt such as `Create an announcement for this article` or `Create an announcement for knowledge article KB0001234`.

    The AI assistant analyzes the source content and generates a draft announcement with headline, body text, and image.

3.  Review the generated headline and body text for accuracy and tone.

    The AI extracts the **Headline** from the article title and **Body text** from the first paragraph or description.

4.  Respond to the assistant prompts for target audience and scheduling preferences.

    The assistant inherits user criteria from the source content but may ask for additional targeting details.

5.  Select the option to enter **authoring edit mode** when offered by the assistant.

    The announcement opens in the standard editing interface with AI-generated content pre-filled.

6.  Review and adjust the announcement content as needed.

    1.  Verify the **Headline** and **Body text** align with your communication goals.

    2.  Check the **Image** and adjust the **Focal point** if necessary.

    3.  Confirm the **Link configuration** points to the correct source content.

    4.  Review the **Content priority** setting \(defaults to **Medium**\).

7.  Configure the publishing window by setting start and end dates and times.

    The AI assistant sets default values, but you can adjust these based on your communication timeline.

8.  Configure chat promotion settings if you want to share the announcement through supported channels.

    1.  Review and edit the promotional title and body text.

    2.  Set the promotion schedule, which can be independent of the publishing window.

9.  Select **Publish** to make the announcement live.

    The announcement appears in the Employee Comms widget according to the priority and freshness algorithm.


## Result

The AI-generated announcement is now live and visible to employees who match the targeting criteria. The announcement includes content derived from the source article or catalog item, with any adjustments you made during the review process.

If the AI assistant doesn't recognize the article or catalog item, verify that you have the correct ID or URL and that the content is published and accessible. Also check if you have user permissions to the content.
