# Request based chat - Start and import chat from classic view

Initiate a conversation with the requester to resolve the ticket.

You must have the "write" role to use the **Start Microsoft Teams chat** and **Import messages from Microsoft Teams** features for an incident, request, change request and a catalog task. This role is available when you activate the ITSM roles plugin, or for all the instances starting the Madrid release.
