# Enable task configuration for approvals

Provide the approvers with more in-context information about the approval requests for informed and prioritized approval workflows.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin

## About this task

Each task configuration is associated with a table that is an extension of the To-dos configuration. Define the following task configuration sections:

-   Task configuration
-   Common information
-   Primary information
-   Tab configuration
-   Actions

Here is a sample illustration of how these configurations appear on the approvals page.

\[Omitted image "approval-hub-sap-workday.png"\] Alt text: Approval hub workflow in Employee Center portal and NowMobile

The information displayed on each section of the page depends on the individual approval request type. When a configurable section has no specified value or when a user does not have permission; information isn’t displayed.

-   Customize the experience by embedding widgets for all sections except task configuration.
-   Click the URLs for additional information and context.
-   Use the condition builder to specify the conditions that a task must meet to appear on the to-dos page.

    -   Ensure you have the write permissions to the Comment field. Check the ACL and grant permissions to add comments.
    -   For more information on adding comments while rejecting an approval request, see [https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb\_article\_view&amp;sysparm\_article=KB0760283](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0760283).

## Result

Based on this configuration, the approvers see the in-context important information about the approval and complete the approval. For more reference info, see [Approvals experience reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/approval-hub-ootb.md).

**Note:** A user must have the approval\_user or business\_stakeholder role to approve IT requests \(not applicable to other requests such as HR approvals\) on Employee Centre. Role validation has not been implemented in Core UI16 because modifying ACLs in UI16 might have broader implications at the NowPlatform level.

Use the out-of-the-box **Approvals action group** to display the actions such as **Approve** and **Reject**. For more information, see [Action framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/action-group-framework.md).

**Note:** For actions to appear in the my items widget, you can add the OOTB **Approvals action group** from **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **To-dos Configurations**, click an existing to-dos configuration, navigate to the **To-do Configuration Details** record, and use the OOTB **Approvals action group** under **Fields Mapping**.
