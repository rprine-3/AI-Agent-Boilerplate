# Configure actions

Using the action framework, configure actions and associate a set of actions as action groups for use in the different contexts.

## Before you begin

Role required: sp\_admin or sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin

## About this task

Action items provide quick access to actions that you perform in various contexts. You can modify the actions to suit your business needs. For example, you can use the default approve or reject actions to process the requests directly from the approvals page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Action framework** &gt; **Actions**.

2.  Click **New** or edit an existing record.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Action label|Name of the action label that appears on the button.|
    |Action type|Select the action type from the available list.|
    |Active|Check the box to activate the action|
    |Action icon|Icon of the action.|
    |Table|Name of the table to which the action is associated. When a record from this table is open, this list action appears. For approvals, select sysapproval\_approver.|

4.  Click **Save** or **Update**.
