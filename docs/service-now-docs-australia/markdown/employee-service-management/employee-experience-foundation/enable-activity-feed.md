# Send campaign notifications automatically in Microsoft Teams

Automatically send campaign notifications in Microsoft Teams for better collaboration and efficient communication.

## Before you begin

A manifest file to enable the campaign notification display in Microsoft Teams must exist.

If the configured Employee Center version is v.24 or above, then the Employee Center tab is present by default in your Microsoft Teams application. If the Employee Center version is lower than v.24, you must update the value of the portal in the `sn_now_teams.portal.suffix` property to `esc`. This value enables Employee Center in your instance.

Role required: admin
