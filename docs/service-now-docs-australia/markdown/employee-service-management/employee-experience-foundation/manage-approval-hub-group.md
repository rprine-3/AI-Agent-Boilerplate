    Use the Action group m2m table to add multiple actions into a group.

5.  On the **Action group M2Ms** related list, click New or update an existing record.

        -   User criteria: Select the user criterion from the available options.
        -   Advanced: Define a custom visibility with the Advanced option through a script. For example, `answer = context.state.toString() === 'requested';`.
