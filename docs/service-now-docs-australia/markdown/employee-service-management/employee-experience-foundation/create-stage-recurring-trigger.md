# Create a campaign stage with recurring trigger

Use this trigger to publish date-based repeatable content. For example, recognition announcements like birthdays or work anniversaries.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ca.campaign\_manager or sn\_cd.content\_admin

## About this task

Stages organize and manage the delivery of campaign content. When configuring a stage, you set the stage trigger, which determines when content becomes available and for how long.

**Note:** Some parts of the interface use the term "bundles" to refer to stages.

Offset start date

</td><td>

Select this check box to trigger your campaign stage before or after the actual trigger start date. For example, if you are creating a recurring campaign stage for employee birthdays, you can trigger the campaign stage 2 days before the employee birthdays and keep the campaign stage active after the employee birthdays.**Note:** Content is not triggered unless the initial trigger is in the past. For example, if you set a yearly recurring trigger on a date in 2024, the content does not trigger until 2024, so the trigger must be set in the past. You can use the Offset trigger start field to pull the initial trigger start date before the current date.

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">
