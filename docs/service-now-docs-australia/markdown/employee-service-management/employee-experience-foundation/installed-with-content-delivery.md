# Components installed with Content Publishing

Several types of components install with the activation of the Content Delivery \[com.sn\_content\_delivery\] plugin, including tables, user roles, and scheduled jobs.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this feature.

**Note:** The Content Publishing \[com.sn\_content\_delivery\] plugin activates the sn\_cd.min\_admin\_count system property \[sys\_properties.list\]. This property prevents you from deleting your only Content Publishing admin user by requiring a minimum number \(default is two\) of active users with this role.
