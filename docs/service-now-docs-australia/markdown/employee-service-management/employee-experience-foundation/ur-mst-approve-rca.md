# Approve application restricted caller access privileges

Approve restricted caller access \(RCA\) privileges in the target scope so that you can provide scope access privileges. Approving the RCA privileges enables the script includes in Universal Request scope to be accessed from the Universal Request integration with Microsoft Teams scope.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

RCA privileges define cross-scope access to an application, an event, or an application resource. Application resources include access control roles, business rules, UI actions, and script includes. RCA privileges can also be used to allow or deny requests for access. Restricted caller access \[sys\_restricted\_caller\_access\] records track cross-scope applications or scripts that request access to an application, application resource, or event. For more information, see [Requested restricted caller access \(RCA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/requested-rca.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **Application Restricted Caller Access** &gt; **Restricted Caller Access Privileges**.

2.  In the **Source Scope** search, enter `Universal Request integration with Microsoft Teams`.

3.  Right-click on **Source Scope** column header, and select **Group By Source Scope**.

4.  Expand the **Universal Request integration with Microsoft Teams** source scope.

5.  Open the record.

6.  Change the **Status** to **Allowed**.

7.  Click **Update**.


## Result
