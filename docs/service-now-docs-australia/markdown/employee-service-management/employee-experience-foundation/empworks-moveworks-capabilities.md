# Moveworks capabilities

You can handle work tasks, find information, and get things done faster with the Moveworks AI assistant. Chat naturally to update records, search company content, get answers, and complete requests without switching between different systems.

When your organization uses Moveworks with EmployeeWorks Web App, you get AI-powered help for everyday work tasks. You can start any request from the same chat bar and complete everything in one place, without jumping between different tools or systems.

## AI assistant reasoning engine

You can ask for complex things in plain English, and the AI assistant determines all the steps needed to complete your request. Here's how it works behind the scenes:

-   **Plan**

    The engine interprets the request, identifies the records and systems involved, and builds an ordered set of steps.

-   **Execute**

    The engine runs each step against the correct system of record. Examples include SAP SuccessFactors for personal records or a calendar system for scheduling.

-   **Observe**

    The engine evaluates the outcome of each step and the context that surrounds it. The engine assesses the impact of a relocation on benefits or payroll.

-   **Adapt**

    The engine adjusts the plan in response to the observed outcome, requests missing inputs, and proactively surfaces related content.


The assistant collects inputs in the conversation rather than in a separate form. For any action that changes sensitive data, the assistant summarizes the intended change and waits for confirmation before committing. After a change completes, the assistant proactively surfaces related knowledge. The assistant shows the employee handbook and payroll FAQs after a move to a new state.

## Enterprise Search

You can search through all the content in SharePoint, OneDrive, Google Drive, Slack, and Outlook from one place. The search covers up to 100 million documents per system.

You have two ways to search:

-   Granular filter search: Use a search interface with AI-generated summaries at the top. Narrow results with filters for source, date, and file type.
-   Conversational search: Ask questions in natural language through the AI assistant. The assistant searches across all connected systems without manual filters.

When you find something useful, you can select **Dive Deeper** to continue the conversation with the AI assistant about that content.

## World Knowledge

You can ask the AI assistant about topics that go beyond the internal knowledge base of your company. This secure capability combines AI reasoning with web search to help you with general knowledge tasks.

You can use this to:

-   Improve your draft emails and communications.
-   Get technical concepts explained in simple terms.
-   Stay updated on recent security vulnerabilities or advisories.

**Note:** AI generates these responses, which might not be fully accurate. Verify AI-generated content against authoritative sources before acting on it.

## Specialized assistants

You can access specialized assistants that support particular types of work . These appear in the left panel of Employee Slate based on what your organization makes available to you. Each assistant comes ready to help with its specific domain, so you don't need to explain the context.

Each specialized assistant includes:

-   **Suggested prompts**: Ready-made conversation starters for common tasks.
-   **Context**: Relevant information already loaded to help with your requests.
-   **Connected tools**: Direct connections to the systems you need for that type of work.

Your administrator makes specialized assistants available based on the deployment.

## Interactive split view

To review, act, find more content or information, you can open the chat panel in a split view. You can work with documents, forms, and other content without switching to different systems.

You can work with:

-   **Catalog forms**: Request forms that you can fill out and submit right in the panel.
-   **Knowledge articles**: Company policies and reference documents that open in full.
-   **Tasks and requests**: Your active work items, like approvals or support tickets.
-   **Canvas pages**: Personalized dashboard views with your widgets.

Here's how it works to submit a request:

1.  You ask the AI assistant for something, for example, request to work remotely.
2.  The assistant displays any relevant policies, like needing manager approval for extended periods.
3.  The request form opens in the side panel next to your conversation.
4.  You review, fill out, and submit the form without leaving the AI assistant.
5.  Your request goes to the right approver with all policy checks and requirements handled automatically.

To review a policy or document, you can see what's covered, what's approved, and what conditions apply. The experience stays consistent across all content types.

## Moveworks notifications

You can see and respond to Moveworks notifications in your Employee Slate notifications tray. When you get an alert, you can:

-   Ask follow-up questions about the notification in the AI assistant.
-   Take direct action, like approving a request, right from the notification.

Your administrator sets up these notifications from ServiceNow or other connected systems.

## User-specified personalization

You can personalize Employee Slate to work the way you prefer, separate from any settings your administrator controls. You can:

-   Choose your display language for the interface.
-   Set the language for AI assistant responses and search results.
-   Connect to your personal content in systems like Slack and Outlook that require your individual login.

When you connect your personal content, the AI assistant includes information from those systems in searches and responses.

## Catalog experience

You can request services and items from the catalog of your company in two ways:

-   **Default guided UI**

    You can search for catalog items and open the request forms on the side panel. You fill out the form while the AI assistant stays available in the conversation panel to help.

-   **Conversational \(slot filling\)**

    You can tell the AI assistant what you need in natural language. It asks for the required information through the conversation and submits your request when you've provided everything needed.
