# Scheduling the delivery of content

After you create content in Content Publishing, use **Schedule Content** to post to your Employee Center, in a campaign, To-dos, email notifications, and community.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_manager

You can also schedule content after creating and saving it from the related list of the content. See the following:

-   [Portal content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-streamline-content.md)
-   [Create email, SMS, or push notification content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-manage-notification-content.md)
-   [Create to-do content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-manage-content-to-do.md)
-   [Add or modify forum content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-manage-community-content.md)

The to-do content is automatically scheduled separately when the link content is scheduled.
