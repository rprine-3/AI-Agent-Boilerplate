-   **Scoped cache**

    You can add scoped cache for HR criteria to optionally save the evaluation results in cache. This is an optional feature that is available by passing a Boolean "true" as the "useCache" parameter.

    You can also define how long in minutes to retain the cached entries via the sn\_hr\_core.cache.hrcriteria.ttl system property.
