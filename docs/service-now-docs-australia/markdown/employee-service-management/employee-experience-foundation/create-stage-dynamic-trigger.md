# Create a campaign stage with dynamic trigger

The campaign bundle triggers based on a trigger table \(sn\_hr\_core\_profile or sys\_user\), trigger field, and date offsets.

## About this task

Stages organize and manage the delivery of campaign content. When configuring a stage, you set the stage trigger, which determines when content becomes available and for how long.

**Note:** Some parts of the interface use the term "bundles" to refer to stages.

The table you want to base your recurring campaign stage to trigger. Choose from:-   HR profile \(sn\_hr\_core\_profile\)
-   User \(sys\_user\)


</td></tr><tr><td>

Start date field

The fields from the table you select to base your recurring campaign stage to trigger. For example, if you are creating a recurring campaign stage for employee birthdays, select the HR profile table and **Date of birth** from this drop-down.

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

Offset trigger start

</td><td>

Select this check box to trigger your campaign stage before or after the actual trigger start date. For example, if you are creating a recurring campaign stage for employee birthdays, you can trigger the campaign stage 2 days before the employee birthdays and keep the campaign stage active after the employee birthdays.**Note:** Content is not triggered unless the initial trigger is in the past. For example, if you set a yearly recurring trigger on a date in 2024, the content does not trigger until 2024, so the trigger must be set in the past. You can use the Offset trigger start field to pull the initial trigger start date before the current date.

</td></tr><tr><td>

The number of days, weeks, or months to offset the trigger type. This field works with the next fields to determine when content is available.For example, if you want your campaign stage to trigger 2 days before the actual date, enter 2 and select **Days** in the **Date** offset units drop-down.
