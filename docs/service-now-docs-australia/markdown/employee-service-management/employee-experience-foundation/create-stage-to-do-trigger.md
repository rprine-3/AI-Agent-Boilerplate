# Create a campaign stage with to-do trigger

The content in a stage with a to-do trigger becomes available when a user completes a specific to-do item from another stage in the campaign. For example, create a stage that sends a confirmation email when an employee completes the "Select health plan" to-do item.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ca.campaign\_manager

Complete the steps to [Create a campaign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-create-campaign.md)

Create a stage with a to-do content item. For more information on this content type, see [To-do content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-to-do-content.md).

## About this task

Stages organize and manage the delivery of campaign content. When configuring a stage, you set the stage trigger, which determines when content becomes available and for how long.

**Note:** Some parts of the interface use the term "bundles" to refer to stages.

Create a stage that is triggered when the user completes a to-do item from another stage.
