# Using AI Agents with ServiceNow Otto for Employee Experience

Use AI Agents with the Now Assist for Virtual Agent in the Employee Center for users to have a seamless agent-like conversation.

Verify that you have the following plugins:

-   ServiceNow Otto for Employee Experience version 2.0.3 and later. The AI Agents for Employee Experience is automatically installed with the updated version.
-   Content Publishing version 36.0.4 \(Installed automatically as part of Employee Center Pro\)

Company News &amp; Events AI Agent

</td><td>

This Agent shares the latest updates on news, events, and announcements. It can understand and respond to general questions like 'What’s the latest news?' or 'Are there any upcoming events?'

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Important:** All use case and AI agent records are read only by default.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first duplicate the use case, and then do the following steps:

-   Activate the use case.
-   Activate all agents within the use case.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the use case automatically. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn't necessary.

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).
