Enable users to interact with agents from Microsoft Teams application by copying the Notify connector App ID value.

## Before you begin

Role required: Microsoft Teams admin

## Procedure

1.  Log in to [Microsoft Teams admin portal](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).

2.  Navigate to **Teams apps** &gt; **Manage apps** &gt; **Upload new app** &gt; **Upload**.

3.  Search, select, and open \(in the Upload a custom app dialog-box\) the app package you downloaded in the section [Create and configure an app for Meeting Extensions in the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/config-nc-use-meeting-ext-ms-teams-portal.md).

4.  Go to **Manage Apps**, search for the uploaded app, open and copy the **App ID** value in a notepad from the app details page.
