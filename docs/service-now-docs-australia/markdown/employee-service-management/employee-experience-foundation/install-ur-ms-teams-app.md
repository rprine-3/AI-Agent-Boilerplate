## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Universal Request integration with Microsoft Teams application \(sn\_uni\_req\_msteams\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you cannot find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    Dependent plugins and applications are listed if they will be installed, are currently installed, or need to be installed. If any plugins or applications need to be installed, you must install them before you can install Universal Request integration with Microsoft Teams.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select the **Load demo data** check box.

    Demo data are the sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load the demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

5.  Select **Install**.
