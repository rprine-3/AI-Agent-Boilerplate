# Guided Self-Service reference

Use the following reference information for the Guided Self-Service functionality.

## Guided Self-Service: Things to remember

You can display Guided Self-Service as a widget on the home page or as a quick link or as a widget on topic pages. Remember the following information:

-   Ensure that the **sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin** user has the **playbook.write** role to edit the playbook design and **playbook\_experience.admin** to preview the guided experience.
-   Only when the playbook and guided help process are in an active state, the guided help process appears on the Employee Center.
-   Guided Self-Service can’t be created from the playbook page directly, create the process from the GSS form, see [Configure Guided Self-Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/gss-guided-help-config.md).
-   Guided Self-Service flow is a single-stage flow.
-   The Activity Definition \[sys\_pd\_activity\_definition\] table lists the definitions for the activities that you can add to a playbook in **Workflow Studio**.

    To access the activity definitions, navigate to **Process Automation** &gt; **Process Automation Administration** &gt; **Activity Definitions**

-   State management of your choices in an activity is retained for 24 hours only.
-   When a guided process activity is partially completed or aborted mid-way, you can resume and complete the rest of the process within 24 hours.
-   Currently, the option to restart the activity or change the selections isn’t supported after 24 hours. The process restarts afresh.
-   The completed self-service is purged after 30 days with the auto-flush schedule available from sys\_trigger\_list.
-   The `Cancel incomplete guided help playbook` scheduled job for the automatic cancellation of incomplete guidance is only available for admin.
-   Deleting the GSS process from `sn_ex_sp_gd_help_process` doesn’t delete the process from `sys_pd_process_definition`.
