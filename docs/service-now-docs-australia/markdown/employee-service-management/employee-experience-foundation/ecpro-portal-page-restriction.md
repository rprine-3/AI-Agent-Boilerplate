# Assign ownership to a portal page

Assign ownership of a portal page to give a user or group with the content manager \(sn\_cd.content\_manager\) role exclusive content publishing ability for the Content Publishing widgets in that page.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_admin

Ensure **Yes** is checked under **Allow Ownership for Portal Pages** under Content Publishing or Content Experiences properties. For more information, see [Properties installed with Content Experiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/properties-installed-with-content-auto.md) and [Properties installed with Content Publishing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/properties-with-content-delivery.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Pages**.

2.  Select the **ID** of the page.

3.  Scroll down to the related list tabs.

    -   To assign ownership to a user, select the **Content Publishing Owner by User** tab.
    -   To assign ownership to a group, select the **Content Publishing Owner by Group** tab.
4.  Click **New**.

5.  From the **User** or **Group** field, click the **Lookup using list** \(\[Omitted image "magnify-glass-outline-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon\) icon and select a user or group.

    **Note:** Only groups that have the content admin \(sn\_cd.content\_admin\) or content manager \(sn\_cd.content\_manager\) roles appear. If the members of the group have these roles, but the group does not, the group does not appear.

6.  Select **Submit**.

    After a user or group is assigned to a page, only that user or group can publish content to that page. Remove the user or group to allow all content managers to publish content to that page.
