# Create customized media with styled content

Create banners, block/announcements, or videos using the styled content type to customize settings such as text color, text alignment, links, background colors, and images on Employee Center Pro.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_manager

If you are creating video content, you must first upload the video: [Add or modify links to other content sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-manage-link-content.md)

## About this task

This content type offers three options:

-   Banner: appears at the top of the page \[Omitted image "ec-rich-text-content.png"\] Alt text: Banner containing header, heading, body text, and button content
-   Block: appears in a widget on the page \[Omitted image "ec-block-styled.png"\] Alt text: Block content containing heading, body, and a button
-   Video: can appear anywhere on a page, including at the top in place of a banner

When creating or editing a banner using styled content, you can view and edit the background image rather than editing your image externally and then importing it.

The Form Context menu \(\[Omitted image "ec-hamburger-menu.png"\] Alt text: Form Context menu\) at the top, left of the form provides the ability to quickly accomplish tasks when creating content. Select the icon and the following choices appear:

-   Clone: duplicate the content record.

    **Note:** Only translate content after you are done modifying the content. For best results, we do not recommend that you add or remove components or change the formatting after translation.

    To create rich content that is formatted differently in different languages, duplicate the content and modify the formatting as needed. Then, use Audiences to target the content to users by language.

    **Note:** Content Preview is designed to provide a general idea of how your content looks. Content may look different once published due to variations in device resolution, theme difference, or mobile app style configuration.

-   Configure a publish plan to control where the content is delivered, the audience, and the period of time it is available: [Create a publish plan for your content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-library-publish2.md).
