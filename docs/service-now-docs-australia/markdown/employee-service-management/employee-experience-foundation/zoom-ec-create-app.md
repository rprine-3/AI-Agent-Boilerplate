# Employee Center for Zoom

Integrate Employee Center with a Zoom account for your organization employees so they can use Employee Center capabilities from within the Zoom client application.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have installed the Employee Center integration with Zoom plugin \[sn\_ex\_ec\_zm\].

At least Zoom application version 5.13.11 and it must be installed on the ServiceNow® instance.

Role required: admin, Zoom admin

The Zoom admin role is the Zoom account admin role, and it is not a role in ServiceNow.
