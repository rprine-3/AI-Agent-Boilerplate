# Configure the AI widget builder

Configure the AI widget builder in EmployeeWorks Web App. Set the scope, the role access, and the chat panel that drives widget generation.

## Before you begin

Activate Employee Slate \(built for Now Assist\) in the instance.

An Oasis for Creator license for any admin who uses the AI chat panel.

Role required: admin.

## About this task

The AI widget builder lets admins describe a widget in plain language. The builder generates the widget code, validates it, and compiles it before preview.

The landing card lists the widgets in the instance. Admins can search, filter custom widgets from default widgets, edit a widget, or clone a widget.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin Console** &gt; **All** &gt; **AI widget builder**.

    The landing card lists every widget available in the instance.

2.  Select **Global** to create widgets at the global scope, or select an application scope.

    The scope applies to every widget created from this point.

3.  Select **Create**.

    The create workflow opens with the chat panel on the left and the component and server script editor on the right.

4.  Enter a widget description in the chat panel.

    An example description is `Create a widget that creates an OTP page.`

    The skill validates, compiles, and renders the widget. The build can take 15 to 20 seconds.

5.  Set the **Element name**, the **Widget name**, the **Tag**, and the **Description**.

    Detailed property values improve the next chat prompt.

6.  Set **Chat compatibility** for the widget.

    Chat compatibility maps the widget to the output of tools used in agents and renders the widget in the interactive chat view rather than inline.

7.  Select the roles that can view and use the widget.

    Restrict the widget to admin roles when the widget operates on admin-only data.

8.  Open the component and the server script to review the generated code.

    Run quality checks and edit the code manually when needed.

9.  Provide sample inputs and select **Refresh preview**.

    Drag, drop, and resize the widget to confirm responsive behavior.

10. Enter a refinement prompt in the chat panel.

    An example refinement is `When the timer is less than 30 seconds, change the background color to red.` Accept or reject the change. Select **Undo** to revert to the prior version.

11. Select **Save**.

    The widget code, properties, chat compatibility, and role access are saved. The widget is available in the widget library.


## Result

Admins create, clone, and refine AI-powered widgets from the same builder. Each widget honors the configured scope, the chat compatibility, and the role access. Admins can review the generated code and revert any change with the undo control.
