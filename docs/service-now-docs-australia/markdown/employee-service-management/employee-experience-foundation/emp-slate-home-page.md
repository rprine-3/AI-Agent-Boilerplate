# EmployeeWorks home

Access services, tasks, and announcements from an AI-first dashboard that supports your daily work.

EmployeeWorks is an employee engagement layer that combines intelligent assistance, employee communication, organizational navigation, task management, and other employee services to boost work productivity.

Employee Slate provides a set of default widgets on the home page that surface actionable information and give employees a consolidated view.

-   Homepage displays a dashboard with widgets and shortcuts relevant to your daily work.
-   Widget content is updated to reflect current priorities, pending tasks, and relevant announcements. The page provides a starting point for accessing all the capabilities and services.

## Conversation-first experience

The homepage features a prominent AI-powered chat and search bar. Employees can interact with the chat in natural language. When employees submit the initial query, it expands into a full-page conversation view powered by ServiceNow Otto or Now Assist, capable of answering questions, submitting requests, and surfacing relevant content.

**Important:** AI-generated outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete. Review all AI-generated content before taking action.

## Home widgets

Employee Slate includes the following widgets on the home page. Use the flexible home page which auto-adjusts the layout based on the widgets count.

-   **Tasks and requests**

    Surfaces priority tasks and approvals for your employees to act directly from **Tasks and requests**. The widget highlights the top two AI-prioritized to-do items for immediate attention and action. Tasks and requests provides quick access to the full task or approval record.

-   **Employee Comms**

    Displays curated company-wide or targeted audience announcements to keep employees informed of key updates. Content appears based on article, catalog, or a custom link as a multi-item carousel. Content managers generate announcements from manual and conversational approaches.

-   **Popular Content**

    Highlights the most-viewed knowledge articles and popular catalog items for employees to self-serve. The widget ranks content by recency, relevance, and popularity. The most-viewed knowledge articles and most-requested catalog items \(up to three slots\) across the peer group appear for quick access.

-   **Quick Links**

    Provides configurable shortcuts to commonly used catalog items, KBs, and links for easy access to other portals. Administrators configure the most frequently accessed links and destinations. Employees can navigate to knowledge articles, catalog items, and external links in a new tab.

-   **Upcoming Holiday**

    Shows upcoming company holidays relevant to the employee location. The widget uses the location to display the upcoming holiday schedule.


Administrators control which widgets are available on the home page from the widget instance at **Employee Home Page** &gt; **Container**. The home page does not support arbitrary addition of custom widgets outside of the widget library managed through the console.

## Guided widget configuration

The **Home** section of the admin console lets administrators manage all default home page widgets in one place. Instead of editing widget properties directly, administrators select a widget, make changes in a dedicated page, and preview the result before saving.

-   Widget selection: The **Home** section lists the default home page widgets.
-   Live preview: Changes appear immediately in a preview panel with light/dark theme and desktop/mobile layout options.

## Suggested prompts

Suggested prompts help employees get started with common actions and queries.

-   With Otto, your admins can configure these prompts based on organizational requirements.
-   With Now Assist, your admins can configure promoted assets as prompts.
