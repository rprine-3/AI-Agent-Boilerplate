# Employee live chat overview

As an employee, you can chat directly and in real time with support agents through the Employee Center. When you initiate a chat and select a conversation topic, you are routed to the appropriate chat queue and connected to a support agent.

Connect Support is a messaging tool that enables support agents to provide real-time assistance for end users, and is automatically enabled with Employee Center. Your administrator can create multiple chat queues for different departments, such as queues for HR, IT, Payroll, or Facilities. To set up the chat queues and learn more about Connect Support, see [Connect Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_ConnectSupport.md).

**Note:**

Starting in Utah, Connect Support has been deprecated and is no longer supported or available for new activation. For similar capabilities, please move to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat. For details, see [Move from Connect Support to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/migrate-from-connect-support.md).

If no chat queues are defined, then the chat queue defaults to:

-   Virtual Agent Support
-   \( HR Service Delivery only\) HR Department Chat Queue

When you initiate a chat in the Employee Center, a pre-chat conversation is displayed with pre-chat categories. The following GIF shows an example of initiating a chat.

**Note:** These pre-chat categories are only used with live chat. If you are using Virtual Agent with Employee Center, then these pre-chat categories don't apply.

## Configuring the pre-chat categories in live chat

Your administrator can control the pre-chat categories that appear in the pre-chat conversation by adding survey choices in the appropriate configuration. For example, your administrator can configure benefits, employee relations, and travel and expense categories that route to an HR chat queue; finance and payroll categories that route to a finance chat queue.

**Note:** If the survey options are not defined, the pre-chat conversation is displayed without data.
