# Create a company event

Use company events to configure a live-streamed event.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: sn\_cd.content\_manager

For more information, see [Create a Content template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-create-content-template.md).

-   Social engagement settings enable employees to view page count, select a reaction icon, or leave a comment. See [Content engagement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-engagement.md).
