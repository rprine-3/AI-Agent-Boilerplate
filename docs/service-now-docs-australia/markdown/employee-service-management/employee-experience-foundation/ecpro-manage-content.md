## What to do next

Since you attached your content to a bundle or stage, you can launch your campaign by clicking **Publish** from the campaign. Publish only appears when at least one bundle with content is attached to the campaign, and the campaign has a title and a start time. Publishing activates all content for a selected audience and duration.

After the **Content Experiences: Update Campaign Audience** schedule job runs, the **Campaign Targets** tab shows specific employees that are part of the refined audience for the campaign content.

Click **Edit Campaign** to pause the campaign and make edits to the content, audience, or duration.

Click **Cancel Campaign** to de-activate all undelivered content \(including notifications\) to a scheduled audience. You cannot reverse this step. Canceling a campaign that has already launched de-activates all undelivered content and you cannot restart it.

Click **Deactivate Content** to remove the content from a campaign. The content does not appear for users who have not yet viewed it.
