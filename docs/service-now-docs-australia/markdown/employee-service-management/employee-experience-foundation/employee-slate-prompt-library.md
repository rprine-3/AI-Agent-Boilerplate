# EmployeeWorks Web App prompt library

Example natural-language prompts that you can use across Employee Slate features. Use these prompts in the home page chat bar, the full-page conversation view, or the contextual assistant on any page.

## About prompt library

The prompt library groups example prompts by feature area. Use the prompts as written or adapt the phrasing to your context. The assistant retains conversation context across turns, so you can refine results with follow-up prompts in the same chat.

## Cross-cutting prompt patterns

The following patterns work across multiple features. Use them when you don't know the exact phrasing, and the assistant routes the request to the right capability.

-   "Help me with..." \(open-ended; the assistant routes the request\)
-   "What can you do?"
-   "How do I...?"
-   "Find..."
-   "Show me..."
-   "Schedule..."
-   "Approve..."
-   "Cancel..."
-   "Summarize..."
-   "Switch to mobile view."
-   "Send this to my manager."

## Tips for effective prompts

-   Start with a verb, such as `Show`, `Find`, `Approve`, `Schedule`, or `Update`.
-   Include the object ID, such as `request`, `approval`, `article`, or `meeting`.
-   Add a filter when the result set could be large, such as `today`, `this week`, `by team`, or `by priority`.
-   Reference the page you're on for contextual actions, such as "approve this" or "update this ticket".
-   Ask follow-up questions in the same chat to refine results. The assistant stores conversation context across turns.
