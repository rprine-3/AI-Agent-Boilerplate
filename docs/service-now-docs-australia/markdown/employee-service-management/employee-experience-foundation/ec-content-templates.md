# Content templates

Content templates empower content creators to efficiently publish large volumes of news articles. Each template defines the article layout, publishing schedule, destination, and target audience. By associating a news article with a content template, the system automatically generates publish plans, which reduces the effort required to publish content.

Your instance includes two out of the box templates with a set duration of 90 days and an audience of all active users.

-   Featured News: Delivers news to widgets in the portal Home page, News Center, and mobile app.
-   News Default: Delivers news to widgets in the portal Home page and News Center.

**Note:** If you insert a news widget onto a portal page that doesn't already have one configured out-of-the-box, you must create a new content destination to include that page in a content template.

To view a graphic that displays where the News widgets appear, see [News articles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-news-articles.md).

To view the templates, navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Publishing** &gt; **Content Templates** &gt; **View All**.

**Note:** Updating a content template does not impact existing publish plans that use that template.

## Creating a Content template

A user with the sn\_cd.content\_template\_owner role creates a content template to define the article layout, publishing location, and audience. For more information, see [Create a Content template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-create-content-template.md).

## Using Content templates

Content authors can use a content template when creating a News article. Depending on the template configurations, the template provides the following pre-defined components:

-   Article layout
-   Publishing destination \(mobile or portal widget\)
-   Audience
-   Content category
-   Social engagement activities

When the content author clicks **Save** or **Save and continue**, the system auto-generates publish plans.

A Content template can be modified, even if it is associated with a News article. Changes to a Content template will not impact the existing publish plans for News articles.
