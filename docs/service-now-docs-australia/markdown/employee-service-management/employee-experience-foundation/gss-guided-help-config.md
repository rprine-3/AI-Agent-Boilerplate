# Configure Guided Self-Service

</table>4.  Click **Save** or **Submit**.

    Related tabs Available For, Not Available For, and Assigned Topics appear.

    **Note:** By default, only sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin user role can add GSS to the topics and topic persona users \(such as Topic Managers and Contributors\) can't add GSS to the assigned topics.



5.  On the Assign Topics tab, click **Add**, select the topic, and click **OK**.

    **Note:** When you assign the guided process to a subtopic, the help process appears on the topic page and its parent topics. For example, in `Human resources > Benefits`, when a Guided Self-Service is assigned to a subtopic Benefits, the guided self-service appears on its parent topic also.

6.  On the **Available For** and **Not Available For** tab, select the users, groups, roles, and more.

    User criterion is defined for Guided Self-Service.

    **Note:** When a user or user group doesn't have permission to a catalog or a KB article, the `You do not have access to this item` message appears. You can contact the admin for permissions.

7.  Click **Save** or **Update**.

    Remember, you can't configure multiple questions within a single questionnaire.

    **Note:** The incomplete selections are cancelled daily by a schedule job.


## What to do next

Click the **Edit in Process Automation Designer** button to define and publish the process for the Guided Self-Service after you create the process. Proceed to edit the playbook from **Workflow Studio**.

**Note:** Ensure you mark the guided process and playbook active. Only when you activate the GSS process, the **Add** button is displayed on the Assigned Topics.
