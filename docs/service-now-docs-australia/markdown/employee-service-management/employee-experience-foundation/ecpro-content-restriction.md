# Content Ownership

Define who has permission to create content, where they can publish it, and which employees can view it.

Content Ownership enables system admins and content admins to designate exclusive access to certain Content Publishing features to specific content managers.

Content Ownership gives control over three areas of Content Publishing:

-   Who sees the content \(Audience\)
-   Where can a content manager publish content \(Topic or Page\)
-   What content can the content manager create \(Content item\)

    **Note:** Content Managers can create audiences. To enable this, the Allow Ownership for Audiences option must be turned off. If the Ownership Property is enabled, the Content Manager will not have permission to create audiences. See, [Create an auidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-audiences.md).

</table>## Impact on roles

-   System admin \(admin\) has total control and visibility into Content Publishing and Content Experiences during and after restriction set up.
-   Content Administrators \(sn\_cd.content\_admin\) have full and complete access to add, edit, and publish content within the restricted areas and functions for Employee Center Pro.
-   Content Managers \(sn\_cd.content\_manager\) have restricted access to authoring and publishing capabilities. Review the tables below to understand how content managers access to audiences, pages, topic, and content items changes when a user or group is assigned to the record.

    The following graphic shows a content manager's access permissions to a record based in whether they are assigned to that record or not.

    **Note:** These access permission changes apply only when a record is assigned to at least one user or group. If a record does not have an assignment, it is accessible to all content managers.

## Activating Content Ownership

The following plug-ins are required:

-   Employee Center Pro
-   Content Publishing
-   Content Governance \(only required if using Content Governance features\)
-   Content Experiences \(only required if using Content Experiences features\)

**Note:** For more information on activating the above plug-ins, see [Employee Center plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/install-plugins.md) and [Install Employee Center Pro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/install-ec-pro.md).

After activating the required plug-ins, enable the Content Manager Ownership properties. See [Properties installed with Content Publishing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/properties-with-content-delivery.md). When the Content Manager Ownership properties are enabled, Content Ownership related lists appear in records for audiences, content items, topics, and portal pages.
