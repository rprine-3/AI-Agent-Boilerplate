# Campaign bundle triggers

Define a trigger to make the content in the campaign stage available to employees.

A campaign bundle organizes and manages the delivery of campaign content. When configuring a bundle, you set the bundle trigger, which determines when content becomes available and for how long.

**Note:** The interface use the terms "bundle" and "stage" interchangeably.

</td><td>

The content is visible to the audience immediately after campaign publication, for the duration of the campaign.[Create a campaign stage with immediate trigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/create-stage-immediate-trigger.md)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Fixed date

</td><td>

The content becomes available according to a specific start and end date and time and within the start and end date and time of the campaign.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Recurring

</td><td>

Use to create a campaign stage \(bundle\) that has date-based repeatable content.

</td></tr><tr><td>

To-do completion

</td><td>

The content in this campaign stage becomes available when a user completes a specific to-do item from another stage in the campaign.[Create a campaign stage with to-do trigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/create-stage-to-do-trigger.md)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Dynamic

</td><td>

The campaign stage triggers when a field in a table \(sn\_hr\_core\_profile or sys\_user\) fulfills a specific condition. An example use case for this trigger type is a new hire campaign, where each stage contains onboarding content for each week and delivers the content based on the employment start date.**Note:** The dynamic stage trigger will show content only one time. To configure a stage that is triggered on a repetitive basis, such as on an annual basis, use the recurring trigger.

Condition

</td><td>

This trigger type is specifically for Employee Journeys: Parental Leave of Absence. You can use it for your process, but it is an advanced feature that requires building a triggering mechanism, such as a business rule or scripting.[Create a campaign stage with condition trigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/create-stage-condition-trigger.md)
