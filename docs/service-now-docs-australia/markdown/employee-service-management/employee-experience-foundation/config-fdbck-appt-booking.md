# Configure feedback for appointment booking

Create a feedback definition for appointment booking so employees can provide feedback for completed appointments.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin

## About this task

The appointment booking experience already contains two feedback definitions for Employee Center Pro and Employee Center Pro Kiosk.

You can modify the feedback definitions provided with the plugin, or create your own. For more information about the feedback feature, see [Integrated experience and service feedback](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ex-fdback-ovrvw.md).

You can modify the number of times a user can submit feedback in a single session by configuring the **Overlay session limit** field in the feedback configuration. The **Overlay session limit** value is set to 5 by default. For more information about feedback configurations, see [Set up the feedback configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/config-employee-ex-fdbck.md).

If you create a custom feedback definition for appointment booking, ensure that you deactivate other feedback definitions that are on the same portal.
