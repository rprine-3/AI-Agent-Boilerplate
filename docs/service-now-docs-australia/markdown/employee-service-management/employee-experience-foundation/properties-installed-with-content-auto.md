# Properties installed with Content Experiences

The Content Experiences \[sn\_ca\] plugin adds properties that determine how a campaign runs related to scheduled jobs and performance.

To access Content Experiences properties, navigate to **Content Experiences** &gt; **Configurations** &gt; **Properties**.

Content Experiences properties determine how the scheduled jobs run and help to ensure that there is limited impact on the performance of your instance.

**Note:** Properties with an asterisk \(\*\) in front of the name indicates that the default values are recommendations when the number of users targeted is 100,000 or less. If your audience is over 100,000 and the scheduled jobs run longer than expected, you can try increasing the values.

|Property|Usage|
|--------|-----|
|All approvers must approve any schedule content record to publish it \(sn\_ca.all\_must\_approve\)|Indicates that all approvers must approve any scheduled content prior to publishing it. If you check **No**, only one approver is required to publish a campaign.|
