# Create a Content template

A content template is pre-defined publishing plan for news articles. Create a content template to enable content authors to create and publish higher volumes of news article content.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_admin or sn\_cd.content\_template\_owner

-   The following content destinations are available out-of-the-box:

    -   All News: the news feed widget on the News Center page
    -   Featured News: the Featured News widget on the top of the News Center page
    -   Featured News Mobile: the news section on the mobile app
    -   Latest News Home Page: the news widget on the portal Home page
    -   Other News: the news feed widget on the article detail page
    To publish to a different page and widget, create a custom content destination. See [Add content destination](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-add-content-destination.md).

-   Define the audience. See [Create an audience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-audiences.md).
-   Define content categories to tag the news articles, such as company news, pay and benefits, or industry news. See [Create a content category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-cat.md).
-   Define the article layout with a reusable article template. See [Create a news article template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-create-news-template.md).
-   Enable and configure Content engagement features. See [Content engagement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-engagement.md).

## About this task

The steps below guide you in creating a content template based on the form that appears when you navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Publishing** &gt; **Content Templates** &gt; **Create New**.

If you instead navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Publishing** &gt; **Content Templates** &gt; **View All** then click **New**, the form has the same fields but with different field names. Also, that form does not provide the ability to add a content destination, audience, or content categories to the template. Instead, you define a Content template record, then open the Content template to add the content destination, audience, or content categories.

**Note:** The Content template must have a defined content destination and audience to appear as an option in the Content Library **Publish** tab.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Publishing** &gt; **Content Templates** &gt; **Create New**.

2.  Fill in the fields on the form.
