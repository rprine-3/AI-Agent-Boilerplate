# Outlook Actionable Messages compatibility for surveys

Survey definitions must be compatible with Outlook Actionable Messages \(OAM\) to display surveys in the Microsoft Outlook application.

## Conditions for OAM compatibility

The survey definition must meet the following conditions to be compatible with OAM.

-   Outlook Actionable Messages must be selected in the survey definition. For more information, see [Modify a survey definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ModifySurveyDefinitions.md).
-   The survey must be active and published.
-   The survey must not contain image scale questions with other question types. For more information, see [Survey question data types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_SurveyQuestionDataTypes.md).
-   The survey can only contain one image scale question.

**Note:** If the survey contains more questions than the value of the **sn\_ms\_oam.feedback\_survey\_question\_count** system property, the survey opens on the portal specified in the **sn\_ms\_oam.portal.suffix** property. For more information, see [Configure system properties to update the survey question limit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/configure-survey-question-limit.md).
