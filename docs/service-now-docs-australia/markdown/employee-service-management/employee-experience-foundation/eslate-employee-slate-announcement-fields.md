</table>## Content priority levels

To create an announcement through chat, see [Conversational authoring for announcements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/eslate-conversational-authoring-announcements.md).

|Priority level|Behavior|
|--------------|--------|
|**Critical**|Highest priority level. Critical announcements appear first in the carousel, but newer high-priority content can still appear ahead of older critical content.|
|**High**|High priority level. Balances with content freshness to determine position in the carousel.|
|**Medium**|Default priority level for announcements created from existing content.|
|**Low**|Lowest priority level. Low-priority announcements typically appear later in the carousel unless they are very recent.|
