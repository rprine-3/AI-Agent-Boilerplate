## Company News &amp; Events AI Agent overview

The **Company News &amp; Events AI Agent** helps users stay informed by sharing the latest updates on news, events, and announcements.

It understands general questions like "What’s the latest news?" or "Are there any upcoming events?". You can also ask casual questions like "show me New York news" or "what's happening in Atlanta this month," and also specific questions such as "Get the latest news on 401k," "Show me events happening in New York," or "Show local news."

On prompting, it also provides updates based on the user’s location and their interests. Shows nearby events, local news stories, company updates, and news related to relevant people or topics the user cares about.

The agent helps users stay informed at all levels, from local to global.
