# Add a Video with the Rich Content Editor

Use the **Rich Content Editor** canvas to add videos in your content.

## Before you begin

Create the page layout using modules or columns.

-   Modules are predefined content layouts comprised of header, paragraph text, and images. See [Add predefined content layouts with the Rich Content Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/add-modules-rich-content-editor.md)

-   HTML5

    **Note:** Hover-text or tool tips aren't supported for HTML5 at this time.

-   YouTube

    **Note:** You must configure a content provider to use videos from a video streaming service. See [Video hosting integrations framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/content-providers.md).

## What to do next

-   \(Optional\) Translate your content.

    Request language translation for your content. For more information, see [Multilingual support in the Content Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-switch-language.md).

    **Note:** Only translate content after you are done modifying the content. For best results, we do not recommend that you add or remove components or change the formatting after translation.

    To create rich content that is formatted differently in different languages, duplicate the content and modify the formatting as needed. Then, use Audiences to target the content to users by language. See [Audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-audience.md)

-   Preview your content from the **Publish** tab.

    **Note:** Content Preview is designed to provide a general idea of how your content looks. Content may look different once published due to variations in device resolution, theme difference, or mobile app style configuration.

-   Configure a publish plan to control where the content is delivered, the audience, and the period of time it is available: [Create a publish plan for your content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-library-publish2.md).
