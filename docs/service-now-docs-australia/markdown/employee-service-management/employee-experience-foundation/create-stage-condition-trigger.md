This trigger is for Employee Journeys.

## About this task

**Note:** Some parts of the interface use the term "bundles" to refer to stages.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Experiences** &gt; **Content Experience Builder**.

2.  Select the campaign and click the **Schedule of content** tab or click **Next**.
