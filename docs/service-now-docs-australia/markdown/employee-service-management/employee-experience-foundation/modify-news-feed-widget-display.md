# Modify the News feed widget

The News feed widget displays articles on company news and announcements. All news, Other news, and Related news are instances of the News feed widget.

## Before you begin

Role required: sp\_admin or admin

Learn more about the news widgets: [News articles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-news-articles.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Employee Center**.

    The Employee Center home page is displayed.

2.  Press and hold the control key, right-select the News feed widget, and then select **Instance Options**.

3.  Configure the widget:

    **Note:**

    Admins have an additional configuration option to enable or disable a degraded or normal experience for the News Feed Widget to help during high traffic events.

    News can be directed to other widget instances, provided that the content is published within the News Feed widget. The targeted news will automatically appear on the designated widget, eliminating the task of configuring any content assigned to that widget.
