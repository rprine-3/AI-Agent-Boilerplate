# Add Text or a Text section with the Rich Content Editor

Use the Rich Content Editor canvas to add **Text** or a **Text section** in your content.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_manager

Create the page layout using modules or columns.

-   Modules are predefined content layouts comprised of header, paragraph text, and images. See [Add predefined content layouts with the Rich Content Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/add-modules-rich-content-editor.md)
-   Columns are containers that enable you to define a custom layout. See [Add columns with the Rich Content Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-rich-content-canvas.md)

## About this task

-   **Text** provides the tools to format and arrange text.
-   **Text section** provides the tools to format and arrange text and an area to add a headline.

    **Note:** For **Text section**, the headline, text, and container settings are configured separately.


When you copy and paste formatted content into the Rich Content Editor, the content retains its original formatting and appears in a new text box. Alternatively, you can use the browser toolbar option **Edit** &gt; **Paste and Match Style** to paste the content as plain text, matching the formatting of the destination text box.

Pasting behavior:

-   Clicking into the text box and pasting: The content appears at the cursor's position.
-   Selecting the entire text box and pasting: The content appears in a new text box underneath

    **Note:** Content Managers and Admins have the option to apply background colors to selected canvas elements, including images. Available features include the use of solid and gradient colors, as well as adjustments for color opacity. These settings can be accessed in the right-hand panel under the Settings Styling tab when adding rich content to a canvas element.


## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the canvas by selecting the **Open editor** button from the **Design** tab of the **New content** form.

2.  From the **Blocks** column, use a drag-and-drop method to move a **Text** or **Text section** block to your canvas.

3.  Enter text or text and a headline depending on what component you dropped into the column.

4.  Navigate to **Settings** tab.

5.  Use any of the following styling settings:

    **Note:** When adding images, videos, or text, there are several functional and convenient styling features that help create Rich Content and News Articles. Some of the right-hand panel options include the ability to enable different backgrounds, opacities and shadows, improved cells and buttons allow additional border settings, colors and types, as well as additional text styles, colors and fonts.

## What to do next

-   \(Optional\) Translate your content.

    Request language translation for your content. For more information, see [Multilingual support in the Content Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-switch-language.md).

    **Note:** Only translate content after you are done modifying the content. For best results, we do not recommend that you add or remove components or change the formatting after translation.

    To create rich content that is formatted differently in different languages, duplicate the content and modify the formatting as needed. Then, use Audiences to target the content to users by language. See [Audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-audience.md)

-   Preview your content from the **Publish** tab.

    **Note:** Content Preview is designed to provide a general idea of how your content looks. Content may look different once published due to variations in device resolution, theme difference, or mobile app style configuration.

-   Configure a publish plan to control where the content is delivered, the audience, and the period of time it is available: [Create a publish plan for your content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-content-library-publish2.md).
