# Assign ownership of content

Assign a user or group with the content manager \(sn\_cd.content\_manager\) role to a content item so only that user or group can edit and publish the content.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cd.content\_admin

Ensure **Yes** is checked under **Allow Ownership for Content Items** under Content Publishing or Content Experiences properties. For more information, see [Properties installed with Content Experiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/properties-installed-with-content-auto.md) and [Properties installed with Content Publishing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/properties-with-content-delivery.md).

## About this task

Provide a content manager or group of managers with exclusive access to sensitive content, such as a notice of an upcoming merger or reduction of workforce.

Alternatively, use a content item as a template that can be repeatedly cloned and assigned to content owners for customization.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Content Publishing** &gt; **Content Library** &gt; **View All**.

2.  Select a topic.

3.  From the top-left menu \(\[Omitted image "menu-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: Menu icon\), select **View content record**.

    -   To assign ownership to a user, select the **Restrict content by user** tab.
    -   To assign ownership to a group, select the **Restrict content by group** tab.
4.  Click **New**.

5.  From the **User** or **Group** field, click the **Lookup using list** \(\[Omitted image "magnify-glass-outline-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon\) icon and select a user or group.

    **Note:** Only groups that have the content admin \(sn\_cd.content\_admin\) or content manager \(sn\_cd.content\_manager\) roles appear. If the members of the group have these roles, but the group does not, the group does not appear.

6.  Select **Submit**.

    After a user or group is associated with content, only that user or group can access the content when scheduling content or when adding content to a campaign. Removing the user or group makes the content accessible by all content managers.
