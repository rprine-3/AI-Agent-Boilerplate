# Enhanced Requests Experience

Improve your request management on Employee Center with the Enhanced Requests Experience that enables you to find and manage requests effectively.

In the Enhanced Requests Experience, requests are segmented by type. You get the **For you** and the **For others** tabs by default with the Enhanced Requests Experience. You can also configure other tabs as the functionality supports multiple tab interface. If the numbers of tabs exceed the screen size a **Show more requests** button displays the rest of the tabs in a list view.

You can edit the default filters **Status** and **Updated** available with the default tabs **For you** and **For others**. You can also configure new filters to the tabs as required. You can associate tabs to filters according to your organizational requirement.

**Note:** You must be on the Employee Center version 38.0 or later or have upgraded to the Australia release to use the Enhanced Requests Experience.

The default number of requests shown on one page is 15. If it exceeds 15, pagination comes into effect.

The Enhanced Requests Experience let's you create a request and keep it in your **Drafts** instead of submitting it instantly. It will sit in the **Drafts** until you're ready for submission.

**Drafts** is enabled by default. If you want to hide the **Drafts** tab, mark the system property, Enable Save as draft in esc portal \(glide.sc.enable.save\_as\_draft.portal.esc\) **false**.

The requests are displayed in a card view by default. You can the view toggle icons next to the search bar to switch between card view and list view. The toggle functionality is only available on Employee Center version 40 onwards.

Enhance the visibility of requests by using the **Filter by** option. You can only have one filtering view for one portal. Filter options can be like **Request Type**, **State**, **Location**, and so on.Known Limitations

**Important:** Keyword search in Enhanced Requests Experience searches only the table with the Source Configuration record. It does not extend to child or parent tables. For example, if you search for a Requested Item \(RITM\), related Request \(REQ\) records will not surface in the search results. Support for traversing related tables through grouping is planned for a future release.

The multiple tab interface and the filter options are configurable. For more information, see:

-   [Set up request sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/config-request-sources.md)
-   [Set up the Requests filter definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/request-filter-def.md)

The **Requests** page is available on responsive view too. The filters are displayed with a **Show more** option when it exceeds the page length.

The Enhanced Requests Experience has improved features for different personas. The experience is scalable, so that admins can create as many tabs as required.

As a manager, you can:

-   View requests created by you on behalf of the team.
-   View requests created by others for your team.
-   View requests created for your own work location, when configured.

As an employee, you can:

-   View requests you have created for yourself.
-   View requests that are created for you.
-   View requests that are created for your work location, when configured.

As an executive assistant, you can view requests that you have created for others.
