# Appointment Booking

Provide an omnichannel unified experience to your employees to schedule and manage appointments across multiple business units such as IT support, HR consultations, or other business units.

## Configuring Appointment Booking

As an administrator, you can create categories and reasons for appointments. You can also configure the communication channels for the appointment based on the user location.

You can leverage topics from the Unified Taxonomy for Employee Center to create appointment categories. For more information about Unified Taxonomy, see [Unified Taxonomy for Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/config-taxonomy.md).

The appointment booking experience leverages user criteria to display reasons that are relevant to the user. You can create new reasons and link them to location queues to use them for appointments. If you are using ITSM Walk-up Experience, you can reuse the existing reasons for appointment booking.

You can create location consent records to configure the communication channels and link them to a walk-up location queue to use them for appointment booking.

**Note:** To configure the appointment booking feature, you must install Employee Center Pro and activate ITSM Walk-up Experience. For more information about the plugins, see the following topics:
