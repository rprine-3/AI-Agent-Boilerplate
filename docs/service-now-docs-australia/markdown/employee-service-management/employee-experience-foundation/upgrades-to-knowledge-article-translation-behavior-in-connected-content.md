# Translated Knowledge Base article attachment behaviour

Use the upgraded translated Knowledge Base article attachment feature to find a Knowledge Base article in your own language on topic pages. As an admin, easily link all translated articles. As an employee, quickly find different translated versions, enhancing the navigation experience in different topic pages.

The Connected content section in the topic pages has been upgraded to accommodate easier bulk linking and removal of translated Knowledge Base articles for admin users.

With this upgrade, adding any translated version of a particular Knowledge Base article connects all its translated versions to the same topic. Similar logic applies when one of the translated articles is disassociated from the topic. In this case, all the translations for that article are automatically removed.

Any Knowledge Base article translation created after the initial linking to a topic gets automatically connected to the respective topic.

For both association and disassociation of the translated versions, notifications appear on the screen warning you of the automatic changes that were made.

</table>## Translated Knowledge Base article view on Employee Center

As an employee user, view articles in your preferred language by using the respective Employee Center settings. If the preferred language translation is not available for any article, it is visible in the default language. The default language is configured by the **glide.sys.language** system property.

The feature applies to the Recommended for you section in the Employee Center portal and Now Mobile app.
