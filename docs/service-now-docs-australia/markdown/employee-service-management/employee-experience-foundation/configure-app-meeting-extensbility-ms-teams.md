# Configure the Notify connector app to use Meeting Extensions in the Microsoft Azure portal

Configure the existing Notify connector app/bot to use Meeting Extensions in Microsoft Azure portal to fetch the incident details during the conference call in Microsoft Teams.

## Before you begin

Role required: Microsoft Azure admin

## About this task

No need to create a separate Meeting Extensions bot as the Meeting Extensions app depends on the Notify connector for Microsoft Teams app. You can configure the existing Notify connector app/bot in the Microsoft Azure portal for Meeting Extensions to have a seamless conference call experience in Microsoft Teams.

**Note:** Ensure that API permissions are configured for the Notify connector for Microsoft Teams app in the Microsoft Azure portal. For more information, see [Manage permissions and authenticate the Notify connector app/bot in Microsoft Azure portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/manage-permissions-notify.md). You must update the following changes to the existing Notify connector app in the Microsoft Azure portal.

6.  Grant admins access to the Microsoft Azure applications that require admin approval.

    1.  Select **Grant admin consent for &lt;tenant&gt;** in the API permissions page.

    2.  Select **Yes** in the Grant admin consent confirmation pop-up page.

7.  Authenticate app to receive the incoming requests from Microsoft Teams into ServiceNow® instance.
