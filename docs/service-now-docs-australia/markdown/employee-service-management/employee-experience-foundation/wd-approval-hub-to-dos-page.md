# Use task configuration for Workday approvals

Using the default To-dos configuration, you can provide the approvers with more in-context information about the approval requests for better approval workflows.

## Before you begin

To-dos configurations are based on **Pulled Integration To-do** table and show **Open** and **Completed** approvals on **My tasks**. For more information on task configuration, see [Enable task configuration for approvals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/approval-hub-to-dos-page-filters.md)

Role required: sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Go to **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **To-dos Configuration**, click an existing to-dos configuration, and navigate to the **Task Configuration** related list.

2.  Click **New** or edit an existing task configuration record such as **workday**.

3.  Understand the configuration as explained in [Enable task configuration for approvals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/approval-hub-to-dos-page-filters.md) for more contextual info about the request.
