# Configure bot ID and AI assistant

Specify the bot ID to configure Moveworks AI assistant on Employee Center portal.

## Before you begin

Confirm that you have the appropriate entitlements for the application.

**Note:** To save the page with Bot ID, verify that the your application scope is selected to ServiceNow Otto Chat Integration.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Copy the bot ID from **Moveworks** &gt; **Chat Platform** &gt; **Manage Chatbots**. For more information, see [Embedded AI Assistant Installation-ServiceNow](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/moveworks-for-web-installation-servicenow).

**Note:** You need not perform other steps or provide any REST API details.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Moveworks Assistant Setup**.

2.  Add **Bot ID** which can be found from the **Manage Chatbots** record from Moveworks.

    For detailed Bot ID instructions, see [Embedded AI Assistant Installation-ServiceNow](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/moveworks-for-web-installation-servicenow).

3.  Specify the initialization options in JSON format for Moveworks integration.

    You can configure initialization options, for example, To adjust width and height

    ```
    
    "styles": {
       "bottom": "20px",
       "right": "20px",
       "width": "400px",
       "height": "600px"
    }
    
    ```

    **Note:** The integrationId value must match the connector name on the Moveworks side for [authentication steps](https://help.moveworks.com/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-web-surfaces/moveworks-for-web/moveworks-for-web-installation-servicenow#installation-steps).

    For complete configuration with branding

    ```
    
    {"integrationId":"securitytest5"
    "styles": {
       "bottom": "30px",
       "right": "30px",
       "z_index": "9999"
    },
    "theme": {
       "primary_color": "#5550DD",
       "font_family": "Arial, sans-serif"
    }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** While installing to a **Moveworks GovCloud** instance, ignore the 'Failed to update config' error. The process installs the required assets.

    Complete the setup by following these steps:

    1.  Navigate to the `sys_properties` table and locate the `sn_ex_mw_chat_int.webchat.initialization_options` property.
    2.  Update its value to `{"serverUrl": "https://webchat.moveworksgov.com"}`.
    3.  Select **Save**.
4.  Select **Save configuration**.


## Result

The Moveworks application is ready for use. You can access the features and functionality per your role permissions.
