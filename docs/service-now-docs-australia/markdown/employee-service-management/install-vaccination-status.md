Vaccination Status admin\[sn\_imt\_vaccine.admin\]

</td><td>

Application-specific admin for Vaccination Status.Can approve COVID-19 health test results in Health and Safety Testing. **Important:** By default, the System Administrator \[admin\] role contains the sn\_imt\_vaccine.admin role. The sn\_imt\_vaccine.admin role should be reassigned to another user and then removed from the admin. This process protects sensitive application data by restricting access to the application.

</table>### Tables installed

Table

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Vaccine profile\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_vaccine\_profile\]

</td><td>

Shows which users received a COVID-19 vaccine. Users are not considered fully vaccinated until 14 days after receiving their vaccination \(single-dose vaccine\) or their final dose \(multi-dose vaccine\).

 **Note:** The COVID-19 vaccine completed column has a value of **false** until the 14-day vaccination period is complete.

 Organizations can make the vaccine complete status dependent on whether a user reported receiving a vaccine booster when it became due. If the **\[sn\_imt\_vaccine.enforce\_vaccination\_complete\_for\_booster\]** property is enabled and a booster is due, the COVID-19 vaccine completed column has a value of **false** for users who have not reported receiving their booster after the due date.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Vaccine response\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_vaccine\_response\]

</td><td>

Contains a history of all reported vaccination statuses for each user. Users can review their previously submitted vaccines in **My vaccinations**.

 Vaccine responses and their attachments are stored for the duration set by your organization's data retention policies. If the vaccine responses are deleted before the expiration date, the reported statuses and attachments are also deleted.

**Note:** Any historical data saved for use in the Vaccination Status dashboard is count data only. Any personally identifying information is removed by default and is deleted based on your organization's policy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Vaccine response definition\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_vaccine\_response\_definition\]

</td><td>

List of vaccines, including the type, manufacturer, and number of doses required. By default, this table contains several generic COVID-19 vaccines. A Vaccination Status admin can add and remove records to reflect the vaccines that are currently available to users.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Campus vaccine summary\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_campus\_vaccine\_summary\]

</td><td>

Stores vaccination data to map against data provided by the COVID-19 Global Health Data Set in the Safe Workplace Dashboard Vaccination Widget. User vaccination data is pulled from the Vaccine response table and entries are created daily based at midnight \(00:00\) instance time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Vaccine exemption requests\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_vaccine\_exemption\]

</td><td>

Lists of vaccine exemption requests, their status, the exemption type, expiration date, and their status. Vaccine exemption requests without an expiration date do not expire. Vaccine exemption requests are inactive by default.

 Managers may view the exemption requests for their direct reports in **My Employee's exemptions** if this ability is enabled by their organization.

 For more information, see [Set up Vaccination Status properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/config-vaccination-properties.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Validator service\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_validator\_service\]

</td><td>

Stores information for validator services, such as CommonTrust Network, used to verify submitted vaccine responses and their attachments.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Vaccine response attachment type\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_vaccine\_response\_attachment\_type\]

</td><td>

List of attachment types available for users to specify the type of upload they are providing. For example, the SMART health card attachment type is used with the CommonTrust Network when performing validations.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Vaccine code systems\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_vaccine\_code\_system\]

</td><td>

Lists common vaccine systems and standards used with vaccine codes to confirm the vaccine manufacturer of a user's submitted dose.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Vaccine codes\[sn\_imt\_vaccine\_vaccine\_code\]

</td><td>

Lists valid vaccine codes, such as CVX codes, obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) used to validate the manufacturer of a vaccine in a user's vaccine response. For a complete list of codes, see [COVID-19 Vaccine Related Codes](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/COVID-19-related-codes.html).**Note:** Vaccination Status provides some codes as part of the base system.
