# Add or modify document security policies

Many employee documents contain confidential and personal information. Use document security policies to define access to employee documents and ensure that they are secure.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.admin

## About this task

You can determine who can read, write, or authorize purging of documents by adding or modifying document security policies.

**Note:** You can provide employees visibility into their own employee documents through their HR profile. Check the **Employee access** box on the **Document type** form. See [Define policies for a document type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-document-management/hr-doc-management-config.md).

Users are granted access to employee documents by:

-   Groups
-   Roles
-   Both groups and roles

The security policy can require authorization to purge and requires a user to belong to a group that has purge authorization.

See [Manage HR Groups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_ManageHRGroups.md) and [Manage HR roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/c_ManageRoles.md). Or see [Groups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_ManageHRGroups.md) and [Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/c_ManageRoles.md).
