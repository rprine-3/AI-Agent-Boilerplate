# Setting up your Alumni Center

Set up your Alumni Center so you can communicate with your former employees or non-employees.

The following plugins must be activated prior to activating the Alumni Center \(sn\_asc\) plugin:

-   Human Resources Scoped App: Core \(com.sn\_hr\_core\)
-   Employee Center \(sn\_ex\_sp\)

For more information on requesting activation of a plugin, see [Request a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_RequestAPlugin.md).

To set up Alumni Center, you must request activation for the following: Explicit Roles \(com.glide.explicit\_roles\). The Alumni Center uses this plugin to help segregate external users from internal users.

**Note:** The Explicit Roles \(com.glide.explicit\_roles\) plugin must be activated before activating the Alumni Center \(sn\_asc\). For information on installing a ServiceNow Store application, see [Install a ServiceNow Store application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_InstallApplications.md).

-   **Supported task types**

    The base system supports the following task types:

    -   Collect Employee Input

    -   Mark when complete
    -   Take survey
    -   Upload documents
    -   URL
    -   View video
-   **Adding content**

    The Alumni Center uses the same widgets as the HR Service Delivery Employee Center. For more information, see [Employee Center widget instance options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/emp-center-topic-inst-options.md).

    Use Content Publishing to add and display content to your Alumni Center. For more information, see [Content Publishing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ec-publish-content.md).

    To add content as part of a campaign, use **Content Automation**. For more information, see [Working on Campaigns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-campaigns.md).

-   **Load data**

    To add alumni users in bulk, use **System Import Sets**. For more information, see [Import sets key concepts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/c_ImportSetsKeyConcepts.md).

    At a minimum, the file you upload must have a header and the personal email for each alumnus.

    **Note:** Use the Imported Alumni \[sn\_asc\_user\_imp\] table when importing users.

-   **Transform and edit**

    After loading your file:

    -   Transform your import set so that it moves to staging.
    -   Go to **Staged Alumni** to view what was loaded from your file.
    -   You can edit the loaded users, ensure unique user IDs, or approve if they look valid.
    -   From the list view of Staged Alumni, click **Import All Approved** to start the Import Approved Staged to Alumni scheduled job.
