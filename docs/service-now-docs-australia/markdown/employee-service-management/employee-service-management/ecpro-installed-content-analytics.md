# Components installed with Content Analytics

Several types of components install with the activation of the Content Analytics \[sn\_cda\] plugin, including tables, user roles, and scheduled jobs.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this feature.

**Note:** The Content Analytics \[sn\_cda\] plugin activates the sn\_cda.min\_admin\_count system property \[sys\_properties.list\]. This property prevents you from deleting your only Content Analytics admin user by requiring a minimum number \(default is two\) of active users with this role.

**Note:** A new **Enable Tracking** field has been introduced to content notifications, designed specifically for email content. Existing notification records will have this field disabled by default, in line with prior system settings and by default, existing email content will have tracking turned off. However, for new email notification contents, the **Enable Tracking**option will be available for your selection and will be automatically enabled on new record creation. This feature provides greater flexibility, allowing you to determine whether tracking should be applied to specific email content record.
