# Work on a legal matter

As a matter owner, work on a legal matter assigned to you to resolve issues or answer queries.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_matter.matter\_fulfiller

## About this task

When a legal request is promoted to a legal matter, the Privileged and Confidential status of the request determines the initial Privileged and Confidential status of the matter.

-   If the legal request has Privileged and Confidential enabled, the matter is created with Privileged and Confidential status. The matter owner can later remove the Privileged and Confidential status of the matter.
-   If the legal request has Privileged and Confidential disabled, the matter is created also has Privileged and Confidential disabled. You can enable the Privileged and Confidential status later.

The Privileged and Confidential status of a legal request and its associated matter are tracked independently. Changing the Privileged and Confidential status of a request does not automatically change the Privileged and Confidential status of the associated matter, and vice versa.

As a collaborator added to a legal matter, you can access and work on the legal matter just as matter owners can. However, you can't modify the **Matter owner**, **Assignment group**, and **Assignment group permission** fields.

**Note:** During times when you're unavailable, you can [delegate your legal duties to other users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/legal-services-delegation.md).

</table>4.  Enable privilege and confidential status.

    1.  Select **Enable Privilege and Confidential** if already not enabled.

        The enable action is available only when the matter is in the Assigned or Work in progress state. Requests in states such as Closed Complete, Closed Incomplete, or Cancelled cannot have their Privileged and Confidential status changed.

    2.  On the confirmation modal, select **Continue**.

    -   The legal matter is marked as Privileged and Confidential.
    -   The assignment group permission is automatically updated to No Access. You can manually modify the assignment group permission.
    -   In the Privileged Document Access tab, the document permissions are marked as Privileged &amp; confidential. Access to these documents for users is controlled by the Assignment group permissions.
    -   Privileged and Confidential field in the secondary header is changed to Enabled.
    -   Notifications and outbound emails from the request automatically include "privileged and confidential" markers in the email content.
    -   Stakeholders are notified when changes occur to the collaborator list, watchlist, or fulfiller assignment for a privileged and confidential enabled request.
5.  Change permission for attachments.

    The document permission is marked as Privileged &amp; confidential when the request status is set as privileged and confidential, and resets to Public when the status is removed. Access to these documents for users is controlled by the Assignment group permissions.

    1.  Navigate to **Privileged Document Access**.

        The **Privileged Document Access** tab appears when Privileged and confidential status is enabled.

    2.  Select the check box next to the document for which you want to change the permission.

    3.  Select **Manage Access**.

    4.  Select the option applicable.

        -   Privileged and Confidential – Protects documents under legal privilege and confidentiality. Use this option for sensitive communications between an attorney and client.
        -   Legal Work Product Protected – Restricts access to internal legal analysis, drafts, or investigation notes prepared in anticipation of litigation.
        -   Public – Marks documents as freely shareable externally without restrictions.
    5.  Select **Update**.

6.  Update the **Assignment Group Permission** to change the permission level of the legal matter for the assigned user group.

    -   **No Access**: Only the practice area lead, group manager, and matter owner \(user in the **Matter owner** field\) can access and work on the legal matter.
    -   **Read**: All members from the assignment group can only view the legal matter.
    -   **Edit**: All members from the assignment group can view and edit the legal matter.
    **Note:** The matter owner, practice area lead, or group manager can set the assignment group permissions on the legal matter.

7.  [Create artifacts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/add-artifact-to-legal-matter.md) \(folders\) and [attach files to a legal matter artifact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/add-files-to-artifact.md) to store the collected supporting documents within the matter.

8.  If the request must be reassigned to a new assignment group due to business needs, select a new assignment group in the **Assignment group** field.

    **Note:** Editing of the **Assignment group** field is available only when the **Editable Assignment group in Matter** [option is configured](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/associate-categories-practice-area.md) in the associated intake form.

    When the assignment group is changed, existing group members who are not in the updated assignment group might lose access to the matter. The **Matter owner** field is also cleared, and the matter owner is notified via email.

9.  If you need help from other fulfillers to work on the legal matter, add them in the **Collaborators** field.

    **Note:** Users with the matter\_fulfiller role are listed in the **Collaborators** field.

    The collaborators are notified via email that they have been added as collaborators to a legal matter.
