## About this task

\[Omitted video\] Description: Reserve a space and add workplace services.

Reserve a workplace space based on your office working hours.

Create a workplace reservation for a single day or for multiple days. Administrators can set the max days in future value in the **Reservable Module Configuration** tab. For more information, see [Configure reservation multi-day settings in Reservable Module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/rsv-config-rsv-mod-value.md).

Space and reservation planners \(sn\_wsd\_rsv.reservation\_planner\) with the dedicated role \(sn\_wsd\_rsv.bypass\_module\_validation\) can ignore or bypass certain settings in the Reservable module configuration. For more information, see [Allow Event planners to handle reservations with more flexibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/event-planner-bypass-validation-rule-overview.md).

</table>6.  Select **Recurring** to make a recurring reservation.

    When making a recurring reservation, select the most suitable recurring pattern \(Daily, Weekly, or Monthly\) based on the space availability within the recurring series.

    **Note:** Reservations in a recurring series cannot be updated in bulk. To update a reservation from a recurring series, select a reservation and edit it as required. The option to make a recurring reservation is configured by your administrator. The **Allow recurring reservations** Reservable Module configuration option should be enabled for making recurring reservations. This option is dependent on the **Max days in future** and **Max number of occurrences** value. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md). Reservations with single occurrences are converted to a single-day reservation.

    Shift-based reservable module configuration is not supported for recurring reservations.

    Calculate and set a recurring meeting pattern to define the frequency and recurrence pattern in the Add Recurrence dialog box.

    1.  Set a start date, end date, and duration \(start time and end time\) for your reservation.

        For example:

        -   Start date: Select 25/02/2026 as your reservation start date.
        -   End date: Select 23/08/2026 as your reservation end date.
        -   From: Select a start time for your reservation.

            Duration or start time and end time depends on the selected building time zone.

        -   To: Select a time when you want to end your meeting or reservation.

            The end time is based on the standard working hours \(full day\) of your office.

            **Note:** The start date is reset if you select a different start and end date in the Add recurrence dialog box. For more information, see Step c. Select the start and end dates before setting the recurrence patterns in the Add recurrence dialog box.

    2.  Select Recurring list options as required:
        -   **Daily**: Option to set daily recurring series.
        -   **Weekly on Wednesday**. This option label changes as per the weekday that you have selected as your start day. For example, selecting Wednesday as your meeting weekday shows **Weekly on Wednesday**.
        -   **Monthly on fourth Wednesday**. This option label changes as per the selected weekday. For example, selecting Wednesday as your meeting start day shows Monthly on fourth Wednesday.
        -   **Every weekday \(Monday to Friday\)**
        -   **Custom**: Customize your recurring reservation options as required for Daily, Weekly, or Monthly recurrences.
    3.  Select any of the following recurring patterns to open the Add recurrence dialog box and select the required recurring pattern:

        1.  Daily: The meeting occurs every day. You can define a repeat interval of every X days.

            \[Omitted image "add-recurrence-daily.png"\] Alt text: Daily Recurrence options showing reservation start and end date and recurrence pattern.

            1.  In the Add recurrence dialog box, confirm that the start and end dates are correct. Select the required recurrence pattern.

                Select the duration, repeat duration, and number of occurrences or date when you want to end the reservation. \[Omitted image "add-recurrence-daily-end-date.png"\] Alt text: Select duration for daily recurrence meetings.

            2.  Select **Save**.

        2.  Weekly: The meeting takes place on the same weekday each week. You can define a repeat interval of every X weeks. For example, select the following recurrence pattern for weekly or biweekly reservations.
            -   Weekly, Every 1 week on Wednesday. The meeting occurs every Wednesday starting Feb 25, 2026, ending on Aug 19, 2026 \(the last Wednesday before Aug 23\). Confirm that the start and end dates are correct. Select the required recurrence pattern.

                \[Omitted image "add-recurrence-weekly-end-date.png"\] Alt text: Select the weekly recurrence options and duration.

            -   Bi-Weekly \(Every 2 Weeks\). Every 2 weeks on a selected weekday. For example, every two weeks on Wednesday.
            -   Select **Save** after selecting the required weekly recurring pattern and duration.

                If the reservation time duration has only one occurrence in case of weekly recurring reservation, the single occurrences are converted to a single-day reservation. For example, consider a recurring reservation from 13-02-2026 to 18-02-2026 set to repeat weekly once on every Monday. Since, in this duration, there's a single Monday when the reservation is scheduled to repeat weekly, it is considered as a single-day reservation.

        3.  Monthly: Specific day of a month. For example, the last Wednesday of every 1 month. In the Add recurrence dialog box, confirm that the start and end dates are correct. Select the required recurrence pattern. You can define a repeat interval of every X month. To select a day of the month, select **On**. Select from a date range, for example **29**, **30**, **31** or **Last day**

            Day 29, 30, and 31: You can only select these days for a month, if the selected dates are available for a selected month. For example, February and April are skipped by the application if you select the date as **31**. If you set it to the **Last day** option, it selects the last day of a month automatically.

            \[Omitted image "add-recurrence-monthly-end-date.png"\] Alt text: Select the required recurrence meeting pattern and duration for monthly meetings.

        **Note:** If you select an invalid date range or invalid number of occurrences for a recurring pattern, the **Save** button is not available for selection. Reset the date range to save your changes.

    4.  Custom: Customize your recurring reservation options as required for Daily, Weekly, or Monthly recurrences.
    **Note:** If you change the start and end time duration for a reservation after setting a recurring reservation, it resets the duration for the reservation. You should add or update the recurring series and pattern again.

    **Note:** The option to set a recurring reservation pattern is also available on the My favorites page. Select a favorite space. On the Space details page, you can set a reservation to recurring.

    Consider the following when selecting a recurrence pattern. For example, select a recurring reservation from Feb 25, 2026 - August 23, 2026:

    -   Total Reservation Duration: The date range span covers approximately 179 days, which is about 25 weeks.
    -   Reservation End duration: If the pattern extends beyond the end date 23.08.26, application ends the reservation. You can choose to end the recurrence after a certain number of occurrences. The calendar doesn’t allow you to select a range beyond what is specified in the **Max number of occurrences** reservable module property configuration.
    -   If your workplace manager has enabled time-bound allocations, the workplace availability changes based on the start and end date of an allocation. For example, if you select five recurring days, and the workplace is allocated for 3 out of the five days, the availability of the workplace is 3/5. Only the first occurrence of the recurring reservation is checked for time-bound allocations.
    After you confirm the required recurring reservation pattern and save your changes, the Make a reservation portal page displays the recurring reservation duration you selected.

    To update or edit recurring reservation series, select the edit option to edit your recurring reservation.

    **Note:** Recurring series cannot be edited. You can edit a single reservation at a time and not the entire series.

7.  Select **Add Invitees**.

    This option is available when your administrator has enabled the Reservable Module property configuration **Allow attendees based search** on the Reservation Widget Configuration. This option allows employees to add attendees to a reservation and search for their availability on the Make a reservation portal page. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md) and [Add invitees as collaborators and create a reservation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/add-colleagues-rsv-search.md).

8.  Select **Search**.

    Available spaces for reservations are displayed automatically. The first building card is selected by default in the search result.

9.  The application performs auto-search for reservable items when the reservation property \(**sn\_wsd\_rsv.enable\_auto\_search**\) is enabled by your administrator.

    If an auto-search reservation property is configured by your administrator, the **Search** button is hidden on the reservation portal. The application searches for reservable locations and items automatically while creating a reservation. An auto-search is triggered when any of the following is changed or updated:

    -   Reservable module.
    -   Reservable paths.
    -   Building.
    -   Floor.
    -   Start Date.
    -   End Date.
    -   All day.
    -   Recurring \(Daily/Weekly/Monthly\).
10. Select **Refresh the results** manually to refresh the search results on the advanced reservation portal page while making a reservation.

    The reservation portal search page shows a message to refresh the page when an employee stays too long on a page or when the search results are outdated. Select **Refresh the results** to fetch the latest data.

11. Select the toggle option **Show Filters** to filter by:

    -   Minimum Capacity: Filter by space capacity.
    -   Services: Filter by Workplace Services
    -   Purposes: Filter by Location purposes.
    -   Floors: Filter by Floors for a selected building.
    Select **Apply** to apply the selected filter option.

12. Select **Alphabetically A-Z** list option to sort the workplace items in an alphabetical order \(Z-A or A-Z\).

    The **My favorites first** sort option is automatically selected if you have favorite locations. Your favorite locations are displayed first in an alphabetical order followed by the other locations that match the search criteria. You can view and perform the following actions after you set a space as favorite:

    1.  When searching for a space, you can sort the workplace items to display your favorite locations at first using the **My favorites first** sort option. By default, if you have favorite locations, the default sort option is set to **My favorites first**.

        The workplace items are sorted and all your favorite locations are displayed first in an alphabetical order.

    2.  If you're browsing for a workplace location near a person, you can sort the workplace items to display your favorite locations first using the **My favorites first** sort option.

        The favorite locations are displayed based on the proximity closest to the person's location.

    **Note:** You can’t sort workplace items in alphabetical order or by your favorite locations if you're browsing spaces near a person. The spaces near a person are searched based on proximity.

13. Select a location or locations from Search Results.

14. View search results using the **Card**, **Schedule**, or **Map** tab.

    \[Omitted image "rsv-schedule-view.png"\] Alt text: Schedule view showing locations for reservations.

            Floor names are sorted alphabetically by label, or according to the sort **Order** configured in the Floors table. For example, Floor A, Floor B, and so on. For more information about sorting order, see [Add a floor using Workplace Space Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-space-management/add-a-floor.md).

            **Note:** If the **Order** is null for all available buildings in a selected campus, then floor names are alphabetically sorted based on floor name label. For example Floor A, Floor B, and so on.

        -   Zoom in to select a building and location.

            The building names are alphabetically sorted or sorted according to the **Order** that you have configured in the Buildings table.

    -   Select a space, and then select **Add** to add a space.

        While reserving or viewing a space, the employee can see if a space is part of a neighborhood. The neighborhood icon \(\[Omitted image "neighborhood-icon.png"\] Alt text: Neighborhood icon.\) is displayed on the space card.

        If your organization is using floor maps, you can view the floor maps for a location using Indoor Mapping as your map provider.

        If you have selected the **Browse by neighborhood** option in Step 6, the reservation portal shows spaces for a neighborhood.

        **Note:** You must check in within 30 minutes before the reservation start time. If the reservation isn’t checked in within 30 minutes before the reservation start time, your reservation is canceled. An email notification is sent for the canceled reservation. The Check-in option is also available on the My Reservations page.

        If you have occupancy sensors installed in your workplace, reserved spaces are automatically checked in. When your reserved spaces are checked in automatically, a push notification is received on the Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile app.

</table>23. After reviewing the workplace services added to a reservation, you can select a new date, time, and location to update the reservation details.

24. On the Reservation Details page, select**Change date, time, or location** to update a reservation.

25. On the Update meeting room reservation page, modify the date, time, and location as required.

26. When you update a reservation, the Reservation details page shows the **Retain extra services** option to retain the services from the previous location and reservation.

    When you update or change a location, a message is shown to indicate that certain services are going to be removed. This happens when workplace services for an updated location are not available. Users are notified if the services are available for a location. The Reservation details page shows services that are available on the new location and also shows the services that aren’t available on the new location.

    Workplace services are automatically retained when the date or time changes for a reservation. But if a location is changed, or if a new location or space is added, you must select **Retain** to keep your existing workplace services. You can retain, review, or discard the proposed services. When this action is performed, the services are considered **Resolved** for that location. When all location workplace services are resolved, confirm the changes. If location workplace services aren’t resolved, a pop-up message is displayed to confirm the action.

    **Note:** In this case, if the **Allow only single service item selection** option is selected on the Workplace services page, the **Retain Services** option isn’t shown on the Reservation details page and the existing services are removed after updating the reservation details for a space \(location\). You can add new services using the **Add extra services** option as shown in step 11. For more information, see [Create a workplace service to provide an extra service for a reservation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/create-workplace-service-to-provide-extra-service.md).

</table>    -   Services are canceled if they aren’t available or applicable for a location.
    -   While updating a multi-location reservation, employees are notified after matching the workplace services from previous workplace locations.
    -   When you change an existing service or services for a reservation, the existing workplace case is canceled. A new workplace case is created as a replacement for an existing case and the workplace services are updated.
    -   A state is added to the changed service. A note is added on the new service case with the changes to the ordered services \(added, updated, removed, no changes\). For more information, see [View and track workplace cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-case-management/view-workplace-cases.md).
    -   The costs of services are shown based on the case or requested item fields.
    -   The cost is updated when a workplace service is updated.

        **Note:** The cost of service items is updated if an employee updates existing service offerings. For example, if you have not changed your extra service item but have changed the time for a reservation record, the cost of the service item is updated based on the latest pricing of the service item. If you remove a space \(location\) and the service item is also removed from a reservation record, suggested services in the **Retain Services** option show the latest pricing or cost in the reservation record.


## Result

-   Select **Reservations** &gt; **My Reservations** to view and track your reservation on the Reservation portal home page or on the Reservation summary page.
-   **Confirmed**: Reservation state to indicate that the reservation for the selected building is confirmed.

    **Note:** The **New space** state indicates that a new space is assigned due to a conflicted reservation.

    For more information, see [Auto-resolve recurring reservations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/recurring-reservations.md).


## What to do next

Review your reservation details on the Reservation Summary page.

While reserving or viewing a space, the employee can see if a space is part of a neighborhood. The neighborhood icon \(\[Omitted image "neighborhood-icon.png"\] Alt text: Neighborhood icon.\) is displayed on the space card.

-   To share the reservation details with others, perform the following actions:

    1.  On the Reservation summary page, select **Actions** &gt; **Share reservation**.

        \[Omitted image "rsv-share-reservation-form.png"\] Alt text: Share reservation details form showing options to add recipients for sharing the reservation.

    2.  In the **Send reservation details to** field, select the users that you want to share the reservation with.
    3.  In the **Include a note** field, enter a note if necessary.
    4.  Select **Send**.
    5.  When you share a reservation, invitees receive an email notification.

        \[Omitted image "wsd-shared-email-options.png"\] Alt text: Shared email notification for a reservation with Browse all spaces and Reserve a space for me navigational link options.

    6.  You can perform the following from a shared reservation email:
        -   Log in as an administrator.
        -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Emails** &gt; **Open shared reservation**.
        -   Two navigational links **Browse all spaces** and **Reserve a space for me** are shown:
            -   **Browse all spaces**: Select the **Browse all spaces** link to open the reservation portal page.

                The **Browse all spaces** link appears when the shared reservation start date falls within the configured range. This range is defined by the Max number of days for browse near a person setting. The link is shown in the shared email notification with pre-filled dates for the selected team member.

                -   The **Browse near a person** reservable path is selected by default. If this path isn’t available, the **Browse all** path is used.
                -   All the fields are pre-filled for a selected team member or a colleague.
                -   For a multi-day reservation, the first day of a multi-day reservation is prefilled. If the first day is in the past but the current date is still within the reservation time, the current date is selected. In case of multi-day reservation, consider the following:

                    -   From: The start date of your reservation.
                    -   Time: Select the start time for your reservation from the drop-down list.
                    -   To: End date of your reservation.
                    -   Time: Select the end time for your reservation from the drop-down list.
                    For more information about multi-day reservations, see [Create a multi-day reservation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/create-multi-day-reservation.md).

                **Note:** If the start day \(current date\) of a shared reservation is past the value set in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable module property, the **Browse all spaces** link doesn't show prefilled dates on the Make a reservation page. The application shows a validation error message "**Reservation date for the selected user has changed. Select a date**." You must manually select the start date and time and end date and time for a reservation.

            -   **Reserve a space for me**: When you select the **Reserve a space for me** URL link from an email, the space reserved for a colleague or team member is selected by default on the reservation portal. A reservation is created with the same start and end date and time from your previous reservation. If the start date of the reservation falls before the current date, the current date is taken as the start date of the reservation. For example, if the start date of your previous reservation is October 15, 2023 and the current date is October 17, 2023, the application uses the current date \(October 17, 2023\).

                **Note:** When making a reservation directly by using the **Reserve a space for me** navigational link option, the application ignores the value set in the **Max number of days for browse near a person** Reservable module configuration and creates a reservation.

    The reservation details are shared when a reservation is **Confirmed**. If you edit the reservation details after sharing, you’re prompted to send an email update to reservation invitees.
