# Assign a legal request

Assign a legal request to yourself or to someone in your assignment group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_ops.legal\_fulfiller

## About this task

When an employee submits a legal request, it is automatically assigned to a group or user in the legal department. The assignment is done based on the [assignment rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/create-assignment-rules-intake-form.md) configured for the intake form of the associated practice area. If the request is assigned to a legal group, any member from the group can triage the request themselves or assign it to another member of the group.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Legal Request** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center**.

2.  Select the list icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

3.  Under **Legal Requests**, select **Unassigned**.

4.  In the list of unassigned requests, open a request by clicking the request number.

5.  Update the **Assignment group permission** to change the permission level of the legal request for the users.

    -   **No Access**: Only the practice area lead, group manager, and user in the **Assigned to** field can access the legal request and assign it to one of the members in the assignment group. The assigned user can then work on the legal request.
    -   **Read**: All members from the assignment group can only view the legal request. This option is the default permission level.
    -   **Edit**: All members from the assignment group can view and work on the legal request. The Assigned To field is set to optional if this option is set.
    Assignment Group Permission field of a active Legal Request Record can be edited by:

    -   Practice area lead, Assignment group manager, Assigned to, and delegated users.
    -   Any Assignment group member, if the record is in New state or Assignment group permission is edit or Configured options have assigned\_to\_field\_not\_mandatory in it.
6.  Based on the permission option, assign the request to yourself or to another member from the assigned group.

    -   To assign the request to yourself, select **Assign to me**.
    -   To assign the request to another member, on the **Details** tab, select a user in the **Assigned to** field and select **Save**.

## Result

The state of the request updates to Assigned.

## What to do next

The assigned user can start [working on the legal request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/work-on-legal-request.md).
