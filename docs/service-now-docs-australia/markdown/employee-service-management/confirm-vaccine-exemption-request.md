# Confirm a vaccine exemption request for a user

As a Vaccination Status adminor manager, use the Employee Readiness Core Approval Portal to approve or deny a user's vaccine exemption request.

## Before you begin

Your organization must install both Health and Safety Testing and Vaccination Status to use the Approval Portal.

-   For more information on installing Health and Safety Testing, see [Install Health and Safety Testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-testing/install-health-testing.md).
-   For more information on installing Vaccination Status, see [Install Vaccination Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/install-vaccination-status.md).

Activate the **sn\_imt\_vaccine.allow\_managers\_ability\_to\_update\_vaccine\_exemption\_records** property to enable all managers to approve or deny vaccine exemption requests for their direct reports. This property assigns the sn\_imt\_core.approval\_portal\_manager role to managers and grants access to the Approval Portal for vaccine exemption requests.

Your organization must enable vaccine exemptions. Exemptions do not affect a user's **Covid 19 Vaccine Complete** status in their vaccine profile. For more information, see [Set up Vaccination Status properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/config-vaccination-properties.md).

Role required: sn\_imt\_vaccine.admin, sn\_imt\_core.approval\_portal\_manager, or sn\_imt\_core.health\_and\_safety\_approver
