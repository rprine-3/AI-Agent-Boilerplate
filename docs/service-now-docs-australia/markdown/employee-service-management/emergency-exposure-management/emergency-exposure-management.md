# Emergency Exposure Management

The ServiceNow® Emergency Exposure Management application helps identify users who might have been exposed to infectious diseases by analyzing multiple data sources such as meetings, location, shifts, Wi-Fi access logs, and badge scans of affected users.

Emergency Exposure Management provides tracing systems to use the following data sources to generate a list of potentially exposed users:

-   Microsoft Office 365 meeting invite
-   Location of the ServiceNow user profile
-   Workspace reservation
-   Badge scan log
-   Wi-Fi access log
-   Employee daily log
-   Field service task
-   Visitors log
-   Handheld or wearable device proximity sensing data

**Note:** Some of the tracing systems require you to install other Safe Workplace suite and Emergency Response Management applications. For more information, see [Tracing systems in Emergency Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-exposure-management/tracing-systems-exposure-mgnt.md).

You can also manually add users whom you know might have been potentially exposed to an affected user.

In addition to using the base system tracing systems, you can set up a tracing system that uses your own data source to identify potentially exposed users. For more information, see [Set up a tracing system for an exposure data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-exposure-management/set-up-tracing-system.md).
