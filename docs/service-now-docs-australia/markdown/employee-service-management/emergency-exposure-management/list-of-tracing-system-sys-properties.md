# System properties for tracing systems in Emergency Exposure Management

System properties associated with tracing systems that are available in the Emergency Exposure Management application.

To configure the system properties available for a tracing system, navigate to **Emergency Exposure Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Tracing Systems** and open the tracing system record.

For more information on setting up or modifying a tracing system, see [Set up a tracing system for an exposure data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-exposure-management/set-up-tracing-system.md).

## System properties for tracing systems installed with Contact Tracing

For more information, see [Setting up Contact Tracing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contact-tracing/set-up-contact-tracing.md).
