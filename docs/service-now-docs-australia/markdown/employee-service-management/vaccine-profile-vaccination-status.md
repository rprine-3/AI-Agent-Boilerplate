# Viewing vaccine profile records

Vaccine profiles contain vaccination information for vaccine admins to review, such as a user's vaccination date, whether users are exempt from receiving a vaccine, or the results of their most recent COVID-19 tests.

## Vaccine profile records

You can access vaccine profile records and view a user's booster dose due date by navigating to **All** &gt; **Vaccination Status** &gt; **Vaccine profiles**. Then you can create a record or select an existing record to review.

**Note:** You must have the Vaccine profile reader role or Vaccination Status admin role to view vaccine profile records.

In addition to the fields on the profile records, you can review additional details about a user, such as the dates for different manufacturers and doses and the status of a user's exemption request.

Vaccine Review Outcome

</td><td>

The outcome of a user's most recently reported COVID-19 vaccine. This field is updated when the vaccine was reviewed by a Vaccination Status admin, manager, or validator service. The review outcome depends on your organization's review process and system configuration. If it was reviewed, it is either approved or rejected.

**Note:** A validator service can only approve reviews or leave them in the same status as if they had not been reviewed. If the vaccine response could not be validated and approved, the response must be manually reviewed.
