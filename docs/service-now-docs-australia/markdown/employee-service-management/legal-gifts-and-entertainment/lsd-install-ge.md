# Install Gifts and Entertainment Compliance

You can install the Gifts and Entertainment Compliance application \(sn\_lg\_gifts\) if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

**Note:**

The Gifts and Entertainment Compliance application is installed automatically when you install the Legal Simple Compliance suite.

Gifts and Entertainment Compliance requires a separate subscription from the rest of the ServiceNow AI Platform.

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. When you purchase a subscription, certain plugins are activated automatically. If a paid plugin isn't activated automatically, you can manually activate it from the All Applications list in your instance.

**Note:**

Before purchasing a subscription, you can evaluate the feature on a non-production instance without charge by requesting it from the Now Support Service Catalog.

Role required: admin
