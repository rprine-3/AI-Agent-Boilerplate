# Configure the rescind process for a lifecycle event

Cancel and revert work done in a lifecycle event case with the rescind process.

The rescind process enables you to cancel and revert work done in a lifecycle event case. For example, if a new hire decides not to join the company or a job offer is revoked, you can revert work done in the onboarding case.

## Procedure

    1.  Navigate to **Lifecycle Events** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Manage Lifecycle Events**, and open a lifecycle event record.

    2.  Click the **Activity Sets** tab.

    3.  Click **Enable Rescind**.

        The rescind activity set displays on the right-hand side of the lifecycle event builder.

        **Note:** You cannot set an audience for activity sets that have a trigger type of **Rescind**.

2.  Add one or more rescind activities.

    1.  Click **Add** to add a rescind activity to the rescind activity set.

    2.  Fill in the fields on the form.
