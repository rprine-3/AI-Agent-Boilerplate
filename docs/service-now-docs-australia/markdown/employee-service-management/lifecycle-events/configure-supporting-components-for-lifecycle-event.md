# Configure the supporting components for a lifecycle event

Configure the supporting components for a lifecycle event. Lifecycle events are a collection of activities. For each activity, you must identify and configure the underlying components that support it, such as HR task templates, order guides, catalog items, and HR services. You must also identify and configure the relevant owning groups, activity types, and audience records.

-   Audiences

## Owning groups

Owning groups control who owns a lifecycle event activity. Because lifecycle events are generally cross-departmental, it's critical that ownership of each activity is assigned to the appropriate group, such as for HR, IT, or Facilities. Each owning group is responsible for overseeing the activities that fall under their purview. See [Configure an owning group for a lifecycle event](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/lifecycle-events/configure-lifecycle-event-owning-group.md) for more information.

To create, update, or delete an activity, you must be both a member of the associated owning group and have the sn\_hr\_le.activity\_writer role. For example, only members of the HR activity writers owning group with the sn\_hr\_le.activity\_writer role can configure an HR activity.

## Activity types

Lifecycle event activities can be approvals, employee activities, fulfiller activities, notifications, and more. Depending on the activity type, you must configure the appropriate components that underlie it.

A key benefit of the Enterprise Onboarding and Transitions application is that you can reuse existing components and processes. These components and processes include existing HR services, HR task templates, or catalog items. For each activity, determine whether there’s an existing component that you can use or if you must configure a new one.

</table>## Audiences

Not all lifecycle event activities are required for all employees. Some activities are intended for a target audience. You can use audience records to define the criteria that the subject person of a lifecycle event case must meet for the activity to trigger on their behalf. For more information, see [Audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-audience.md).

Clearly defined audience criteria enable you to create targeted workflows for different audience types. For example, you can create a tailored onboarding experience for newly hired employees depending on whether the employee is office-based or remote.

**Note:**

-   If an activity isn't associated with an audience record, then the activity triggers for all employees.
-   If a subject person doesn't meet the audience criteria defined for an activity set during the evaluation process, the **State** field in the corresponding activity set is set to **Skipped**.

Create or modify a schedule content template to deliver content as part of a lifecycle event. Each template must be associated with the Schedule Content \[sn\_cd\_content\_visibility\] table, and you can configure the template for mobile content, portal content, notification content, or to-do content.
