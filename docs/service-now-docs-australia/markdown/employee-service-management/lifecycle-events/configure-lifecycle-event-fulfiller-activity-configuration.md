# Configure an activity configuration for a lifecycle event

Create or modify an activity configuration to define the fulfillment process and conditions for closure for a lifecycle event activity.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_le.admin or sn\_hr\_le.activity\_set\_manager

A key benefit of the Enterprise Onboarding and Transitions application is that you can leverage existing fulfillment processes from different departments to fulfill lifecycle event activities that are assigned to them. For example, you can use a fulfillment process set up by the IT department to fulfill lifecycle event activities assigned to IT. Preconfigured activity types are available to use. You can also configure your own custom activity types.

2.  Click **New** or open a record.
