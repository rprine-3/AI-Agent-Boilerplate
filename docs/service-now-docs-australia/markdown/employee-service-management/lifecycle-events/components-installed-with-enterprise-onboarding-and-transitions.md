# Components installed with Lifecycle Events

Several types of components install with the activation of the Human Resources Scoped App: Lifecycle Events \[com.sn\_hr\_lifecycle\_events\] plugin, including tables and user roles.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this feature, and it’s used in some related example tasks.

**Note:** The Human Resources Scoped App: Lifecycle Events \[com.sn\_hr\_lifecycle\_events\] plugin activates the sn\_hr\_le.min\_admin\_count system property \[sys\_properties.list\]. This property helps to prevent you from deleting your only Enterprise Onboarding and Transition admin user by requiring a minimum number \(the default is two\) of active users with this role.

</table>**Important:** After the Lifecycle Events plugin is installed, the Lifecycle Events administrator \(sn\_hr\_le.admin\) role is automatically assigned to the IT system administrator \(admin\) role. Use the admin role to assign the sn\_hr\_le.admin role to at least two users in your organization. If one of the two users is deactivated in the future, the user that remains active can reassign the sn\_hr\_le.admin role to other people in your organization.

After the sn\_hr\_le.admin role has been assigned, remove the role from the admin role to suppress the IT system administrator from viewing sensitive HR information. The removal of the sn\_hr\_le.admin role from admin role ensures that only the Lifecycle Events administrator has access to the sensitive information.

For more information about the process to remove an HR administrator role from the admin role, see [Remove HR Administrator role from IT System Administrators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_HRRemoveAdminRole.md).

The Lifecycle Events administrator \(sn\_hr\_le.admin\) role with the Delegated Developer \(delegated\_developer\) role can also configure and create COEs. For more information, see [HR Centers of Excellence data model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-centers-of-excellence-coes.md).

You can assign these roles to the appropriate roles, groups, or users in your application.

-   To assign a role to another role, see [Add a role to an existing role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddARoleToAnExistingRole.md).
-   To assign a role to a group, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).
-   To assign a role to a user, see [Assign a role to a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignARoleToAUser.md).
