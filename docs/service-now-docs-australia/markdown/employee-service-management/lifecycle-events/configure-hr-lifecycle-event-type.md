# Configure a lifecycle event

Build a lifecycle event and its associated activity sets and activities with the lifecycle event builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_le.admin or sn\_hr\_le.activity\_set\_manager

Begin by defining the event type, such as new hire onboarding. Each lifecycle event has one or more activity sets, which represent different stages in the lifecycle event process. And each activity set has one or more activities, which can be requests for approvals, tasks for employees, activities for fulfillers, or the sending of notifications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Lifecycle Events** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Manage Lifecycle Events**.

2.  Click **New** or open a record.

3.  Fill in the fields on the form.

\(Employee Center only\) Option to show the activity sets timeline on the HR ticket page to the subject person of the lifecycle event case. This is a two-part process. In addition to selecting the box here, you must also select **Show case to subject person** for the HR service that the lifecycle event is associated with. To select the latter, see [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md).**Note:**

-   If **Show case to subject person** for the corresponding HR service is not selected, then the activity sets timeline will not display for the subject person.
-   The progress bar for each activity set does not appear for the subject person. It only appears for the opened for person.
-   The HR ticket page is where users can view the details of an HR case in the Employee Service Center. See [Standard Ticket Page view for HR Service Delivery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/ur-hr-standard-ticket-page.md) for more information.
