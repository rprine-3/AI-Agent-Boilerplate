# Configure a lifecycle event activity

Create or modify a lifecycle event activity. Lifecycle Events activities can be approvals, employee tasks, fulfiller activities, notifications, flows, content, or activity containers.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_le.activity\_writer and membership in the owning group that owns the activity.

Each activity must be associated with an owning group. If the activity has a targeted audience, you can use audience records to define the conditions or criteria that the subject person of a lifecycle event case must meet for the activity to trigger on their behalf. Each activity is associated with a single activity set.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Lifecycle Events** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Manage Lifecycle Events**, and open a record.

2.  Click the **Activity Sets** tab to access the lifecycle event builder.

3.  Create a new or modify an existing activity.

    -   To create a new activity, click **Add Activity**.
    -   To modify an existing activity, hover over the activity and click **Edit Activity**.
    \[Omitted image "le-builder-config-activities-brand2.png"\] Alt text: Use the lifecycle event builder to create new or modify existing activities.

4.  On the Activity form, set the **Activity type** field to one of the following:

    -   Approval
    -   Employee task
    -   Fulfiller activity
    -   Notification
    -   Flow
    -   Content
    -   Activity container
    -   Pulse survey
    For each activity type, follow the applicable task.

    **Warning:** An LE activity \(fulfiller activity\) for an HR service that has the same LE type as the LE case can cause a loop that could cause a memory issue.

## Flow activity parameters

Use flow activity parameters on a lifecycle event activity to automatically populate values from a subflow within an activity.

You can configure subflows for a lifecycle event and pass the values for the input parameters of the subflow within the activity.

Having the ability to call any subflow from a lifecycle event activity provides you with a low code or no code configuration.

Calling subflows from a lifecycle event activity provides an enterprise-wide workflow you can use to interact with third-party applications at a specific point in a lifecycle event.

For more information, see [Flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flows.md).

### Use cases

You can use flow activity parameters for:

## Moving an activity within an activity set

There are multiple ways you can move an activity within an activity set.

The different methods are:

-   The drag-and-drop feature enables you to move an activity within an activity set or to another activity set.
-   Use the reorder pop-up on an activity and select where you want the activity to reside.
-   Edit the activity and select and save a new activity set or enter a new display order number to reorder an activity within an activity set.
-   You cannot reorder a request activity.

    **Note:** Requests have a grey background around the request card for easier identification.

-   You cannot move an activity above a request activity.
-   If you use the \[Omitted image "le-reorder-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lifecycle event reorder icon to move an activity to another activity set, by default it moves it to the top position of the activity set below any request activities.

### Reorder a life cycle event activity

You can reorder an activity within an activity set for a lifecycle event using different methods.

#### Before you begin

Role required: admin

#### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Lifecycle Events** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Manage Lifecycle Events**.

2.  Select a lifecycle event.

3.  Select the **Activity Sets** tab.

4.  Drag and drop an activity to move it within the same activity set or to another activity set.

    **Note:** The ordering numbers change automatically.

5.  To move an activity, select the Reorder icon \(\[Omitted image "le-reorder-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lifecycle event reorder icon from an activity.

    **Note:** If you use the Reorder icon to move an activity to another activity set, by default it moves it to the top position of the activity set below any request activities.

6.  A reorder pop-up appears.

    \[Omitted image "le-reorder-activity-brand2.png"\] Alt text: Lifecycle event activity - Reorder

7.  Select a choice with your mouse and release.

    **Note:** The ordering numbers change automatically.

8.  Another way to edit an activity is to select the Edit Activity icon \(\[Omitted image "le-edit-activity-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lifecycle event - Edit Activity icon\) on an activity.

    The activity appears in a separate window.\[Omitted image "le-edit-activity-brand2.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow Journey Designer editing Manage Lifecycle Event - Onboarding demo, showing Account Setup and Notification activity configuration with title, description, owning group, and flow details.

9.  Edit the **Activity set** and **Display order** fields to change the activity set the activity belongs to and the order it appears.

    **Note:** Requests cannot be reordered.

10. Select **Update**.


## Triggering an activity from upstream activities

For a lifecycle event case, you can trigger or create an activity from an activity that is in another activity set.

Activities in later activity sets can be created based on survey responses in earlier activity sets and for users other than the person the case was created for \(subject person\).

You can create an activity that has a task type of Collect Employee Input and based on the results, another activity is created. In this example, the activity that has a task type of Collect Employee Input is the upstream activity. The activity that is created from this is the downstream activity.

Previously, only the Subject person could answer questions from an activity with a task type of Collect Employee Input \(survey\). For an New Hire Onboarding lifecycle event, the Subject person might not have access to the survey yet. Now, the Opened for, Subject person, or Assigned to can take the survey. This keeps the lifecycle event moving.

-   **Upstream survey creates downstream survey**

    For example, a lifecycle event activity can task a manager with taking a survey.

    -   The survey asks a hiring manager if their new employees require special equipment.
    -   The hiring manager can answer the survey indicating if the new hires require special equipment.
    -   If the answer is yes, a new survey can be created in a downstream activity set that asks what specific safety equipment are required.
    -   Anyone that has access to the original lifecycle event case can answer the second survey requesting specific safety equipment for the new hires.
    -   To configure this activity, associate an HR template that has an HR task type of **Collect Employee Input**. For more information, see [Configure an HR task template]() and [Adding an HR task to an HR case]().
    -   -   **System property**

    The sn\_hr\_core.create\_new\_survey\_instances system property determines if new survey instances are created with each survey task even when an existing survey instance for the same user exists.

    The default value is **True** and indicates multiple survey instances can be created.

    If the value is **False**, when an existing survey instance for the same survey and same user exists, the survey is attached to the survey task.
