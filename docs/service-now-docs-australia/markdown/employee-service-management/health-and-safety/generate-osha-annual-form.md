## Before you begin

Ensure that the following conditions are met.

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.compliance\_manager

## About this task

The OSHA 300 Log and 300A Summary forms are generated per establishment per year.

For the PDF export format, the system uses the saved PDF templates for OSHA 300 and 300A forms and fills them with the values from the recordable injury and illness reports.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the incident management icon \(\[Omitted image "list-icon-hs.png"\] Alt text: Incident Management icon.\) and navigate to the **Lists** tab.

3.  In the **Lists** tab, under the **Injury / illnesses** list, open a report list.

    -   For reports marked as recordable, select **Recordable**.
    -   For all reports, select **All**.
4.  For the injury and illness reports, review the **Recordable** column.

5.  Select **Generate OSHA forms**.

6.  In the Generate OSHA form dialog box, fill in the fields.
