<table id="table_vqh_rvv_z3c"><thead><tr><th>

Field

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

NFPA health hazard rating

</td><td>

Numerical rating \(0-4\) from the National Fire Protection Association that indicates how dangerous a chemical is to human health. 0 means normal material with no hazard, while 4 means a substance that can be lethal even with brief exposure.**Note:** NFPA \(National Fire Protection Association\) is primarily used by emergency responders. It is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

NFPA instability / reactivity hazard rating

</td><td>

Numerical rating \(0-4\) that indicates how easily a chemical can explode or undergo dangerous chemical reactions. 0 means the substance is normally stable, while 4 means it can readily explode at normal temperatures and pressures.**Note:** NFPA \(National Fire Protection Association\) is primarily used by emergency responders. It is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HMIS health hazard rating

</td><td>

Numerical rating \(0-4\) from the Hazardous Materials Identification System that indicates health risks from chemical exposure. Similar to NFPA but specifically designed for workplace safety programs. 0 means minimal hazard, while 4 means severe hazard that can cause death or major injury.**Note:** HMIS \(Hazardous Materials Identification System\) is designed for workplace or facility use. HMIS is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HMIS instability / reactivity hazard rating

</td><td>

Numerical rating \(0-4\) that shows how unstable or reactive a chemical is under normal conditions. 0 means the chemical is stable, while 4 means it can explode or polymerize violently.**Note:** HMIS \(Hazardous Materials Identification System\) is designed for workplace or facility use. HMIS is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

NFPA flammability hazard rating

</td><td>

Numerical rating \(0-4\) indicating how easily a substance can catch fire. 0 means materials that won't burn under normal conditions, while 4 means extremely flammable gases or very volatile liquids.**Note:** NFPA \(National Fire Protection Association\) is primarily used by emergency responders. It is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

NFPA special hazards

</td><td>

Special symbols that indicate unusual hazards not covered by the numerical ratings. Common symbols include "W" \(reacts dangerously with water\), "OXY" \(oxidizer\), and "COR" \(corrosive\).**Note:** NFPA \(National Fire Protection Association\) is primarily used by emergency responders. It is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HMIS flammability hazard rating

</td><td>

Numerical rating \(0-4\) showing fire hazard levels in workplace settings. 0 means materials that won't burn, while 4 means extremely flammable materials.**Note:** HMIS \(Hazardous Materials Identification System\) is designed for workplace or facility use. HMIS is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HMIS personal protection

</td><td>

Letter code that indicates what personal protective equipment \(PPE\) workers should wear when handling the chemical. For example, in our provided list "B" means safety glasses and gloves, and "H" means full face shield, apron, and gloves.**Note:** HMIS \(Hazardous Materials Identification System\) is designed for workplace or facility use. HMIS is a standardized labeling system used in North America.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HMIS chronic health hazard

</td><td>

Indicator that flags chemicals causing long-term health effects from repeated exposure, such as cancer, organ damage, or reproductive harm. This is separate from immediate/acute hazards.**Note:** HMIS \(Hazardous Materials Identification System\) is designed for workplace or facility use. HMIS is a standardized labeling system used in North America.
