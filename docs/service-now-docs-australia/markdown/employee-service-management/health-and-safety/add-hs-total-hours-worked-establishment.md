# Add total hours worked for an establishment

Add the total hours worked for an establishment annually.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.compliance\_manager

## About this task

**Note:** The annual total hours information is used for auto-filing the total hours worked by employees in a year when exporting the injury and illness reports for an establishment, for example OSHA 300A form. When the total hours information is not available for a year in the **Annual information** tab, the system uses the default value from the **Total hours worked** system property in the exported report. For more information, see [Property to set employee hours worked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/configure-hs-property-hours-worked.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the incident management icon \(\[Omitted image "list-icon-hs.png"\] Alt text: Incident Management icon.\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, under the **Establishments** list, select **All**.

4.  Select to open the establishment record to add the total hours worked to.

5.  In the **Annual information** tab, select **New**.

6.  In the **Year** field, enter the year to add the total hours for and select **Save**.

    The **Periodic total work hours** tab appears for the year.

7.  In the **Periodic total work hours** tab, add the hours worked for each time period in the year.

    1.  Select **New**.

    2.  Select start date and end date for the period.

    3.  In the **Total hours worked** field, enter the total hours worked for the selected period.

    4.  Select **Save**.

8.  Repeat step 7 to add the required number of periods and their hours worked.

9.  Select **Save**.


## Result

-   All periodic hours logged for a year are listed in the **Periodic total work hours** tab of the year.
-   All periodic hours for a year add up to the annual total hours worked for that year. The total hours worked for a year are listed in the **Total hours worked** column under the **Annual information** tab.
