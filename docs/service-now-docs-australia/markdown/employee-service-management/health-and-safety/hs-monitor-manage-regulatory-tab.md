# Monitor and manage the Regulatory list for a chemical substance

Use the Regulatory tab on a chemical substance record to quickly assess regulatory conformance status, review regulations, and track upcoming and overdue regulatory obligations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_chm.manager

## About this task

The **Regulatory** tab provides a visual summary of a chemical substance’s regulatory conformance status. It displays a timeline of regulatory dates, compliance and overdue metrics, and a grouped list of regulations organized by regulatory list. Regulations fetched from the 3E server are read-only. Regulations created manually are editable.

The regulatory tab shows the conformance status through the regulatory list timeline, compliance, incoming, and overdue cards, and the regulations by regulatory list section.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select **Environmental Management** \(\[Omitted image "icon-hs-envt-mgmt.png"\] Alt text: environmental management\) icon.

3.  In the **Chemical substance** list, select **All** and then open a record.

4.  Select the **Regulatory** tab.

    The tab displays cards that summarize the current regulatory compliance status.

5.  To retrieve the latest regulatory data from the 3E server, select **Sync Regulatory list**.

    For more information, see [Sync regulatory list regulations for a chemical substance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-sync-regulatory-list-chemical-substance.md).

6.  Review the regulatory status and metrics using the following cards:

    |Cards|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Regulatory list timeline|Timeline that displays regulations organized by in-force date, spanning past and future dates. Regulation clusters appear as numbered icons on the timeline.|
    |Compliance|Chart showing the distribution of regulations by compliance status. The number inside the chart shows the total regulation count. Select a segment to drill down to a filtered list of regulations by that status.|
    |Incoming|Count of regulations with an upcoming in-force date that have not yet been reviewed.|
    |Overdue|Count of regulations whose in-force date has passed and that have not been marked as compliant.|
    |Regulations by Regulatory List|Regulations grouped by regulatory list.|

7.  Use the filter and sort controls to refine the regulations displayed.

    When the regulatory list is retrieved from 3E, the **Compliance** field is set to **Non-compliant** by default.
