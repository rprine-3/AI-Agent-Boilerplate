# Add actions for safety inspections survey in Mobile Agent app

Learn how to use the Mobile Agent app to create actions for an inspection survey in online or offline mode.

## Before you begin

Verify the following conditions:

-   The system properties for the offline mode behavior of the mobile application are configured. For more information, see .
-   The offline mode for the Mobile Agent app on your mobile device is turned on. For more information, see [Offline mode for Mobile Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-health-safety-mobile.md).
-   The **glide.sg.offline.scheduled\_download.enabled** system property for scheduled offline caching is set. If the property is not set, manually update cache before you go offline. To update cache, navigate to **Settings** and tap **Update Cache**. This ensures that the survey is downloaded and it's ready for you to complete.
