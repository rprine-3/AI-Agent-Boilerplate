# Submit a chemical request for approval

A chemical manager reviews a chemical request received from the employee and submits it for approval by the approver.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_chm.manager or approver

## About this task

The approver is selected based on the location entered in the chemical request. The approver is assigned for that location in the approval flow configuration. For more information on setting up the approval flow, see [Configure the chemical request approver based on location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-configure-approver-by-location.md). If no configuration exists for the selected location, the approver name defaults to the Chemical manager user for approval.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  In the primary navigation, select **Environmental Management** \(\[Omitted image "icon-hs-envt-mgmt.png"\] Alt text: environmental management\) icon.

3.  Select a chemical request with the pending review status.

4.  In the **Chemical requests** list, select **All**.

5.  In the **Details** tab, review the information provided by the chemical requester to ensure that it is correct and complete any missing details.

    For example, the **Manufacturer** field enables you to update the manufacturer name or use the **Attach file** option to attach a safety data sheet \(SDS\).

6.  In the **Assigned to** field, select the approver.

    The names in the **Assigned to** field appears based on the approval flow that is configured for the location in the chemical request.

7.  Select **Save**.

8.  Select the **Submit for approval** button.


## Result

-   The approver list can be viewed in the **Approvers** tab of the chemical request record.
-   The approver assigned to the chemical request can view this request under **My Tasks** in the Employee Center for approval.
