# Contract and amendment requests

Contract Management Pro supports initiation of self-served contract requests, non-self-served contract requests, and amendment requests

The main difference between self-served and non-self-served contract requests is the use of own paper or third-party paper for generating contract documents.

## Self-served contract requests

Self-served contract requests are fulfilled using the contract templates that are based on the company's own paper. Using contract templates, you save time and the manual work of filling out contract documents or standard letters from again for each request. In addition, contract templates ensure that the company’s contract guidelines are followed maintaining consistency. For example, you can create a contract template for a non-disclosure agreement to generate a non-disclosure agreement contract document. For more information, see [Use self-served contract request]().

## Non-self-served contract requests

Non-self-served contract requests don’t use contract templates to generate contract documents but you can submit third-party paper contract documents for review. You don't need to create and configure any contract templates for third-party paper contract requests. Non-self-served contract requests support review of multiple contract and supporting documents from a single request. For more information, see [Use non-self-served contract request]().

## Amendment requests

Amendment requests enable you to amend an existing contract by adding, removing, or updating terms, without the need to replace the entire contract.

The amendment workflow supports both own-paper and third-party amendment requests. While submitting an amendment request, you can select the **Type of paper** from the intake form.

For more information, see [Contract amendments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-amend-landing.md).

You can initiate an amendment request from your workspace using the **Initiate contract** modal.

**Note:** Third-party amendments are supported only for single contract types.

## Distinguish contract and amendment request

The field, **Request type**, differentiates contract and amendment requests. For amendment request the value is **Amendment** and for contract request it’s **New contract**.

The Request type field is displayed in the contract details and list view pages making it easy to differentiate between the two request types.

This field is also available in the following base system configurations \(when demo data is installed\) to indicate whether the configuration applies to a contract or an amendment request:
