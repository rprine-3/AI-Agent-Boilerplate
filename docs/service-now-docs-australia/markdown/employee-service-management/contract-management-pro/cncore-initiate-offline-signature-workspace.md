# Initiate an offline signature for a contract request

Initiate an offline signature when a contract has been signed outside Contract Management Pro and record the signed document in Contract Management Pro.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

**Note:** The **Initiate offline signature** option is not available for wet signature and electronic signature. For more information, see [Send a contract document for signature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-send-doc-signature.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your workspace.

2.  Open the contract request where the signature type is offline signature.

3.  Select **Initiate offline signature**.

4.  In the confirmation message, select **Initiate**.


## Result

-   The contract request state updates to **Awaiting signature**.
-   Signature request emails are not sent to the signatories.
-   The status of all signatories is set to **Pending**.

From this state, only the **Upload signed contracts** and **Cancel signature** actions are available.

For offline signatures, you don't need to select signatories while uploading the signed contract. For more information, see [Upload a signed contract document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-upload-doc-wsignature.md).

To cancel the offline signature process, see [Cancel the signature process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-cancel-a-manual-signature.md).
