# Contract request State and Contract document status in Contract Management Pro

Contract requests follow a specific life cycle and move through a series of states in Contract Management Pro. The contract request state and the contract document status are displayed in the State and the Contract status fields on the request record.

For a contract request you can see the following:

-   State: Indicating the state of the contract request.
-   Contract status: Indicating the status of the contract document.

    **Note:** For cumulative approvals in the multiple-document scenario, the approval status of latest revision is considered for populating the contract status.
