# Signature workflow for a contract request

Contract Management Pro supports electronic signature, wet \(manual\) signature, and offline signature for a contract request.

-   Electronic signature: Signatories can sign the contract document electronically. For more information, see [Configure an e-signature provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-integrate-esign.md).

    To generate a certificate of completion, you must select the **Electronic Signature** as signature type in the contract request. For more information, see [Activate a system property to generate a certificate of completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-system-prop-COC.md).

-   Wet signature: Signatories can sign the contract document manually. You can then upload the signed document to a contract request. For more information, see [Upload a signed contract document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-upload-doc-wsignature.md).
-   Offline signature: Records a contract that has been signed outside Contract Management Pro. Signature request emails are not sent to the signatories. The fulfiller or contract user uploads the signed document directly.

## Electronic signature workflow

-   Send the finalized document to the signatories for signing.
    -   The state and contract status update to Awaiting Signature and the electronic signature flow is triggered as configured in [Configure an e-signature provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-integrate-esign.md).
    -   An email notification that the contract document is available for signature is sent to the first signatory. The email contains a link to the contract document that the signatory can open and sign the document through the Docusign or Adobe Acrobat Sign electronic signature provider.

        Signatories receive signature request emails according to the order set in the signatories tab.

        You can assign the same signing order to multiple signatories when you want them to sign the contract simultaneously. Signatories with the same signing order receive signature requests at the same time and can complete their signatures independently. For more information, see [Modify the signing order for signatories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-set-signing-order.md).

    -   The signatory fields—such as Name, Title, and Email—are not pre-filled in the contract document before it is sent for signature. These fields are populated by the electronic signature provider when the signatory accesses the document to sign it.
-   Signatories can sign or decline the contract document.

If there is more than one signatory, the contract document is sent to the next signatory in the order.

The status of the current signatory in the request updates from Pending to Completed. The status of the next signatory updates from Not Started to Pending.

-   After the last signatory signs the document, the contract repository record is created and the signed document is attached to it.

For contract requests containing multiple contract documents, the signed contract document is split into individual documents and attached to the contract repository record for the respective contract type.

The state of the requests updates to Contract Signed.

</td><td>

-   One or more signatories choose to do a wet signature instead of an electronic signature.
-   The wet signed contract document in PDF format is shared with the contract fulfiller.
-   The contract fulfiller uploads the signed document, selects the signatories who have shared the wet signed contract document and continues the signature workflow by sending the document to the next signatories.

The status of the signatory in the request updates from Pending to Completed. The status of the next signatory updates from Not Started to Pending. The signature type is updated to Mixed signature after all the signatories have signed the document.

-   After the last signatory signs the document, the contract repository record is automatically created and the signed document is attached to it.

For contract requests containing multiple contract documents, the signed contract document is split into individual documents and attached to the contract repository record for the respective contract type.

The state of the requests updates to Contract Signed.

 An email notification is sent to the contract fulfiller informing them that the signature request could not be delivered.

 A notification appears on the contract request informing about the undelivered signature request and the available actions for the fulfiller.

-   For Docusign, you can update the signatory's information and retry, cancel the signature process to restart it, or upload a manually signed contract.
-   For Adobe Acrobat Sign, you can cancel the signature process to restart it, or upload a manually signed contract.

The contract document is resent for signature.

</td><td>

For contract request fulfilled by the contract user: A contract user can submit a change request. The contract fulfiller works on the change request and sends the updated document back to the contract requester. The updated contract document is sent for signature by the contract user.

 For contract request fulfilled by contract fulfiller: The contract fulfiller creates a document revision manually or by using the **Regenerate** option and resends the document for signature.

</table>    **Note:** When signatory roles are enabled, each signatory participates in the electronic signature workflow according to their assigned role. For information about available roles and how to enable them, see [Signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-signatory-roles.md).

    If the system property **sn\_cm\_core.enable\_executed\_contract\_audit\_certificate** is set to true, the certificate of completion is generated and attached to the contract repository record.


## Wet signature workflow

-   Send the finalized document to the signatories for signing.
    -   The state and contract status are updated to Awaiting signature.
    -   An email notification is sent to the first signatory in order and the contract documents are attached as PDFs in the email.

        The current signatory is placed in the To field of the email. The CC field includes the contract fulfiller, the person who opened the contract, and the person for whom the contract was requested. It also includes the initiator of the send for signature action.

-   Signatories accept or decline the document.

 For non-self-served contracts, the state of the request and the contract status updates to Contract signed. To close the contract request, select **Close complete**.

 For more information, see [Upload a signed contract document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-upload-doc-wsignature.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:** In the wet signature workflow, only signatories with the Signer role participate. Signatories with Viewer, Receiver, or Approver roles are not included. For more information, see [Signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-signatory-roles.md).


## Changing the signature type from e-signature to wet signature

Wet signature supports only Signer role and sequential signing. If you change the signature type from electronic signature to wet signature:

-   Signatories with Viewer, Receiver, or Approver roles are removed.
-   Signatories with the same signing order are assigned sequential signing order, and any gaps in the signing order are removed.

A message notifies you of these changes so that you can review the Signatories tab before continuing with the signature workflow.

## Offline signature workflow

Use the offline signature workflow when the contract is signed outside Contract Management Pro. For example, the parties physically sign the contract document or through a third-party application, and to record the signed document against the contract request.

-   Set up a contract request for offline signature.
    -   Create a contract request with **Offline signature** selected as the signature type.
    -   On an existing contract request, change the signature type from **Electronic signature** or **Wet signature** to **Offline signature**.
-   The fulfiller or contract user selects **Initiate offline signature**.
-   The state and contract status update to Awaiting signature. Signature request emails are not sent to the signatories.
-   The signatories sign the contract document outside Contract Management Pro.
-   The contract fulfiller uploads the signed document.
-   The state and contract status update to Contract signed. The status of all signatories updates from Pending to Completed.

## Modify signatories when the signature workflow is in progress

The **Modify Signatories** option enables you to add, remove, edit, or reorder pending signatories while a signature workflow is in progress. Initiating this action pauses the signature workflow for a duration defined by the system property **maximum\_signature\_pause\_duration**. To continue the signature workflow after making changes, use the **Resume Signature** option to resume the workflow.

The workflow can progress as follows:

-   Select **Modify Signatories** to modify the signatories.
-   Add, remove, modify, or reorder signatories.

    **Note:**

    -   For signature block-based contract templates, you can add, modify, remove, and reorder actions, whereas for participant based templates, only modify and reorder actions are enabled.
    -   The Modify signatories option is available in the wet signature workflow and the electronic signature workflow with Docusign electronic signature provider integration.
-   Select **Resume signature** to resume the signature workflow after modifications are complete.

    **Note:** If the signature workflow is not resumed within the configured time duration, any changes made to the signatories are reverted, and the signature workflow resumes from its previous state.

-   Signature request email notifications are sent to the signatories.
-   After the last signatory signs the document, the contract repository record is created and the signed document is attached to it.

For more information, see [Modify signatories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-pause-signature.md) and [Resend signature request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-resend-sign-req.md).

## Contract document access

Access to a contract document is based on the following user roles and conditions:

-   A contract fulfiller can view and update contract documents.
-   Only a contract administrator can delete contract documents.
-   Requesters can view only the contract documents for which they submitted the contract request.
-   Users added to the watch list can view only contract documents for contract requests they have added.

While generating the contract repository record, mapped fields and their values are validated for data type and correctness. If validation errors are found, an email notification is sent to the contract fulfiller. The email also displays the list of fields that have not been copied into the final contract document and the link to the contract repository record. The fulfiller then opens the record using the link and corrects the values to resolve the validation errors.
