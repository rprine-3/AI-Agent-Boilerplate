## About this task

Use the **Modify signatories** option to pause the signature process when you want to add, modify, reorder or remove a signatory. If the signature process is not resumed within the configured time duration \(as defined by the system property **maximum\_signature\_pause\_duration**\), any changes made to the signatories are automatically reverted, and the signature process resumes from its previous state.

-   You can select the option to modify signatories only when the contract request is in Awaiting signature state.
-   You can only remove, modify, or reorder signatories who have not yet signed the contract document.
-   When the signature process is paused, signatories with pending signature task will not be able to access the contract document from the already received signature request email.
-   For signature block based contract requests, you can perform add modify, remove and reorder actions.
-   For participant based contract requests, you can only perform modify and reorder actions.
