# Initiate an amendment request

Initiate an amendment request from your workspace.

## About this task

A sample workflow while submitting on an amendment request would be:

1.  Initiate an amendment request from the workspace using the Initiate contract option.
2.  Enter amendment details and submit the request.

The initiated amendment is assigned according to an assignment rule or manually by a contract fulfiller or a group manager. The contract administrator can modify the assignment rule to specify the group to which the contract request should be assigned.

## Before you begin

-   Amendment requests can only be submitted for contracts in the Active state. If a contract is in Draft state and Awaiting Review substate, manually approve it before submitting an amendment request. For more information on how to approve a contract, see [Approve contracts to allow amendments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-approve-draft-cntr.md).
-   Verify that the initiate contract button has been added to your workspace. For more information, see [Add a workspace action button for initiating a contract request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-initiate-cont.md).
-   To copy field values from the parent contract request to the amendment request, configure the ContractManagementExt extension point. For more information, see [Copy fields from parent request to amendment request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-cpy-fld-parent-amedreq.md).
-   Verify you have a contract configuration with the request type set as amendment to copy values from amendment request to the contract repository. For more information, see [Create a contract configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-contract-config.md).
-   Verify you have a contract template rule to identify the amendment document template to be used for generating the contract document for an amendment request. For more information, see [Configure contract template rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-template-rules.md).
