# Search in contract metadata

Ask question in the ServiceNow Otto panel to search for information related to contract fields.

## Before you begin

The Contract Management Pro - Prime plugin \(sn\_cm\_ai\_prime\) must be installed to use AI capabilities.

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

Conversational search enables you to find information by searching across contract fields using natural language queries. When you ask questions about structured information—such as vendor names, contract dates, payment terms, or contract status —the system searches the contract metadata and returns matching contract records. By default the search results display the following columns:

-   Number
-   Contract model
-   Vendor
-   Start date
-   End date
-   State

You can customize the columns to be displayed by using the **Personalize fields** option under the **More Actions** icon \(\[Omitted image "agent-workspace-more-ui-actions-icon.jpg"\] Alt text: More actions icon\)\). The columns you configure are also included when you export the search results.

Contract fulfillers and assignment group managers with the sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller and now\_assist\_panel\_user role can view the agentic workflow conversation in the ServiceNow Otto panel.

**Note:** The agentic workflow isn’t supported in the Virtual Agent panel.

For feature limitations, see [AI capabilities in Contract Management Pro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-exp-now-assist-land.md).

## Procedure

2.  Enter a query in the ServiceNow Otto panel.

    3.  Select the **Download** option.

7.  Perform in-document search after viewing contract field search results.

    After viewing contract field search results, the system asks whether you want to search within the contract documents. Select **Yes** to search within contract documents. The system displays matching results with AI reasoning. Previously shown contract field search results remain visible above the new document search results.
