# Activate Analytics Pack for Contract Management Pro

You can activate the Analytics Pack for Contract Management Pro plugin \(com.sn\_cm\_pa\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

Activate the full, subscription version of Performance Analytics on the instance where you're activating this Platform Analytics Solution. You can activate Performance Analytics on a non-production instance without purchasing a subscription. For more information, see [Activate your Performance Analytics subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_PremiumPerformanceAnalytics.md).

Review the [Analytics Pack for Contract Management Pro](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/88191096438402100a899afecab8f219) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.

**Note:**

Before purchasing a subscription, you can evaluate the feature on a non-production instance without charge by requesting it from the Now Support Service Catalog.

Role required: admin
