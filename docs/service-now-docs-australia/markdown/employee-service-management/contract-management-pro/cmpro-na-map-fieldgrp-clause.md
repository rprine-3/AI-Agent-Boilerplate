# Map a field group to a clause

Map field groups of a use case to clauses of a clause library. AI uses the mapped clause content to display suggestions for a missing or non-standard clause.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have active clauses in the clause library.

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_config, sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** to access the **AI Skills** tab of the AI Admin Hub console.

2.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **CM Pro**.

3.  Select **Activate skill** on the skill you want to activate.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-NA-skills.png"\] Alt text: AI skills available for Contract Management Pro.

4.  In the General details page, view the skill details and select **Save and continue**.

5.  In the Use case page, select **Save and continue**.

    For more information on creating a use case, see [Create use cases for contract analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-na-usecase-ca.md).

6.  In the Clause mappings page, select **New clause mapping**.
