# Define an internal signatory rule

Define an internal signatory rule to map signatories to a template using signatory mappings.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_admin and sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## About this task

If you want the variables related to a contract request to be available in the condition builder, add the contract request reference to your application table. For more information, see [Enable contract request fields in condition builders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-add-cmr-condtion-build.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Contracts Core** &gt; **Contracts Administration** &gt; **Internal Signatory Rules**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_nbm_c44_bhb"><thead><tr><th>

5.  In the **Signers Mappings** section, select **New**.

    1.  In the **Participant** field, select a participant.

        **Note:** If signature blocks are configured for the contract template, this field isn't available.

    2.  In the **Signer** field, select a user from the list.

    3.  In the **Role** field, select the role for the signatory.

        **Note:** The **Role** field is visible for signature block-based contract templates only and when the **sn\_cm\_core.enable\_docusign\_signature\_roles** system property is set to `true`. To enable this property, see [Enable signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-enable-signatory-roles.md). For more information about signatory roles, see [Signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-signatory-roles.md).

    4.  Select **Submit**.

6.  Select **Update**.

    **Note:** When more than one internal signatory rule is applicable, the signatory rule with the lowest order is considered.


## Result

An internal signatory rule is created to map a user as an internal signatory for the corresponding contract template.

**Note:** During signatory assignment for contract based on own paper, the **Internal Signatory** rule takes precedence.

-   A user from **Signers mappings** is picked as a signatory.
-   For contract templates configured with participants, when a participant does not meet the **Internal Signatory** rule criteria, a signatory is picked from the user field mapping of the participant list in the template.
-   While creating the signer task for an internal user, check whether the user's legal name is available in the user's employee profile. If no value is provided in the **Legal Name** field, use the user name from the Users \[sys\_user\] table. For more information, see [Employee Profile form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/employee-profile-fieldconfig.md).
-   When no data is found, an empty signatory record is created that can update with the correct signatory details.
