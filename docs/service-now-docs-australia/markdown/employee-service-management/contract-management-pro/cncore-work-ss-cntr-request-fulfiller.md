# Work on requests as a contract fulfiller

Review and finalize a contract document according to the contract request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fullfiller

## About this task

A self-served contract request can be worked on by a contract user. However a contract fulfiller can get assigned to the request by an assignment rule or by a group manager. A contract fulfiller can work on the contract request but can also initiate ad-hoc approvals and create revisions manually, whereas a contract user can't initiate ad-hoc approvals or create revisions manually.

You cannot add the same user to the Assigned to and Collaborator fields.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your workspace.

2.  Open the contract request that is assigned to you or if you're a collaborator on the contract request.

3.  Work on the contract request.
