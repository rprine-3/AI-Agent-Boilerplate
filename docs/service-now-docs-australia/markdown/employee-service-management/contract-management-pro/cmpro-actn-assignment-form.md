# Action assignment form

Learn about the fields of the Action Assignment form. Use this form to add the New action button to your workspace.

Use the action assignment form to define a action button in your workspace and map it to the built-in action that initiates a contract request. For more information, see [Add a workspace action button for initiating a contract request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-initiate-cont.md).

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Action label|Label that appears on the button created through the action. For example: Initiate Contract|
|Action name|Name for your action that appears in the action assignment list. For example, `initiate_contract`.|
|Application|Application of the workspace for which the action is added. Example: To add action to Source-to-Pay workspace, select Source-to-Pay Workspace.|
|Table|Application table to which the action will be associated to. Example: To associate action to the Sourtable that stores requests to source for supplier products, select Sourcing Request \[sn\_shop\_sourcing\_activity\]|
|View|View of the form on which the action button is displayed.|
