Schedule type of the obligation tasks.-   **Adhoc**

Obligation must be fulfilled once or at irregular intervals. You must create obligation tasks manually.

-   **Recurring**

Obligation must be fulfilled regularly at a defined interval. Obligation tasks are automatically created based on the interval specified in the **Repeats** field and according to the value in the **Task creation lead time \(days\)** field.

Repeats

</td><td>

This field appears only when **Recurring** is selected from the **Schedule** field.

 **Note:** For monthly or yearly repeats, the first obligation task is due on the selected date and recurring obligation tasks are due on the same day of the month or year as the initial value. For example, if you select 2024-08-10 as the **Due date** value, the first obligation task will be due on the 10th of August 2024 and the subsequent tasks will be due on the 10th day of the month in the specified interval or on that date every year. If you select the 31st day of a month as the **Due date** value, the obligation tasks for months with less than 31 days will be due on the last day of that month.

 The available values are:

-   **Daily** - Obligation tasks are created daily and are due every day between the start date and end date of the obligation record.
-   **Weekly** - Obligation tasks are created every week. The value in the **Repeats** field that appears when this value is selected determines the days of the week when the obligation tasks should be fulfilled.
