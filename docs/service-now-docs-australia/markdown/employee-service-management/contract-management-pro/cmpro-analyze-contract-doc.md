# Analyze a contract document

Analyze a contract document with generative AI to identify non-standard and missing clauses. You can do this task by using the ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro application.

## Before you begin

Verify that AI has data access for your role. For more information, see [Configure data permissions for AI skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-conf-roles-skills.md).

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

-   As an assigned-to collaborator or group manager with the sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller role, you can initiate a AI analysis for a contract document when the contract request is in the Work in progress state.
-   The analysis is run on the latest revision of the contract document.
-   Only documents in Microsoft Word \(.docx\) and PDF formats can be analyzed. For more information on the document limitations, see [Limitations in Document Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/hard-limits-in-doc-intel.md).
-   For contract documents that are in a PDF format, you can run the AI analysis but you can't act on a suggestion.

**Note:** Be sure to review the AI-generated analysis for accuracy.

## Procedure

1.  Open the contract request from the workspace that you’re using.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    1.  The AI application creates a copy of the documents and starts analysis on the new documents. The contract analysis state is now Analysis in progress.
    2.  A card is created for each document in Analyzed contracts with the AI contextual panel. The contract status updates to the Awaiting review.
    3.  When the analysis of the documents is complete, the state changes to Ready for review with the following details:

        |Section|Description|
        |-------|-----------|
        |Pending reviews|Displays the number of deviations reported and pending for review.|
        |Completed|Displays the number of reviewed deviations that have been reviewed and any actions taken.|

5.  Select the document card to view the details of the analysis.

    The details of the contract analysis are displayed with the reasons for marking a clause non-standard.

6.  Review the suggestions and provide feedback to help improve the accuracy of AI contract analysis over time.

    1.  For each suggestion, select the thumbs up icon \[Omitted image "thumbs-up-outline-24.svg"\] if the suggestion is helpful or the thumbs down icon \[Omitted image "thumbs-down-outline-24.svg"\] if the suggestion is not helpful.

    2.  In the pop-up, select the options that best describe your experience.

        You can select multiple options and add optional comments.

    3.  Select **Submit**.

    The feedback is captured in the Contracts Gen AI Feedback \[sn\_cm\_gen\_ai\_feedback\] table.

7.  Go to the analyzed contracts in the AI contextual side panel by selecting **Back**.

    You can only view the suggestions in the contextual side panel. To act on a suggestion, open a .docx Microsoft Word document and use the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts.
