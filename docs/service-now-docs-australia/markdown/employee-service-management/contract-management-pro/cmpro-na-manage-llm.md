Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_admin

## About this task

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).

In ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro, you can select the LLM provider at the use case level. This selected LLM is applicable only for the use case and overrides the LLM selected at the skill level.
