## Result

After all signatories have signed, the contract document is uploaded to the contract request. A contract repository record is created and the signed contract document is attached to it.

For wet and mixed signatures, an email with the attached final contract document is sent to the signatories. For offline signatures, no email is sent.

For own paper contracts, the state of the request updates to **Closed complete** and the contract status updates to **Contract signed**.

For third-party contracts, the state of the request and the contract status updates to **Contract signed**. To close the contract request, select **Close complete**.
