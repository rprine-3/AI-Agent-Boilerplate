# Configuring user access and data permissions for agentic workflows

Configure the security controls to specify the users who can discover or use the agentic workflow, and provide data permissions for the agentic workflow.

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

In ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro, the following roles are configured with the base system to provide data access to the agentic workflows in Contract Management Pro.

-   sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller
-   sn\_lg\_cnt.contract\_fulfiller
-   sn\_lg\_ops.request\_fulfiller
-   sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller
-   contract\_manager
-   sn\_lg\_cnt.contract\_owner
-   sn\_cm\_obligation.obligation\_fulfiller

To ensure that the agentic workflow can access all the required information for your workspace, add the necessary roles for the agentic workflow in the AI Agent Studio.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Select the **Agentic workflows** tab.
3.  Open the agentic workflow for which you want to configure the security controls.
4.  In the guided setup, navigate to **Define security controls** to define the security access.
    1.  In the **Define user access** tab, add the user roles who can discover or invoke the agentic workflow.
    2.  In the **Define data access** tab, add the user roles to define which roles the agentic workflow uses to access data during its execution.

        This configuration controls what information the agentic workflow can read, update, or share, based on the permissions of the selected roles.
