    -   **Deactivate**

        Deactivate an expected response mapping to temporarily make it unavailable for the skill.

        The **Reactivate** options appears when a expected response mapping is deactivated. Use this option to activate a expected response mapping.

        Delete an expected response mapping when it is no longer required for the skill.
