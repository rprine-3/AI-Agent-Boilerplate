# Create an updated contract document revision after modifying a self-served contract request \(starting Contract Management Pro 1.2.1\)

When a contract request is modified, sync the contract document for self-served requests to create revision of the document with updated metadata and signatories while retaining the changes made in the previous version of the contact document.

## About this task

**Note:** The **Sync document** option is available starting with Contract Management Pro version 1.2.1.

You can sync a contract document only when the contract request is in the Work in progress state.

**Note:** Tables aren’t updated when you use the **Sync document** option. You must regenerate the document to update the tables. For more information, see [Regenerate contract document after modifying request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-regen-contract-doc.md).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller or sn\_cm\_core.contract\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your workspace.

2.  Open the contract request.

3.  Select the **Contracts documents** tab.

4.  Select **Sync document**.
