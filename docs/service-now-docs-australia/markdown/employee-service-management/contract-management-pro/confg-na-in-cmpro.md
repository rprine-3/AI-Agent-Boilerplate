# Configure AI capabilities

As an AI administrator, configure ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro so that contract fulfillers can use the AI capabilities while working on contract documents or search the contracts for information from the ServiceNow Otto panel.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the application is in Global or ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro scope.

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_admin

## About this task

Use the AI Admin Hub console to configure ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro. The console contains everything that you need to configure the AI skills. For more information, see [Overview tab in AI Admin Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configuring-now-assist.md).

The following skills are available for Contract Management Pro in the AI Admin Hub console:

-   Contract metadata extraction
-   Contract obligation extraction
-   Contract analysis

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).
