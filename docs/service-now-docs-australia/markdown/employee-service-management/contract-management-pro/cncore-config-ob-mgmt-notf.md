# Configure Obligation Management notifications

Activate Obligation Management notifications to notify users when an obligation task is created, assigned, submitted, approved, or rejected.

## About this task

The Approval Request and Approval Rejected, notifications are triggered when an obligation task is submitted for approval and the obligation task is approved or rejected.

To avoid duplicate notifications for an event, the following notifications are not activated by default:

-   Obligation task submitted
-   Obligation task approved
-   Obligation task rejected

You can activate the notifications specific to obligation tasks and then set up a condition to stop the default system notifications.

For more information about obligation-related notifications, see [Obligation Management notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-ob-mgmt-notification.md).
