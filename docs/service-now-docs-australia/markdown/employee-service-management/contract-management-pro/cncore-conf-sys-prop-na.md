# Configure system properties for contract metadata extraction

Configure system properties to specify whether the contract metadata extraction should be automatically initiated or manually.

## About this task

The sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.cmpro\_initiate\_metadata\_extraction system property defines how the contract metadata extraction process is initiated on a contract repository record. By default, the system property is set to initiate the contract metadata extraction process manually.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **All** menu and enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter.

    The System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table appears.

2.  In the **Name** column, search for `sn_cm_gen_ai.cmpro_initiate_metadata_extraction`.

3.  Select the **sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.cmpro\_initiate\_metadata\_extraction** property.

4.  Update the **Value** field.

    -   To set manual initiation of the metadata extraction process, enter `manual`.
    -   To set automatic initiation of the metadata extraction process, enter `automated`.
    The default value is **manual**.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-manual-me.png"\] Alt text: Set metadata extraction initiation method.

5.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The initiation method for metadata extraction is configured.

-   If set to manual, the **Initiate metadata extraction** button appears in the contract repository record, enabling you to initiate the metadata extraction process from that record.
-   If set to automatic, the metadata extraction automatically initiates once the contract repository record is created.
