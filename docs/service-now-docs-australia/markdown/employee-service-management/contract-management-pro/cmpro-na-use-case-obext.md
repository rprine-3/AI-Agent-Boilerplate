# Create use cases for contract obligation extraction

Create obligation extraction use cases to specify the types of key contractual obligation that you want AI to detect and extract from contract documents.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_config, sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## About this task

In the contract obligation extraction skill, you can create a use case to define the category and subcategory of obligations that you want to extract from a contract.

For each use case, you can add fields with detailed prompts to define the obligation category, subcategory, and description of the subcategory. The information is used by the large language model \(LLM\) to identify and extract obligations from a contract. You must add a separate field for each obligation category that you want to extract.

Comprehensive use cases ensure that obligation extraction is precise, consistent, and aligned with your compliance requirements.

The CM Pro - Contract Obligation Extraction use case is available with the in base system. This use case isn’t editable.

**Note:** If you create your own use case or customize a copy of an available use case, be sure to test it thoroughly to ensure accuracy.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** to access the **AI Skills** tab of the AI Admin Hub console.

2.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **CM Pro**.

3.  Select **Activate skill** on the skill you want to activate.

    3.  Turn on the toggle switch for **Create multiple fields** to create multiple fields without closing the window.

    4.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** After adding questions, be sure to test them thoroughly to ensure accuracy.

8.  Select **Save and Continue**.

9.  Upload a document to test how the contract metadata extraction skill works with the new use case.
