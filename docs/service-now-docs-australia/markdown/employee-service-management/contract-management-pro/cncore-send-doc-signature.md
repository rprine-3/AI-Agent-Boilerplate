# Send a contract document for signature

Send the document for signature after a contract document has been reviewed and finalized.

## Before you begin

The contract document must have been reviewed and finalized. For more information, see [Review a contract document in your workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-request-changes-ss-cntr.md) and [Work on a contract change request]().

If the contract request is linked to a parent contract request, the parent request must be in Contract signed or Closed complete state.

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_user

## About this task

**Note:** The **Send for signature** option is not available for the offline signature. For more information see, [Initiate an offline signature for a contract request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-initiate-offline-signature-workspace.md).

## Procedure

2.  Select a contract request.

3.  Select **Send for signature**.

    -   If a message appears containing the details of the contract document, select **Send for signature**.
    -   If a message appears stating that the signatories aren't synchronized:
        1.  Update and sync the signatures.
            -   For versions of Contract Management Pro starting with 1.2.1, see [Resolve the failure to send contract documents for signature \(starting with Contract Management Pro 1.2.1\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-sync-doc-user.md).
            -   For earlier versions of Contract Management Pro, see [Resolve an error during send for signature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-sync-signatories-user.md).
        2.  Select **Send for signature**.
        3.  Select **Send for signature** in the confirmation message.
    -   If a message appears stating that the parent contract request is not signed, ensure the parent contract is either signed or unlinked before selecting **Send for Signature**.

        For more information, see [Remove a linked contract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-remove-linked-cntr.md).
