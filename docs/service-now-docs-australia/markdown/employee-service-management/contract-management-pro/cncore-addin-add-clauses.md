## Before you begin

The Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts must have been configured. For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-word-addin.md).

An active contract template in the Draft or Editing state must exist. For more information, see [Create a contract template to contain content controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-create-ct-word-addin.md).

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config and canvas\_user

## Procedure

1.  Open the document in which you want to mark the content controls in Microsoft Word.

2.  From the Microsoft Word ribbon, select the ServiceNow Contracts add-in.

3.  In the login screen, enter the credentials of the ServiceNow instance from which you downloaded the manifest file.

    For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-word-addin.md)

4.  In the **Templates** tab, select the contract template for which you want to add or modify clauses.

5.  Navigate to the **Clauses** tab.

    A list of active clauses associated with the table selected in the contract template is displayed.

7.  In the Microsoft Word document, select the content to be tagged along with the paragraph ending symbol \(\[Omitted image "lsd-word-formatting-icon.png"\] Alt text: Paragraph ending symbol\).

8.  Map the content to the clauses by either using an existing clause variation, creating a clause, or creating clause variation.

    A clause cannot be mapped to more than one piece of content.
