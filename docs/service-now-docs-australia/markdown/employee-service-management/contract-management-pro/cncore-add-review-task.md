# Request an internal review

Initiate a review of the contract document by internal subject matter experts.

## Before you begin

-   For self-service contract requests, you may want review and feedback from the internal subject matter experts. If needed, the contract requester can submit a change request to the contract fulfiller. The contract fulfiller then submits a review task with the change request details. For more information, see [Review a contract document in your workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-request-changes-ss-cntr.md).
-   For non- self-served contract requests, the contract user cannot create a change request. Instead, the contract fulfiller creates a task for internal review.

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

-   You can raise a review task when the contract request State is Work in progress or Awaiting review.
-   You can create parallel review tasks for the same contract document for different reviewer groups. You cannot create a review task for the same document with the same reviewer group if another active task already exists.

## Procedure
