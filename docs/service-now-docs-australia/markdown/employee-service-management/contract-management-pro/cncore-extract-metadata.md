# Initiate metadata extraction from a contract

Use generative AI capabilities to extract metadata from a signed contract attached in a contract repository record.

## Before you begin

Verify that AI has data access or your role. For more information, see [Configure data permissions for AI skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-conf-roles-skills.md).

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

You can also configure the system properties to automatically initiate the metadata extraction process once the contract repository record is created. For more information, see [Configure system properties for contract metadata extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-conf-sys-prop-na.md).

**Note:** Contract metadata extraction using generative AI capabilities is not available when the Manage contract repository agentic workflow is enabled.

## Procedure

1.  Open a contract repository record where you want to extract information from a contract.
