# Initiate an ad hoc approval for a contract document revision

Initiate an ad hoc approval for a contract document revision from a user or a user group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

You can request for approval of a revision for contract documents from stakeholders. Here is how the flow works:

-   You can assign the approvals to a user or user group in your organization. Users with the group manager or contract fulfiller roles who are in the **assigned to** or **collaborator** fields can raise the approval for the revision.
-   When you initiate an approval, the approvers receive an email notification and can act on the approval.
-   An approver who does not have access to the contract revision is granted read-only access to the record until the assigned approval record is completed.

**Note:** Only latest revision of specific contract type is sent for approval. If an approval of revision is pending, you cannot initiate another approval for the same contract type.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your workspace.

2.  Click the list icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, open a request by selecting an option under **Contract Requests**.
