# Configure conditions to send reminder notifications for expiring contracts

Configure contract repository rules to determine the expiration conditions under which reminder notifications for expiring contracts are sent.

## About this task

Email notifications are available for the following contract expiration conditions in the base system:

-   Expired – The email notification reminder is not sent and the expiration level in the contract is set as Expired.
-   within 7 days – The email notification reminder is sent seven days before the expiration of the contract.
-   within 15 days – The email notification reminder is sent 15 days before the expiration of the contract.
-   within 30 days – The email notification reminder is sent 30 days before the expiration of the contract.

You can update the contract repository rule to modify or add expiration conditions that determine when the notification email is sent.
