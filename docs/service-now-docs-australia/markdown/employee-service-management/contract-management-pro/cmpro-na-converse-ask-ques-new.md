# Search in contracts document

Ask question in the ServiceNow Otto panel to search for information in the content of the contract document.

## Before you begin

The Contract Management Pro - Prime plugin \(sn\_cm\_ai\_prime\) must be installed to use AI capabilities.

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

Conversational search enables you to find information by searching within the contract documents. The system displays up to 20 document search results initially. If more results are available, select the **Show more** option to load additional batches of 20 results.

By default the search results display the following columns:

-   Document: Document name in which content is found
-   Number: Contract number
-   Summary: AI-generated summary explaining what was found
-   Section details: Section of the document where the information was found

You can customize the columns to be displayed by using the **Personalize fields** option under the **More Actions** icon \(\[Omitted image "agent-workspace-more-ui-actions-icon.jpg"\] Alt text: More actions icon\). The columns you configure are also included when you export the search results.

\[Omitted image "cmpro-na-converse-rag-result.png"\] Alt text: Conversational search results for query related to content in the document.

Contract fulfillers and assignment group managers with the sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller and now\_assist\_panel\_user role can view the agentic workflow conversation in the ServiceNow Otto panel.

**Note:** The agentic workflow isn’t supported in the Virtual Agent panel.
