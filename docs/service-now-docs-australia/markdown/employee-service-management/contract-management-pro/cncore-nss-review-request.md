# Work on a non-self-served contract review request

Review and revise a non-self-served contract document. As a collaborator on the request, you can email the revised document to stakeholders to verify the revisions. After they confirm the revisions, send the signature from the contract request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

As a collaborator added to a request, you can access and work on the request just as assignees can. However, you can't modify the **Assigned to** and **Assignment group** fields.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your workspace.

2.  On the **Lists** tab, navigate to **Contract Requests** and open a contract.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  If you need help from other fulfillers to work on the contract request, add them in the **Collaborators** field.

    **Note:**

    -   Users with the sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller role are listed in the **Collaborators** field.
    -   Same user cannot be added to the Assigned to and Collaborator fields.
    The collaborators are notified via email that they have been added as collaborators to a contract request.

4.  In the **Details** tab, select the **Perpetual** check box to specify the contract as perpetual.

    **Note:** The **End date** must be blank when this check box is selected.

    The **Perpetual** check box is available in contract requests that are initiated from the Sales Customer Relationship Management and Source-to-Pay Operations.

5.  Reclassify the contract or supporting documents submitted for review.

    Examples of reclassifying the contract or supporting documents include:

    -   You can change the contract document type from a Non-disclosure Agreement to a Partnership Agreement. For more information, see [Reclassify contract documents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-nss-reclassify-doc.md).
    -   You can change the supporting document to a contract document. For more information, see [Reclassify supporting documents in the contract request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-nss-reclassify-supdoc.md).
6.  Open an existing revision of a contract document.

    -   For internal storage: Open the document revision record by navigating to the **Contract documents** tab and then selecting the name of the document.
    -   For external storage: View the document online by navigating to the **Contract documents** tab and then selecting the link on the **URL** tab.
7.  Review the contract documents.

8.  Create document revisions.

    For more information, see [Create a document revision](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-create-doc-rev.md).

9.  Analyze the contract documents to identify non-standard and missing clauses by using ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro.

    For more information, see [Contract review using ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-NA-review-land.md).

10. If an approval is required from other stakeholders, send the document for ad-hoc approval.

    For more information, see [Initiate an ad hoc approval for a contract document revision](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-initiate-approval-contract-request.md).

11. Email stakeholders to request a review of the completed contract document and confirm the changes.

    For more information, see [Send email to stakeholders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-send-email.md).

12. Add the internal or external signatories for the contract signatures.

**Internal**

</td><td>

1.  In the **Internal Signer** field, enter the name of the signer. The **Authorized signatory name**, **Signatory**, and **Signatory email** fields are automatically populated.
2.  In the **Signatory order** field, enter the order in which the contract should be sent to the signer. The system starts sending the contract to the internal signer with the lowest number.

**Note:** You can assign the same signing order to multiple signatories when you want them to sign the contract simultaneously. Signatories with the same signing order receive signature requests at the same time.

3.  In the **Signatory Role** field, select the role for the signatory.

**Note:** The field is enabled only for Docusign electronic signature. For wet signature and offline signature, the field is inactive and the default value is set to **Signer**.

The **Signatory Role** field is visible only when the **sn\_cm\_core.enable\_docusign\_signature\_roles** system property is set to `true`.

To enable this property, see [Enable signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-enable-signatory-roles.md).

## What to do next

-   Signatories can sign or decline to sign the contract.

    For more information, see [Signature workflow for a contract request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-signature-workflow.md).

-   Check the contract request state and the contract document status in the request:
    -   If all signatories sign the contract document, the contract document status updates to **Contract signed**. On the **Signatories** tab, the status of all signatories updates to **Completed**. You can access the contract repository record from the **Contracts Repository** tab.
    -   If any signatory declines to sign the contract document, the contract status updates to **Signing Declined**. If more changes are required in the contract document, update it and resend it to the signatories for their signatures.
    -   After all signatories sign the document, an email is sent to them with the finalized contract document attached.
-   If all signatories sign the contract, you can close the request by selecting **Close Complete**.
