To enable this feature in Contract Management Pro, do the following:

1.  Activate the smart documents skill in Document Management. For more information, see [Configure the smart documents skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configure-skill-smart-documents.md).

    -   Contract \[ast\_contract\]
    -   Contract Document Revision \[sn\_cm\_core\_document\_revision\]
    -   Legal Contracts Repository \[sn\_lg\_cnt\_repository\]
    -   Supporting File \[sn\_cm\_core\_supporting\_file\]
3.  To enable users to access the contract summarization feature, add the following roles in the **Define access** tab of the smart documents skill.
    -   Contracts Core administrator \[sn\_cm\_core.contract\_admin\]
    -   Contracts Core user \[sn\_cm\_core.contract\_user\]
    -   Contracts Core fulfiller \[sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller\]
