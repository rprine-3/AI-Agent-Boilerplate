# Configuring the Playbook tab on contract repository records

Configure the visibility of the Playbook tab on contract repository records so contract managers can review and act on AI‑extracted metadata and obligations.

The playbook appears on the contract repository record when the ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro plugin is installed for your workspace. If the playbook tab is not configured in the base system for your workspace, you must configure the playbook tab to control its visibility.

The visibility of the Playbook tab is controlled by a data broker. The conditional logic is provided as a script method, `sn_cm_gen_ai.ContractsMetadataExtractionHelper()` in a Script include file. To invoke this action, create a method in one of your Script include files for your workspace, which can be accessed by the data broker linked to your workspace on the UI Builder.
