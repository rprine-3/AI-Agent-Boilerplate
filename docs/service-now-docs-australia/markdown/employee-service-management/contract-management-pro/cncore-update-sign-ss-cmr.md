# Add signatories in self-served contract request

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller or sn\_cm\_core.contract\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your workspace.

2.  Open a contract request assigned to you or one for which you are a collaborator.

3.  In the **Signatories** tab, select **Add**.

4.  On the Add Signatory form, indicate whether you are configuring an internal or external signatory by selecting **Internal** or **External**.

**Internal**

</td><td>

1.  In the **Internal Signer** field, enter the name of the signer.

The **Authorized signatory name**, **Signatory**, and **Signatory email** fields are automatically populated.

2.  In the **Signatory order** field, enter the order in which the contract is sent to signers for an e-signature. Contracts are sent starting with the signatory assigned the lowest number.

**Note:** You can assign the same signing order to multiple signatories when you want them to sign the contract simultaneously. Signatories with the same signing order receive signature requests at the same time.

3.  In the **Signatory Role** field, select the role for the signatory.

**Note:** The field is enabled only for Docusign electronic signature. For wet signature and offline signature, the field is inactive and the default value is set to **Signer**.

The **Signatory Role** field is visible only when the **sn\_cm\_core.enable\_docusign\_signature\_roles** system property is set to `true`.

To enable this property, see [Enable signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-enable-signatory-roles.md). For more information about signatory roles, see [Signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-signatory-roles.md).

4.  Select **Add**.
