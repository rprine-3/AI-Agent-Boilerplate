# Link and inherit parent contract fields

Link parent contracts during drafting and negotiation phases to establish a hierarchical relationship between the parent and child contracts, and automatically inherit the configured fields from the parent contract.

## About this task

This task links a parent contract request and copies configured fields from it into the child contract request. If you only want to establish the parent-child relationship without inheriting fields, use [Link parent contract requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-link-parent-cmr.md) instead. That action also supports contract requests in Contract signed state.

The following video walks you through the process of linking a parent contract request and inheriting its fields.\[Omitted video\] Description: Video providing step-by-step instructions on linking parent contract request and inheriting its fields, approximately one and a half minutes long.

## Before you begin

Verify that the contract request is in Draft, Work in progress, or Awaiting review state.

You must be either assigned to the contract request or a group manager or a collaborator.

Verify that the parent contract is not a multiple contracts type third-party contract request.

Verify that the parent child mapping is configured. For more information, see [Configure field mapping for parent-child contract linking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncor-conf-parent-child.md).

    The selected contract request is linked as a parent contract and its fields are inherited by the child contract. The parent-child relationship appears in a hierarchical order in the Related contract requests tab.

    The **Parent contract request** field is updated with the parent contract request number. The linked parent contract details appear in the activity stream.
