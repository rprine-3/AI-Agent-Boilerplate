# Configure signature pause duration when modifying signatories

Configure the duration for which a signature workflow is paused when signatories are modified for an ongoing signature workflow.

## Before you begin

The Modify Signatories and Resume Signature options enables a contract fulfiller to pause an ongoing signature process to add, remove, modify, or reorder pending signatories.

If the signature process is not resumed within the configured time limit set by the system property, changes made to the signatories are automatically reverted, and the signature process resumes from its previous state.

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_admin

## About this task

**Note:** This property is applicable only for wet signature workflow and electronic signature workflow with Docusign integration.

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  In the **Name** column, search for the `maximum_signature_pause_duration` property.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-signature\_pause.png"\] Alt text: System property to configure maximum duration for which a signature workflow is paused.

3.  Select the property.

4.  If you aren’t able to edit the property in the current application scope, select the word **here** in the message at the top of the page.

5.  Update the **Value** field with the time duration for which the signature process is paused.

    -   The minimum value that can be set is 8 hours and the maximum is 24 hours. The default duration is set to 8 hours.
    -   The value of 8 hours is considered, if the value configured is outside the allowed range.
6.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The signature pause time duration is set.
