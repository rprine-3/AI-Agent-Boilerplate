# Edit or delete table mappings in a contract template using Microsoft Word add-in

As a contract configurator, edit or delete table mappings in a contract template using the Microsoft Word add-in.

## About this task

Using table mappings you can map data source tables in your ServiceNow instance to tables in a contract template. The mappings determine which records from the data source table will be added in the contract and where it will be added.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config and canvas\_user

## Procedure

1.  Open the contract template where you want to edit or delete the table mappings.

2.  From the Microsoft Word ribbon, select ServiceNow Contracts add-in.

3.  On the login screen, enter the credentials of the ServiceNow instance for which the Microsoft Word add-in is configured.

    For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-word-addin.md)

4.  Select the **Table** tab.

5.  In the list of table mappings, select the mapping or find it by entering the table name in the search bar.

6.  Either modify or delete the table mapping.

For more information, see [Map contract tables using the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-addin-table.md).

**Note:** When you update the fields in the **Table mapping details** section, you might need to map the table and columns again based on the following conditions:

    -   If you change the table in the **Table** field and select **Update**, all the sections in the Microsoft Word add-in screen are cleared and you must perform the mapping again.
    -   If you change the table name in the **Name** field and select **Update**, the content control of the mapped table in the Microsoft Word document is removed. You must map the table and table columns again.
    -   If you remove a column from the **Table column** field and select **Update**, the content control of the mapped table column in Microsoft Word document is removed.
