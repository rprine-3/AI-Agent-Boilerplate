# Signatory roles

Signatory roles define how each participant interacts with a contract document during the signature workflow.

## Signatory role types

**Note:** Signatory roles apply to Docusign electronic signature integrations. Signatory roles are available only for signature block-based contract templates. The **Signatory role** field is not displayed for participant-based templates.

|Role|Description|
|----|-----------|
|**Signer**|Signs the contract document. This is the default role for all signatories.|
|**Viewer**|Views the contract document during the electronic signature workflow. Does not sign the document.|
|**Receiver**|Receives a copy of the signed contract document after all signatories have completed their actions.|
|**Approver**|Approves the contract document in the electronic signature tool before signing begins.|

## Role availability by signature type

The following table describes field availability for each role across signature types.

|Role|Electronic signature|Wet signature|Offline signature|
|----|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|
|**Signer**|Available|Available|Available|
|**Viewer**|Available|Inactive|Inactive|
|**Receiver**|Available|Inactive|Inactive|
|**Approver**|Available|Inactive|Inactive|

**Note:** When you switch the signature type from electronic signature to wet signature or offline signature, signatories with Viewer, Receiver, or Approver roles become inactive. These signatories no longer appear in the Signatories tab. If you switch back to electronic signature, these signatories are reactivated and appear again in the Signatories tab.

## Signatory task statuses

The following table describes signatory task statuses in a contract request.

|Status|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Not started**|The signature request has not been sent to the signatory.|
|**Pending**|The signature request has been sent and is awaiting action from the signatory.|
|**Completed**|The signatory has signed the contract document.|
|**Declined**|The signatory has declined the contract document.|
