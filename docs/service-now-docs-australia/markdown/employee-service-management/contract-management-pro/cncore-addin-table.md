# Map contract tables using the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts

Use the ServiceNow Contracts add-in to map a contract table to a source table in your ServiceNow instance to determine the data that will be added in a contract document. When a contract document is generated from the template, the rows and columns are dynamically added in the mapped table of the contract document.

## About this task

The following video walks you through the process of configuring dynamic tables using Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts.

\[Omitted video\] Description: The video walks you through the process of configuring dynamic tables using Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts.

## Before you begin

The Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts must be configured. For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-word-addin.md).

An active contract template must exist in the Draft or Editing state. For more information, see [Create a contract template to contain content controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-create-ct-word-addin.md).

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config and canvas\_user

## Procedure

1.  Open the Microsoft Word document in which you want to map tables.

2.  From the Microsoft Word ribbon, select the ServiceNow Contracts add-in.

3.  On the login screen, enter the credentials of the ServiceNow instance for which the Microsoft Word add-in is configured.

    For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-word-addin.md)

4.  In the **Templates** tab of the Microsoft Word add-in screen, select the contract template to which you want to map the data source table.

5.  In the **Table** tab, create a table mapping for the template.

    -   For a first table mapping, select **Configure table mapping**.
    -   For subsequent table mappings, select the add icon \[Omitted image "plus-icon.png"\] Alt text: Add icon beside the search bar.
6.  In the **Table mapping details** section, configure the details for the data source table from which you want to add data in the contract document.

    1.  In the **Parent request table**, select the source table from which contract request is created.

        **Note:** The field appears only when Contract Request table \[sn\_cm\_core\_contract\_request\] is selected when creating the contract template.

    2.  In the **Table** field, select the data source table from which you want to add data in a contract document.

    3.  In the **Name** field, either retain the default name or enter a unique table name.

    4.  In the **Record identifier** field, select a table field to determine which records are added to the contract document.

        For example, if you have selected the Quote Line Item table and you want to include data only from the Quote record that initiated the contract, you would select the **Quote** field.

    5.  In the **Table Columns** field, select the columns of the data source table that you want to map to the contract template.

    6.  Select **Next**.

7.  In the **Table display configuration** section, set the display properties to define how the data appears within the table in the contract document and then select **Next**.

You can add conditions for the table mapping to filter for the data that appears in the contract. For more information, see [Add conditions for a table mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-add-filter-table-map.md).

As a contract configurator, use condition builders to define criteria for a table mapping in a contract template so only the essential data from the mapped table is displayed in the contract document.
-   **[Configure mapped columns to append or add fields from related tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-append-data-table.md)**  
Configure dynamic tables in a contract template to display additional data from related table fields by appending it to existing columns or adding it as new columns.
