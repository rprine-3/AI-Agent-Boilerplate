# Enable users to view email details in activity stream

As a contract configurator, specify the user roles to enable users to view email details in the activity stream of contract requests.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Specify the user roles for a user.

    -   Add role using user interface \(UI\).
        1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **UI Properties**.
        2.  In the **Roles that can view email in the Activity formatter when including "Sent/Received Emails"** property field, add roles for which you want to enable viewing of sent email details in the activity stream. Use comma separator while adding additional roles.

            For example, to enable contract fulfillers to view email details in the activity stream, add `sn_cm_core.contract_fulfiller`.
