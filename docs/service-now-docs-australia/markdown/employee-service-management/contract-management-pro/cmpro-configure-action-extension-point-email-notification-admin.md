# Configure extension point for notifications

Add or modify an Action and its functionality on the Standard ticket page for a contract request.

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

-   Review the configuration of the script include, scripted extension points, and widgets.

    For more information about using and customizing the script includes, see [Script includes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).

-   Ensure that you've set the application scope to this application.

## About this task

The base system `ApprovalNotificationWorkspaceURLExt` script provides the configuration of common actions for all request types. You can override these common actions for a specific request type or add more actions.

## Procedure

1.  Add or modify an action in the scripted extension point.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

    2.  Search and select the **ApprovalNotificationWorkspaceURLExt** extension point.

        \[Omitted image "cmpro-aprval-ext-point.png"\] Alt text: Extension point for approval notification.

    3.  Add or modify an implementation for a practice area.

        To add a new implementation for a practice area, click the **Create implementation** related link.

        On the Script Include form, update the script as required.

        1.  To restrict this implementation to the practice area, add the following code to the **canHandle** parameter:

            ```java
             appliesTo(parentRecord) {
                    return <tablename of the parent record>;
                },
                /**
                 * @return {String} workspace to which the user can be navigated to view the contract request from notification
                 * The navigation URL is formed in runtime as '/now/' + (getWorkspaceURL return value/output)  + '/record/' + table '/' + sysID.
                 *
                 * For example:
                 * getWorkspaceURL output is  "legal/counsel-center"
                 * URL formed in runtime is '/now/legal/counsel-center/record/' + table + '/' + sysId
                 */
                getWorkspaceURL: function() {
                    return "legal/counsel-center";
             
                },
            ```

        2.  To add a new action, update the **process** method.

            For reference, see an existing **process** method of the `DefaultLegalTicketActions` script include or the implementation of another practice area.

    4.  Click **Update**.
