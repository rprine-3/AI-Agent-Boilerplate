# Compare contract revisions in Contract Management Pro

Streamline the contract negotiation process by comparing two contract revisions to quickly identify and review all changes between the two versions, thereby reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of missing critical updates.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_user

    **Note:** You can only compare files in .doc and .docx format.

    1.  In the **Contract type** field, select the contract type.

        For single contract type contract requests, this field is automatically updated.

    2.  In the **Select document 1** field, select a lower version of the contract document you want to compare.

        Document revisions are listed in ascending order, with older versions appearing above newer ones.

    3.  In the **Select document 2** field, select a higher version of the contract document.

        Document revisions are listed in descending order, with the latest version at the top.

    4.  Select **Compare**.

    For internally stored documents, the comparison opens on a new tab displaying the comparison summary with total changes, added, deleted, and format changes. The deletions are highlighted with red strikeout, additions are highlighted in green, and formatting changes are highlighted in cyan.

    For externally stored documents, the comparison is processed in the background. You receive a notification in the application and through an email when the comparison is ready. Select the link in the notification to view the document comparison.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-compare-docs-comparison.png"\] Alt text: Document where changes are highlighted in different colors.

4.  Select **Hide redlines** to hide the highlighted changes.

5.  Select **Download redlined document** to download the document, and make further modifications to it.
