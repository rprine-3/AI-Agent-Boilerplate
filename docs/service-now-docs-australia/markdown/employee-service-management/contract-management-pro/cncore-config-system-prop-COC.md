# Activate a system property to generate a certificate of completion

As a contract configurator, activate a system property to generate a certificate of completion for electronically signed contracts.

## Before you begin

You must have configured an electronic signature provider. For more information, see [Configure an e-signature provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-integrate-esign.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** This feature is applicable only for electronically signed contracts.

The certificate of completion provided by Docusign or Adobe Acrobat Sign includes the audit trail with the time stamp details about each signatory action during an electronic signature. The audit trail ensures non-repudiation and resolves any objections.

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  In the **Name** column, search for the `sn_cm_core.enable_executed_contract_audit_certificate` property.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-audit-certificate.png"\] Alt text: Audit certificate property for executed contracts.

3.  Select the property.

4.  If you aren’t able to edit the property in the current application scope, select the word **here** in the message at the top of the page.

5.  Update the **Value** field to `true`.

6.  Select **Update**.


## Result

A certificate of completion will be generated for all electronically signed contracts.
