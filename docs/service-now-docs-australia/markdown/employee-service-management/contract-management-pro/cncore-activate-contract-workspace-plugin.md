# Activate Contract Workspace

You can activate the Contract Workspace plugin \(sn\_cm\_workspace\) for Contract Management Pro if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

Review the [Contract Workspace](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/1803d03a37023110da6cdf3c24924bab) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Two roles are installed with the Contract Workspace plugin.

For more information, see [Components installed with Contract Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-comp-contract-workspace.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Contract Workspace plugin \(sn\_cm\_workspace\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed.
