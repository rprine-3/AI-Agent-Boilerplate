# Create use cases for contract analysis

Create a use case for contract analysis that is used by AI to identify non-standard and missing clauses in a contract document.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_config, sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## About this task

The contract analysis use case contains field groups and their associated fields.

Field groups represent the clauses that are used in the contract document. Field groups are linked to clause variations of a clause library. AI uses the mapped clause content to display suggestions for missing or non-standard clause.

Fields are the prompt questions added for a field group. Fields are mapped to an expected response. AI executes these fields \(prompt questions\) on a contract document to identify the non-standard clauses.

When creating a use case, add a field group, and then define the fields within that field group to ensure that the fields are linked to the field group.

The CM Pro - Contract Analysis use case is available in the base system. This use case is not editable.

**Note:** If you create your own use case or customize a copy of an available use case, be sure to test it thoroughly to ensure accuracy.

For more information on the computation of non-standard and missing clauses, see the [KB1704731](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704731) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** to access the **AI Skills** tab of the AI Admin Hub console.

2.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **CM Pro**.

3.  Select **Activate skill** on the skill you want to activate.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-NA-skills.png"\] Alt text: AI skills available for Contract Management Pro.

4.  In the General details page, view the skill details and select **Save and continue**.

5.  In the Q&amp;A use cases page, select **New use case**.

6.  In the Define use case page, add the use case details and select **Save and continue**.

<table id="table_czf_dpc_chc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Use case name

</td><td>

Unique name of the use case.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target table

</td><td>

This field should be left empty.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Language of the files

</td><td>

Language of the contract documents this is by AI.For more information on supported languages, see [Languages supported by Document Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/languages-supported-by-document-intelligence.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Large language model \(LLM\) provider for the use case that is used to analyze contracts.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Image mode

</td><td>

Improves the efficiency of processing images for third-party multi-modal LLMs like Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI.The field is available only when a third-party multi-modal LLM is selected in the **LLM provider** field.

**Note:** Selecting image mode reduces the page count limit to 10 pages per file.

</table>7.  In the Define fields page, select **Add a field** to add fields for the use case.

    1.  In the New field window, select **Question group**.

        \[Omitted image "cmpro-na-question-group.png"\] Alt text: Question group card in add field page.

        **Note:** Add a question group, and then define the questions within that question group to ensure that questions are linked to a question group.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ewn_b2r_bdc"><thead><tr><th>

Question group

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Field group name

</td><td>

Unique name of the question group that will be mapped to a clause variation using clause mappings.For example, `Purpose`, `Term`, and so on.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Additional details

</td><td>

More information on the field group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target table

</td><td>

This field should be left empty.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    3.  Select **Add questions**.

        \[Omitted image "cmpro-na-add-questions.png"\] Alt text: Adding questions in a Question group page.

    4.  Enter details for the field.

        For more information on the field form, see [Question form for use case setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-qna-single-field-form.md).

        \[Omitted image "cmpro-na-add-fields.png"\] Alt text: Question details in the fields page.

    5.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** After adding question groups and questions, be sure to test them thoroughly to ensure accuracy.

8.  Select **Save and continue**.

9.  Upload a document to test how the contract analysis skill works with the new use case.

    1.  Select **Test a new document**.

    2.  Upload a document from a record or from the device.

        You can test documents in .pdf or .docx format.

    3.  Select **Continue**.

        The contract analysis results for the uploaded document is displayed on the side panel.

        To upload and test another document, select **Test a new document**.

    4.  Add new fields or update the existing fields by selecting **Back**.

    5.  Proceed by selecting **Save and continue**.

10. In the Review and activate page, select **Complete setup**.
