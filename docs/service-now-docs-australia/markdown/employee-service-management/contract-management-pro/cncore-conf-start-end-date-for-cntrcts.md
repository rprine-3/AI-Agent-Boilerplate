2.  In the **API Name** field, enter `sn_cm_core.ContractManagementExt`.

3.  Select the record.

4.  In the Related Links section, select **Create implementation**.

5.  On the Script Include form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Scripted Extension Point form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/scripted-extension-point-form-fields.md).

6.  In the **Script** field, add a method `populateDataForInitiateContractModal` to define the fields from which the values will be automatically added in the **Start date** and **End date** fields of a contract request.

    You can also define the exact dates for the **Start date** and **End date**.

7.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The **Start date** and **End date** fields in the Initial contract window are automatically updated from the parent record while creating a contract request.
