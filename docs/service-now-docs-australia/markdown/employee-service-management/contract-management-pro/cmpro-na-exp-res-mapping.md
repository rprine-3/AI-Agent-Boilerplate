# Map a field to an expected response

Map a field of a use case to an expected response. AI uses the field mapping to identify a non-standard clause in a contract document.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_config, sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** to access the **AI Skills** tab of the AI Admin Hub console.

2.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **CM Pro**.

3.  Select **Activate skill** on the skill you want to activate.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-NA-skills.png"\] Alt text: AI skills available for Contract Management Pro.

4.  In the General details page, view the skill details and select **Save and continue**.

5.  In the Use case page, select **Save and continue**.

    For more information on creating a use case, see [Create use cases for contract analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-na-usecase-ca.md).

6.  In the Clause mappings page, select **Save and continue**.

    For more information on mapping a field group to a clause, see [Map a field group to a clause](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-na-map-fieldgrp-clause.md).

7.  In the Expected response mappings page, select **New response**.

8.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_hgz_nng_zcc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Use case

</td><td>

Use case that the field is associated with.**Note:** Only active use cases for contract analysis are displayed in the list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Request table

</td><td>

Table that the contract analysis is executed from.**Note:** The Contract Request table \[sn\_cm\_core\_contract\_request\] is selected by default to centralize the configuration on a single table and improve reusability across product lines. You can choose a different table for the mapping.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field

</td><td>

Field \(question prompt\) that is mapped to the expected response.**Note:** Only active fields are displayed in the list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Expected response

</td><td>

Expected response:-   Yes: When AI returns the same response as expected, the system considers the field as standard.
-   No: When AI returns a response that differs from the expected answer, the system considers the field as non-standard.

All such fields within a field group are categorized as non-standard and are displayed in transaction results with AI-generated comments in both the workspace and Word Add-in.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Applies when

</td><td>

Conditional fields that are based on an expected response.**Note:** If this condition fails, the expected answer isn't considered.

For more information on using the condition builder, see [Create a condition statement using the condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/create-cond-state-using-cond-build.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order in which the expected response is evaluated if a field has been mapped to multiple responses.AI evaluates the expected response from the lowest ordered number to the highest ordered number. AI stops evaluating when the expected response is satisfied.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>9.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The fields of the contract analysis use case are mapped to expected responses. AI uses the field mapping to identify a non-standard clause on a contract document.
