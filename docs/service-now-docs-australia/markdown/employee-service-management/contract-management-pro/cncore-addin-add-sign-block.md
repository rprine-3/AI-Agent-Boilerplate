\[Omitted video\] Description: The video walks you through the process of adding signature blocks using Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts.

## Before you begin

The Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts must be configured. For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-word-addin.md).

An active contract template must exist in the Draft or Editing state where the **Signature blocks** option is selected. For more information, see [Create a contract template to contain content controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-create-ct-word-addin.md).

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config and canvas\_user

## Procedure

1.  Open the document in which you want to map the tables using Microsoft Word add-in.

2.  From the Microsoft Word ribbon, select the ServiceNow Contracts add-in.

3.  On the login screen, enter the credentials of the ServiceNow instance for which the Microsoft Word add-in is configured.

    For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-word-addin.md)

4.  On the add-in screen in the **Templates** tab, select the contract template to which you want to add the signature metadata.

6.  In the Signatory type section, set the signature type as internal or external, and select **Next**.

    **Note:** You can create one internal signature block and one external signature block.

7.  Define the signature block in the Microsoft Word document.

    1.  Select a placeholder in the Microsoft Word document.

    2.  Select the signature tag.

    3.  Select **Next**.

8.  Insert the items you want to display in the signature block.

    1.  Place the cursor within the signature block.

    2.  Add placeholder text at the locations where you want to place the content controls.

    3.  Set the font color of the placeholder text to match the document’s background color.

    4.  Select the tag for the metadata you want to add.

        You can add the following metadata:

        -   Signature
        -   Name
        -   Title
        -   Date
        -   Email

    The signatory fields—such as Name, Title, and Email—are not pre-filled in the contract document before it is sent for signature. These fields will be populated by the electronic signature provider when the signatory accesses the document to sign it.

10. View the signatory details by navigating to the **Template Mappings** related list of the Contract template form.


## What to do next

Define an internal signatory rule to automatically add signatory details in contract documents using the template. For more information, see [Define an internal signatory rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-define-internal-signers-rule.md).
