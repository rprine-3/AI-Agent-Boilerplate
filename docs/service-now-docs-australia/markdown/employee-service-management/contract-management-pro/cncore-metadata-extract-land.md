# Extract contract metadata

As a contract fulfiller, use ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro to extract metadata from a signed contract and add the information to the mapped fields in the contract repository.

You can review the extracted information and make necessary corrections on the Document Intelligence workspace before adding the information to the contract repository. On completion of the extraction process, the **Extraction results** tab opens on the contract repository record displaying the status of the extracted metadata.

## Metadata extraction workflow for a contract fulfiller

The following end-to-end workflow shows how a contract manager extracts metadata from a signed contract and adds the information in contract repository.

1.  The contract repository record is created once the signed contract is attached to the contract request.
2.  A contract manager with the appropriate role \(sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller\) initiates metadata extraction in the contract repository record.

    The metadata extraction is automatically initiated on creation of the contract repository record, if the automatic extraction process is enabled in system properties. For more information, see [Configure system properties for contract metadata extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-conf-sys-prop-na.md).

3.  The contract manager receives a notification once the metadata extraction is successfully completed.

    **Note:** The **Metadata extraction-Completed** notification as is not active by default.

4.  The contract manager selects the **Review extracted metadata** button to view the extracted information in the Document Intelligence workspace.
5.  The contract manager submits the verified information to update it in the contract repository.
6.  When the extraction process is completed, the **Extraction results** tab opens on the contract repository record displaying the status of the processed information.
