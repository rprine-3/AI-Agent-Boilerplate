# Create a contract template

Create a contract template that can be used to generate a standard contract with predefined content when an employee submits a contract request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

If you are creating a contract template for a non-task table, ensure that the non-task table is added in the extension script. For more information, see [Configure non-task tables for contract templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-config-non-tsk-tbl-cn-tmplt.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Contracts Core** &gt; **Contract Administration** &gt; **Contract Templates**.

    The Word Templates page opens in the Contract Templates view by default.

2.  Select **New**.

For more information, see [Add content controls in a Microsoft Word document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-word-doc-tmplt-contls.md).

Date on which the Word document template becomes valid. Providing a start date helps when maintaining multiple versions of same template.This field is available only when **Category** is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

End date

</td><td>

Date until which the Word document template is valid. Providing an end date helps when maintaining multiple versions of same template.

 If the values in the **Start date** and **End date** fields are empty the template will always be valid.

If you specify an end date, you must also specify a start date.

 This field is available only when **Category** is selected.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    When the document is selected, the Participants, Imported Clauses, Clause Mappings, and Template Mappings related list appear.

4.  In the **Contract Type** field, select only one category of the contract type.

    If you’re creating a template for non-disclosure agreement, select **Non Disclosure Agreement** as the contract type.

5.  Select **Parse Document** to extract the content marked by content control from the imported document.

    -   The content controls that have **clause\_** as prefix are derived from the document and listed under the Imported clauses related list.
    -   The content controls that have **field\_**, **signatory\_**, **signature\_**, and **sign\_** as prefix are derived from the document and listed under the Template mappings related list.
6.  Select **Save**.

The contract template is saved in the Draft state.
