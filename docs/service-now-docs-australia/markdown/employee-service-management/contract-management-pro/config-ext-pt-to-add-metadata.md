# Configure an extension point to add contract metadata

Update the script in an extension point to specify fields in a related contract repository table where you want to add the extracted information for unmapped fields of a metadata extraction use case.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

2.  In the **API Name** field, search for `sn_cm_gen_ai.NowAssistUpdateMetadataExtractedValuesExt`.

3.  Select the record.

4.  Select the **Create implementation** related link.

5.  On the Script Include form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Scripted Extension Point form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/scripted-extension-point-form-fields.md).

6.  In the **Script** field, update the script to specify the contract repository related table and the field mapping

    -   In the `canHandle` function, add the request table name where you want to update the extracted information.
    -   In the `updateContractRepositoryFields` function, add a script to update the fields. The extracted metadata will be fetched from the `retrievedFieldsData` parameter.
7.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The script specifies the related contract repository tables and their field mappings. After metadata extraction, values from these fields are added according to the defined mapping.

For more information on metadata extraction use case mapping, see [Map a use case for contract metadata extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-na-usecase-mappings-me.md).
