    -   If the mapping is successful, the Clause Mappings related list displays the details of mapped clauses with their contract type.
    -   If the mapping is not successful, an error message appears. Possible causes could include:
        -   No contract type was selected.
        -   All clauses were not assigned a classification.
        -   Clauses classified as New clause were mapped to a clause instead of being empty.
        -   Clauses classified as Existing clause or No change don’t have a clause mapped to them.
5.  Select **Update** to save the contract template.

6.  View the clause variations associated with a clause by selecting the Display/hide hierarchical lists icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-icon-hirerachy-lists.png"\] Alt text: Display/hide hierarchical lists\) for the clause.
