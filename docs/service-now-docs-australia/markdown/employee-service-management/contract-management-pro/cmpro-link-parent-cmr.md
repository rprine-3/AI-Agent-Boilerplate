# Link parent contract requests

Link parent contracts during drafting and negotiation phases to establish hierarchical relationship between the parent and child contracts.

## About this task

This task links a parent contract request without copying any fields from it. If you also want to inherit configured fields from the parent into the child contract request, use [Link and inherit parent contract fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-link-inhrt-prnt-flds.md) instead.

The following video walks you through the process of linking a parent contract request.\[Omitted video\] Description: Video providing step-by-step instructions on linking parent contract request, approximately one minute long.

## Before you begin

Verify that the contract request is in Draft, Work in progress, Awaiting review, or Contract signed state.

**Note:** If the contract request is in Contract signed state, the parent contract request must be in Contract signed or Closed complete state.

You must be either assigned to the contract request or a group manager or a collaborator.

Verify that the parent contract is a single contract type using own paper or third-party paper.
