# Exploring Contract Management Pro

Learn more about the Contract Management Pro application through a sample workflow and review the benefits that it can provide.

## Contract Management Pro overview

Contract Management Pro solution enables you to set up contract document templates, clauses, and clause variations, and to initiate contract and amendmentrequests. The solution uses AI to analyze contracts and extract metadata. It also supports e-signatures, wet signatures, and external storage systems.

## Self-served contract request workflow

The following image provides an overview of the self-served contract requests.

\[Omitted image "mmasset0021155-ss-cmpro-horizontal.png"\] Alt text: A flowchart illustrating a self-served contract request workflow in Contract Management Pro.

1.  The contract requester initiates a contract request.
2.  A contract document is generated from a contract template and the metadata, clauses, signatories, and tables are added dynamically according to predefined conditions.
3.  The contract fulfiller views the contract document and does one of the following actions:
    1.  If no changes are required, gets approval from stakeholders. Sends the contract document for signature.
    2.  If any changes are required, uploads a new revision of document and gets approval from stakeholders before sending it for signature.
4.  If any signatory declines the document, it is sent back to the requester to be reworked and the revision is sent for signature.
5.  After all signatories have approved the document. The signed contract is attached to the contract request record.
6.  The signed contract is stored on the ServiceNow instance or an external storage system and referenced in the contract repository. The requester and department members can access the signed contract document from the Contracts repository.

## Non-self-served contract request workflow

The following image provides an overview of the non-self-served contract requests.

\[Omitted image "mmasset0021156-nss-cmpro-horizontal.png"\] Alt text: A flowchart illustrating a non-self-served contract request workflow in Contract Management Pro.

A workflow for non-self-served contract request might progress as follows:

1.  The Contract requester initiates a contract request from the workspace.
2.  The Contract requester uploads a single contract or multiple contracts and their supporting documents and classifies them.
3.  The contract fulfiller views the contract document attached to the contract request.
4.  If necessary, the contract fulfiller reclassifies the contract and supporting documents.
5.  The contract fulfiller views the contract document and does one of the following actions:
    1.  If no changes are required, gets approval from stakeholders. Sends the contract document for signature.
    2.  If any changes are required, modifies the contract document, gets internal or ad-hoc approval if required. Uploads new revision of the contract document and sends for signature.
6.  If there are multiple contract documents, the contract fulfiller prepares for signatures by specifying the order. If there's an e-signature, the contract fulfiller adds the required fields and sends the contract document for signature.
7.  Signatories review the contract document.
    -   If no change is required, the contract document is signed by all the signatories.
    -   If any changes are required, the signature is declined, and the user who is working on the contract request generates a new document and resends it for signature.
8.  The signed contract is stored on the ServiceNow instance or an external storage system and referenced in the contract repository. The requester and department members can access the signed contract document from the contracts repository.
