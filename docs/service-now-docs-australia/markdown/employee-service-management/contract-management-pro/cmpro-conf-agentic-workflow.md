# Configuring agentic workflows in ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro

Configure agentic workflows in ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro so that contract fulfillers can use the AI agents to perform specific tasks autonomously.

Complete the following steps to configure agentic workflows in Contract Management Pro.

1.  Install the Contract Management Pro - Prime plugin \(sn\_cm\_ai\_prime\).

    For information about the plugin installation process, see [Install plugins for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-now-assist-feature-plugins.md).

2.  Ensure ServiceNow Otto panel is turned on. For more information, see [Activate the ServiceNow Otto panel standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-now-assist-panel.md).
3.  Ensure **ServiceNow Otto - Platform \(default\)** assistant in the CI Admin Experience is turned on. For more information, see [Manage LLM virtual agents on the Assistants screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/manage-llm-va.md).
4.  Configure the security controls to specify the users who can discover or use the agentic workflow, and provide data permissions for the agentic workflow.

    For more information, see [Configuring user access and data permissions for agentic workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-conf-users-agentic-wf.md).

5.  Configure the security controls to specify the users who can discover or use the agentic workflow, and provide data permissions for AI agents.

    For more information, see [Configuring user access and data permissions for AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-conf-users-ai-agents.md).

6.  Ensure that Contract metadata extraction and Contract obligation extraction skills are configured and activated in AI Admin Hub console.

    For more information, see [Configuring contract metadata extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-conf-metadata-extraction.md) and [Configuring contract obligation extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-conf-obligation-extraction.md).

7.  Activate business rules for the agentic workflow to run the AI agents autonomously. For more information, see [Activate business rules for the Manage contract repository agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/conf-repository-agentic-ai.md).
8.  If you want to modify an agentic workflow, duplicate it and then update it.

    For more information, see [Update the contracts AI agents handler script include](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-script-includ-agenticAI.md).

10. Configure system properties to set the notice period for the Manage contract repository agentic workflow that will be used when the contract renewal notice period and termination of contract renewal notice period are not available in a contract.

    For more information, see [Set the default notice period for the Manage contract repository agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/conf-sys-prop-default-np.md).
