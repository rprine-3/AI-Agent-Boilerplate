# Preview and download a signed contract document

View and download a signed contract document.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Cancelling a contract request after it has been sent for signature stops the process in its current state.

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_user

## About this task

When all signatories have signed a contract document, it’s considered as the final contract document and is stored in the Contract Request Repositories \[sn\_cm\_core\_contract\_request\_m2m\_contract\_repository\] table.

Access to a contract document is based on the following user roles and conditions:

-   Group manager, Assigned to user and collaborator have edit access to the contract repository.
-   Contract fulfiller belonging to the same assignment group has view access to the contract repository.
-   Contract fulfiller not in assignment group do not have any access to the to the contract repository.
-   Only a contracts administrator can delete contract documents.
-   Requesters can view only the contract documents for which they submitted the contract request.
-   Users can view only contract documents for which they have been added to the watch list of the corresponding contract requests.

When multiple contract documents are attached, a separate contract repository record is created for each contract type.

2.  Select a contract request.

3.  Navigate to **Contract repository**.
