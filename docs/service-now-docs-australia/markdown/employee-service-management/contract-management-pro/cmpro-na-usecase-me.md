# Create use cases for contract metadata extraction

Create a use case for contract metadata extraction to define the information that you want AI to detect in a document.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_config, sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## About this task

The CM Pro - Contract Metadata Extraction use case is available with the base system. This use case is not editable. For more information about the various fields in the CM Pro - Contract Metadata Extraction use case, see [Contract metadata extraction use cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/metadata-extraction-use-case.md).

**Note:** If you create your own use case or customize a copy of an available use case, be sure to test it thoroughly to ensure accuracy.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** to access the **AI Skills** tab of the AI Admin Hub console.

2.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **CM Pro**.

3.  Select **Activate skill** on the skill you want to activate.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-NA-skills.png"\] Alt text: AI skills available for Contract Management Pro.

4.  On the General details page, view the skill details and select **Save and continue**.

5.  In the Contract metadata extraction use cases page, select **New use case**.

6.  In the Define use case page, add the use case details and select **Save and continue**.

<table id="table_czf_dpc_chc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Use case name

</td><td>

Unique name of the use case.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target table

</td><td>

Table where extracted information is stored.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Language of the files

</td><td>

Language of the contract documents from which you want to extract the metadata.For more information on supported languages, see [Languages supported by Document Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/languages-supported-by-document-intelligence.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

LLM provider

</td><td>

Large language model \(LLM\) provider for the use case that is used to extract metadata.**Note:** For contract metadata extraction use cases, select large LLMs such as Azure OpenAI GPT to achieve more accurate results.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Image mode

</td><td>

Improves the efficiency of processing images for third-party multi-modal LLMs like Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI.The field is available only when a third-party multi-modal LLM is selected in the **LLM provider** field.

**Note:** Selecting image mode reduces the page count limit to 10 pages per file.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Document intelligence skill

</td><td>

Displays the skill name for which you’re creating the use case.

</table>7.  In the Define fields page, select **Add a field** to add fields for the use case.

    1.  In the New field window, select **Field**.

    2.  Enter details for the new field.

        For more information on the field form, see [Field form for use case setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-extraction-single-field-form.md).

        \[Omitted image "cmpro-na-fields-me.png"\] Alt text: Field information for contract metadata extraction.

    3.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** After adding fields, be sure to test them thoroughly to ensure accuracy.

8.  Select **Save and Continue**.

9.  Upload a document to test how the contract metadata extraction skill works with the new use case.

    1.  Select **Test a new document**.

    2.  Upload a document from a record or from the device.

        You can test documents that are in .pdf format.

    3.  Select **Continue**.

        The metadata extraction results for the uploaded document is displayed on the side panel.

        Upload and test another document by selecting **Test a new document**.

    4.  Add new fields or update the existing fields by selecting **Back**.

    5.  Select **Save and continue** to proceed.

10. Select **Complete setup**.


## Result

The use case is created for the Contract metadata extraction skill. AI uses the use case to extract metadata from signed contract.
