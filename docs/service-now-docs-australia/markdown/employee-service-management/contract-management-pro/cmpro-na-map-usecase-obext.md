# Map a use case for contract obligation extraction

Map a use case to specific tables, and define conditions to apply the use case for obligation extraction.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the application scope is in the Global or ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro scope. If you’re configuring the use case mapping in a different application scope, add the scoped ACL to the Use Case Mapping table \(sn\_cm\_gen\_ai\_usecase\_configuration\).

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_config, sn\_cm\_core.contract\_config

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** to access the **AI Skills** tab of the AI Admin Hub console.

2.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **CM Pro**.

3.  Select **Activate skill** on the skill you want to activate.

    \[Omitted image "cmpro-NA-skills.png"\] Alt text: AI skills available for Contract Management Pro.

4.  In the General details page, view the skill details and select **Save and continue**.

5.  In the Use case page, select **Save and continue**.

    For more information on creating a use case, see [Create use cases for contract obligation extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-na-use-case-obext.md).

6.  In the Use case mappings page, select **New**.

7.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Contract obligation extraction use case mapping form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-na-use-case-map-form-obe.md).

8.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The use case is mapped to specific tables and conditions, and it’s applied for obligation extraction when the conditions are met.
