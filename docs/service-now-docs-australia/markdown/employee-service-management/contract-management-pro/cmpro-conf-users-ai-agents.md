# Configuring user access and data permissions for AI agents

Configure the security controls to specify the users who can discover or use the agentic workflow, and provide data permissions for AI agents.

AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aia.md).

The following roles are configured with the base system to provide data access to the AI agents in the agentic workflows of Contract Management Pro.

-   sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller
-   sn\_lg\_cnt.contract\_fulfiller
-   sn\_lg\_ops.request\_fulfiller
-   sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller
-   contract\_manager
-   sn\_lg\_cnt.contract\_owner
-   sn\_cm\_obligation.obligation\_fulfiller

To ensure that the AI agent can access all the required information for your workspace, add the necessary roles for the AI agent in the AI Agent Studio.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Select the **AI agents** tab.
3.  Open the AI agent for which you want to configure the security controls.
4.  In the guided setup, navigate to **Define security controls** to define the security access.
    1.  In the **Define user access** tab, add the user roles who can discover or invoke the AI agent.
    2.  In the **Define data access** tab, add the user roles to define which roles the AI agent uses to access data during its execution.

        This configuration controls what information the AI agent can read, update, or share, based on the permissions of the selected roles.
