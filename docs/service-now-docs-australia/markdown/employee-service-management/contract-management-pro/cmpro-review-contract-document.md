# Review the AI suggestions for clause deviations

Review the suggestions for clause deviations and take actions by using the ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro application to ensure that the clauses comply with the guidelines of the company.

## Before you begin

Before you start to review a document, verify the AI analysis of the contract document is complete. For more information, see [Analyze a contract document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cmpro-analyze-contract-doc.md).

Role required: sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

A clause is a section in a contract document that outlines the guidelines of the company agreement, such as the purpose, term, or confidentiality.

-   As an assigned-to collaborator or group manager with the sn\_cm\_gen\_ai.ai\_contract\_fulfiller role, review and act on the suggestions from the contract analysis when the contract request is in the Work in progress state.
-   The Microsoft Word add-in for ServiceNow Contracts isn’t supported when the document is opened from the Google Drive. If you're using Google Drive for external storage, you must download the document from Google Drive and work on it offline.
-   If you're using the Microsoft OneDrive configuration for external storage, you can work on the document online or download it to work on it offline.
-   If you work on the suggestions offline, you must upload the document manually by creating a revision in the contract request. For more information, see [Create a document revision](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-create-doc-rev.md).
