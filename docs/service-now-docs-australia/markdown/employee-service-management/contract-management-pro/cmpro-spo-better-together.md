-   Mitigate risk to the organization: Ensure contract compliance and consistency with pre-approved templates and proactive obligation management
-   Control spend with contract data: Optimize procurement cost with access to historical metadata through a robust contract repository
-   Boost legal team productivity: Utilize common contract processes like review and signature to boost productivity.
-   Reduce manual review work by using generative AI: Use AI to identify missing and non-standard clauses for reducing manual review work

## Workflow for Sourcing and Procurement Operations and Contract Management Pro

The following figure shows an example workflow of how a procurement specialist and a contract fulfiller can use these applications to streamline collaboration with legal teams, enabling them to execute contracting tasks within the procurement workflow. It also provides procurement professionals with full visibility into contract progress, reducing delays and improving operational transparency.

\[Omitted image "mmassest0021243-SPO-CMPro-workflow.png"\] Alt text: SPO - CM Pro workflow

In this workflow:

1.  The employee initiates a sourcing request from the Sourcing and Procurement Operations workspace.
2.  The procurement specialist reviews the sourcing request and initiates contract request.
3.  The contract fulfiller reviews contract terms and clauses.
4.  The contract fulfiller finalizes the contract document.
5.  The contract fulfiller send the contract document for signature.
6.  The contract document is signed.
7.  A contract repository record with signed contract document is created in Sourcing and Procurement Operations.

## User roles required for the Contract Management Pro and Sourcing and Procurement Operations better together solution

The following roles are required to initiate, view, and manage contract execution:

-   **Sourcing and purchasing viewer**: This is a new role provided within the **Contract specialist** assignment group. This role can be assigned to the contracting and procurement professionals to have read-only access into the purchase lines, sourcing requests, negotiations, and purchase requisitions.
-   **Contract fulfiller**: This is a licensed role for CM Pro. This role has to be explicitly assigned to the contracting and procurement professionals if they have to work on contract requests. Once assigned, they can work on the contract requests, leveraging all capabilities from CM Pro – obtaining contract signatures, authoring contracts, tracking revisions, and creating the contract documents to be stored in the contract repository.​
-   **Contract user**: This role is also provided within the **Contract specialist** assignment group and is required to initiate and track contract execution.

You can assign your procurement and contracting professionals to these roles as required.
