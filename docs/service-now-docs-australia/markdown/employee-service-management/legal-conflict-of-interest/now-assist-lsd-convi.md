# Submit COI request using ServiceNow Otto conversational intake

Submit Conflict of Interest \(COI\) requests through natural language conversations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_ops.legal\_user

## About this task

Legal Conflict of Interest \(COI\) enables you to manage the disclosure, approval, and registry of conflict of interest that might arise from employees having competing interests or loyalties. You can submit COI requests using any of the following methods in the Employee Center:

-   Employee Center COI intake form.
-   Conversational intake interface from the ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent.

This topic describes how to submit a COI request using the conversational interface. The conversational intake functionality is available only when you have installed and configured Legal Service Delivery - Prime plugin \(sn\_lg\_ai\_prime\) that is a paid application.

For more information on how to submit a COI request using Employee Center intake form, see [Submit COI request form Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-conflict-of-interest/submit-coi-disclosure-request.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Center**.

2.  Select the ServiceNow Otto panel icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-coi-nap-icon.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow Otto Panel icon\).

3.  Enter a message in the chat to indicate that you want to report disclose a conflict of interest.

    Example: I need to disclose an employment opportunity for Acme, a for-profit services company, for an 18-month starting 2026-04- 01 and ending 2027-09-30. The organization is not family-owned. My role will involve providing technical services on a project basis.

5.  Select **Get started**.

    Relevant follow-up questions are prompted to gather additional details.

6.  Respond to the follow-up questions with the relevant details.

    After all relevant details are gathered, a summary is displayed with an option to submit the request.

7.  Review the summary and select **Submit** when the details are as required.

    The request is submitted and you can view it from the Employee Center. The system evaluates the COI request to determine risk. Low‑risk requests are auto‑approved, while medium‑ and high‑risk requests are routed for approval.

## Result

When an employee submits a COI disclosure the risk assessment utility evaluates the submission against a set of predefined risk factor. Each risk factor contributes to an overall risk score, which determines the risk level \(Low, Medium, or High\) and the corresponding approval routing. The risk level determines whether the request needs approval or can be auto-approved.
