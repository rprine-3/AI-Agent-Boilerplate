# Configure risk assessment

Configure the risk assessment to automatically evaluate conflict of interest disclosures and assign risk levels that determine approval routing.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lco\_cmn.config

## About this task

The risk assessment functionality evaluates each request against a set of risk factors to calculate a risk score. The risk score determines the risk level \(Low, Medium, or High\), which drives the approval workflow. Low-risk disclosures are auto-approved; Medium and High-risk disclosures enter the approval workflow with approvers determined by the conflict type.

The risk assessment record defines the risk factors, the table it applies to, and the conditions under which it runs.

COI Risk Assessment is available in the base system to evaluate the COI requests. You can also configure risk assessments to evaluate other compliance requests.

## Procedure

1.  Set the application scope to **Global** or **Legal and Contracts Common Utilities** in the application picker.
