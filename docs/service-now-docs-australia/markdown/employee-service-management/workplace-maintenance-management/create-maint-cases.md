# Workplace maintenance cases

The schedule job creates maintenance cases for plan records.

## Before you begin

The scheduled job Workplace Planned Maintenance Nightly runs every 48 hours \(end of day tomorrow\) and creates duration-based and meter-based cases.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Select a published plan record.

2.  On the calendar view, select the **Maintenance case** tab to view cases created by the scheduled job.

    The **Workplace Maintenance Nightly run** scheduled job generates maintenance cases for maintenance plan records.

4.  Select a maintenance case to open the Case details panel and perform the following to update the record:

    1.  State: Update the maintenance case details by changing the maintenance plan state \(Draft, Work in progress, Complete, and so on\).

    2.  Assigned to: Select a user to assign this case.

    3.  Assigned to group: Select a user group to assign this case.

    4.  Select **Update**.

5.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definitions** &gt; **Scheduled jobs**.

    1.  Search for Workplace Maintenance Management in the Application Column.

    2.  **Workplace Maintenance Nightly run**: This scheduled job runs every 48 hours \(end of day tomorrow\) and generates maintenance cases for maintenance plan records.

    3.  To execute the schedule job before the scheduled time, select **Execute Now**.

        The scheduled job checks for active plan records with a **Next Run time** \(duration-based schedule\) or **Next run value** \(meter-based schedule\) and checks for a schedule template in a plan record. When it finds a schedule template, it creates maintenance cases.
