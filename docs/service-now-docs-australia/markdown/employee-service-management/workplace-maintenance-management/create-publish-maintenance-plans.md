    For more information, see [Create or copy a maintenance schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-maintenance-management/create-maint-schedule.md). For more information about how the scheduled job creates maintenance cases for a plan record, see [Workplace planned maintenance scheduled job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-maintenance-management/sch-job-planned-nightly.md).

10. Select **Save**.

11. Select **Publish**.

    The maintenance plan is published. A contextual sidebar is available for you to search for schedules, view workplace maintenance case details, and view attachments for a plan.

    **Note:** The **Publish** option is not available when you select **Skip Scheduling**. You must open the maintenance plan again separately and select **Publish** to publish the plan.

    The published maintenance plan is available for you to view in a calendar view. For more information, see [Maintenance plan calendar view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-maintenance-management/cal-view-overview.md).

12. Review the maintenance plan details on the calendar view.

    Status of the maintenance plan moves to the **In progress** state. For more information about the calendar view, see [Maintenance plan calendar view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-maintenance-management/cal-view-overview.md).

    The **Schedules tab** shows the **Next run time** for a scheduled job. The scheduled job **Workplace Maintenance Nightly run** runs every 48 hours \(2 days\) and creates maintenance cases for active plan records.
