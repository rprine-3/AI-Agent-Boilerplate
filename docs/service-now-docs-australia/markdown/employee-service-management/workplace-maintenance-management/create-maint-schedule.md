# Create or copy a maintenance schedule

After creating a maintenance plan, define a maintenance schedule for a maintenance plan. Define duration or meter-based schedules for your assets or locations on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Maintenance schedules are duration or meter based. For example, on the Maintenance Schedule form, select Duration or Meter as the trigger for replacing a printer ink cartridge. Define the maintenance schedule duration as three months and the paper sheets as 10,000. The schedule is triggered when the paper sheets need refill and the printer ink cartridges are replaced based on this trigger. The maintenance schedule populates the **Next run time** \(duration-based schedules\) and **Next run value** \(meter-based schedules\) in the Plan Service configuration. Maintenance schedule job checks for a maintenance schedule template in a plan record and creates maintenance cases.

For more information, see [Create plan service configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-maintenance-management/create-maint-service-config.md) and [Workplace planned maintenance scheduled job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-maintenance-management/sch-job-planned-nightly.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Central.**

2.  Select the **Preventive Maintenance** tab.

3.  Select open a published maintenance plan from **My Plans** or **All plans**.

6.  Search for a maintenance plan name from the list.

7.  Select **Copy**.

    An existing schedule is copied over to a maintenance plan item.

    **Note:** You can also create a maintenance schedule if copying a schedule isn’t the best option for a maintenance plan.

8.  To create a schedule, select **Create schedule**.

    The New Schedule form opens. Fill in the form fields.

-   **Meter**: Maintenance to be performed based on count. Based on your selection, **Every** and **Field** options appear. For example: Change the printer cartridge after every 1000 printed sheets.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Trigger type \(Duration\)

</td><td>

Trigger type determines the schedule run time interval duration \(weekly, monthly, annual, and so on\).\[Omitted image "wsd-create-durationbased-schedule.png"\] Alt text: Duration-based schedule for a maintenance plan.

For a duration-based schedule, complete the following field information:

**Interval**: For example, select a duration from the drop-down options. For example: **Weekly**

Repeat: Repeat interval hours. For example: 1 hour.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Trigger type \(Meter\)

</td><td>

For meter-based schedule, complete the following field information: \[Omitted image "wsd-create-schedule-meter-based.png"\] Alt text: Meter-based schedule for a maintenance plan.

-   **Table**: Workplace Location or Model. Selected by default. The selection depends on your selection of Model \(asset\) or Location while creating a maintenance plan. For more information, see [Create and publish maintenance plans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-maintenance-management/create-publish-maintenance-plans.md).
-   **Field**: Field value for the trigger type. Select a value from the drop-down options. For example, **Start Date and time**.
-   **Every**: The repeat interval duration. The number of occurrences that must be recorded before the maintenance plan is executed. Takes an integer-based value and the value must be greater than zero \(0\). For example: 2 days.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Minimum lead time in days

</td><td>

Applicable only for a duration-based schedule and takes integer-based values \(For example: 2\). Number of days prior to the scheduled due date to determine the date on which the work should begin. That date is pre-filled in the Scheduled start field for the task. This field appears when Duration is selected for Trigger. The scheduled job ensures that the **Next run time** duration has the lead time value considered \(Next run time value = Next schedule target date - Lead time\).

For example, if your **Due day of week** is next week Monday and your lead time is 2, then your lead time is Friday \(the current week\). By Friday, the maintenance plan schedule is assigned to a Workplace Manager or administrator for executing or triggering the schedule next week Monday.
