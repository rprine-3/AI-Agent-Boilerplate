# Setting up Contact Tracing

Configure system properties, scheduled jobs, script includes, Wi-Fi access log integration, and outreach notifications to aggregate contact tracing information for various data sources.

In Contact Tracing version 1.29.4. and above, the navigation path is not available in the application context menu search \(**All** &gt; **Contact Tracing**\) for Zebra MotionWorks and Devvio. The following application modules are not available in the application search context menu Contact Tracing version 1.29.4:

-   Handheld/Wearable Access Management \(separator\)
-   Wearable Access Register
-   Devvio \(Separator\)
-   Devvio Users Risk Report
-   Devvio Users Risk Report Import Set

The navigation path is available if you are using Contact Tracing 1.29.2 and later versions.

Get contact tracing information from various data sources such as workplace locations, work shifts and reservations, badge scans, Wi-Fi access logs, and self-reporting logs. Use these data sources to identify potentially exposed users by running the diagnostic request in the Emergency Exposure Management application.

## Identifying potentially exposed users using tracing systems

A tracing system is configured for each contact tracing data source. Review the tracing systems for data sources to see whether these tracing systems meet your business needs. You can modify these tracing systems or set up a new tracing system for your data source.

For more information, see [Set up a tracing system for an exposure data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-exposure-management/set-up-tracing-system.md).
