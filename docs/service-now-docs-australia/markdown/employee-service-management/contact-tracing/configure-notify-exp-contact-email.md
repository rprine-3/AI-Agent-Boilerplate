# Configure an email notification for an exposure notice

Configure an email notification to use in the Emergency Outreach to send to potentially exposed contacts in an exposure case to notify them of potential exposure from an affected employee.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notifications** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Notifications**.

2.  Review the existing **Notify Exposed Contact** email notification to familiarize yourself with the script and other settings.

3.  Click **New**.

4.  In the **Table** field, select the Exposure Notice \[sn\_imt\_tracing\_exposure\_notice\] table.

5.  On the **When to send** tab, complete the following settings.

    2.  Set the **Conditions** criteria to **\[User.Active\]\[is\]\[true\]** and **\[Notification count\]\[changes\]**.

    3.  In the **Advanced condition** field, enter the following code:

        ```
        var exposedContactNotificationSysId = '<your-sys_id>';
        answer = current.outreach.notification == exposedContactNotificationSysId;
        
        ```

        Replace the &lt;your-sys\_id&gt; variable with the sys\_id notification that you're adding by right-clicking in the header, selecting the **Copy sys\_id** option, and pasting the sys\_id into the code line.

6.  On the **Who will receive** tab, open **Users/Groups in fields** and select **Assigned to**.
