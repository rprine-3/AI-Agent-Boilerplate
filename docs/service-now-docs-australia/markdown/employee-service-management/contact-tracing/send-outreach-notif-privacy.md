# Send an Emergency Outreach notification for employee privacy consents in Contact Tracing

Send an Emergency Outreach notification, on demand, to employees to provide the privacy policy and seek their consent to use their data for contact tracing.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have the Emergency Outreach application installed. For details, see [Install Emergency Outreach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-outreach/install-emergency-outreach.md).

Employees must have the Now® Mobile app installed on their phones to receive mobile push notifications. For more information, see [Now Mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-mobile-employee-experience/mobile-employee-experience.md).

Role required: sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin or admin

## About this task

**Important:** The privacy consent notification is sent to a user only once even if the user is in the target audience of multiple privacy consent notifications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Emergency Outreach** &gt; **View Outreaches**.

2.  Open the **User Privacy Consent** outreach record.

3.  On the **Safe Workplace Audience** tab, select the audience from the list, and click **Save**.

    If you don't have an audience defined, click **New** and define an audience from user lists, groups, departments, locations, and so on. After you save the Safe Workplace audience, you can use it to send any outreach message.For more information, see [Add a Safe Workplace Audience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-readiness-core/add-safe-workplace-audience.md).

4.  On the **Content configuration** tab, select **Privacy Consent** in the **Response mode** field.

5.  Enable the outreach to provide location-specific privacy consents by selecting the **Use Country** option on the **Content configuration** tab.

    When enabled, the privacy statement text in Location Privacy Configuration takes precedence over text in the privacy consent templates. This text is used for the outreach, system notification email, and push notification. If you need to update the text that users receive, you must change the location's privacy statement.

    For more information on updating a location's privacy statement, see [Generate location-based privacy configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-readiness-core/generate-location-common-privacy-configuration.md).

6.  On the **Content configuration** tab, select a notification in the **Notification** field, and choose how to send the notification.

    -   To send the notification by email, select the **Email notification** check box.
    -   To send a mobile push notification, select the **Now Mobile Push notification** check box.

        This option is available only if the ServiceNow NowMobile App Screens and Applet Launcher \(com.glide.mobile-employee\) plugin is activated.

        Push notifications use the ServiceNow Request Application notification device. When a user registers their mobile application to an instance, this notification device is automatically created in their notification preferences. Ensure that this device is active for the users that you want to receive the push notification.

7.  Review the message content.

    -   For email notifications, review the email subject and email body and modify it if necessary.
    -   For push messages, review the message details.
8.  Click **Update**.

    The target audience and content configuration changes are saved.

9.  To send the notification, click **Schedule**.

10. In the Scheduled Script pop-up window, click **Execute Now**.


## Result

The notification is sent to the target audience.

**Note:** The outreach notification is not sent to any users in the selected audience who do not have a location set in their user profile or whose privacy consent is disabled in the [location privacy configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contact-tracing/generate-location-privacy-configuration.md).

## What to do next

[Review user privacy consents in Contact Tracing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contact-tracing/review-privacy-consents.md) to see who has responded to the notification.
