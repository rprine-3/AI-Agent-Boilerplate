## About this task

When you configure an email notification for use as a daily contact log, you are creating a customized email notification for contact tracing purposes. The **Employee Daily Log Alert** and **Daily Contact Log Notification** are email notifications you can review for a better understanding on how notifications similar to the one you might create are configured.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notifications** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Notifications**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the notification.

4.  In the **Table** field, select the Daily Log Acknowledgements \[sn\_imt\_tracing\_daily\_log\_acknowledgement\] table.

5.  On the **When to send** tab, set the conditions.

    -   Enter conditions in the condition builder to define when users are sent the email notification.
    -   Copy the following example script in the **Advanced condition** field and make these modifications.
        -   Give the variable a different name, for example, *employeeCheckInAcmeSysId*.
        -   Enter the new notification sys\_id as the value.
        -   Enter the variable name that you declared at the end of the second line.
    Example Advanced condition script:

    ```
    var employeeCheckInAcmeSysId = '<replace with this notification sys_id';
    answer = current.employee_check_in.notification == employeeCheckInAcmeSysId
    
    ```

6.  On the **Who will receive** tab, select from **Users** and **Groups** to determine who will receive the notification.

7.  Complete the remaining information on the **What it will contain** tab.
