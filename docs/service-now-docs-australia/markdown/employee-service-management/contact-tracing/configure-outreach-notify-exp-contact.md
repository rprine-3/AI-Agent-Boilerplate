# Configure an Emergency Outreach notification for the exposure notice

Configure an Emergency Outreach notification to send email and mobile push notifications to potentially exposed employees in an exposure case to notify them of a potential exposure from an affected employee.

Ensure that you have the Emergency Outreach application installed. For details, see [Install Emergency Outreach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-outreach/install-emergency-outreach.md).

Employees must have the Now® Mobile app installed on their phones to receive mobile push notifications.

 Push notifications use the ServiceNow Request Application notification device. When you register the mobile application to an instance, this notification device is automatically created in the user's notification preferences. Make sure that this device is active for the users that you want to receive the push notification.
