# Generate location-based privacy configurations for Contact Tracing

As an administrator, generate the privacy configuration for locations set up in your instance.

## Before you begin

The privacy statement in the default template is copied in each location's privacy configuration. Ensure that you have reviewed the privacy statement in the default consent template and modified it if necessary.

Role required: sn\_imt\_tracing.admin

## About this task

You can generate a location-based, default privacy configuration for each country available in the Locations \[cmn\_location\] table. For each location, you can specify whether the privacy consent is required and update the privacy policy statement.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Contact Tracing** &gt; **Privacy** &gt; **Location Privacy Configuration**.

2.  Click **Generate Location Configurations**.

    The default configuration is created for each country and appears in the Location Privacy Configurations list.

3.  Open a location to review its configuration and modify it if necessary.

4.  Configure the privacy consent text if necessary.
