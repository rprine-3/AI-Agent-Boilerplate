# Train the similarity solution for similar knowledge articles

Train the Similar Knowledge articles for UR solution definition to identify and predict knowledge articles using the short description. When an agent opens a universal request, similar knowledge articles are displayed in the Related Search section of the Universal Request record.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Ensure that you have installed Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\) and Predictive Intelligence for \(com.snc.universal\_request.ml\) plugins are activated.

**Note:** A minimum of ten thousand records are needed to train the classifications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Predictive Intelligence** &gt; **Similarity** &gt; **Solution Definitions**.

2.  In the Similarity Definitions list, search for and select the Similar Knowledge articles for UR \(ml\_sn\_sn\_uni\_req\_global\_similar\_knowledge-articles-for-ur\) solution.

3.  On the form, verify the default field values and customize the solution as required.

    For more information about the Similarity Definition form fields, see [Create and train a similarity solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-similarity-solution.md).
