# Create your service-specific assignment groups

Set up your service-specific groups and assign the necessary roles and users. The users in the group inherit the roles of the group, so you do not have to assign roles to each user separately.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Here are a few good practices for creating groups:

-   Create one group for administrators and assign the admin role to this group only.
-   Create as many groups as needed in your organization. For example, you can create a HR department specific assignment group or IT specific group. Assign the necessary users to those groups, and then assign the staff role to those groups.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Groups**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For more information, see [Create a user group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateAGroup.md).

4.  Click the lock icon beside the **Type** field.

    If the field is not visible, configure the form to add it.

    The **Type** field expands.

5.  Click the reference lookup icon and select the **\[application\]** type.

6.  Right-click the form header and select **Save**.

7.  Add the roles to the **Roles** related list.

8.  Add users to the **Group Member's** related list.

9.  Click **Update**.
