# Train the classification solution to predict the assignment group

Train the Universal Request classification solution definition to identify and predict an assignment group using the short description and create service level tickets that are associated with the universal request.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Ensure that you have installed Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\) and Predictive Intelligence for Universal Request \(com.snc.universal\_request.ml\) plugins.

Set the **Enable universal request auto categorization** property to true by navigating to **Universal Request** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**. Enabling this property enables the application to use the **Universal Request Classification solution** for UR.

2.  In the Classification Definitions list, search for and select the Universal Request Categorization \(ml\_universal\_request\_categorization\) solution.

3.  On the form, verify the default field values and customize the solution as required.
