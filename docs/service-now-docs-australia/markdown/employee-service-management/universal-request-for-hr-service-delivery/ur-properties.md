The primary ticket is handled based on the transfer reason and no new primary ticket is created.

-   **Department:** If this transfer type is selected, then based on the **Transfer Action** and **Service** selected, the UR is transferred back to the service level or department assignment group. The primary ticket is handled based on the transfer reason.

**Note:** If the **Service** is disabled, then a general primary task is created for the selected department.

-   **Service:** If this transfer type is selected, then based on the **Action** and **Service** selected, the UR is transferred back to the service level or department assignment group. The primary ticket is handled based on the transfer reason. For `Transfer to department` transfer action:
    -   If no service is selected, a general inquiry primary ticket is created for the selected department.
    -   If a specific service is selected, a primary ticket is created for the selected service.
