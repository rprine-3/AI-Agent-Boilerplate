</table>|AI agents|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Universal Request departmental ticket creator|Automates the routing of universal requests to appropriate departmental ticketing systems by analyzing department predictions and creating properly configured HR cases or IT incidents with all necessary field mappings and reference tracking.|
|Record field value prediction AI agent|Predict fields of an incoming task/record by gathering incoming task sys\_id. It can also provide a summary and justification of the field predictions.|

**Important:** All agentic workflow and AI agent records are read-only by default.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first duplicate the agentic workflow, and then do the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn't necessary.

For more information about duplicating an agentic workflow, implementing access control lists, and activating the required components, see the following topics:

-   [Duplicate an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md)
-   [Activate an agentic workflow template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-aia-use-case.md)
-   [Modify an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/modify-ai-agent.md)

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Important:** Some generative AI skills, AI agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).
