## Create a universal request in Agent Workspace

The Universal Request is a task that a requester creates from any of the following sources, such as mobile application, service portal, agent workspace, or using a virtual agent chat. As a routing agent, you can create universal requests from the Universal Request application on behalf of the requester to track and resolve issues.

## Create a Universal Request from an Interaction Record

Convert an Interaction Record to a Universal Request from the Universal Request Agent Workspace.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_uni\_req.routing\_agent or admin

### About this task

Consider the following scenario. An IT service desk agent with a routing agent role receives a phone call on a request and creates a new call record or an Interaction Record with the notes. After reviewing the record, the agent realizes that the request belongs to HR and not IT. In this case, the IT Agent can create a Universal Record from the interaction record and assign it to the HR assignment group.

**Note:** Universal Request is not automatically created when a fulfiller creates a department ticket from an Interaction Record. You have to perform few manual steps to get this. For more information, see [Create universal request automatically for department tickets via other channels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/universal-request-for-hr-service-delivery/autocreate-ur-from-interactionrecord-WS.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Agent Workspace Home**.

2.  From the navigation list, click **Interactions** &gt; **My Interactions**.

3.  Open the interaction record for which you want to create a Universal Request.

4.  Click the **Create UR** button

5.  Click **Save**.


## Cancel a universal request in Agent Workspaces

Change the state of the universal request to **Canceled** to cancel the request if the issue is resolved already or you no longer require the request.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

You can cancel a universal request only if there are no active or closed primary tickets attached to it. Also, the state of UR must be either **New** or **In Progress**. When the UR is canceled, email notifications are sent to the stakeholders associated with the request.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Agent Workspace Home**.

2.  From the navigation list, click **Universal Request** &gt; **Open**.

3.  From the list of open universal requests, select the request you want to cancel.

4.  Select **Canceled** from the **State** field.

    **Note:** If the person in **Opened for** tries to cancel the request, then they must enter the reason for canceling.

5.  Click **Update**.


## Use Agent Assist in Agent Workspace

Find similar Universal Requests that are open and closed, Knowledge articles, Catalog items, and Pinned articles using the Agent Assist capability in the Agent Workspace.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_uni\_req.routing\_agent or admin

## Transfer primary ticket in Agent Workspaces

You can transfer a primary ticket back to Universal Request, service set \(department\), or service either with resolution or without resolution.

### Before you begin

Role required: No specific role is required. Agents part of the assignment group or assigned-to agents on the primary ticket can perform this task.

\[Omitted image "route-to-ur-aws.png"\] Alt text: Click to transfer the task

A routing agent can either resolve and close a primary ticket or transfer it to back to UR or another department for review and closure. When a primary task is transferred back to UR, the ticket is no longer a primary ticket and the primary ticket field of the universal request becomes empty.

When transferring the ticket, the routing agent can choose the department and a specific service within the department or can just choose `I'm not sure` when they are not sure of the department or service to transfer to.

When you transfer a ticket back to universal request, you can transfer it with one of the following reasons:

-   **Transfer with resolution**

    The request is resolved and transferred back to UR, a specific department, or service. Agents can choose this option when another department's help is required to fulfill the request.

-   **Transfer without resolution**

    The request is not resolved or does not belong to the specific department, and is transferred back to UR.


\[Omitted image "route-dialog-aws.png"\] Alt text: Choose transfer reason

Configure the **sn\_uni\_req.transfer\_type** property in the **Universal Request properties** page to determine how to handle the primary ticket transfers. For more information, see [Universal Request properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/universal-request-for-hr-service-delivery/ur-properties.md).

### Procedure

3.  Click **Transfer**.

    **Note:** Based on your transfer type configuration, the given fields are displayed. For more information, see [Universal Request properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/universal-request-for-hr-service-delivery/ur-properties.md).

    -   **Department**: Select the department from the list.
    -   **Service**: Select the specific service of the chosen department.
    -   **Transfer reason**: Select the reason from the list.
    -   **Transfer notes**: A brief description for routing the primary ticket that you want to pass to the UR Routing agent.
    -   **Copy additional comments and attachments**: Deselect if you do not want to transfer the ticket with additional comments and attachments. By default, all attachments and comments are transferred.

        **Note:** Work notes are not copied while transferring.

5.  Click **Transfer**.

    The ticket is transferred based on the transfer and transfer type configuration.
