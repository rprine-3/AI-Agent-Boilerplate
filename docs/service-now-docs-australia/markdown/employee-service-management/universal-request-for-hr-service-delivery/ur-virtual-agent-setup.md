# Set up Virtual Agent for Universal Request

Use Virtual Agent \(VA\) capabilities to provide a better user experience for your chat channel using the ServiceNow® Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) model. Publish and use the default Virtual Agent topics for Universal Request.

## Before you begin

To use VA capabilities, you must activate the following plugins:

-   Activate the Universal Request: Virtual Agent Conversations plugin \(com.snc.universal\_request.va\) to set up and use Virtual Agent in Universal Request. This plugin installs the Virtual Agent topics that must be made active. By default, the topics are set to inactive.
-   Activate the Universal Request: NLU Model for Virtual Agent Conversations plugin \(com.snc.universal\_request.nlu\) to set up and use the NLU model for Virtual Agent conversations.

Role required: admin

You can also copy and modify the default topics or create your own topics to use during the chatbot conversations.
