# Universal Request states and reasons

The Universal Request \(UR\) state is determined by the state of the primary ticket. The primary ticket for a UR is a child department ticket, such as an IT incident or a HR case. A Universal Request can have only one primary ticket at a time.

Given are some examples of the impact of the primary ticket on UR:

-   If there is no primary ticket, then the Standard Ticket configuration for UR determines requester page view of the UR ticket.
-   If a child IT incident is the primary ticket of a UR, then the Incident Standard Ticket configuration determines the requester page view of the UR ticket.
-   If a child HR case is the primary ticket of a UR, then the Case Standard Ticket configuration determines the requester page view of the UR ticket.

## UR states and state reasons

The Universal Request \(UR\) state describes where in the life cycle the UR request is.
