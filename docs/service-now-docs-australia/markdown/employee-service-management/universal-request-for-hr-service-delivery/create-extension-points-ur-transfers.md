# Create an extension point for post-processing of transfers

Create a scripted extension point to perform additional actions after the cross-department transfer of a primary ticket in the Universal Request application. You can change the sample extension point to copy any additional information from the previous primary ticket's child entities.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When a primary ticket of a Universal Request is transferred, the current mapping configuration only copies the information from the primary ticket to the destination ticket. However, if you want additional actions to be performed after the cross-department transfer of the primary ticket, you can create a scripted extension point implementation for the **DepartmentTransferPostProcessor** extension point. A sample **DepartmentTransferPostProcessor** extension point, which is based on your business requirements, is provided for you to modify and use.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** **&gt;System Extension Points** **&gt;Scripted Extension Points**.

2.  In the search bar, search for **sn\_uni\_req.DepartmentTransferPostProcessor**.

3.  Create your department-specific extension point by selecting **Create implementation**.
