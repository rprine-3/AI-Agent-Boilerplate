# Activate Universal Request Integration for Incident management

You can activate the Universal Request: Integration for Incident management plugin \(com.snc.incident.universal\_request\) if you have the admin role. Activating this plugin enables ServiceNow Incident Management application integration with Universal Request. This plugin includes demo data and activates related plugins if they are not already active.

## About this task

This plugin allows the Incident \(incident\) table to participate in Universal Request \(UR\) flows. The plugin activation ensures incidents can be created, tracked, and managed within the same framework used for URs and Universal Tasks—streamlining multi-step, cross-functional work.

## Before you begin

Before installing the Universal Request Integration for Incident management \(com.snc.incident.universal\_request\) plugin, install the Universal Request plugin.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
