# Standard Ticket page for Universal Request

The Universal Request standard ticket page enables requesters to view the details of their universal requests from the Service Portal.

A requester can view the aggregated and simplified view of the UR activity and all activities from one or more child department tickets \(primary tickets\). Using the UR standard ticket page has the following advantages:

-   A ticket reference number \(UR number\) that is always consistent for the requester, even when the request is transferred between various departments.
-   The UR state details that is derived from the mapping between the UR states and the states of the primary ticket associated with UR. With this state mapping enabled, the requester sees only the UR state.
-   An activity stream that shows a logical and sequential record of comments to and from any fulfiller who worked on the UR or its primary tickets.
-   An info region that displays department-specific fields of the current primary ticket. For example, configure the page to show **Opened For** and **Subject Person** fields from a child HR case, or to show **Caller** and **Urgency** fields from a child IT incident.

The Standard ticket page configuration for UR tickets enables you to determine what you want to display as a view. By default, a Universal Request Standard Ticket configuration is available that you can use and customize. Information displayed in different sections of a standard ticket page depends on the individual request type.

**Note:** If you are upgrading from a previous release and want to use the Standard Ticket page for your department, ensure that you enable the **Page Route map** in Service Portal. For more information, see [Enable the page route map for standard ticket page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/config-pageroutemap-stpage.md).

</table>When a routing agent chooses not to share additional comments or attachments while routing, a system-generated message displays in the header and activity stream. However, the requester can view all comments in the activity stream.

When a user clicks to view the Standard Ticket page from a department ticket that was previously a primary ticket of the UR, then the Standard Ticket configuration validates and displays a message asking the user to open the latest page that displays only the activity streams and attachments. The following image displays the message containing a link to open the latest activity stream.
