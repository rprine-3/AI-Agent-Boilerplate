# Configure a catalog item or record producer to create a universal request

Create a universal request along with a requested item or task-based record to provide unified ticketing experience.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Only when the Universal Request plugin \(com.snc.universal\_request\) is activated, the **Universal Request Config** section is added to a catalog item or record producer form.

A universal request is not created for the following scenarios:

-   Cart with multiple catalog items is checked out
-   Order guide is submitted

For information on creating a catalog item, see [Create or edit a catalog item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_DefineACatalogItem.md).

For information on creating a record producer, see [Create a record producer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_DefRecProdInSCat.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Definitions** &gt; **Maintain Items**.

2.  Select the required catalog item or record producer.

3.  In the Catalog Item or Record Producer form, configure these fields in the **Universal Request Config** section.
