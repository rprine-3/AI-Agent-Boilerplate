</table>    When All day **Reservable Module** setting is set to **Default** on the Reservable module configuration, you see the actual time when you’re making a reservation. For example, if you’re making the reservation at 11.24 am, reservation start time shows **11.24**. Start and end time for a reservation are based on the building time zone and reservation properties for setting office hours.
