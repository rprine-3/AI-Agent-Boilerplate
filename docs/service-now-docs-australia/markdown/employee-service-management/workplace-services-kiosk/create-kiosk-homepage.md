# Create a kiosk homepage

Create a homepage configuration that is displayed when a user opens the kiosk device.

## Before you begin

**Note:**

-   The kiosk device automatically maintains the session before it times out. The session timeout value can be configured in the **glide.ui.session\_timeout** property.
-   The kiosk header contains the session refresh API; ensure that you do not remove or replace the kiosk theme or the kiosk header.

    For information about customizing the kiosk header, see [Customize the kiosk header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-services-kiosk/customize-kiosk-header.md).
