# Create a return to work case from an injury or illness

## Before you begin

Ensure that the following conditions are met:

-   The Human Resources Scoped App: Core \(com.sn\_hr\_core\) plugin is not installed on your instance. For more information on activating it, see [Activate Case and Knowledge Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/activate-case-and-knowledge-management-scoped.md).
-   **Employee** is selected in the **Person type** field on the injury and illness record. For more information, see [Injury and illness fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/hs-injury-illness-form.md).
