# Monitoring and analyzing safety incident metrics

The **Incident Management** tab of the Health and Safety dashboard provides a comprehensive view for monitoring and analyzing safety incident metrics, including incident counts, injury data, observation trends, and action tracking across various organizational levels.

For any selected period and location, you can drill down into detailed data, empowering your teams to respond faster, improve conditions, and build a safer workplace.

When you have the Generative AI plugin installed, you can view the incident pattern analysis tab on the dashboard. For more information, see [Incident pattern analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-health-and-safety/hs-incident-pattern-analysis.md).

## Prerequisites

-   Ensure that the Health and Safety Incident Management application is installed. For more information, see [Install Health and Safety Incident Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/install-hs-incident-mgmt.md).
-   Configure total annual hours for an establishment. For more information, see [Add total hours worked for an establishment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/add-hs-total-hours-worked-establishment.md).
-   Run the **\[OHS\] Safety Metrics** scheduled job to update the safety metrics on demand. For more information, see [Configure scheduled job to generate frequency rates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/configure-job-generate-frequency-rates.md).

    **Note:** The **\[OHS\] Safety Metrics** job is set to run daily by default.


## Required roles

-   sn\_ohs\_im.manager, sn\_ohs\_im.agent, or sn\_ohs\_im.compliance\_manager, needed to see dashboard home page. The metrics on each tab are dependent on the user's access to that table.
-   sn\_ohs\_im.admin and the following roles, to edit the dashboard:
    -   pa\_admin, to edit the Performance Analytics \(PA\) components used in the dashboard.
    -   ui\_builder\_admin, to edit the dashboard visualizations that are built using the UI Builder.

## Access the Health and Safety Incident Management metrics

Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace** and select the **Incident Management** tab on the Health and Safety dashboard.

**Note:**

-   To view a high-level summary of key incident metrics such as the total incidents and recordable injuries, select the **Highlights** tab.
-   To view top incident metrics with data broken down by each establishment for localized analysis, select the **Establishment Metrics** tab. Use the **Establishment** filter in this tab to show the data by establishment.

## Metrics on Incident Management tab
