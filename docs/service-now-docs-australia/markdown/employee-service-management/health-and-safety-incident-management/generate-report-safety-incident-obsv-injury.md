# Generate a report for a safety incident, observation, or injury

Generate a report for a safety incident, observation, or an injury that you want to export for your regional or industry-specific requirements.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.manager, sn\_ohs\_im.agent, or sn\_ohs\_im.operations\_manager

## About this task

The report generation uses a report field mapping for your reporting PDF template. A report field mapping includes mappings of fields from the safety record \(such as incident or observation\) to the fields in the reporting PDF template. When generating a report, the exported PDF fills in information from the selected safety record through mapped fields. This field mapping, therefore, speeds up the report filling for incidents, observations, or injury and illness records. For more information on report field mapping, see [Create a safety report field mapping for generating reports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/create-safety-report-field-mapping.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the Incident Management icon \(\[Omitted image "list-icon-hs.png"\] Alt text: Incident Management icon.\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, open the safety incident, observation, or injury and illness list.

    -   For the safety incidents list, select **Safety Incidents** and then **All**.
    -   For the safety observations list, select **Safety Observations** and then **All**.
    -   For the injury and illness list, select **Injury / illnesses** and then **All**.
4.  In the list, open a safety record to generate a report for.

5.  Select **Generate report**.

6.  In the **Generate report** dialog box, select a report mapping in the **Select report** field.

    In the **Select report** field, the following report mappings are available:

    -   Published report mapping forms.
    -   Report mappings assigned to your role or with no assigned roles.
7.  Select **Generate**.


## Result

-   The report is generated based on the selected report mapping and its PDF template.
-   The PDF template is automatically filled with the values from the selected safety record.
-   Based on the attachment option in the selected report mapping, the generated report is available in one of the following locations:

    -   **Attachments** section of the safety record.
    -   Downloaded to the browser.
    For more information, see [Health and Safety report field mapping form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/hs-report-field-mapping-form.md).

-   If the selected report field mapping includes one or more related lists, a separate related list report is generated in addition to the main report. It is available in the same location.
