# Submit a safety incident as an employee

Submit a safety incident through the Employee Center to report it to the safety department for an investigation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.requestor

## About this task

If there's an emergency, you can use the Health and Safety contacts knowledge article to access the emergency contact list. This knowledge article includes the local health and safety team contact numbers, emergency response numbers, or any other contacts that employees can use if there’s a health and safety incident or emergency.

To open the emergency contacts knowledge article from the Employee Center, navigate to **Health and Safety** &gt; **Policy and procedures** &gt; **Health and Safety contacts**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Employee Center**.

2.  In the Employee Center, select the **Health and Safety** menu and then select **Health and Safety Incidents**.

    -   Select **Report Health and Safety Incident - Basic** to report an incident with basic information.
    -   Select **Report Health and Safety Incident - Advanced** to report an incident that includes its detailed information such as injured people, injury details, hazards, and assets involved in the incident.
3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:**

    -   The map loads when the **Use map location** check box is selected. On the map, the Google search box can be used to find the exact location of the incident or observation.

        For more information on configuring the visibility of the Google search box on the map, see [Configure the location search bar visibility on the map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/hs-configure-property-hide-map-location.md).

    -   The **Contractor** option appears only when the Health and Safety Contractor Management \(sn\_hs\_crm\) application is installed on your instance. For more information, see [Additional features in Health and Safety](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/install-hs-incident-mgmt.md). The field only lists users who have the \[snc\_external\] role assigned to them and have their Health and Safety profile created. For more information, see [Assign Health and Safety profile to a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/assign-hs-profile-user.md).
4.  If you have selected the **Report Health and Safety Incident - Advanced** form, use the **Describe the event** section to add more details about the incident.
