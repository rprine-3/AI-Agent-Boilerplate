# Work on an anonymous safety concern

Only an agent with the sensitive content role \[sn\_ohs\_im.sensitive\_observation\_content\_user\] can view and work on the anonymous report in the Health and Safety Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.sensitive\_observation\_content\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the incident management icon \(\[Omitted image "list-icon-hs.png"\] Alt text: Incident Management icon.\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, select **Safety Observations** and then **All**.

4.  Open the anonymous safety observation to work on and change the state to work in progress.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    -   The **Opened by** field automatically displays **Anonymous reporting user** for an anonymous safety incident.
    -   The comments that the agent adds in the **Details** related item reflects in the anonymous report.
    -   In the **Details** related item, the sensitive content field indicates that the incident contains sensitive information. This field is automatically selected when the anonymous safety concern is created. Only a user with a sensitive content role can view a report marked as sensitive.
    -   The **What was observed** field displays the responses of the anonymous reporter to the Health and Safety concern form.
6.  Record the following information related to the observation.

    You can record this information in any order as needed.

    1.  In the **Assets** tab, select **New** to associate an asset to the observation.

        The fields related to the selected asset are auto-populated from the asset record.

    2.  In the **People involved** tab, select **New** to add people involved in the observation such as witnesses and collaborators.

        -   For a description of the field values, see [People Involved form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/hs-people-involved-form.md).
        -   If an observation involves more than one person, add a record for each.
        -   To modify the record of an existing person involved, select it in the list to open it and update.
    3.  In the **Root cause analysis** tab, select **New** to perform the root cause analysis for the observation.

        The application includes the Five whys technique of root cause analysis. You can add as many root cause analyses as you need to an observation.

7.  Add an action based on your root cause analysis.

    For more information, see [Add an action for a safety incident or observation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/add-hs-action.md).

8.  Record your findings that you gathered about the observation.

    You can use these sections to add your findings:

    -   **Attachments** section to attach findings in the form of image, video, and documentation such as a signed witness statement.
    -   **Activity** section to add findings in the form of free text. You can also use this section to add links to related knowledge base articles.
9.  Generate a report for the safety observation, if needed.

    For more information, see [Generate a report for a safety incident, observation, or injury](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/generate-report-safety-incident-obsv-injury.md).

10. [Close the safety observation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/close-hs-incident-observation.md) after all activities are complete.
