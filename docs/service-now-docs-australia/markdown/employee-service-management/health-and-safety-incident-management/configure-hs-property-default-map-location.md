## About this task

This property is required to set a default coordinate for the map when using the map location feature to report an incident or an observation.

The Geo map component \[sn\_geo\_map\] must be installed to use this feature. For more information, see [Activate a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md).

2.  In the **Default map location fields**, enter the latitude and longitude.

3.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The latitude and longitude are saved as the default coordinates that loads while completing the Health and Safety incidents or observation form.
