# Event type extension points in Workforce Optimization for HR

Use extension points to call scripts for event categories such as meeting, time off, or work time.

To see a list of extension points that you can use for Workforce Optimization for HR, navigate to **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**. In the Extension Points list, open the sn\_shift\_planning.EventManagerextension point.

Use scripted extension points to integrate customizations without altering the core components in the application code. When customizing a base application, you implement the scripted extension points by creating the custom script includes and registering them against the scripted extension points.
