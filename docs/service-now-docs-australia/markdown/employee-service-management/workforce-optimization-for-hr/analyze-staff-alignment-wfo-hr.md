# Analyze staff alignment using Demand Forecast in Workforce Optimization for HR

Use Demand Forecast to plan the number of staff members that you require so that you have enough agents to do the job.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_agent\_forecast.user

## About this task

Using Demand Forecast, you can:

-   Monitor agent or team shift coverage for any day or week.
-   Analyze if you are overstaffed, understaffed, perfectly staffed, or not aligned well with your staffing needs.
-   Adjust the staff alignment depending on the coverage you need and the schedule of your teams.
-   Analyze staff alignment as you are creating a schedule.
-   You can analyze the agent coverage you have and the actual demand for the number of agents based on assignment groups and work shifts in a day.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Click the Schedule \(\[Omitted image "schedule-new.png"\] Alt text: Schedule icon\) icon.

3.  Click the **Team Calendar** tab.

4.  Analyze staff alignment for each shift.

5.  You can click the filter icon and select the assignment groups and shift plans for which you want to view the staff alignment.

Do the following

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d379192e127">

**For each day**

</td><td>

Select **Day** from the list.The **Total resources needed** row displays the demand for the number of agents for that day at the selected intervals of 15,30, and 60-minute.

 For example, at 15-minute intervals, a number 16 between 0700 and 0715 means that the agent demand forecast is 16.

 The time slots are color-coded as below to show the coverage of agents in a particular interval:

|Highlight color for each day for a group|Description|
|----------------------------------------|-----------|
|Green|The number of agents you have scheduled for that interval and demand for that interval are an exact match—your staffing needs are perfectly aligned.|
|Yellow|The number of agents you have scheduled are more than the demand you have for that interval.|
|Red|The number of agents you have scheduled are less than the demand you have for that interval.|
|Grey|The demand for the number of agents and the number of agents scheduled is zero for that interval.|

</td></tr><tr><td id="d379192e214">

**For a given week**

</td><td>

1.  Select **Week** from the list.

The **Total coverage/demand** row has indicators for the staff alignment.

    |If the row displays|Then|
    |-------------------|----|
    |An arrow points downward|The predicted forecast is lower than the number of agents you need for that day|
    |An arrow points upward|The predicated forecast is higher than the number of agents you need for that day|
    |A check mark|The perfect alignment of the predicted forecast and the required number of agents.|

2.  Click any of the indications displayed in the **Total coverage/demand** row to analyze further details on the forecast.
 You can also view the coverage and demand for every hour for each group.
