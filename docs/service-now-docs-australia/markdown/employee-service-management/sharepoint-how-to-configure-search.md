    To know more about how to exclude sites, see [Exclude sites from indexing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/how-to-exclude-sites-indexing.md).


## Result

The sites, subsites, folders, and files are indexed and displayed in your search results. Use filters to verify the progress and manage the indexing status by navigating to **SharePoint Online Search Connector** &gt; **SharePoint Sites**.

After site indexing is complete, you can search and discover the site content from multiple channels, like Employee Service Center, Service Portal, Now Mobile app, and Virtual Agent. For more information, see [SharePoint Online Search Connector search results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/using-search.md).

## What to do next

**Remove Index**: Select the indexed site and click Remove Index to remove the site from indexing. On success, all the sites, drivers, and files are removed from the respective tables and the connector is updated to read only with the Deleted status.
