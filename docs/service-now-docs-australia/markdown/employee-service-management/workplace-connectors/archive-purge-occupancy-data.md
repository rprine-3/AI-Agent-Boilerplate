# Archive and Purge space occupancy data

Archive and purge the Space Occupancy data \(sn\_wsd\_wc\_space\_occupancy\) table after every five days.

## Before you begin

The Archive rule **Archive Space Occupancy table at the end of everyday** runs every day to archive data from the Space Occupancy data \(sn\_wsd\_wc\_space\_occupancy\) table and archives it in the **Archived Space Occupancy** Table \(ar\_sn\_wsd\_wc\_space\_occupancy\). The Archive Destroy Rule **Destroy Space Occupancy archived table after every 5 days** purges data from Archived Space Occupancy Table \(ar\_sn\_wsd\_wc\_space\_occupancy\) after every five days.
