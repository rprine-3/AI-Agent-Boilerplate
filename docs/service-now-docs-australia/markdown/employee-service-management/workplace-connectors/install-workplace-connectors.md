# Install Workplace Connectors

Install the Workplace Connectors application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Before you begin

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

Ensure you have the following plugins:

-   Workplace Connectors
-   Workplace Central
-   Workplace Core

Complete the following setup instructions:

1.  Navigate to **Subscription Management** &gt; **Subscriptions** in your instance.

    The list displays the subscriptions that your organization has purchased.


Use the following details when required:

-   Application ID: sn\_wsd\_wc

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the application by using the filter criteria and search bar.

    Search for the application by its name \(Workplace Connectors or ID \(sn\_wsd\_wc\). If you can’t find the application, you may have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

3.  Select **Install**.
