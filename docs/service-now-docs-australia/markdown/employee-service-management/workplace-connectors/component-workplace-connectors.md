Providers \(sn\_wsd\_wc\_provider\)

</td><td>

Stores Space Occupancy sensor data provided by occupancy data providers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connector Configuration\[sn\_wsd\_wc\_connector\_config\]

</td><td>

Configures a connector to connect with the integration framework. This configuration fetches the data from the integration to workplace applications.This table holds information about the workplace connectors that are defined in the application. For example, Badging data, Occupancy sensors, and so on. This table can also process data for each of the connectors through extension points.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Employee Attendance Data \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_employee\_attendance\_data\]

</td><td>

Employee Attendance data table is the target table to which data is imported from the source table \(Badging data table\).This table holds badging data information of employees, like user id, badging time along with any other event defined in the connectors.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Provider Execution\[sn\_wsd\_wc\_provider\_execution\]

</td><td>

Stores all the scheduled job execution timestamps. Every time the scheduled job **Process Provider data** record runs, this table has an entry for the last query time. The time taken to import data from the source table \(Badging data\) to the target table \(Employee attendance data\) table is updated in the **Last query time**.
