# Career tab in Employee Center

View update, and manage all aspects of your career using the **Career** tab in Employee Center.

Role required: sn\_skills\_int.emp

The **Career** tab contains various widgets to manage your work data like, experience, aspirations, and skills in your profile.

**Note:** The **Career** tab and the widgets are activated with the installation of the Skills Foundation application driven by the sn\_skills\_int.enable\_skills property. For more information, see [Add the Career tab in the Employee Profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/talent-development-core/add-career-tab.md).

## Role details

View your business title, role group and your role specialty that accurately reflect your position in the organization and enable you to get personalized skill recommendations.

**Note:**

-   The Business title is derived from the Employee position table \(sn\_employee\_position\) where the primary role is marked as true because an employee can have multiple job profiles.
-   The Employee position table updates whenever the HR profile table \(sn\_skills\_int\_job\_profile\) is updated.
-   A scheduled job synchronizes the HR jobs table \(sn\_hr\_core.job\) and HR profiles table, ensuring accurate data during integration.
-   The Job code in the Job profile table \(sn\_skills\_int\_job\_profile\) and HR jobs table \(sn\_hr\_core.job\) should match for the Role specialty to be populated.

## Shared aspirations

View objectives that enable you to excel in your career and also promote growth in your organization. Aspirations can be based on your interest, skill, or role. For more information on aspirations, see [Create a Talent Development Aspiration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/talent-development-core/egd-create-aspirations.md).
