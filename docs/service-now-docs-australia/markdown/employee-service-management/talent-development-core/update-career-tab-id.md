# Use a custom tab for the Career tab in Skills Foundation

Use a custom tab as a replacement for the **Career** tab in Employee Profile by updating the tab ID so employees are redirected to this custom tab.

## Before you begin

Create a custom tab to display skills-related content in the employee profile. For more information on creating a tab, see [Manage profile tabs and visibility in Employee Profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/manage-employee-profile-tabs-visibility.md).

Role required: sn\_skills\_int.admin, sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Access the sys\_id of the custom tab.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Profile** &gt; **Profile Tabs**.

    2.  Select the tab that you want to use instead of the **Career** tab.

    3.  Select the Additional actions icon \(\[Omitted image "additional-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions icon\) and select **Copy sys\_id**.

2.  Access the sn\_skills\_int-tab\_id system property.

    1.  Select **All**.

    2.  In the navigation filter, type `sys_properties.list`.

    3.  Search for `*skill` in the **Name** field.

    4.  Select sn\_skills\_int.tab\_id.

    5.  In the **Value** field, replace the existing value with the sys\_id of the customized tab.

    6.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The employee will be directed to the customized tab to view and modify the skills in Employee Profile.
