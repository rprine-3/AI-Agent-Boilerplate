# Creating a job level progression

Create a progression from one job level to another to identify the growth path in your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skills\_int.job\_arch\_admin, sn\_skills\_int.job\_arch\_editor

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Job Architecture** &gt; **Job Families**.

2.  Select **Job Level Progression**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  Set the beginning and end of the job level progression.

    **Warning:** Make sure not to create more than one vertical progression from the same starting job level. For example, if an X to Y vertical progression exists, then an X to Z vertical progression is not allowed. Similarly, don't create more than one vertical progression to the same target job level. For example, if an X to Z progression exists, then a Y to Z progression is not allowed.

    1.  Set the beginning of the job level progression by selecting a job level in the **From job level** field.

    2.  Set the end of the job level progression by selecting a job level in the **To job level** field.

    **Note:** A job level progression for the same level is also possible, for example, IC1 to IC1 where both IC1s belong to different role groups.

5.  Mark the direction of the progression in the **Type** field.

    -   **Vertical** - The progression for an employee is within the same role group
    -   **Lateral** - The progression for an employee is either within the same role group or related role groups \(sn\_skills\_int\_related\_role\_group\).
6.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

A job level progression record is created.
