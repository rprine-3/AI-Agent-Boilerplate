    -   Summary - Overview of skill matches.

    -   Previously mapped - Skills that have been mapped in the previous import.

    -   Errors - Skills with errors. For example, missing description, missing Level type and so on.
    -   Incomplete - Skills that don’t have data in the required fields.
    -   Duplicate in source - Skills that exist more than once in the source file.
    -   Ignored from upload
    -   All - All the uploaded skills.
    You can edit the incomplete skills, duplicate skills, or skills with errors at this stage and correct them before the actual upload.

12. Select **Upload skills**.

    **Note:** The skills with errors are not uploaded.

    The upload process takes some time to complete depending on the number of skills imported. For example, uploading a thousand skills takes around five minutes.

    The uploaded skills are analyzed by AI Search and are displayed in the following tabs.
