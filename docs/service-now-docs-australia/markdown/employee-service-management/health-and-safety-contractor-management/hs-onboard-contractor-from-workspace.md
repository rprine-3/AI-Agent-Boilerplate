## About this task

A new contractor can be added to an existing contractor company in the company list that can be viewed in the Health and Safety Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_crm.contractor\_coordinator

## Procedure

2.  Add a contractor.

**From a contractor company record**

</td><td>

1.  Select the contractor management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-contractor-mgmt.png"\] Alt text: Contractor management icon\) to open the **Contractor Management** tab.
2.  In the **Lists** tab, select **Contractor companies** and then select **Active**.
3.  Open the company that you want the contractor added to.
4.  In the **Workers** tab, select **Add**.

**Note:** A list of all users with the \[snc\_external\] role is displayed. Selecting a user from this list creates a Health and Safety profile for them and add them to the contractor company.

5.  Select the check box for one or more contractors to add to the contractor company and select **Add**.

**From Health and Safety user profile list**

</td><td>

1.  Select the configuration icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-config.png"\] Alt text: Configuration icon\).
2.  In the **Lists** tab, select **Health and safety profiles** and then **Active** and then select **New**.
3.  On the form, fill in the fields and select **Save** to add the contractor in the workers list.

**Note:**

    -   The **Type** field must be set to contractor. Only the users with \[snc\_external\] role appear in the **User** list. When the form is saved, the role \[sn\_hs\_csc.contractor\] is assigned to the contractor. This role is needed to access the Contractor Service Center.
    -   Select the company in the **Company** field for the contractor to appear in the company's worker tab.

**Note:** If the company isn’t selected, the Health and Safety profile for the contractor is still created with the correct roles to access to the Contractor Service Center, but the contractor doesn’t appear under any contractor company.
