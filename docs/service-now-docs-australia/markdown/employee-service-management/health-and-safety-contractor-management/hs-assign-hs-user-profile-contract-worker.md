# Assign Health and Safety profile to a contractor worker

Assign the Health and Safety profile to all contractor workers who need to complete assigned tasks to work at your site.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_crm.contractor\_coordinator

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the configuration icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-config.png"\] Alt text: Configuration icon\).
