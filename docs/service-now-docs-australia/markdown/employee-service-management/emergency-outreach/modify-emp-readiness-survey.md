# Modify or add Employee Readiness Surveys

Review the Employee workplace readiness survey that is installed with the Employee Readiness Surveys app. Modify the survey, or create one or more surveys to use based on the readiness concerns that you want to address and any legal obligations under applicable law, including data protection laws.

## Before you begin

Familiarize yourself with [Survey administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_SurveyAdminTasks.md). Then meet with other emergency response team stakeholders to plan the changes to the survey. Decide whether to edit the existing survey before you send it to employees, or to create one or more new surveys.

Role required: sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin, survey\_creator, survey\_admin, or admin

## About this task

Users with the sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin role have the survey\_creator role, and are made owners of the default readiness survey. Users with the survey\_creator role can edit or copy the default survey. These users can also add another readiness survey and add other users as owners to collaborate with them.

## Add additional Employee Readiness Surveys

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin, survey\_creator, survey\_admin, or admin

### About this task

Consider how you want to begin to reopen your workplace, and what you must understand about the employees before you can begin. Work with a user with the survey\_admin role in your company to plan the types of questions and responses for the survey. For information about adding surveys, see [Survey administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_SurveyAdminTasks.md) and [Survey designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_SurveyDesigner.md).

### Procedure

-   To create a survey, navigate to **Surveys** &gt; **View Surveys**.

-   Select **New** or **Survey Designer** and enter the information to complete the survey from the plan that you made.

    Decide on a naming convention to use for surveys, so that a user with the sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin role knows which one to select when sending outreach surveys. For example, **Readiness survey India** or **Customer service employees return readiness**.
