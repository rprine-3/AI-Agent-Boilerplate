# Configure Emergency Outreach notifications

A user with the admin role can add email notifications to use for any of the apps that communicate using Emergency Outreach. Each app provides a default email notification as an example to help with planning a new notification.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin and sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin

## About this task

The Emergency Outreach notification feature supports the following applications and base system outreach notifications.

-   Emergency Outreach: Request employee response indicating health status.
-   Employee Readiness Surveys: Send a survey link with questions to determine employee readiness to return to the workplace.
-   Employee Health Screening: Request that employees acknowledge their health status verification each day before they can return to the workplace.
-   Contact Tracing:
    -   Schedule an email notification to request that employees in the workplace list other employees they were in contact with.
    -   Schedule an email notification to request that employees review the organization's privacy policy and provide their consent to use their data for contact tracing.
    -   Send an email notification to potentially exposed contacts in an exposure case to notify them that they might have been potentially exposed to an affected employee at the workplace.
