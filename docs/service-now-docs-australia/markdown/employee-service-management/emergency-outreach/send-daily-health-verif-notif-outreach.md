# Send notifications for daily health verification

Use Emergency Outreach to notify users to report their daily health status.

## Before you begin

Users must have the Now® Mobile app installed on their phones to receive mobile push notifications. For more information, see [Now Mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-mobile-employee-experience/mobile-employee-experience.md).

Note the following requirements to be able to send and receive SMS notifications:

-   Your company must have a Safe Workplace suite subscription and Employee Readiness Core installed.
-   Your company must have a Twilio account and phone number.
-   The Notify plug-in and the Notify-Twilio Direct driver must be enabled.
-   The Label for your number in **Notify** &gt; **Messages** must be set to **Outreach**.

For more information on configuring Notify and the Notify-Twilio Direct driver, see [Notify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/notify-landing-page.md).

Role required: sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Emergency Outreach** &gt; **Send Outreach**.

2.  Enter a name that describes the purpose of the outreach notification.

    For example, `Global daily health verification` or `London office daily health verification`.

3.  In the **Description** field, describe the purpose for sending the outreach.

4.  On the **When to run** tab, specify when the outreach should be sent.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d192703e175">

**To send the notification on demand**

</td><td>

Keep the default **Mode** value of **None**. The outreach is sent when you select **Send Notification**.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d192703e193">

**To schedule the notification**

</td><td>

1.  Set the mode to **Scheduled**.
2.  In the **Run** field, indicate how often the outreach should be sent. The options are **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Once**.
    -   For daily outreaches, enter the time that you want to send the outreach. You can specify hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, enter `17:30:00` to send the outreach at 5:30 p.m. If you don't want the outreach to be sent on certain days of the week, select those days in the **Exclude** field.
    -   For weekly outreaches, select the day of the week and the time you want to send the outreach.
    -   For monthly outreaches, select the day of the month and the time you want to send the outreach. If you select a day that does not exist in all months, for example `31`, the outreach will run on the last day of the month.
    -   For outreaches that are only sent once, schedule the date and time that you want to send the outreach in the **Starting** field.
3.  \(Optional\) To send the outreach based on the time zone set in the user profile, select the **Send in local time** check box.

The outreach messages reference a send time based on the time zone of the user sending the notification. For example, if the sender is in the US Pacific time zone, an outreach scheduled to be sent at 4:30 p.m. shows a send time of 16:30:00 for users in that time zone and 18:30:00 \(6:30 p.m.\) for users in the US Central time zone because the Pacific time zone is two hours earlier than the Central time zone.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:**

    In prior releases of Emergency Outreach, notification scheduling was configured by selecting **Schedule** and entering details in a pop-up window. Scheduling is now configured on the **When to run** tab.

    Scheduled outreaches that you sent prior to upgrading provide the previous scheduling function if you need to resend it. This functionality provides the flexibility to set up new scheduled outreaches and to resend prior scheduled outreaches.

5.  Identify who will receive the outreach notification through either the Emergency Outreach or Safe Workplace application.

**Emergency Outreach standalone**

</td><td>

On the Select targeted audience tab, select the combination of users to send the outreach notification to. Choose from user lists, groups, departments, locations, or other search filters such as building, cost center, or country code.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d192703e324">

**Safe Workplace**

</td><td>

On the Safe Workplace **Audience** tab, select the name of the audience to send the outreach notification to.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Click **Save**.

    The outreach details are saved and related lists appear. You can use the Additional Channels related list to specify additional custom channels to use when you send the notification. Other related lists are populated with outreach recipients and their statuses after you send the notification.

7.  Click the **Content configuration** tab and select the response mode **Daily Health Verification**.

8.  On the **Content configuration** tab, specify how to send the outreach notification.

Clear the **Email** check box.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d192703e402">

**Select a different notification**

</td><td>

Click the lookup icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-lookup.png"\] Alt text: Click icon to look up a notification\) and select **Daily Health Verification**.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d192703e421">

**Review and edit the introductory message**

</td><td>

Modify the subject and body. The notification includes the link to the daily health verification form that the user can submit in the instance or mobile app.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d192703e433">

**Send a mobile push notification**

</td><td>

1.  Select the **Now Mobile Push Notification** check box.

The check box is active if the ServiceNow NowMobile App Screens and Applet Launcher \[com.glide.mobile-employee\] is activated. The push notification content appears when the check box is active.

2.  Modify the push message text as desired.
 Push notifications use the ServiceNow Request Application notification device. When mobile application is registered to an instance, this notification device is automatically created in the user's notification preferences. Ensure that this device is active for the users that you want to receive the push notification.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d192703e463">

**Send an SMS notification**

</td><td>

1.  Select the **Message via SMS** check box.
2.  Modify the SMS message text as required.

**Note:** For existing outreaches, if **Message via SMS** is selected, then the **SMS message** is not autopopulated.

3.  Click **Save**.
 A daily health verification link is not sent when you send an SMS notification. Users respond to the SMS message directly with their status.

 SMS reply options are dynamically populated from the Response Options table \[sn\_imt\_checkin\_response\_option\].

</td></tr><tr><td id="d192703e504">

**Use a custom notification channel**

</td><td>

1.  Click the Additional Channels related list, click **Edit**, and move the channel to the Additional Channels List.
2.  Click **Save**.
 If the **Email notification**, **Now Mobile Push notification**, and **Message via SMS** check boxes are selected, all four notifications are sent. To use only the custom notification channel, clear these three check boxes.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>9.  Click **Send Notification**.

    The notification is sent immediately or at the time specified on the **When to run** tab. As responses are received, they appear in the Health Verification Acknowledgements related list. New records are created for each day in the Health Verification Acknowledgements related list for each user included in the target audience.


## What to do next

Review the daily health verification acknowledgements. Resend the notification to users who have not responded for the day. If a user submits a response via a previous day notification, the status is updated for the notification of the latest date sent to the user.

For example, say you send the daily health notification to Zane from August 1 to August 10. If Zane uses the link in the notification sent on August 4, then the acknowledgement status for Zane is updated in the notification sent on August 10.
