# Emergency Outreach

Notify users of important information about anticipated or occurring emergency situations. Send an outreach notification via email, mobile push message, or SMS message to request a user response. You can also configure other preferred communication channels.

Emergency Outreach was developed with other ServiceNow® Emergency Response Management apps to monitor and aid in stopping the community spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 among users. With the release of additional ServiceNow® Safe Workplace suite apps, companies are able to manage an emergency situation from the outbreak through the reopening of the workplace.

Some of the Safe Workplace suite apps leverage the Emergency Outreach notification feature to communicate with users.

-   [Employee Readiness Surveys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/safe-workplace/employee-readiness-surveys.md) provides an outreach notification with a link to a survey to assess user readiness to return to the workplace. Customize the notification and the survey to address your company’s concerns.
-   [Employee Health Screening](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/safe-workplace/employee-health-screening.md) uses outreach notifications to request that users submit their health status verification each day before they can return to the workplace.
-   [Contact Tracing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contact-tracing/contact-tracing.md) uses the following outreach notifications:
    -   An outreach notification to request that users in the workplace provide a list of users that they were in contact with throughout the day. The daily log notification can be scheduled and sent at a certain time every workday or as needed. Keeping daily logs enables contact tracers to follow up with impacted users when a user is affected.
    -   An outreach notification to request that users review the organization's privacy policy and provide their consent to use their data for contact tracing.

    -   An outreach notification to potentially exposed contacts in an exposure case to notify them that they might have been potentially exposed to an affected user at the workplace.

**Note:** Safe Workplace suite apps require a subscription. Install Emergency Outreach first, then install the Safe Workplace suite app.

-   **Use guided setup to implement Safe Workplace suite apps**

    The Safe Workplace guided setup provides a sequence of tasks that help you configure the Safe Workplace and Emergency Response Management applications on your ServiceNow instance. To open the Safe Workplace guided setup, navigate to **Guided Setup** &gt; **Safe Workplace Guided Setup**. For more information about using the guided setup interface, see [Using guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/guided-setup.md).


## Use with other Emergency Response Management applications

The Emergency Response Management applications, built on the ServiceNow AI Platform®, assist organizations in their emergency response efforts. With the [Emergency Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-exposure-management/emergency-exposure-management.md) application, you can identify users who might have been exposed to affected users. Through the [Emergency Self Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-self-report/emergency-self-report.md) application, users can self-report their health status. Managers can track the health status of their direct reports so that work can be reassigned and response teams can monitor the overall data and trends. Both applications are available in the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

## Emergency Response Management for federal customers

Federal customers using IL4 or FedRAMP environments will see the Emergency Response Management applications ready and available to install on their instances without having to make any special requests. Customers are responsible for configuring the apps to meet U.S. federal regulations and guidelines.
