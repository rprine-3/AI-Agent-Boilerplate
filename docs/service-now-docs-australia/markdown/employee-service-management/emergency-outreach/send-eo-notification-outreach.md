# Send notifications for an emergency

Use Emergency Outreach to notify users to report their health status. Use Emergency Outreach also to quickly notify users of important information if there is an emergency.

## Before you begin

Users must have the Now® Mobile app installed on their phones to receive mobile push notifications. For more information, see [Now Mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-mobile-employee-experience/mobile-employee-experience.md).

Note the following requirements to be able to send and receive SMS notifications:

-   Your company must have a Safe Workplace suite subscription and Employee Readiness Core installed.
-   Your company must have a Twilio account and phone number.
-   The Notify plug-in and the Notify-Twilio Direct driver must be enabled.
-   The Label for your number in **Notify** &gt; **Messages** must be set to **Outreach**.

For more information on configuring Notify and the Notify-Twilio Direct driver, see [Notify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/notify-landing-page.md).

## About this task

Emergency Outreach is available in the ServiceNow Store without a subscription. The base system provides a notification that requests a response from the recipient regarding their health status. The responses are stored as outreach records and the health status is updated each time the user responds with a change.

Some of the Safe Workplace suite apps leverage the Emergency Outreach notification feature to communicate with users. The Safe Workplace suite apps provide more flexible functions than using Emergency Outreach as a standalone app.

-   Employee Readiness Surveys provides notification with a survey link to assess user readiness to return to the workplace.
-   Employee Readiness Core provides the ability to use Safe Workplace audiences to simplify the selection of recipients for an outreach.
-   Employee Health Screening: Request that users acknowledge their health status verification each day before they can return to the workplace.
-   Contact Tracing supports these outreach notification needs:
    -   A scheduled notification for returning users to fill out a daily contact log.
    -   A request to review the organization's privacy policy and provide consent to use their contact tracing data.

The following procedure is applicable to the use of Emergency Outreach as a standalone app or with Safe Workplace suite applications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Emergency Outreach** &gt; **Send Outreach**.

2.  Enter a name that describes the purpose of the outreach notification.

    For example, `Global health status check-in` or `London office health status check-in`.

3.  In the **Description** field, describe the purpose for sending the outreach.

4.  On the **When to run** tab, specify when the outreach should be sent.

**To send the notification on demand**

</td><td>

Keep the default **Mode** value of **None**. The outreach is sent when you select **Send Notification**.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d460810e265">

**To schedule the notification**

</td><td>

1.  Set the mode to **Scheduled**.
2.  In the **Run** field, indicate how often the outreach should be sent. The options are **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Once**.
    -   For daily outreaches, enter the time that you want to send the outreach. You can specify hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, enter `17:30:00` to send the outreach at 5:30 p.m. If you don't want the outreach to be sent on certain days of the week, select those days in the **Exclude** field.
    -   For weekly outreaches, select the day of the week and the time you want to send the outreach.
    -   For monthly outreaches, select the day of the month and the time you want to send the outreach. If you select a day that does not exist in all months, for example `31`, the outreach will run on the last day of the month.
    -   For outreaches that are only sent once, schedule the date and time that you want to send the outreach in the **Starting** field.
3.  \(Optional\) To send the outreach based on the time zone set in the user profile, select the **Send in local time** check box.

The outreach messages reference a send time based on the time zone of the user sending the notification. For example, if the sender is in the US Pacific time zone, an outreach scheduled to be sent at 4:30 p.m. shows a send time of 16:30:00 for users in that time zone and 18:30:00 \(6:30 p.m.\) for users in the US Central time zone because the Pacific time zone is two hours earlier than the Central time zone.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:**

    In prior releases of Emergency Outreach, notification scheduling was configured by selecting **Schedule** and entering details in a pop-up window. Scheduling is now configured on the **When to run** tab.

    Scheduled outreaches that you sent prior to upgrading provide the previous scheduling function if you need to resend it. This functionality provides the flexibility to set up new scheduled outreaches and to resend prior scheduled outreaches.

5.  To identify who will receive the outreach, perform one of the following actions.
