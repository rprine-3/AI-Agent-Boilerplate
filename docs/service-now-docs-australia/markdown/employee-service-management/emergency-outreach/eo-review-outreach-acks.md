# Review Emergency Outreach acknowledgements

Review the list of acknowledgements from an outreach notification to see each employee's status. Resend the outreach notification to employees who did not respond.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_checkin.checkin\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Emergency Outreach** &gt; **View Outreaches** and open the outreach notification to view.

    Responses are listed in the Outreach Acknowledgements related list. As employees respond to the notification, their records are updated with their status and whether they responded by email, mobile, or SMS.

    If employees haven't responded yet, click **Resend Notification**. The notification is sent again only to employees who have not yet responded.

    **Note:** If employees update their status in a subsequent email, the employee’s record is updated in the original event and in the dashboard. Employees cannot change their status through mobile push notifications.

    When an outreach is sent using a custom notification channel, a Delivery Logs related list appears in the outreach record. It lists successful and failed log records for the notification that you sent.

    Depending on how the notification channel was created, success messages can show the number of notifications that were successfully sent, and the total number of notifications that were requested. If the total count is higher than the sent count, the difference is the number of notifications that failed.

    Open the record and investigate the cause of the errors. Correct the cause of the failures, or use another notification method for the users whose notification was not sent.

2.  View the Emergency Outreach dashboard, which summarizes data from employee notification events.

    1.  Navigate to **Emergency Outreach** &gt; **View Dashboard**.

    2.  Review the accumulated notification data and trend.

    3.  Click an event in the **Events** pie chart to show its data.
