# Health and Safety case form

Safety case manager can use the safety case form to resolve health and safety questions that they receive from employees.

When a health and safety question is submitted, it creates a safety case. Some of the fields on the case form are populated from the request from which it is created.

After the case is assigned, a safety agent fills out the fields on the case from Health and Safety Workspace.
