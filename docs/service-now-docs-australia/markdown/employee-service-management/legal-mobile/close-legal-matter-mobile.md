# Close a legal matter through Mobile Agent

Close a legal matter assigned to you when you complete all activities for resolving it, or if you find that it doesn’t need any further action.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_matter.matter\_fulfiller

## Procedure

1.  In the Mobile Agent, navigate to the **Assigned Matters** list.

2.  Tap an assigned matter.

3.  Tap **Close Complete**.

4.  In the Close Matter screen, enter comments in the **Comments** field describing the resolution of the matter or why it is being closed if not resolved.

5.  To close related legal requests along with the parent request, tap **Close related requests** and select **Yes**.

    Only related legal requests that are in the Assigned or Work in Progress states are closed.

6.  Tap **Submit**.


## Result

-   The legal matter is closed and its state updates to Closed Complete.
-   If the parent legal request of the matter is not associated with any other open matters, the request is also closed.
-   If you chose to close all related requests also, then they are also closed if they meet the following conditions:
    -   The state of those requests is either Assigned or Work in Progress.
    -   Those requests are not associated with any other open matters.
-   Comments entered in the Close Matter screen are posted in all the open related requests.
