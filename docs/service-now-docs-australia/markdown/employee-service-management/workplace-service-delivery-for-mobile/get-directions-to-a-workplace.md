# Get directions to a workplace

View the directions from one workplace location to another using the Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile.

## Before you begin

The Workplace Space Mapping application must be installed.

**Note:** The **Get Directions** option appears only if the workplace has a floor map defined and a map provider is selected as **Indoor Mapping** or **Mappedin** in Map Properties.

Native mobile Indoor Mapping capabilities are dependent on the Tokyo family release.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## About this task

Using the Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile, get directions for workplace from any of the following locations:

-   From your current or any location to a colleague's workplace directly. The workplace location of your colleague is fetched from their ongoing reservation or from their workplace profile.
-   From the My reservations page to get directions to a reserved workplace.

**Important:** If the colleague has privacy enabled, then, you cannot view any of their details.

## Procedure

1.  On your mobile device, open the Now Mobile app.

2.  **Note:** When using the Now Mobile app, the privacy setting will apply for all spaces in the reservation.
