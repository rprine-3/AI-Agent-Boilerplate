# Scan the QR code to reserve a space

Scan the QR code of a workplace and quickly reserve a space using the Now Mobile app.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the ServiceNow® mobile app.

    The Mobile home page is displayed.

2.  You can also select a space from **My favorites** and reserve a space.

3.  Select a space.

4.  Tap **See my reservations** to see your existing reservations for a selected space.

    Select a space from the list of spaces to view the Reservation Information screen. For more information about the Reservation Information screen, see [Make a reservation using the Now Mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-service-delivery-for-mobile/make-a-reservation-on-mobile.md).

5.  Tap **Reserve** to reserve a location for a selected space.

6.  Space details screen is displayed with the quick reservation option for a day.

7.  Perform the following steps:

    1.  Reserve available time slot: Select a time slot for your reservation.

        -   Suggestion for available reservation time slots is displayed in horizontal blocks with a scroll bar.
        -   To view the time slots in a vertical list, select **View all**.

            The time slot duration is dependent on the **Max duration**and **Min duration** values configured by your administrator in the Reservable Module configuration. For more information, see [Configure a reservable module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-reservation-management/config-reservable-module.md).

            The time displayed in the time slot considers the Start time of the working day \(sn\_wsd\_rsv.day\_start\) and End time of the working day \(sn\_wsd\_rsv.day\_end\) properties set by your administrator. If office hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, then all the available reservation slots between 9 to 5 are divided into 2-hour intervals \(based on the values that you’ve provided for Max and Min duration\). However, if there are any existing reservations, then these aren’t displayed. Only available time slots for a reservation are displayed. If the available slot for a reservation is from 9 AM to 12 PM, and the maximum duration for a meeting is two hours, then 9–11 is the first time slot and 11–12 is the next time slot.

            For example, If the Max duration is two hours and the Min duration is 30 minutes. The office timings are from 9 AM to 5 PM, and a space \(Building A, Floor 3, Meeting room 1\) has two existing reservations. The first reservation is from 9 AM to 1.45 PM and another reservation is from 2 PM to 3 PM. Then, 3 PM to 5 PM can be the next time slot.

        **Note:** QR code reservation is not supported for **All day** reservation. Multi-day and recurring reservation is also not supported for QR code reservations.

    2.  Check availability: Manually select a Start date and time and End date and time for your reservation. If you try to select a past date or select any future dates, tThe time is reset to the current date. Time durations can be changed.
    3.  The Schedule view shows the time slot in vertical bars. Select the chevron icon \( \[Omitted image "chevron-right-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: chevron icon to move forward in the scheduled view calendar\) to move forward or select the icon \(\[Omitted image "chevron-left-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: Chevron icon to move backward in the scheduled view calendar\) to go back and check the reservation time slot availability for a day.

        The selected time slot \(Step 9a\) is highlighted in green on the scheduled view. Existing reservations and unavailable time slots show shaded blocks. Vertical lines indicate a 1-hour duration while the dotted lines indicate a 30-minute duration.

    4.  If the selected time slot isn’t available or if the selected space is not available, a validation message is shown. Users can use the **Nearby spaces** option to check for available spaces or check for next available time slot. **Nearby spaces** section shows list of spaces that are nearby the scanned space and are available for reservation.
    5.  Select **View details** to see the space details.
8.  Tap **Reserve** to make your reservation.

    Check in your reservation by the start time and check-out the reservation after it ends. Open your reservation to check in directly using the My Reservations option on the home page.
