# Create a reservation for a day in Workplace

Reserve your preferred workspace in Workplace using the Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile app.

## Before you begin

View your workday presence schedule, office as well as remote days in the schedule calendar.

Employees can plan their hybrid workplace schedule and modify workplace presence preferences \(in-office, Remote, and visiting another office\) in Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile. Employees can view their preferred in-office days and get insights on their preferred collaborators. They can reserve a space by selecting their preferred workspace and collaborators.

Get insights on workplace collaborators who plan to be in office on the days when you are in office. Change your workplace preferences and workplace presence information as and when required to maximize workplace productivity and collaboration. If no collaborators are available in your in-office days, update your in-office presence days to match it along with that of your preferred collaborators.

Make sure that you have the following applications:

-   Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile
-   Workplace Core
-   Workplace Reservation Management
-   Workplace Concierge
-   Indoor Mapping
-   Workplace Central
-   Workplace Space Management

    The location pin changes to a blue pin icon \( \[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-location-pin-icon.png"\] Alt text: Blue pin location icon.\). The workplace screen appears for you to coordinate your workdays and collaborate with your preferred collaborators.

4.  Tap and select a date labeled as **In-office** day on the calendar to make a reservation.

    The Schedule calendar view shows the current date as selected by default. The text label **Today** is displayed for the current date of a month. When you select a future date,the label for **Today** is inactive. This label is not available for making bulk reservations.

    1.  View your in-office, remote workday schedule for a week on the calendar.

        The calendar view shows your hybrid workday schedule \(In-office, Remote\). Use the chevron buttons on the calendar to toggle between different calendar views \(Day, Week, and Month\). Adjust your calendar view as required.

        -   Use the chevron next button \(\[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-chevron-forward.png"\] Alt text: Use the chevron next button to scroll to the next month or future months in a calendar.\) to view the next or future week when you are in a week view on the calendar.

This option is not available for creating bulk reservations.

        -   **Remote**: Option to indicate that you are working remotely or from home. When you select a remote day on the calendar, application shows the message "You are working from home this day".
