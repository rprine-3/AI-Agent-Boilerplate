# Create bulk reservations in Workplace

Create bulk reservations in Workplace using the Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile. Employee can manage multiple planned reservations from the Workplace page.

## Before you begin

Create bulk reservations using the Workplace page. Select multiple days in the Schedule calendar view and reserve all selected days simultaneously. Check in or check out reservations, edit reservations, view reservation summary details, or cancel a reservation using Workplace. Manage your reservations and presence information using your mobile app. Change your **Remote** working days to **In-office** or **Visiting another office** presence days. Select your preferred space or desk. Add or edit workplace services to your reservations.

**Note:** The **sn\_wsd\_concierge.workplace\_day\_selection\_limit** property is configured by your administration for enabling multiple days selection on the Workplace page. This property when set to an integer value \(for example, 3, 5, and so on\) enables employees to select multiple dates or days on the calendar to make bulk reservations. For example, if this property is set to 5, employees can make bulk reservations and select only five dates or days on the calendar to make bulk reservations. For more information, see [Properties installed with Workplace Concierge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-concierge/properties-installed-with-workplace-concierge.md).

If the Reservable Module Configuration property **Max days in future** is set to 5 days by your administrator, and the **sn\_wsd\_concierge.workplace\_day\_selection\_limit** property is set to 6 by your Workplace administrator, employees can select only five dates or days on the calendar for making bulk reservations. The least minimal value is selected for default bulk days selection the calendar by the application.

Make sure that you have the following applications:

-   Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile
-   Workplace Core
-   Workplace Reservation Management
-   Workplace Concierge
-   Indoor Mapping
-   Workplace Central
-   Workplace Space Management
-   Workplace Space Mapping

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the Now Mobile® app.

2.  Access your Workplace Service Delivery for Mobile instance.

3.  Tap and select the **Workplace** location pin icon \(\[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-location-pin-without-color.png"\] Alt text: workplace location pin launch icon.\) from the mobile home page.

    The location pin changes to a blue pin icon \( \[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-location-pin-icon.png"\] Alt text: Blue pin location icon.\). The Workplace page opens for you to reserve your preferred workspaces, coordinate your workdays and collaborate with your preferred collaborators.

4.  Tap the **Select Multiple days** toggle button.

    Make bulk reservations or select multiple days on the calendar to make multiple reservations at once. When this toggle button is selected, users can select multiple days on the calendar for making reservations. When you turn on the toggle **Select multiple days** the calendar is expanded by default and shows a month view.

    **Note:** If the employee selects or manually enters past timings on the reservation page, it resets to the n-1 slot. For example, if the current time of building is 2:00 PM \(n\), the available time slots are from 1:30 PM \(n-1\) onwards. When you manually enter 1:00 PM in the Start time, the time is reset to 1:30 PM \(n-1\).

    Past dates are disabled on the calendar view and are not visible to workplace employees when the **Select multiple days** toggle button is selected. Only the current date and future dates are available for selection on the calendar.

    If the Workplace Concierge property \(**sn\_wsd\_concierge.allow\_overlapping\_reservations**\) is set to **Yes**, the dates on which you are already having an existing reservation are not disabled and displayed with a dot on the calendar. If this property is set to **No**, the reserved dates on the calendar are disabled and employees cannot select those dates. If overlapping reservations are allowed, the **In office** days are selected. This also includes exceptions when the employee plans to be in the office \(changing the Remote day to In-office day\) and when the employee is visiting another office. If overlapping reservations are not allowed, only allowed days indicated as **In office** are selected. This also includes exceptions where the employee is visiting another office.

    **Note:** If the sn\_wsd\_concierge.allow\_overlapping\_reservations property is set to **false** by your workplace administrator, you cannot create an overlapping or parallel reservations for a day. You can make only a single reservation for a day.

    **Note:** If you try to select a date which is labeled as **Remote**, the Remote day is changed to an **In-office** presence day and this record is updated in the Employee Presence Exceptions table \(**All** &gt; **Workplace Concierge** &gt; **Employee Presence** &gt; **Exceptions**\). The **Location** column in this table is updated with the building name that you using to reserve a space for your **In-office** day. For more information, see [Components installed with Workplace Concierge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-concierge/components-installed-with-workplace-concierge.md).

    **Note:** You can only those number of dates on the calendar that is set by your administrator in the **sn\_wsd\_concierge.workplace\_day\_selection\_limit** property.

    If the user has no reservations for a selected day, a message appears 'You have no reservations for the this day".

    When there's no reservations for a selected workday, the application shows "You have no desk reservations for today." If you don't make a reservation, application shows "You have not made a reservation for this week's in-office day for \(&lt;date and month name&gt;\)''. If you select a remote day, application shows "You are working from home this day."
