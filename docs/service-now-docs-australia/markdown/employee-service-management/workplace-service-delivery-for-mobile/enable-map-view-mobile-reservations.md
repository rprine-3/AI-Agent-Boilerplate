# Enable map view to create reservations

Enable map view for mobile employee users so that they can reserve spaces using floor maps Now Mobile app.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.admin

## About this task

Activate the Enable Map view option. Users can view maps supported by Indoor Mapping or Mappedin while reserving a space.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Space Mapping** &gt; **Custom Map Provider** to modify the base system map provider.

    Modify the base system map provider to use one of your buildings as a key and use either your Workplace Indoor Mapping or Mappedin credentials.

2.  Mappedin: If your Map provider is Mappedin, perform the following steps:

    1.  Open the base system custom map provider record.

        This record does not have a name. If your system has multiple custom map providers, you have to identify this record by its sys\_id. To check the sys\_id of a record, right-click the record, select **Copy sys\_id** from Additional Actions on top left , and paste the sys\_id **c5d49d2265072010f87794bf508527f6** into a text document.

    2.  Modify the following fields on the Custom Map Provider form:

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Key|Table entry for which you want to configure the map provider. For example, Building1.|
        |Map provider app id|User name for the Mappedin credentials. To find the user name, navigate to **All** &gt; **Space Mapping** &gt; **Mappedin Administration** &gt; **Credentials**. Select your Mappedin Credentials and copy the user name.|
        |Map provider app secret|Your map provider's \(Mappedin\) app secret credentials.|

    3.  Select **Update**

    4.  For Mappedin, update **CustomMapDefaultProviderId** and **CustomMapConfigId** in both location\_custom\_map and locations\_custom\_map with corresponding Sys IDs.

    5.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_sg\_input\_list** to open the Inputs page.

    6.  Select and open the **location\_custom\_map** and **locations\_custom\_map** and make the following changes for both these properties:

        1.  On the Location Map View and Locations Map view page, Edit the **CustomMapDefaultProviderId** and verify that it is mapped with sys id of Mappedin associated record on the Custom map provider page \(see step 2a\).
        2.  Edit the **CustomMapConfigId** and verify that it is mapped with sys id of sys\_sg\_custom\_map\_config.list. To copy the sys\_id, navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_sg\_custom\_map\_config.list**. Select **Mapped Reservations** and copy the sys\_id and then paste it for **CustomMapConfigId**.
3.  If you have installed Indoor Mapping as your map provider, perform the following steps:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Space Mapping** &gt; **Custom Map Provider** to modify the base system map provider.

    2.  A new map provider **ServiceNow** is created for Workplace Indoor Mapping in the Custom Map Provider.

    3.  Open the base system custom map provider record to edit.

    4.  Right-click the record, select **Copy sys\_id** from Additional Actions on top left, and paste the sys\_id **5a0a15aac35301100f926ff4c840dd9a** into a text document.
