# Work with Location Directory for Now Mobile app

Work with Map view and Card view on the Location directory. Search for employees, locations, and neighborhoods. Filter spaces based on reservation status, occupancy status, and space types. Get directions to a workplace location or collaborators or a workplace profile user using floor maps. Reserve a space or raise a workplace service request or an issue for a location.

## Before you begin

Make sure that the following applications are configured:

-   Workplace Core
-   Indoor Mapping

    Filter and display reservation status for a selected location on the Location directory.

-   Workplace Connectors \(Optional\)

    Filter and display occupancy status for a selected location on the Location directory.

-   Workplace Space Mapping

**Note:** Confirm that the map properties for the Location directory are configured by your administrator. Map properties for the Location directory provide options to:

-   Filter spaces based on the reservation and occupancy states.
-   Automatically refresh reservation and occupancy data on the Location directory.
-   Control the Map display setting options to display permanent and private workplace profile users.
-   Show or hide neighborhoods for a location.
