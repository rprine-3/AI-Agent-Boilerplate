Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## Procedure

1.  On your mobile device, open the Now Mobile app.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-homepage.png"\] Alt text: Workplace Service Delivery Mobile Home Screen

    \[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-make-rsv-home-page.png"\] Alt text: Mobile home screen showing the Make a reservation option.

2.  Tap **Make a reservation**.

3.  The Make a reservation section shows the Reservable Modules.

    For example: Select **Desks**.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-mobile-reservable-module-desks.png"\] Alt text: Make a reservation screen showing Reservable Modules.

4.  In case, if you have set the Reservable Module property **Max days for multi-day** for two or more days, the **Make a reservation** screen shows the number of reservable days up to which a multi-day reservation can be made.

    The default value of **Max days for multi-day** is 1.

    If the **Max days for multi-day** value is set to 1, only single day reservations can be made and the **All day** option is enabled while making a reservation. If the **Max days for multi-day** value is set to 2 or higher value, the **All day** reservation option is disabled.

    \[Omitted image "wsd-multi-day-rsv-mob-1.png"\] Alt text: Max days for multi-day value of 7 and Max days in future of 90 days shown on the Make a reservation screen.

    The **Max days in future** is configured on the Reservable module by your administrator, the number of days in the future up to which the reservation can be made is displayed on the card. The **Max days in future** value is 1 or higher. If an employee tries to select an invalid date range, search results for a reservation aren’t returned.

5.  To make a quick reservation for any workplace, under the Quickly reserve section, tap **Reserve this location**.

    If you have set any favorite locations in the Workplace Reservation Management Reservation portal, the Quick reserve section displays your favorite location in **My favorites**.

    **Note:** The workplace type that is available in the Quick reserve section depends on the configuration made by your organization.

6.  Select a reservable path.

    Multi-day reservation is available for all the reservable paths. For example: Select Browse all.

    -   Browse all
    -   Browse near a person
    -   Browse by area
    -   Browse by neighborhood
