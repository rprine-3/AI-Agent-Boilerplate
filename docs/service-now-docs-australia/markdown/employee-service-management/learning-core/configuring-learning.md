# Install and configure Learning

Configure Learning by setting up the following dependencies.

## Before you begin

Dependent plugins and apps for Learning:

-   [Manager Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/manager-hub-overview.md)
-   [Skills Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/talent-development-core/skills-intelligence.md)

    When the Skills Foundation property **sn\_skills\_int.enable\_skills** is set to true, the use of Skills Foundation is enabled for all Learning. See [Configuring Skills Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/talent-development-core/configuring-skills-intelligence.md) for more information about Skills Foundation properties.


Role required: admin

## About this task

When an administrator installs the Learning app from the ServiceNow store, it integrates learning, skills identification, aspirations, and planning for a personal career growth and development plan.

## Procedure

1.  Go to the ServiceNow Store and find the application using the filter criteria and search bar.

    In the list next to the **Install** button, the versions that are available to you’re displayed.

2.  Select a version from the list and select **Install**.

    In the Review Installation Details dialog box, any dependencies installed with your application are listed.

3.  If you're prompted, follow the links to the ServiceNow Store to get any additional entitlements for dependencies.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select the **Load demo data** check box.

    Demo data comprises sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

5.  Select **Install**.


## What to do next

Allow RCAs

After you install Learning you might encounter Restricted Caller Access \(RCA\) approval messages requesting an update in the access request. Allow the following RCAs:

-   Target Human Resources Core
-   Target Journey Accelerator
-   Target Journey Designer

Dependencies

The Learning application depends on other applications such as Learning Core and Employee Profile.
