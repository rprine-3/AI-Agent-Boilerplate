## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Learning** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**.

<table id="table_kxp_b22_kqb"><thead><tr><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length

-   **Default value:** 16384
-   **Recommended value:**1638400
 **Note:**

You must add this system property to set the desired value.

When you synchronize third-party learning content with your ServiceNow instance, if the word count of the content being pulled into your instance exceeds the value set for this property, the synchronization will fail.

</td></tr><tr><td>

com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.serialized.val\_size\_limit

</td><td>

Specify the number of bytes allowed for runtime values in each step in the flow execution details. To prevent truncation, set the value to an integer equal to or less than zero.-   **Type:** integer

-   **Recommended value:**1638400
 **Note:** When you synchronize third-party learning content with your ServiceNow instance, if the word count of the content being pulled into your instance exceeds the value set for this property, the synchronization will fail.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:** These properties set a word limit for records that are fetched through an API call. API call fails when the word limit goes beyond the **1638400** limit.
