# Integrating Learning Core with third-party learning management systems

Connect your ServiceNow instance with third-party learning systems to pull learning content into a single repository.

## Before you begin

Role required: learning\_admin

Activating the Learning Core \(sn\_lc\) plugin automatically enables the following plugins:

-   [Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-integrations-framework.md)

The following plugins are not active by default, and you must install them to use them with Learning Core.

## Procedure

1.  Integrate your ServiceNow instance with the third-party learning source account that you plan to use.

To integrate with this third-party learning source

</th><th align="left" id="d82346e95">

Do this

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d82346e101">

**Pluralsight Skills account**

</td><td>

Use an API key to authenticate the ServiceNow requests. Follow the steps in [Set up the Pluralsight spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/setup-pluralsight-spk.md) to perform the integration.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d82346e116">

**Cornerstone OnDemand application**

</td><td>

Register an OAuth application in Cornerstone OnDemand application and authenticate requests from ServiceNow instance. Follow the steps in [Set up the Cornerstone spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/setup-cornerstone.md) to perform the integration.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d82346e134">

**Udemy application**

</td><td>

Integrate your Udemy application with your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Set up the Udemy spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/setup-udemy-spk.md)

 **Note:** You must manually configure fields such as logos and course reassignments in the learning system configuration table.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d82346e155">

**Sumtotal application**

</td><td>

Integrate your Sumtotal application with your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Set up the Sumtotal spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/setup-sumtotal.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d82346e177">

**Saba application**

</td><td>

Integrate your Saba application with your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Set up Saba spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/saba-spoke.md) .

</td></tr><tr><td id="d82346e197">

**Workday Learning**

</td><td>

Integrate your Workday Learning application with your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Set up Workday spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/saba-spoke.md) .

</td></tr><tr><td id="d82346e217">

**SuccessFactors Learning**

</td><td>

Integrate your SuccessFactors Learning application with your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Set up SuccessFactors Learning spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/successfactors-learning-setup.md) .

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    The records from the third-party content are pulled into your ServiceNow instance using an API call. To successfully run this API call, you must configure the **com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length** and **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.serialized.val\_size\_limit** properties. For more information on these system properties, see [Configure properties for Learning Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/learning-core/config-ln-prop.md) .

2.  Activate the required schedule flow to synchronize third-party learning content into your ServiceNow instance.

    For more information, see [Activate Learning Core flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/learning-core/flows-lp.md).

3.  Configure the learning system with which you want to integrate your ServiceNow instance.

    For more information, see [Configure a learning system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/learning-core/create-source-ln.md).

    **Note:** Once you set up the Learning Core application, the source record for Cornerstone OnDemand, Pluralsight, and Udemy applications are automatically created in the Source module in Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework. These source records contain a predefined set of properties and integration services. For more information, see [Sources for Learning Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/learning-core/source-lnpst.md).

4.  Refresh the entire third-party content or synchronize new and updated service content into your ServiceNow instance.

    -   To refresh the entire content, set the **full\_pull** property to **true**.

        **Note:** When the schedule flow is run for the first time, it always is a full pull irrespective of the value set in the property.

    -   To synchronize new and updated service content, set the **full\_pull** property to **false**.
    1.  Open any integration source for which you want to pull content.
    2.  Click **Run Job** to manually synchronize data.
    The integration framework pulls the corresponding third-party learning courses into the Learning External Content \[sn\_lc\_external\_content\] table on your ServiceNow instance.

    When synchronizing new and updated services, the content is populated as described in the table below.

## What to do next

To integrate Learning Core with a new third-party learning system, follow the instructions in [Create a source for a learning system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/learning-core/set-up-int-lc.md).

-   **[Sources for Learning Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/learning-core/source-lnpst.md)**  
Once you set up the Learning Core application, the source record for Cornerstone On Demand, Pluralsight, Udemy, Sumtotal, and Saba applications are automatically created in the Source module in Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework. The source records in the Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework application contain a predefined set of properties and integration services.
-   **[Activate Learning Core flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/learning-core/flows-lp.md)**  
Activate the flows that run on a schedule basis to pull learning course items from the Cornerstone OnDemand, Udemy, Pluralsight, Sumtotal, and Saba applications into the ServiceNow application.
