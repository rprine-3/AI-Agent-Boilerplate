# Using Agent Workspace for HR Case Management

As an HR agent, use the Agent Workspace for HR Case Management to interact with employees, respond to inquiries, and resolve issues.

**Note:** The COEs available to you may differ depending on the HR package you have.

-   The categorization of HR catalog items are employee-facing only, and have no relation to the categorization of HR services under the HR Centers of Excellence \(COEs\) data model.
-   If you are creating a new HR service and plan to make it available for employee self-service, see [HR catalog item configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-catalog-item-configuration.md). Creating a new HR catalog item automatically creates a corresponding HR service, and you can avoid creating duplicate services.
-   If you have an existing HR service that you want to make available for employee self-service, do not create an HR catalog item. \(Creating a HR catalog item automatically creates a corresponding HR service.\) Instead, see [Configure a record producer for an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-record-producer.md) to add the existing service as an HR catalog item in the HR service catalog.
-   The Agent Workspace for HR Case Management is highly configurable for HR agents. It supports the same functionality in the Classic HR Service Delivery Agent Workspace.

You can start work in the Agent Workspace for HR Case Management from one of these areas:

-   Landing page
-   List queue
-   Agent inbox
-   Chat
-   Phone
-   Global search

HR case form enables you to manage multiple cases, view information that is related to a case, and use knowledge articles or similar cases to manage the case.
