# Integration with Contact Center as a Service \(CCaaS\)

Implement prebuilt, certified integrations with Contact Center as a Service \(CCaaS\) providers using the ServiceNow® voice reference architecture.

## About this task

The Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\) feature enables CCaaS providers to display native voice and callback integrations so HR agents can manage customer calls directly from HR Agent Workspace.

HR agents are provided a brief wrap-up period at the end of customer conversations to complete their work before moving on to assist other customers. Review the [HR interaction wrap up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/agent-workspace-for-hr-case-management/hr-interaction-wrapup.md) for more details.

The voice controls and callback controls display under the following conditions:

-   When the interaction is a phone call, voice controls display. When the interaction is a phone call that is associated with a callback task, the callback controls the display.
-   The **Enable interaction controls** field is enabled on the OpenFrame Configuration record that allows the admin to configure the Agent Workspace to display voice interaction components.
-   The agent is a member of the user group specified on the OpenFrame Configuration record. If no user group is specified, all agents can access the HR voice interaction record page.
-   Ensure that the certified third-party App Store plugin is installed. For Example:
    -   [Unified Experience from Genesys](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/cdff6b621ba46a50a85b16db234bcba3#linksAndDocuments)
    -   [Unified Experience from Genesys - Core](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/6ebe67ea1b646a50a85b16db234bcb54)

        **Note:** Integration with Contact Center as a Service \(CCaaS\) is currently available only with [Genesys](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/cdff6b621ba46a50a85b16db234bcba3#linksAndDocuments) application.


## Before you begin

Ensure that the Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\) plugin \(com.app\_interaction\_control\) is installed to use the ICC voice features for CCaaS.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **OpenFrame** &gt; **Configurations**.

2.  Create a new configuration record for the specific CCaaS provider.

    Some CCaaS providers can include OpenFrame configurations for their plugin.

3.  Turn on the interaction controls for OpenFrame by selecting the Enable interaction controls check box.

    The Enable interaction controls field is enabled on the OpenFrame Configuration record that enables the admin to configure the HR Agent Workspace to display voice interaction components.

4.  From the **User Group** column, select a group and move it to the selected column.

    This is the group of users to whom the OpenFrame configuration applies.

5.  Unlock the URL field.

6.  In the URL field, enter a third-party URL.

    CaaS providers have specific configuration requirements for their plugins. Refer to the relevant contact center documentation for setup instructions.

7.  Select **Update**.


## What to do next

Refer to [Plugin requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/agent-workspace-for-hr-case-management/plugin-req-hr-icc.md) for dependencies and address all prerequisite requirements to access the ICC features.
