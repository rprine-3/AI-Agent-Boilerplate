# Add adhoc approvers to an HR case in the Agent Workspace for HR Case Management

Provide your agents with the flexibility to add adhoc approvers to a case that is part of an HR service.

## Before you begin

For example, in certain scenarios where in an employee's requests falls outside the bounds of the standard process or the agent needs to take an additional approval, an HR agent might need to request an adhoc approval before proceeding with its fulfillment.

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspace** &gt; **HR Agent Workspace**.

2.  Open the case that is assigned to you.

3.  Click **More actions** and select **Add an approval**.

    **Note:**

    -   Administrator must have configured the **Agent Can Add An Approval** option on the HR service to which the HR case is associated.
    -   This option appears only to the **Assigned to** user when the case is in the **Ready** or **Work in progress** state.
4.  Fill in the required fields in the **Add an approval** window.
