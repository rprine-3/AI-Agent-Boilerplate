# Move employee documents in Agent Workspace for HR Case Management

Move employee documents from a case in Agent Workspace for HR Case Management to employee document repository. The employee document repository provides a central repository for quick and easy identification of documents using different sorting features.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.document\_writer, sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Case Management** &gt; **Agent Workspace for HR Case Management**.

2.  Select a case that has employee documents attached.

    **Note:** From the list view, there is no way to identify HR cases with employee documents attached. To locate an HR case, you need the HR case number or the Opened for person.

3.  Select **Move Attachments**.

4.  In the Move Attachments to Employee documents window:

    1.  Select the check box next to the documents you want to move.
    2.  Select the **Document Type** for each document. The document type determines categorization, who can access it, and the retention policy. Create a document type if none appears for the associated topic detail. Creating a document type confirms correct categorization.
    3.  Select **Move Selected**.
    **Note:** The **Target COE** and **Topic Detail** fields can be modified only if the document has been added under the wrong type of HR case.

-   The moved attachments appears in the contextual side panel under the employee documents icon within the case.
