# Auto determination of assignment group in Agent Workspace for HR Case Management

Auto determine the assignment group for a case in Agent Workspace for HR Case Management. Enable an HR agent to transfer the case to the correct assignment group rather than having to spend significant time manually identifying groups for the HR cases.

**Important:** This feature is available with the HR Professional and HR Enterprise packages when you activate Agent Workspace for HR Case Management and Predictive Intelligence applications. If you do not want to use this feature, disable the **sn\_hr\_core.case\_auto\_assignment** system property.

After a case is created, the Auto Assignment Group for HR Cases solution definition auto determines the assignment group from the Short description, Description, Opened for Title, Opened for Location Name, HR service of the case. The appropriate assignment group for the case is displayed in a banner.

**Important:** The banner is not displayed if:

-   You have manually assigned the case to an assignment group.
-   The assignment group is not identified for the case.
-   The case is not in the ready or draft state.

## Auto training the predictive model

By default the Auto Assignment Group for HR Cases solution definition is configured and the predictive model is auto trained when all the following conditions are met:

-   The Human Resources Scoped App: Workspace \(com.sn\_hr\_agent\_workspace\) plugin is installed.
-   The Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\) plugin is installed.
-   There are 10000 records of HR case study matching the filters defined in the solution definition.
-   The **glide.platform\_ml.auto\_training.enabled** system property is set to true.

**Note:** Auto training does not happen if any one of the preceding conditions is not met. In such a case, [Manually train the HR predictive model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-predictive-intelligence-train.md). Navigate to the **HR AI configuration** module, open the Case Assignment group record, and map the manually configured solution definition.
