# Set up HR Service Delivery Conversational SMS service channel

Configure the Conversational SMS service channel store app for HR Service Delivery.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The HR Service Delivery base system includes the **HR SMS** service channel queue with the default **HR SMS Support Group** assignment group. The **Agent assignment rule** is capacity based by default. For HR Service Delivery, configure the SMS service channel for the HR SMS queue.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Service Channels**.

2.  Select the **SMS** service channel.

3.  On the Service Channel SMS form, select the **Active** check box to activate the service channel.

    **Note:** By default, most of the form is populated for you. **Capacity and Utilization** fields are set to 1 for **Default work item size** and 4 for **Default capacity**. You can change these, and any form values, if desired.
