# Configure the At a Glance panel

Customize which employee information appears in the At a Glance panel by adding or removing fields from the Employee Details and Contacts sections.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

## About this task

The At a Glance panel provides HR agents with quick access to essential employee information without opening the full profile. This panel appears in the HR Agent Workspace and displays key details from the Employee Details and Contacts sections.

You can customize which fields appear in the panel to match your organization's workflow needs.

**Note:** The At a Glance panel replaces the Customer 360 ribbon component in newer releases.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Profile** &gt; **HR Profiles**.

2.  Open any HR profile record to access the form configuration.

    You can use any profile record since the configuration applies to all profiles using the same form view.

3.  Access the form configuration by right-clicking the form header and selecting **Configure** &gt; **Form Layout**.

4.  In the **Form view and section** area, select **At a Glance** from the **View name** drop-down list.

    The form layout displays the current At a Glance configuration with available sections.

5.  Configure the Employee Details section by selecting or clearing the check boxes for fields you want to include or exclude.

    Common Employee Details fields include name, employee ID, department, manager, and job title. Select only the fields that agents need for quick reference.

6.  Configure the Contacts section by selecting or clearing the check boxes for contact fields you want to include or exclude.

    Contact fields typically include phone numbers, email addresses, and emergency contact information. Consider which contact methods agents use most frequently.

7.  Select **Save** to apply your configuration changes.

    Your configuration changes are saved and applied.


## Result

The customized At a Glance panel now displays your selected fields when agents view employee profiles. Fields without data for a specific employee don't appear in that employee's panel, keeping the display clean and relevant.
