# Configure HR Service Delivery playbook card

Use Playbook Card Configuration to view and manage what appears for each card in an activity set.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ws.admin

Each activity attempts to show a record \(HR task, HR case, request, and so on\) and goes through the card configuration and attempts to match to the lowest ordered record in the table. For example, the 'Verify Work Authorization' is a 'mark when complete' card that the base system provides.

The properties from the card configuration record are filled in from the record \(HR task, HR case, request, and so on\).

**Note:** For Classic HR Service Delivery Agent Workspace and Agent Workspace for HR Case Management, there are two separate default card configurations and activity overrides. The property **sn\_hr\_agent\_ws.use\_uib\_playbook\_card\_config** \(default value = false\) decides which card configuration is to be used for HR Service Delivery Playbook when you have each Agent Workspace installed. By default, the Classic card configuration will be selected in the card configuration.
