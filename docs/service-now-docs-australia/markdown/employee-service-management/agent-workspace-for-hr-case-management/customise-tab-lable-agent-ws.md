# Customize tab label in Agent Workspace for HR Case Management

Customize tab labels to display case field values, making it easier to identify cases when multiple tabs are open.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Experiences**.

2.  Select HR Agent Workspace.

3.  Under the UX Page Properties tab, select **caseTabTitleField** property.

    The field value to be displayed on the tab title can be configured here.

4.  In the **Value** field, provide the key value pair.

    The key being the table name, and the value being the field value. For example, "sn\_hr\_core\_case": "opened\_for". The value field has to be a valid JSON.

    Tab titles can also contain multiple fields. The key value remains the table name, but the value can be a list of strings. For example: "sn\_hr\_core\_case": \["opened\_for", "number"\].

5.  Select **Update**.
