# Import an existing building - Mappedin

Follow these steps to import an existing building for a Mappedin map.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

The Mappedin integration is not available for new customers. Existing customers can upgrade to Mappedin version 1.11.0.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_mappedin.admin

## Procedure

1.  Create external IDs for the buildings you want to import.

    For instructions, see [Use external IDs to match spaces between Workplace Service Delivery for Mappedin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/wsm-mappedin-ext-ids.md).

2.  Click **Yes** in the confirm dialog box.

    An email arrives with links to the buildings, floors, and space lists in a specific view. The list layout in the email has columns relevant to Mappedin.

3.  Export the records in a spreadsheet and send to Mappedin with the floor plans.

    Mappedin creates floor plans with the external IDs.

4.  Navigate to **Workplace Core** &gt; **Space Administration** &gt; **Buildings**.

5.  Select the building and click the **Update this building's Mappedin import** related link.

6.  From the **Select a venue to import** list, select the venue.

7.  Select **Update**.
