    1.  Based on your selection of a campus, building, or floor on the Scheduled view, the following options are displayed:

        -   Campus: Select a Campus. The buildings and floors within that campus are selected automatically. At a time, only one campus is available for selection.

            **Note:** If no campus is selected, the location directory portal opens without any context in the Card view.

        -   Building: Option to select a building.
            -   Select a building. The Location directory portal opens with the building view showing the default floor information.
            -   If more than one building is selected, the Location directory portal opens the first building that was selected and the floor that was selected in the Floor list options.
        -   Floor: Option to select a floor.
            -   If multiple floors are selected, the location directory portal shows the floor that was selected first in the Card view. For example, Floor 1.
            -   If only a floor is selected, the location directory opens that particular floor in the Card view.
            -   If none of the floors are selected, the Location directory portal opens the selected building with the default floor.
    2.  In Scheduled view, if you don't select any campus, the landing page of the location directory opens without any context.

    3.  If you provide an invalid floor, a building, or a campus, a message is displayed.

        "Looks like this location doesn't exist." You are redirected to the default Card view.
