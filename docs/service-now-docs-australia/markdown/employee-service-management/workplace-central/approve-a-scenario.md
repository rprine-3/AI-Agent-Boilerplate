-   You have the permission to approve.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager and sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.scenario\_reader

## About this task

As a workplace manager, you can approve a scenario. The Workplace Core Approval definition, provides the **Scenario Plan Approval** by default to perform scenario approval. The approval definition consists of a **Scenario Plan Approver** performer criteria, in which all the workplace managers are configured to approve scenarios. To configure more approvers, refer to [Configure approvers of a scenario](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/configure-approvers-of-a-scenario.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **My Approvals**.

2.  Select the approval that is in **Requested** state.

    You can also use filter options to view only those approvals that are in the **Requested** state.

3.  To view the scenario before approving, in the **Approving** field, select Preview this record icon \(\[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] Alt text: Preview this record icon\).

4.  Select the **Open Record** tab from the preview window.

5.  On the Scenario Plan form, select **Open scenario plan**.

    The scenario stack plan opens in a read-only mode.

6.  Review the scenario.

7.  After reviewing the scenario, to approve or reject, perform the steps 1 and 2 again.

8.  On the form, do any one of the following:

    -   To approve the scenario, select **Approve**.

        The scenario is approved.

    -   To reject the scenario, do the following:
        1.  In the **Comments** field, specify the reason for rejection.

            If you want to suggest any changes in the scenario, briefly details the changes.

        2.  Select **Post** after entering you comments.
        3.  Select **Reject**.

            The scenario is rejected.


## Result

The scenario is approved or rejected based on what action you performed. If the scenario is approved, then the state of the scenario changes to Approved. If it is rejected, then the scenario state is changed to Rejected.
