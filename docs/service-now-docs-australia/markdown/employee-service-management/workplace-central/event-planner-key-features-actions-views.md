# Workplace Central Event planner

The Workplace Central Event planner is a one-stop workspace where you can check all the reservations requested in your organization at a time.

## Event planner capabilities

You can view all the reservations of your organization in this single workspace, and monitor how many workplace locations are engaged by employees. Using the planner, you can perform the following actions:

-   Access the event planner as a Reservation planner and a Reservation viewer.
-   Set the start and end time displaying on the calendar in the schedule view.
-   View various reservations such as single, recurring occurrences, multi-child, group, and more.
-   Check the available and unavailable spaces at any time.
-   Directly view or edit reservations requested in any campus, building, or a floor when required.
-   Open and View Location directory using Event planner.
-   View the planner in a Scheduled view. Open Location directory from the Scheduled view.
-   Change a reservation to an earlier or later date or time.
-   View detailed information of each reservation requested either in the past, on the current day or that are upcoming.
-   View details such as the requester, the current state of the reservation, the check-in and check-out status, the invitees, the number of people attending and more.
-   Create a reservation.
-   As a reservation planner, you can perform the following actions:
    -   Drag a reservation to another date and time to reschedule.
    -   Drag and drop a reservation with service items to another time or another location. The service items can't be modified but the quantity of the service items can be modified.

        **Note:** If the new location or time does not have one or more added services, then a message is displayed informing ''This change will result in the loss of one or more services for this reservation''.

    -   Change the reservation timings.
    -   Change the location of the reservation.
    -   Cancel a reservation.

        **Note:** Only selected reservation occurrence is deleted when a recurring reservation is cancelled, and not the complete recurrence series. You can cancel the complete recurring reservation from the portal.

    -   Open a reservation and make advanced changes and also add services.
    -   Edit the reservation from the contextual side panel of the calendar. This functionality is available only for single and recurring reservations.

        **Note:** When you modify a building value in an existing reservation, because the previous location is not available in the updated building, selecting it throws an error. You can select a different location.

-   As a reservation planner, you can manage single or occurrence reservation details. You can also edit reservation details such as the reservable purpose, number of attendees and cost center from the details reservation details pages directly.

    **Note:** You can manage a multi-location or a group reservation only by opening the reservation details and not with the schedule view.


**Important:** Reservations created using a calendar provider can only be managed using the calendar provider.
