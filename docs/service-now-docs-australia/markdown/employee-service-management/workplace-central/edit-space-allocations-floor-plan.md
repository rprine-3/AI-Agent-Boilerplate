# Edit space allocations on the floor plan

Use the floor plan to edit space or neighborhood allocations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager or sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.space\_planner

**Note:** The sn\_wsd\_core.scenario\_reader role has access to view the map and space allocations.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Central** &gt; **Workplace Central**.

2.  On the side navigation, select the **Space Planning** module.

    The Space Planning workspace opens with the **Floor plan** tab selected by default.

3.  Select a campus, building, and floor to view the map.

4.  Select a **View by** option to group spaces on the map.

    The default view by option is set to **None**.

5.  Select the spaces that you want to edit.

    1.  On the details panel, select **Select spaces**.

        The Select spaces pop-up opens.

        **Note:** Alternatively, you can select multiple spaces on the map by holding the Shift key. You can also hold the Shift key and draw a circle to select spaces on the map.

    2.  Add conditions to filter the spaces.

        For example, `Department is Finance`. For more information about conditions, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).

    3.  Select the spaces from the list, then select **Select**.

6.  Edit the space allocations based on your requirement.
