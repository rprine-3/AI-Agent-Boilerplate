# Create a scenario

Create a scenario with a building. Add, update, or remove space allocations before publishing and deploying a scenario. Manage and update your scenarios using the Stack plan and Floor map component tabs.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the following plugins are installed:

-   Indoor Mapping \(for map-based administration\)
-   Workplace Core
-   Workplace Central
-   Workplace Service Delivery components
-   Workplace Case Management
-   Workplace Space Management

**Important:** You can view spaces based on their workplace entities only for a building. You can’t create or view a scenario based on workplace entities.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.space\_planner, sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.scenario\_reader \(read only; to view a scenario\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations:

    -   **All** &gt; **Workplace Central** &gt; **Workplace Central**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Scenario Planning** &gt; **My Scenario Plans**
    You can also open Workplace Central from the Employee Center. Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Workplace Central**.

2.  Select the **Space Optimization** icon \(\[Omitted image "space-optimization-icon.png"\] Alt text: Space Optimization icon.\).

    The Space optimization dashboard opens.

3.  Create a scenario by selecting **Create a scenario** from either of the following options.

1.  Select a building.
2.  On the building details tab, select **Create scenario**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  On the Scenario details form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Scenario details form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/scenario-details-form.md).

5.  Select **Save scenario**.

6.  Select the Refresh icon \(\[Omitted image "refresh-icon.png"\] Alt text: Refresh to refresh the scenario.\) to check if your scenario has moved to the **Draft** state.


## Result

The new scenario is created in the **Processing** state and takes some time to move to the **Draft** state. You can’t open a scenario that is in the Processing state.

\[Omitted image "wsd-scenario-creation-page.png"\] Alt text: The Scenarios page showing list of scenarios.

For more information about scenario states, refer to [Scenario and Building - Views, states, settings, and key features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/scenario-planning-views-actions-keyfeatures-.md).

After a scenario moves to the **Draft** state, you can open the scenario and select the view options for the scenario.

-   **Edit Scenario**: You can only edit a scenario using this option. This option is available only when you select a scenario from the Space Optimization page. It isn’t available when you select a building from the Space Optimization page.
-   **View Scenario**: View scenario details \(unassigned spaces, allocated spaces, and user assignment details\) for a selected building, floor, or bar.
