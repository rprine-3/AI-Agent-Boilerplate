# Use Floor Plan

Use the floor plan to manage space and user assignments in your workplace.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have installed Workplace Core. For more information, see [Install Workplace Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/install-workplace-service-delivery.md)

For the Floor plan, make sure that you have configured the map in Indoor Mapping. For more information about configuring an indoor map, see [Configure Indoor Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/configure-ind-mapping.md).

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager or sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.space\_planner

**Note:** The sn\_wsd\_core.scenario\_reader role has access to view the map, space allocations, and user assignments.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Central** &gt; **Workplace Central**.

2.  On the side navigation, select the **Space Planning** module.

    The Space Planning workspace opens with the **Floor plan** tab selected by default.

3.  Select a campus, building, and floor to view the map.

4.  View the KPIs on the details panel.

    The following KPIs are displayed based on your selection on the map.

    -   `Space count`: Number of spaces on the floor or in the selection.
    -   `Total effective capacity`: Capacity of the number of spaces multiplied by their capacity ratio.

        For example: If 20 spaces have a capacity ratio of 1.5, and 10 spaces have a capacity ratio of 1, the space count is 30 and total effective capacity is 40.

    -   `Profiles assigned`: Number of workplace profiles assigned to the floor or selected spaces. If a user is assigned to multiple spaces, they are considered to have multiple profiles. The KPI includes both location assignments and neighborhood assignments.

        For example, if a user is assigned to 2 spaces, and another user is assigned to 3 spaces, the number of assigned profiles is 5.

    -   `Unassigned spaces`: Number of spaces that do not have any assignments.
    -   `Assignment ratio`: Ratio of the assigned profiles to the total effective capacity.
    If you have installed Workplace Space Management, space admins can configure custom KPIs to be displayed on the details panel. For more information about configuring KPIs, see [Create a KPI Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-space-management/create-kpi-configuration.md).

5.  Select a **View by** option to group spaces on the map.

    The default view by option is set to **None**. If Workplace Space Management is installed, the option with the lowest order is selected by default.

    Based on the view by option, the details panel displays information about Neighborhoods or Space Types. If the view by option is **None**, the details panel displays both Neighborhoods and Space Types. With Workplace Space Management, the details panel displays spaces allocated to all neighborhoods, departments, cost centers, and workplace entities.

    If you have installed Workplace Space Management, space admins can configure custom view-by configurations to group spaces. For more information about configuring the view by options, see [Create a view-by configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-space-management/create-view-by-config.md).

    1.  For workplace entities, select the entity level that you want to use to view the map.

        For example, select Project to view project-level allocations.

        The map displays all entity levels by default.

    2.  For workplace entities, view the hierarchy by selecting the tree icon \[Omitted image "wsd-central-tree-icon.png"\] Alt text: on the legend.

6.  Perform any of the following actions based on your requirement.
