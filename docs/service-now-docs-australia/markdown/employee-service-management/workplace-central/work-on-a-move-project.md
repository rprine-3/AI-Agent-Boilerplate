# Work on a move project

After creating a move project, work on the project using the move scheduler. The move scheduler displays all the move requests in a schedule view \(calendar view\) and a list view. Track all the move requests that are grouped under the move project.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have created a move project, and it’s active. For more information about creating a move project, see either of the following topics:

-   [Create a move project from existing move requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/create-move-project.md)
-   [Create a move project by uploading an Excel file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/create-move-project-excel.md)

Ensure that you’re aware of the [Move project views, actions, and states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/move-project-schedule-view.md).
