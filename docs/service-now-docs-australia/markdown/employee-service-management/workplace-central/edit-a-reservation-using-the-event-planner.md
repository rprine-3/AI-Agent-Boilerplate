# Edit a reservation using the event planner

As a reservation planner, edit a reservation directly using the event planner.

## Before you begin

You can also manage a reservation using the schedule view. Using the schedule view, you can edit the start and end time, or to move the reservation to another location. For more information, refer to [Working with schedule view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/working-with-schedule-view.md).

Ensure that you have installed the Calendar component \(sn\_calendar\) of version 23.2.0 or later.

**Important:** Using the schedule view, you cannot edit a multi-child or a group-child reservation that is created using a calendar provider. Reservations created using a calendar provider can only be managed using the calendar provider.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_rsv.reservation\_planner
