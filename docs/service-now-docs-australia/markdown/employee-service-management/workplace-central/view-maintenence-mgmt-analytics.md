# View Maintenance Management metrics

Use the Maintenance Management dashboard to get an insight into maintenance cases, their trends, and maintenance plan compliance. These insights enable you to create an efficient maintenance plan to improve workflows and reduce maintenance activities and their related costs.

## Scorecards

The following default scorecards are available on the dashboard. To see the list of records, select the related card.

-   **PMP \(Planned Maintenance Percentage\)**

    Shows the percentage of planned days spent for preventive cases vs the total planned days for both preventive and corrective maintenance cases. A high percentage value indicates that more time is being spent in planned maintenance activities rather than unplanned activities.

    Calculation:

    `Planned Maintenance Percentage = (Total number of days taken to complete all preventive maintenance cases for a duration / Total number of days taken to complete all maintenance cases for the duration) X 100`


-   **PMC \(Planned Maintenance Compliance\)**

    Shows the percentage of the total number of preventive maintenance cases completed vs the total number of preventive maintenance cases. A high percentage value indicates that maintenance activities are completed as per schedule.

    Calculation:

    `Planned Maintenance Compliance = (Number of preventive maintenance cases completed/ Total preventive maintenance cases) X 100`


-   **MTR \(Mean time to repair\)**

    Shows the average time taken to close a maintenance case. A low value indicates that the processes for maintenance and the necessary skills to handle them are effective.

    Calculation:

    `Mean time to repair = Average age of all the maintenance cases / Total number of maintenance cases`


-   **Number of open cases**

    Shows the total number of open cases. A low number of open cases indicates your maintenance plan and resolution processes are effective.

    Calculation:

    `Total number of preventive and corrective maintenance cases that are not in closed complete, closed incomplete, or canceled state.`


## Reports

The following default reports are available on the dashboard. Select the card to see the list of records.

-   **Corrective vs preventive maintenance case trend**

    Displays the trend of corrective and preventive maintenance cases.

    Benefits:

    Analyze the trend to understand the efficiency of planning and identify any assets that must be retired or replaced.


-   **Average age of maintenance cases**

    Displays the average age of corrective and preventive maintenance cases.

    Benefits:

    Analyze the trend to understand the efficiency of maintenance services and identify the process or assets that cause the increase in the age of maintenance cases. Take steps to reduce the age of cases.

    Formula:

    -   `Average age of corrective maintenance cases = [Sum of ages for all the corrective cases/Total number or maintenance cases]`
    -   `Average age of preventive maintenance cases = [Sum of ages for all the preventive cases/Total number or maintenance cases]`

-   **Planned maintenance percentage trend**

    Displays the percentage trend for the total number of days spent on preventive cases versus the total number of planned days for both preventive and corrective maintenance cases.

    Benefits:

    Analyze the trend to identify problem areas that cause unplanned activities or corrective cases. Modify the process or replace or retire the assets to avoid unplanned activities.

    Formula:

    `Planned maintenance percentage trend = (Total number of planned maintenance days / Total number of maintenance days) X 100`


-   **Planned Maintenance Compliance trend**

    Displays the percentage trend of the total number of preventive maintenance cases completed versus the total number of preventive maintenance cases.

    Benefits:

    Analyze the Planned Maintenance Compliance trend to identify issues that lead to deviation from the plan. Take steps to improve processes that causes inconsistent on-time completion.

    Calculation:

    `Planned Maintenance Compliance trend = [Number of completed preventive maintenance cases/ Total preventive maintenance cases] X 100`
