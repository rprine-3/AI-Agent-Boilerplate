## About this task

After you publish a scenario, send the scenario for approval. The scenario will be sent for approval to the workplace managers for approval. If there are multiple approvers for a scenario, the approval or rejection received from the workplace manager who performs it at first, is considered. You can view your approval-related details in the **Approver** tab. When a scenario is sent for an approval, the state of the scenario changes from Published to Awaiting approval and you cannot edit the scenario.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to any one of the following locations:

    -   **All** &gt; **Workplace Central** &gt; **Workplace Central**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Scenario Planning** &gt; **My Scenario Plans**
    You can also open Workplace Central from the Employee Center directly. Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Workplace Central**.

    The Workplace Analytics dashboard opens.

2.  On the left pane, select **Space Optimization** icon \(\[Omitted image "space-optimization-icon.png"\] Alt text: Space optimization icon.\).

    The Space optimization dashboard opens.

3.  Open the scenario that you want to send for approval.

    Follow any one of the following paths.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    The stack plan of the selected scenario opens.

4.  Review the scenario.

    Refer to [Review a scenario](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/review-a-scenario.md).

5.  If the scenario is not published, then publish the scenario.

    Refer to [Publish a scenario](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/publish-a-scenario.md).

6.  After publishing, click **Send for approval** to send the scenario for approval.

7.  Open the **Approver** tab to view your approver-related details.

8.  Depending on the state of the scenario after sending for approval, do the following:

    -   Rejected: If the scenario is rejected by the approver, then the state of the scenario changes to Rejected.

        To view the rejection details, do the following:

        1.  Select the **Approver** tab.
        2.  Search for **Rejected** state.

            Use the filter option to view Rejected state.

        3.  In the **Comments**, view the comments given by the approver.
        4.  Select the **Stack plan** tab to implement the changes suggested by the approver.
        5.  After making the changes, click **Save**.
        6.  After saving the scenario, to send the scenario for approval again, click **Send for approval.**

            The state of the scenario is again changed to Awaiting approval and you can no longer edit the scenario.

            If the scenario is rejected, you can send a scenario for approval multiple times until it is approved.

    -   Approved: If the scenario is approved, then the state of the scenario changes to Approved. You can no longer edit the scenario after it is approved.
9.  After the scenario is approved, deploy the scenario.

    Refer to [Deploy a scenario](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown).
