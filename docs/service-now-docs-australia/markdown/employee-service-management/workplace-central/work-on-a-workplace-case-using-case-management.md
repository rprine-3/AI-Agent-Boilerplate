# Work on a workplace case using Case management

Update, edit, or resolve a workplace case at any time from a single workspace using the Workplace Central Case management workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_case.manager

## About this task

The Case Management dashboard enables you to work on a case at any time. You can perform any action on a case such as update, edit, and even resolve a case when you're done. To save time spent on filtering cases, the workspace, by default, displays the cases under various categories in the Overview section.

-   Update the case details.
-   Change the state of the case.
-   Add comments or work notes.
-   View or attach knowledge articles.
-   Mark the checklist or add new checklist items.
-   View the details of the employee who requested the case and mail them directly if necessary.
-   View the workplace location on the floor map. For move cases, view the **From location** and **To location** on the map.
-   Create child cases and child tasks if needed. For more information, see [Create a child case and a child task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/create-a-child-case-and-a-child-task-casemgmtworkspace.md).
