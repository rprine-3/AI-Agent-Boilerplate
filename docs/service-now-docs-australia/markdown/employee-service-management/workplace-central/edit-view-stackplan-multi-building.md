# Edit a scenario using the stack plan

Edit a scenario using the stack plan to allocate spaces to departments, cost centers, workplace entities, or neighborhoods.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have created a scenario, and it is in the Draft state. For more information, see [Create a scenario](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown).

**Important:** If allocation changes in your instance impact the scenario, the system displays a warning on the Space Details panel. You must review the changes, edit the scenario accordingly, then select **Move to valid** before continuing. For more information about allocation changes, see [Reviewing allocation changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-space-management/reviewing-allocation-changes.md).

Role required: sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.space\_planner, sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt.scenario\_reader \(read only; to view a scenario\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations:

    -   **All** &gt; **Workplace Central** &gt; **Workplace Central**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Scenario Planning** &gt; **My Scenario Plans**
    You can also open Workplace Central from the Employee Center by navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Workplace Central**.

    The Workplace Analytics dashboard opens.

2.  Select All scenarios, then select the scenario that you want to edit.

    By default, the scenario opens in the **Stack plan** tab.

3.  On the Space details pane, on the View options card, select **Edit scenario**.

    The **Group by** option is automatically filled based on the Allocation type \[**sn\_wsd\_core.ALLOCATION\_TYPE**\] system property.

4.  Select the Accordion panel icon \(\[Omitted image "wsd-building-accordion-icon.png"\] Alt text: Accordion icon for a building to show or hide floors within a building.\) for the building that you want to edit.

    You can expand an accordion to display the floors of a building. If your scenario contains multiple buildings, the accordion of the last building is expanded by default.

    -   When you select a building to see the floors, the borders of the selected building are highlighted.
    -   When you select a floor on the Stack plan to view the spaces or allocations, the borders of the selected floor are highlighted.
    -   When you select a bar or space to view the number of allocated spaces, the borders of the selected bar or space are highlighted.
5.  Edit the stack plan based on your requirement.
