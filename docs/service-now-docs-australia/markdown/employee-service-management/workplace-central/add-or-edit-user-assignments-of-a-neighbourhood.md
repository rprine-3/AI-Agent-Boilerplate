# Edit user assignments of a neighborhood

Add a user to a neighborhood or edit the existing user assignments of a neighborhood in a building.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have created a scenario that is based on neighborhoods. For more information about creating neighborhoods and scenarios, see the following topics.

**Important:** If allocation changes in your instance impact the scenario, the system displays a warning on the Space Details panel. You must review the changes, edit the scenario accordingly, then select **Move to valid** before continuing. For more information about allocation changes, see [Reviewing allocation changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-space-management/reviewing-allocation-changes.md).

## About this task

You can add or remove user assignments of a neighborhood in a building or a scenario. A workplace user can only have one location in a neighborhood. If a user is assigned multiple locations in the same neighborhood, the latest added location is set as active and others are deleted.

**Note:** On a building, you can only make user assignment-related changes only for a neighborhood that is already created. You can’t add a new neighborhood.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to any one of the following locations:

    -   **All** &gt; **Workplace Central** &gt; **Workplace Central**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Scenario Planning** &gt; **My Scenario Plans**
    You can also open Workplace Central from the Employee Center directly. Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Workplace Central**.

    The Workplace Analytics dashboard opens.

2.  Select the **Space Optimization** icon \(\[Omitted image "space-optimization-icon.png"\] Alt text: Space optimization.\).

    The Space optimization dashboard opens.

3.  In the All Buildings section, select the building that you want to modify the neighborhood user assignments for.

    Select **View all** to view a list of buildings.

    The stack plan of the building opens.

4.  View the neighborhoods on each floor of the building.

    1.  Select the Stack plan settings icon \(\[Omitted image "stack-plan-settings-icon.png"\] Alt text: Stack plan settings.\) to open the settings.

    2.  In the **View by** field, select **Neighborhood**.

        The stack plan displays the neighborhoods in the building.

5.  Edit the user assignments of a neighborhood in the stack plan.

    1.  Select the neighborhood on the floor that you want to edit the user assignments on.

    2.  On the Space details panel, in the Assignment section, select **Edit user assignments**.

        A page opens displaying the list of users assigned to the neighborhood.

    3.  Use the filter, sort, or refresh options to modify the list.

    4.  Add or remove users from the neighborhood.
