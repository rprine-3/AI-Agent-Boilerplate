# Edit a scenario using the floor map

Edit a scenario using the floor map to add or remove allocations, or to assign users to spaces in your organization.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have created a scenario, and it is in the Draft state. For more information, see [Create a scenario](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown).

Make sure that you have selected Indoor Mapping as your map provider to view maps.

-   For more information about selecting a map provider, see [Customize the map properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/wsm-configure-map-properties.md).
-   For more information about indoor mapping, see [Indoor Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/Indoor-mapping.md).

**Important:** If allocation changes in your instance impact the scenario, the system displays a warning on the Space Details panel. You must review the changes, edit the scenario accordingly, then select **Move to valid** before continuing. For more information about allocation changes, see [Reviewing allocation changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-space-management/reviewing-allocation-changes.md).
