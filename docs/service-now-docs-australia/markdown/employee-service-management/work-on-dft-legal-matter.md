# Work on a digital forensic legal matter

Work on a digital forensic legal matter assigned to you to get the requested actions for the custodial and non-custodial data done to resolve the request.

## Before you begin

The practice area lead or the group manager would have [assigned the legal matter to you](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/assign-legal-matter.md) to work on.

Role required: sn\_lg\_matter.matter\_fulfiller

2.  In the Legal Counsel Center tab, select the list icon \[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.

    1.  In the **Custodial Data** tab, click **Add**.

    2.  In the Add Custodial Data dialog box, select the custodian records you want to add to the matter.

Review the phases and tasks in the respective tabs and, if needed, [create more phases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/add-phases-to-legal-matter.md) and [create digital forensic matter tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/create-dft-matter-task.md) to organize the data processing of custodial and non-custodial data.

    **Note:** The phases and tasks are available in the legal matter only if you created the matter using the digital forensic matter template.

9.  Assign tasks to users across various departments in your organization to work on.

    1.  In the **Tasks** tab, open the task by clicking the task number.

12. [Add milestones](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/add-milestone-to-legal-matter.md) to keep a track of timelines to complete important tasks.

13. [Create artifacts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/add-artifact-to-legal-matter.md) \(folders\) and [upload files into these artifacts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/add-files-to-artifact.md) to record and store supporting documents within the legal matter.

14. [Associate a new legal request with the legal matter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/associate-related-legal-requests-to-matter.md) to combine multiple legal requests with the same underlying needs into a single matter.

    All custodial and non-custodial data from the selected request are added to the matter and appear in the respective tabs.

15. [Associate the matter with another legal request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/associate-existing-matter-to-legal-request.md) that is similar in nature.

16. Close or cancel the request as appropriate.

    -   [Close the legal matter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/close-legal-matter.md) after you complete the required actions for all custodial and non-custodial data in the matter. Ensure you’ve completed the following items before closing the legal matter.
        -   Closed all tasks that are complete or canceled that don't need any actions.
        -   Updated the status of all custodial and non-custodial data in the legal matter to either Complete or Cancelled, as appropriate.
    -   If the matter doesn't need any action, you can cancel it by clicking the more button \(\[Omitted image "more-button-icon.png"\] Alt text: More button.\) and selecting **Cancel**.

        To cancel the requests associated with the matter, select the **Cancel related requests** check box in the Cancel Matter dialog box. These requests are canceled only if they aren’t related to any other open matters.

        -   If a related request gets canceled, the status of all its open custodial and non-custodial data \(status other than Complete\) updates to Cancelled.
        -   If a related request cannot be canceled, all its open custodial and non-custodial data is removed from the matter. The status of such records updates to Approved.
        When you cancel the matter without opting to cancel related requests, all custodial and non-custodial data, except with the Complete status, are removed from the matter. The status of such records updates to Approved.
