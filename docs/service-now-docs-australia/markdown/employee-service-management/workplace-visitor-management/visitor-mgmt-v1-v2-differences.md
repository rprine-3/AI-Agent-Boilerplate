# Differences between Workplace Visitor Management versions

Workplace Visitor Management version 2.0.0 introduces significant architectural, data model, portal, security, and feature changes compared to earlier versions \(1.19 or earlier\).

<table><thead><tr><th>

Workplace Visitor Management 1.19 or earlier

</th><th>

Workplace Visitor Management 2.0.0 or later

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Visitor identity is stored on registration records, coupling identity to a single visit.

</td><td>

Adds the `sn_wsd_visitor_user` table as a dedicated identity store, but identity is still stored on the registration record. The table enables reuse across multiple visits.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Visitor type is is a field \(**visitor\_type**\) on the `sn_wsd_visitor_vistor_registration` record.

</td><td>

Visitor type is an entity in the `sn_wsd_visitor_type` table, including a built-in Internal type for employee visitors. The **visitor\_type** field on the registration record is deprecated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Uses the `sn_wsd_visitor_m2m_location_policy` table to link locations to policies and capture policy acceptance.

</td><td>

Policies are part of visit requirements, which can then be applied to workplace locations. For more information about creating visit requirements, see [Configure visit requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-visitor-management/configure-visit-requirements.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Uses the `sn_wsd_core_html_signing_template` table for badge templates. Policy signing uses only a signature-pad flow.

</td><td>

Extends the `sn_wsd_core_html_signing_template` table to support HTML-based policy signing templates in addition to badge templates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Has no dedicated auth state table for the public visitor portal.

</td><td>

Introduces `sn_wsd_visitor_auth` to track OTP, passcode, and session state for the public visitor portal.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Uses a **location** field on visit, invitation, and registration records.

</td><td>

Adds a **workplace\_location** reference field across all affected tables. The original **location** field remains but is deprecated. Integrations that read the old field require updates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

The `sn_wsd_visitor_visit` table has a basic set of fields. The recurrence end date is stored using the internal key **endDate** in the legacy recurrence engine.

</td><td>

Extends `sn_wsd_visitor_visit` with recurring pattern fields, **workplace\_location**, draft state, and occurrence editing.Replaces the legacy recurrence engine with an rule-based engine; the internal key changes from **endDate** to **until**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

The `sn_wsd_visitor_visitor` table includes **license\_plate**, **parking\_type**, **vip**, and photo fields.

</td><td>

Removes **license\_plate** and **parking\_type** from `sn_wsd_visitor_visitor`. Adds custom-field sync to registration records.
