## Add a visitor

Add a visitor by providing details like their name and email.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_visitor.staff or sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

### Procedure

1.  On the Visit details page, select **Add visitor**.

2.  On the Add Visitor pop-up, enter the **Email** of the visitor.

    For an internal visitor, the email must match a system user. Otherwise, the visitor is an external visitor.

    **Important:** For internal visitors, fields like the first name, last name, email, and phone number are automatically filled based on the system users table and are not editable. Additional information like license plate or parking type, which are not stored in the system users table, can be edited.

3.  Select the **Visitor type** based on your requirement.

4.  Select **Add visitor**.

5.  Fill in the visitor details, then select **Save**.

    Alternatively, you can select **Cancel** to add the visitor with their email address.

    The visitor can fill in their details and complete their pre-check tasks on the visitor portal or at the receptionist desk.


## Add visitors using a file

Add multiple visitors by uploading a CSV or Excel file with the visitor details.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_visitor.staff or sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

### Procedure

1.  On the Visit details page, in the Visitors section, select the ellipsis icon, then download a template based on your preference.

    You can download a CSV or an Excel template.

2.  In the downloaded file, fill in the columns with your visitor details.

    First name, Last name, and Email are required columns.

    **Note:** In Workplace Visitor Management version 2.0.0 or later, Visitor type is optional on bulk upload. In version 1.19 or earlier, Visitor type is a required column.

3.  From the **Add visitor** context menu, select **Add visitors using a file**.

4.  Select the CSV or Excel file to upload the visitors.

    The system takes a few seconds to fetch details from the file and display the visitors and their details.

    If any required fields are missing for a visitor, the system displays them on the visitor row. You can edit the visitor to provide the required details.

    Alternatively, the visitor can provide their details at the receptionist desk.
