# Configure a visitor type

Create a visitor type that can be used to categorize visitors for your hosts or reception staff.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_visitor.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Visitor Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Visitor types**.

2.  On the Visitor types list, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the visitor type, like prospect or candidate.|
    |Order|Order of the visitor type in the list while adding visitors. Visitor types with a lower order are displayed first.|
    |Label|Label of the visitor type that is displayed while adding visitors.|
    |Active|Option to set the record to active. Inactive visitor types are not displayed while adding visitors.|

4.  In the **Available if** field, add conditions for when the visitor type is available.

    For more information about conditions, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).

    To include workplace locations within a parent location, you must add conditions to dot-walk from the nested locations to the parent location.

    To include all the buildings, floors, and spaces in the Demo Campus, add the following conditions.

    -   `Workplace Location is Demo Campus` OR
    -   `Workplace Location.Building.Campus is Demo Campus` OR
    -   `Workplace Location.Floor.Campus is Demo Campus` OR
    -   `Workplace Location.Space.Campus is Demo Campus`
5.  Save the record.

    The visitor type is created and is available to hosts and reception staff members.
