If any visitor policies are applicable for the visit, the email sent to the visitor contains options to accept or decline the policies. If the visitor declines the policies in the email, they can still accept them while checking in through the Workplace Services Kiosk. For more information about the kiosk check-in process, see [Check in using an invite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-services-kiosk/visitor-check-in.md).

**Warning:** In Workplace Visitor Management version 2.0.0 or later, the accept and decline policy buttons have been removed from visitor emails. Visitors can acknowledge policies on the visitor portal, or during the check-in process on a kiosk.
