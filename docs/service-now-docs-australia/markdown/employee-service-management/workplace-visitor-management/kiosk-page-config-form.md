</table>## Self-registration record producer configuration

As an admin, you can configure the default record producer by navigating to **All** &gt; **Workplace Visitor Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Record Producers**, then selecting the **WSD VM Self registration** record producer.

The Variables related list contains the variables that are included with the record producer. The following variables are not displayed on the kiosk:

-   **Location**: The location of the kiosk device determines the company policies and the list of hosts for the kiosk device.

    The location value is automatically filled at run time based on the kiosk configuration. For more information, see [Create a kiosk configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-services-kiosk/create-kiosk-device-config.md).

-   **Duration**: The duration of the visit is used to determine the expected departure time of the visitor.

    The default value of the duration is **1h**, which specifies one hour. You can enter a combination of numbers with `h` to specify hours or `m` to specify minutes. For example, `5h` is five hours, `30m` is thirty minutes, `1h30m` is one hour and thirty minutes.
