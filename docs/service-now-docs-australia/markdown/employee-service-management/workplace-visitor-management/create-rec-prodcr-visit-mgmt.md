</table>4.  Fill the following tab fields appropriately:

    -   **What it will contain**
    -   **Accessibility**
    -   **Generated Record Data**
    -   **Portal Settings**
5.  In the **What it will contain** tab, provide the following script:

    ```
    var visitorService = new sn_wsd_visitor.WSDVMVisitorService();
    visitorService.createVisitorRegistrationRecord(producer, current.sys_id);
    
    producer.portal_redirect = "?id=my_requests";
    ```

6.  In the **Variables** tab, configure the variables for the Workplace Services catalog item as appropriate.

    Variables collect information from the user, and are used to ask questions and map answers to fields.

    To learn more about the different types of variables and how to configure them, see [Types of service catalog variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_VariableTypes.md).

7.  Click **Submit**.
