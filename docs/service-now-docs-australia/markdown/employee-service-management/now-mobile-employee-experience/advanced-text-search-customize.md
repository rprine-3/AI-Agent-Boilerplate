## What to do next

After you have customized the display of your search results, select the AI Search results to be displayed in an applet launcher. See, [Add AI Search to a launcher screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-mobile-employee-experience/aisearch-add-applet-launcher.md).

Consider configuring a customized empty state display to inform users that their search has not produced any results. If you do not customize an empty state, a preconfigured default empty state is displayed. To customize an empty state, see [Configure an empty state for search results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/empty-state-search-results.md).
