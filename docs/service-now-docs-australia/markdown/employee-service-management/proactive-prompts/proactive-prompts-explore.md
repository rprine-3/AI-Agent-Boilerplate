# Exploring Proactive Prompts

Learn how to use the Proactive Prompts application in your organization, configuring the signal for prompts, generating the prompts, and displaying them with actions on the selected channels.

## Proactive Prompts workflow

A scheduled job triggers the Proactive Prompts script that evaluates the signal configuration. Signal configuration contains two parts:

-   Signal details such as to whom to send the prompt, on which channels, what actions are made available, and templates for the prompt message displayed to the user.
-   Signal data source that contains data tables and conditions.

Prompts are then generated and sent to configured platforms like Service Portal, Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Virtual Agent.

The following image illustrates this Proactive Prompts workflow.
