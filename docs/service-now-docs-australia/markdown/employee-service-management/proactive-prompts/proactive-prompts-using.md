# Using Proactive Prompts

You can use Proactive Prompts application to send informative and actionable insights to managers and employees by keeping them informed and encouraging them to act immediately.

After a successful signal configuration in Proactive Prompts, prompts are generated according to the schedule in the configuration.

To see the list of prompts, navigate to **All** &gt; **Proactive Prompts** &gt; **Prompts**. The following details are displayed for each prompt: Receiver name, Signal name, Status, Prompt template, Tokens, and Created date. For more details, like the related **Action table** and **Action taken** fields, select the View content details icon \(\[Omitted image "view-content-details-icon.png"\] Alt text: View content details icon\).

**Note:** Prompts are deleted automatically after 180 days of creation using the Auto Flush feature.

## Prompts in delivery channels

Prompts are delivered to end users through various channels like Employee Portal, Virtual Agent, or Microsoft Teams.

Notifications of prompts and the prompt appearance are different in different channels.

-   Prompt widget - On any portal, prompts are displayed through a widget. The Prompt widget is available by default, but must be added to the portal. For more information, see [Add and configure the prompt widget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/proactive-prompts/config-widget-for-prompts.md).

    The **View details** button on the prompt widget provides more details of the prompt. The details displayed depend on the type of Datasource, the Receiving user and the template \(Single or Multiple record display\) selected. For more information, see [Create a signal in Proactive Prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/proactive-prompts/proactive-prompts-signal-create.md). For more information on actions on the widget, see [Actions and action groups in Proactive Prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/proactive-prompts/proactive-prompts-actions.md).

    **Note:** The generated prompts are delivered to the widget only when the user opens the portal.

-   Virtual Agent - A notification is displayed on the Virtual Agent chat icon to indicate that there’s a prompt message. Selecting the **Open chat window** button starts the chat displaying the prompt message and options to take further actions.
-   Microsoft Teams - Similar to the Virtual Agent chat, a notification is displayed in the chat pane. Selecting the Now Virtual Agent contact initiates the chat.
