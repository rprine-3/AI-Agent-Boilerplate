# Create a signal in Proactive Prompts

Configure signals to determine what prompts to send, whom to send them to, where and when to send them, and to generate them to send to your user.

## Before you begin

**Note:** You must install and activate both the Proactive Prompts application and ServiceNow Otto for HRSD application so that you can use the capability and prompts from the base system. The two signals that are available for use are the Approvals pending prompt, and the High leave balance prompt.

Role required: sn\_pp.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Proactive Prompts** &gt; **Signal Configurations**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the signal configuration.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description about the signal.

5.  Activate the signal by selecting the **Active** option.

6.  In the **Schedule** field, select a schedule that determines the frequency of sending the prompt to the user.

    For more information on schedules, see [Configure signal schedules in Proactive Prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/proactive-prompts/proactive-prompts-signal-schedules.md).

7.  In the **Priority** field, select the priority to determine the display order of the prompts on the prompt widget.

    The available values are High, Low, or Medium.

8.  In the **Order** field, select the order that is related to the signal.

9.  In the **Category tags** field, select the category for the signal, which is used to pull the specific prompts on the prompt widget.

    For more information, see [Configure signal categories in Proactive Prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/proactive-prompts/proactive-prompts-signal-catergories.md).

10. In the **Channels and actions** field, select the channel where you want the prompts to be displayed and the actions that you want to associate with the channel.

    For more information, see [Configure delivery channels in Proactive Prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/proactive-prompts/proactive-prompts-config-channels.md).

11. In the **Receiving user** field, select the user that you want to receive the prompt, either the manager or an employee.

    **Note:**

    -   The employee value is taken from the **User** field of the data source that is specified in the **Datasource** field.
    -   The manager of an employee is derived from the **Manager** field in the User \[sys\_user\] table.
12. On the **Signal Source** tab, select the data source method to retrieve the data in the **Datasource** field.

    For more information, see [Types of data sources in Proactive Prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/proactive-prompts/proactive-prompts-data-source.md).

    The content in the template is displayed as the content of the prompt to your user.
