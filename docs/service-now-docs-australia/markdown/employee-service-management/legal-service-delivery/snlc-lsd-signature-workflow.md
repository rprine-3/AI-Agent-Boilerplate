# Signature workflow for a request

Contract Management Pro for Legal Service Delivery supports electronic signature, wet \(manual\) signature, and offline signature for a contract request.

-   Electronic Signature: Enables signatories to sign the contract document electronically. For more information, see [Configure an e-signature provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-integrate-esign.md).

    To generate a certificate of completion, select the **Electronic Signature** as the signature type in the contract request. For more information, see [Activate a system property to generate a certificate of completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-config-system-prop-COC.md).

-   Wet Signature: Enables signatories to sign the contract document manually. You can then upload the signed document to a contract request. For more information, see [Upload a signed contract document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-upload-doc-wsignature.md).
-   Offline signature: Records a contract that has been signed outside Contract Management Pro. Signature request emails are not sent to the signatories. The fulfiller or contract user uploads the signed document directly.

## Electronic signature workflow

-   Send the finalized document to the signatories for signing.
    -   The state and contract status updates to Awaiting Signature and the electronic signature flow is triggered as configured in [Configure an e-signature provider for legal contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/snlc-integrate-esign.md).
    -   An email notification that the contract document is available for signature is sent to the first signatory. The email contains a link to the contract document that the signatory can open and sign the document through the Docusign or Adobe Acrobat Sign electronic signature provider.

        Signatories receive signature request emails according to the order set in the **Signatories** tab.

        You can assign the same signing order to multiple signatories when you want them to sign the contract simultaneously. Signatories with the same signing order receive signature requests at the same time and can complete their signatures independently.

        **Note:** This option is not available when you set the signing order in Employee Center.

    -   The signatory fields—such as Name, Title, and Email—are not pre-filled in the contract document before it is sent for signature. The electronic signature provider populates these fields when the signatory accesses the document to sign it.
-   Signatories can sign or decline the contract document.

</table>    **Note:** When signatory roles are enabled, each signatory participates in the electronic signature workflow according to their assigned role. For information about available roles and how to enable them, see [Signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-signatory-roles.md).

    If the system property **sn\_cm\_core.enable\_executed\_contract\_audit\_certificate** is set to true, the certificate of completion is generated and attached to the contract repository record.


## Wet signature workflow

-   Send the finalized document to the signatories for signing.
    -   The state and contract status are updated to Awaiting signature.
    -   An email notification is sent to the first signatory in order and the contract documents are attached as PDFs in the email.

        The current signatory is placed in the To field of the email. The following recipients are placed in the CC field:

        -   Contract fulfiller
        -   Person who opened the contract
        -   Person for whom the contract was requested
        -   Initiator of the send for signature action
-   Signatories accept or decline the document.

 For non-self-served contracts, the state of the request and the contract status updates to Contract signed. To close the contract request, select Close complete.

 For more information, see [Upload a manually signed contract document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/snlc-upload-doc-wet-sign.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>
**Note:** In the wet signature workflow, only signatories with the Signer role participate. Signatories with Viewer, Receiver, or Approver roles are not included. For more information, see [Signatory roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-signatory-roles.md).

## Offline signature workflow

Use the offline signature workflow when the contract is signed outside Contract Management Pro. For example, the parties sign the contract document in person or through a third-party application, and you want to record the signed document against the contract request.

-   Set up a contract request for offline signature.
    -   Create a contract request with **Offline signature** selected as the signature type.
    -   On an existing contract request, change the signature type from **Electronic signature** or **Wet signature** to **Offline signature**.
-   The fulfiller or contract user selects **Initiate offline signature**.
-   The state and contract status update to Awaiting signature. Signature request emails are not sent to the signatories.
-   The signatories sign the contract document outside Contract Management Pro.
-   The contract fulfiller uploads the signed document.
-   The state and contract status update to Contract signed. The status of all signatories updates from Not started to Completed.

## Changing the signature type from e-signature to wet signature

Wet signature supports only Signer role and sequential signing. If you change the signature type from electronic signature to wet signature:

-   Signatories with Viewer, Receiver, or Approver roles are removed.
-   Signatories with the same signing order are assigned sequential signing order, and any gaps in the signing order are removed.

A message notifies you of these changes so that you can review the Signatories tab before continuing with the signature workflow.

## Modify signatories when the signature workflow is in progress

**Modify signatories** enables you to add, remove, edit, or reorder pending signatories while a signature workflow is in progress. Initiating this action pauses the signature workflow for a duration defined by the system property **maximum\_signature\_pause\_duration**. To continue the signature workflow after making changes, use the **Resume Signature** option to resume the workflow.

The workflow can progress as follows:

-   Use **Modify signatories** option to modify the signatories.
-   Add, remove, modify, or reorder signatories.

    **Note:**

    -   For signature block-based contract templates, you can add, modify, remove, and reorder actions, whereas for participant based templates, only modify and reorder actions are enabled.
    -   Modify signatories option is available in wet signature workflow and Electronic signature workflow with Docusign electronic signature provider integration.
-   Select **Resume signature** to resume the signature workflow once modifications are complete.

    **Note:** If the signature workflow is not resumed within the configured time duration, any changes made to the signatories are reverted, and the signature workflow resumes from its previous state.

-   Signature request email notifications are sent to the signatories.
-   After the last signatory has signed the document, the contract repository record is created and the signed document is attached to it.

For more information, see [Modify signatories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/snlc-pause-signature.md) and [Resend signature request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/snlc-resend-sign-req.md).

## Contract document access

Access to a contract document is based on the following user roles and conditions:

-   A contract fulfiller can view and update contract documents
-   Only a contract administrator can delete contract documents.
-   Requesters can view only the contract documents for which they submitted the contract request.
-   Users added to the watch list can view only contract documents for contract requests they have added.

While generating the contract repository record, mapped fields and their values are validated for data type and correctness. If validation errors are found, an email notification is sent to the contract fulfiller. The email also displays the list of fields that were not copied into the final contract document and the link to the contract repository record. The fulfiller then opens the record using the link and corrects the values to resolve the validation errors.
