## Predefined conversation topics for Legal Service Delivery

The Legal Virtual Agent Conversations application installs the following virtual agent conversation topics \(chatbot conversations\) to help employees with common self-service tasks in Legal Service Delivery. These conversation topics are grouped under the Legal Service Delivery category.

-   **Check Legal Request and Matter status**

    Displays the status of legal requests and matters submitted by employees for themselves or on behalf of another employee.

-   **General Legal Request**

    Helps employees create a general legal request. Based on the entered short description, it also provides links to relevant Legal knowledge base articles to resolve issues.

-   **Privacy Assessment**

    Helps employees create a legal request to review whether projects comply with an organization’s applicable privacy regulations and accepted privacy policy. The Legal department reviews such requests for potential risks and might recommend a mitigation plan if necessary.

-   **Stock Trading**

    Helps employees to know about the stock trading window of your organization and with stock pre-clearance requests.

    This virtual agent conversation topic is available only if you've installed the Legal Stock Preclearance application.

-   **Legal Knowledge Base**

    Finds and displays Legal knowledge base articles based on the entered search string.


**Note:** If [Universal Request for legal services is enabled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/universal-requests-legal.md), the system creates a universal request and an associated legal request when an employee submits a legal request through virtual agent. General Legal Request, Privacy Assessment, and Stock Trading request types are supported.
