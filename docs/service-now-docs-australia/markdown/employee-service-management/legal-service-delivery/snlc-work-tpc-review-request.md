## What to do next

-   Signatories can review and sign or decline to sign the contract.

    For more information, see [Signature workflow for a request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/snlc-lsd-signature-workflow.md).

    -   If any signatory declines to sign the contract document, the Contract status updates to Signing declined. In the **Signatories** tab, the status of all signatories updates to Declined. If more changes are required in the contract document, update it and resend it to the signatories for their signature.
    -   After all signatories sign the document, the system sends an email to the legal signatories with the finalized contract document attached.
    -   If the certificate of completion is enabled, a certificate is issued with the timestamp details about each signatory's action during an electronic signature.
-   If the contract is signed by all signatories, you can close the request by selecting **Close Complete**.
