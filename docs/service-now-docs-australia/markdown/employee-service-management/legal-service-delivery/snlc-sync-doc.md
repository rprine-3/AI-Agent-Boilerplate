# Synchronize a non-disclosure agreement document after modifying a self-served contract request \(Contract Management Pro 1.2.1\)

Synchronize the contract document for non-disclosure agreements contract requests to create a new revision of the document with updated metadata and signatories while retaining the changes made in the previous version of the contact document.

## About this task

**Note:** The **Sync document** option is available only starting with Contract Management Pro version 1.2.1

You can synchronize a contract document only when the contract request is in the Work in progress state.

**Note:** Tables are not updated when you use the **Sync document** option. You must regenerate the document to update the tables.
