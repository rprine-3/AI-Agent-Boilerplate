# Request an internal review

Initiate a review task for review of the contract document by subject matter experts.

## Before you begin

-   For non-disclosure agreements, you may want review and feedback from the internal subject matter experts. If needed, the contract requester can submit a change request to the contract fulfiller. The contract fulfiller then submits a review task with the change request details. For more information, see [Review a contract document in Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/snlc-submit-req-chngs-ndar.md).
-   For third-party contract review requests, the contract user cannot create a change request. Instead, the contract fulfiller creates a task for internal review.

Role required: sn\_cm\_core.contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

-   You can raise a review task when the contract request State is Work in progress or Awaiting review.
-   You can create parallel review tasks for the same contract document for different reviewer groups. You can't create a review task for the same document with the same reviewer group if another active task already exists.
