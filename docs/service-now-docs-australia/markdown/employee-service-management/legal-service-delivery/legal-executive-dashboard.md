# Legal Executive dashboard

With the Legal Executive dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for resolving Legal service requests.

From a single place, you can track the status of legal requests and matters, analyze trends, and drill down into the details. You can view the details for top request categories, requests by user locations, practice area, and requesting department, SLA compliance of legal requests and legal matters, the average number of requests handled per attorney, and average time to close legal requests and legal matters over time.

**Note:** The classic version of Legal Executive Dashboard has been deprecated. If you open a saved URL to access the classic Legal Executive Dashboard, the Next Experience dashboard is automatically displayed. If you have customized the classic version, review and migrate your customizations to the Next Experience Legal Executive Dashboard.

For reports and metrics on legal requests and legal matters and the trend analysis, see [Legal Operations dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/legal-operations-dashboard.md).

Also, you can add new tabs in the dashboard to view reports related to practice areas created by you.
