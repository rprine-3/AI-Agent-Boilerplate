For more information, see [Modify a non-disclosure agreement legal request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/snlc-modify-nda-req.md).


## Result

-   A legal request is submitted and a contract request is created for generating contract documents.
    -   If there are no validation errors, a contract request is created in the Work in progress state.
    -   If there is a validation error due to incorrect signatory information, a contract request is created in Draft state.
-   If a contract template rule or contract configuration is not available, a contract request will not be created. The contract configurator should correct the configuration to trigger contract request creation. The legal request remains in Draft state.
-   Version 1.0 of a contract document is generated and listed in the **Contract Document** tab of the contract request.
-   The contract document generation process involves:
    -   Using the correct contract template based on contract template rules.
    -   Replacing the metadata with data from the request.
    -   Replacing the signatory information.
    -   Placing the content of the clauses in the contract document according to the clause variation rules.
-   Internal signatories based on the template are also populated in the generated document. For more information, see [Define an internal signatory rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/contract-management-pro/cncore-define-internal-signers-rule.md).

    **Note:**

    -   If more signatories have been added in the request than are needed for the contract as defined in the contract template, only the default number of signatories are necessary for signing the contract. Other signatories are marked as Not Considered.
    -   If fewer signatories are included in the request than are required for the contract, you can add more signatories.
    A record for each external signatory is created in the Signer \[sn\_cm\_core\_signer\] table.
