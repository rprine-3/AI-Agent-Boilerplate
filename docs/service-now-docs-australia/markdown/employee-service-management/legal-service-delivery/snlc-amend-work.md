# Work on amendment request

Review and work on an amendment request for an existing contract.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_cnt.contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

A sample workflow while working on an amendment request would be:

1.  Assign the amendment contract request.
2.  Link a parent contract, if it’s already not linked or you want to change the linked contract.
3.  Modify legal request.
4.  Review the details of the amendment requested.
5.  Update the contract details and contract document according to the amendment request.
6.  Upload revised contract document using **Create revision** option.
7.  Finalizes the contract amendment using the review, approval, and signature workflow.

Identify the legal and contract requests created for amendment using the following indicators:

-   In the legal request, the subject is in the *Amendment request of &lt;contract\_type&gt; for &lt;company\_name&gt;* format.
-   In the contract request, the subject is in the *&lt;type of paper&gt; - &lt;contract type&gt; - amendment request - &lt;CMR-number&gt;* format and the **Request type** is set to Amendment
