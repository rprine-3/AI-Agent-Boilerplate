# Initiate an ad hoc approval for a contract document revision

Initiate an ad hoc approval for a contract document revision from a user or a user group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_cnt.contract\_fulfiller

## About this task

As a collaborator added to a request, you can access and work on the request just as assignees can. However, you can't modify the **Assigned to** and **Assignment group** fields.

You can assign these approvals to any user or user group in your organization who have the sn\_lg\_cnt.contract\_fulfiller role. When you initiate an approval, the approvers receive an email notification and can review and act on the approval.

**Note:** If a contract document revision already has a pending approval record, you cannot initiate another approval for the same item.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Legal request** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center**.

2.  Click the list icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, navigate to **Legal Requests** or **Contract Requests**.
