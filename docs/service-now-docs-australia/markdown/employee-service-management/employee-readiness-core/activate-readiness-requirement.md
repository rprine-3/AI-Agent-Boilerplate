# Activate a health and safety requirement

Activate requirements to track when employees are ready to return to the workplaceor to safely travel to another site. You can also activate requirements that visitors must complete before entering the workplace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_core.admin

## About this task

Use health and safety requirements to define the requirements that employees must fulfill before they can return to the workplace, safely travel to another site , or that visitors must fulfill before entering the workplace. Employee Readiness Core includes pre-built requirements. For more information, see [Included health and safety requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-readiness-core/included-health-safety-requirements.md).

Requirements are not active by default. A requirement must be activated before you can track whether employeesor visitors have fulfilled the requirement.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Health and Safety Status** &gt; **Health and Safety Requirements**.

2.  Click the requirement that you want to activate.

    **Note:** Pre-built requirements provided by Employee Readiness Core are ready to activate without any modifications. However, you can choose to edit them to meet your company's needs. For example, you can edit the **Use duration** and **Valid for** fields to adjust the amount of time a requirement status is valid for. You can also select the **Actionable** check box to add a link for employees to complete the requirement on the Health and Safety Status page. If you're activating a custom requirement, make sure that you select a flow in the **Requirement flow** field. You must also select a table and conditions in the Include previous applicable records section. You can't activate the requirement unless these fields are populated.

3.  Click **Activate**.

    After the requirement is activated, health and safety user records are created for employeesor visitors who have activity for the requirement. Health and safety user records are also created for employeesor visitors who have activity for the requirement before it was activated.


## What to do next

You can view all health and safety user records by navigating to **Employee Health and Safety Status** &gt; **Health and Safety Users**. The **Requirements status** column shows the employee'sor visitor's progress towards completing all active requirements. The value is **Cleared** if the employeeor visitor has fulfilled all active requirementsfor their current location. The value is **Not cleared** if the employeeor visitor is missing any requirements.

You can also look up the requirements status for individual employeesor visitors by navigating to **Employee Health and Safety Status** &gt; **View Employee and Visitor Status**. The status page can be used during the employeeor visitor health screening process for entering the workplace.
