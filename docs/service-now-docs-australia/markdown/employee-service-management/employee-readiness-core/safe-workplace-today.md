## Set up My Safe Workplace

Add or remove widgets that employees can view on My Safe Workplace.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

My Safe Workplace uses widgets from ServiceNow® Safe Workplace suite applications.

-   The **Submit an update about your health status** widget requires the ServiceNow® Emergency Self Report application.
-   The **Track your reservations** widget requires the ServiceNow® Workplace Core application.

If these applications are not installed, by default there are blank spaces in My Safe Workplace where the corresponding widgets would be displayed. Complete the setup steps to remove any blank spaces.

My Safe Workplace also has widgets for employees to create and track requests. The requests use features from the following Safe Workplace suite applications.

-   ServiceNow® Contact Tracing
-   ServiceNow® Employee Health Screening
-   ServiceNow® Employee Readiness Core
-   ServiceNow® Employee Travel Safety
-   ServiceNow® Health and Safety Testing
-   ServiceNow® Workplace PPE Inventory Management
-   ServiceNow® Workplace Core

If some of these applications are not installed, employees can still use the widgets to create and view requests based on the applications that are installed. Install the remaining applications to give employees access to all request types.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Configuration**.

2.  Click **Designer**.

3.  Search for **Safe Workplace Today**.

4.  Adjust the page layout to remove any blank spaces.

    You can also remove any widgets that you don't want to use, or add new widgets. For detailed instructions, see [Create and edit a page using the Service Portal Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/t_ConfigureAPage.md).


### What to do next

To complete the setup, make sure that employees have the required roles to view the widgets.

-   The **Submit an update about your health status** widget requires the sn\_imt\_quarantine.crisis\_task\_user role.
-   The **Track your reservations** widget requires the sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user role.
-   The **View your team's status** widget is only displayed for managers. The sn\_imt\_monitoring.monitoring\_user role is required for managers to view details about their direct reports.
-   There are no required roles for all other My Safe Workplace widgets.
