# Create a health and safety requirement

Create requirements to track when employees are ready to return to the workplaceor visit a site. You can also create requirements that visitors must complete before entering the workplace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_core.admin

## About this task

Use health and safety requirements to define the requirements that employees must fulfill before they can return to the workplace, or that visitors must fulfill before entering the workplace. Create separate requirements for employees and visitors. A requirement must apply to either employees or visitors, not both. Employee Readiness Core provides some [pre-built requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-readiness-core/included-health-safety-requirements.md). However, you can create additional requirements using data from any of the Safe Workplace suite or Emergency Response Management apps.

Health and safety requirements are built with [Flow Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/flow-designer.md). Before creating a requirement, make sure that you're familiar with the basics of ServiceNow® Workflow Studio.

The following steps show how to create a requirement using the pre-built Employee Health Verification Requirement as an example.

## Procedure

1.  In Workflow Studio, create an action to check the requirement status for an employeeor visitor.

    1.  Create an action.

    2.  Save the action in the Employee Readiness Core application.

    3.  In the Inputs section of the Action Outline, create an input for the type of record that you will use to check if the employeeor visitor has fulfilled the requirement.

        For example, to fulfill the Employee Health Verification Requirement, employees must have a health verification record in the Employee Health Verification table \[sn\_imt\_monitoring\_health\_verification\].

        |Label|Name|Type|Mandatory|
        |-----|----|----|---------|
        |Employee Health Verification|health\_verification|Reference.Employee Health Verification \[sn\_imt\_monitoring\_health\_verification\]|Yes|

    4.  Add a **Script Step** to the Action Outline.

    5.  In the **Required Runtime** field, select **Instance**.

    6.  Create an input variable using the input that you created for the action as the value.

        This enables you to use the input for the action in a script.

        |Name|Value|
        |----|-----|
        |health\_verification|**Employee Health Verification** input that you created in the Inputs section.|

    7.  In the **Script** field, add a script to define the conditions when an employee'sor visitor's requirement status is `cleared` or `not_cleared`.

        For the Employee Health Verification Requirement, the requirement is `cleared` for an employee if their health verification response is `yes`, and `not_cleared` for any other response.

        ```
        (function execute(inputs, outputs) {
        	outputs.requirement_status = inputs.health_verification.response == 'yes'
            	? 'cleared'
            	: 'not_cleared';
        })(inputs, outputs);
        ```

    8.  Create an output variable for the requirement status.

        This defines the *requirement\_status* variable that you used in the script.

        |Label|Name|Type|Mandatory|Choice \(Advanced options\)|
        |-----|----|----|---------|---------------------------|
        |requirement\_status|requirement\_status|Choice|Yes|Dropdown with --None--|

    9.  In the Outputs section of the Action Outline, create an output for the requirement status.

        Creating this output enables you to use the *requirement\_status* output variable from the script as an output returned by the action.

        |Label|Name|Type|Mandatory|Choice \(Advanced options\)|
        |-----|----|----|---------|---------------------------|
        |Requirement status|requirement\_status|Choice|No|Dropdown with --None--|

    10. Assign the *requirement\_status* value to the output.

        |Label|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |Requirement Status|*requirement\_status* output variable from the script step.|

        The action returns the value of the *requirement\_status* for the employeeor visitor \(`cleared` or `not_cleared`\) as an output.

    11. Click **Publish**.

2.  Create a health and safety requirement.

    1.  Navigate to **Employee Health and Safety Status** &gt; **Health and Safety Requirements**.

    2.  Click **New**.

    3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        The Include previous applicable records section defines a set of records that have already been created but should still trigger the requirement flow. Including previous records ensures that employees or visitorswho complete the requirement before it is activated have their requirement status set to **Cleared**.

<table id="table_wxk_x2n_2mb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Unique name for the requirement. For example, `Employee Health Verification Requirement`.

</table>    4.  Click **Submit**.

3.  In Workflow Studio, create a flow to update the requirement status for an employeeor visitor.

    1.  Create a new flow.

    2.  Save the flow in the Employee Readiness Core application.

    3.  Add a trigger so that the flow runs whenever the type of record that you're using to check the requirement status is created or updated.

        For example, for the Employee Health Verification Requirement, the flow runs whenever a health verification record is created or updated.

        |Trigger|Table|Condition|Run Trigger|
        |-------|-----|---------|-----------|
        |Created or Updated|Employee Health Verification \[sn\_imt\_monitoring\_health\_verification\]|None.|For each unique change|

    4.  Add the action that you created to the flow.

    5.  Add the record from the trigger as the input.

        For example, for the Employee Health Verification input, add the Employee Health Verification record that was created or updated in the trigger event.

    6.  Add the Update User Requirement action provided in Employee Readiness Core to the flow.

        |User \[User\]|Health and safety requirement \[Health and Safety Requirement\]|Requirement status|Trigger datetime|
        |-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|
        |**Employee** or **User** field from the trigger record. For example, the **Employee** field from the Employee Health Verification record.|Health and safety requirement you created.|`requirement_status` returned by the action that you created.|**Created** field from the trigger record. Only use this input if you set a value for the **Valid for** field on the requirement.|

    7.  Click **Activate**.

4.  Complete the health and safety requirement.

    1.  Navigate to **Employee Health and Safety Status** &gt; **Health and Safety Requirements**.

    2.  Click the requirement that you created earlier.

    3.  In the **Requirement flow** field, add the flow that you created to update the requirement status for employeesor visitors.

    4.  Click **Update**.


## What to do next

When you create the requirement, it's not active by default. You must activate the requirement before you can track whether employeesor visitors have fulfilled the requirement.
