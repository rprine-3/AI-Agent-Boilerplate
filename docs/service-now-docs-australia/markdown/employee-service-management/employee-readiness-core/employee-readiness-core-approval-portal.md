# Employee Readiness Core Approval Portal

The Employee Readiness Core Approval Portal enables you to approve or deny submitted COVID-19 vaccine doses, vaccine exemptions, and health tests.

## Installation and setup requirements

The Approval Portal is included with Employee Readiness Core. To use the Approval Portal, your organization must install Health and Safety Testing and Vaccination Status.

**Note:** Both applications must be installed, but your organization does not have to use both applications.

-   For more information on installing Health and Safety Testing, see [Install Health and Safety Testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-testing/install-health-testing.md).
-   For more information on installing Vaccination Status, see [Install Vaccination Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/install-vaccination-status.md).

## Using the Approval Portal

To use the Approval Portal, you must have either the Vaccination Status admin \[sn\_imt\_vaccine.admin\], Health and safety approver \[sn\_imt\_core.health\_and\_safety\_approver\], or Approval Portal manager \[sn\_imt\_core.approval\_portal\_manager\] roles.

Managers with the Approval Portal manager role can see only approvals for their direct reports. This role is automatically assigned to all managers as long as one of the following properties is enabled:

-   Allow managers the ability to update health test results \[sn\_imt\_health\_test.allow\_managers\_ability\_to\_update\_test\_result\_records\]
-   Allow managers the ability to update vaccine response records \[sn\_imt\_vaccine.allow\_managers\_ability\_to\_update\_vaccine\_response\_records\]
-   Allow managers the ability to update vaccine exemption requests \[sn\_imt\_vaccine.allow\_managers\_ability\_to\_update\_vaccine\_exemption\_records\]

Each property provides managers access to the Approval Portal, however, managers are able to see and interact with only records associated with the activated property. Activating multiple properties grants additional capabilities to the reviewing managers.

You can perform the following tasks on the Approval Portal:

-   View and approve or deny COVID-19 health test results. For more information, see [Confirm COVID-19 test results for a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-testing/confirm-health-test-result.md).
-   View and approve or deny an employee's vaccination status and dose details. For more information, see [Confirm the reported vaccination status for a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/confirm-vaccine-response.md).
-   View and approve or deny employee vaccination exemption requests. For more information, see [Confirm a vaccine exemption request for a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/confirm-vaccine-exemption-request.md).
-   Review attachments and documentation submitted with the user's responses and requests. Supported documents open in the document viewer. For more information on supported formats, see [Document Viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/Documentviewer.md).
-   Review and add work notes to the records.
