    |Property|Description|
    |--------|-----------|
    |sn\_imt\_core.send\_email\_to\_visitor|When enabled, the **Notify about scheduled visit** email notification is sent to the visitor when an employee invites them to the workplace. The email is sent immediately after the employee submits the invitation.
