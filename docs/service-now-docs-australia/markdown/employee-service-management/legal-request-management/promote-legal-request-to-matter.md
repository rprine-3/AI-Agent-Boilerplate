# Promote a legal request to a legal matter

Promote a legal request to a legal matter when the request needs additional investigation and cross-departmental collaboration that might take more time to resolve.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have the Legal Matter Management app installed and the record producer type in the associated intake form set to **Request and Matter**. For more information, see [Add an intake form to a practice area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/associate-categories-practice-area.md).

Role required: sn\_lg\_ops.legal\_fulfiller

## About this task

As a collaborator added to a request, you can access and work on the request just as assignees can. However, you can't modify the **Assigned to** and **Assignment group** fields.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Legal Request** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center**.

2.  Click the list icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, open a legal request by selecting an option under **Legal Requests**.

**As an assignee**

</td><td>

1.  Select the **Assigned to Me** option.
2.  Select a request to work on.
3.  If the request is newly assigned to you, select **Start Work** to start working on the request.

The state of the legal request is Work in progress and the document is Legal review.

**Create a new matter**

</td><td>

-   Select **Create Matter**.
-   In the Create Matter dialog, indicate whether to use a template to create a legal matter.
    -   To create a legal matter record with predefined data, such as phases and tasks, select a template name from the Matter template list, and select **OK**.
    -   To create a legal matter record without any predefined data, leave the Matter template field empty and select **OK**.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d67541e224">

**Add to an existing matter**

</td><td>

-   Select **Add to an Existing Matter**.
-   In the Add to an existing matter dialog, select an existing matter.
-   Select **OK**


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>
## Result

-   A legal matter is created with details copied from the legal request.
-   When legal request is promoted by creating a new matter, the Privileged and Confidential status of the created matter is dependent on the Privileged and Confidential status of the request. You can change the status later.
-   When legal request is promoted by adding to an existing matter, the Privileged and Confidential status of the existing matter is retained irrespective of the Privileged and Confidential status of the request.
-   You \(a legal fulfiller or a collaborator\) will be added in the **Watch list** of the legal matter to access it.
-   If you selected a matter template, then the matter has predefined phases, tasks, and attributes from the template.
-   If the external storage option is enabled, the documents attached to the legal request and stored in the configured external storage are listed under the **Documents** tab of the [legal matter's Artifact record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-matter-management/add-artifact-to-legal-matter.md).

    **Note:** Since the documents in the artifact created from the requests are shared, the addition or deletion of any documents in this shared artifact is reflected in both request and matter. Also, the document permission for this shared artifact is managed at the legal request level and not at the legal matter level.
