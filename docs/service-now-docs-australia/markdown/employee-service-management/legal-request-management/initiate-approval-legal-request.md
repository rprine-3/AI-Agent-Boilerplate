# Initiate an ad hoc approval for a legal request or its attachment

Initiate an ad hoc approval for a legal request or its attachments from a user or a user group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_ops.legal\_fulfiller

## About this task

As a collaborator added to a request, you can access and work on the request just as assignees can. However, you can't modify the **Assigned to** and **Assignment group** fields.

Some cases where approvals can be requested for a legal request or its attachment include:

-   Approval for legal contract documents from stakeholders.
-   Ad hoc approval for a legal request that needs an authorization from the privacy team before it can be processed.

You can assign these approvals to any user or user group in your organization who have the legal\_user role. When you initiate an approval, the approvers receive an email notification and can review and act on the approval.

**Note:** If a legal request or attachment already has a pending approval record, you cannot initiate another approval for the same item.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Legal Request** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center**.

2.  Click the list icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, open a legal request by selecting an option under **Legal Requests**.

## Result

Assigned approvers are added in the **Approvers** tab based on the following conditions:

-   If you selected **User** in the **Approval by** field, an approval record is created for the selected user.
-   If you selected **User group** in the **Approval by** field, an approval record for each user in the selected user group is created. Anyone from the group can approve.

The assigned approvers get an email notification with a link to open the record for review and action.

**Note:**

-   An attachment cannot be deleted after an ad hoc approval is initiated and is in the Requested state. To remove such attachments, either cancel the ad hoc approval request or obtain the approval first.
-   When you remove an attachment from a legal request, it also deletes the associated ad hoc approval records. A work note is posted with the deletion details in the activity stream of the legal request.

The approval details appear under the **Approvals** tab on the Standard Ticket page.

Approvers can review and [approve or reject the requested item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/approve-reject-legal-request-attach.md).
