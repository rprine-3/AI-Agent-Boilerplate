</table>4.  Enable privilege and confidential status.

    1.  Select **Enable Privilege and Confidential**.

        The enable action is available only when the request is in the Assigned or Work in progress state. Requests in states such as Closed Complete, Closed Incomplete, or Cancelled cannot have their Privileged and Confidential status changed.\[Omitted image "lsd-acp-enable.png"\] Alt text: Enable privileged and confidential

    2.  On the confirmation modal, select **Continue**.

    -   The legal request is marked as Privileged and Confidential.
    -   The assignment group permission is automatically updated to No Access. You can manually modify the assignment group permission.
    -   Privileged and Confidential field in the secondary header is changed to Enabled.
    -   In the Privileged Document Access tab, the document permissions are marked as Privileged &amp; confidential. Access to these documents for users is controlled by the Assignment group permissions.
    -   Notifications and outbound emails from the request automatically include "privileged and confidential" markers in the email content.
    -   Stakeholders are notified when changes occur to the collaborator list, watchlist, or fulfiller assignment of a privileged and confidential enabled request.
5.  Update the **Assignment group permission** to change the permission level of the legal request for the users.

    -   **No Access**: Only the practice area lead, group manager, and user in the **Assigned to** field can access the legal request and assign it to one of the members in the assignment group. The assigned user can then work on the legal request.
    -   **Read**: All members from the assignment group can only view the legal request. This option is the default permission level.
    -   **Edit**: All members from the assignment group can view and work on the legal request. The Assigned To field becomes optional if this option is set.
    Assignment Group Permission field of a active Legal Request Record can be edited by:

    -   Practice area lead, Assignment group manager, Assigned to, and delegated users.
    -   Any Assignment group member, if the record is in New state or Assignment group permission is edit or Configured options have assigned\_to\_field\_not\_mandatory in it.
6.  If the request must be reassigned to a new assignment group due to business needs, select a new assignment group in the **Assignment group** field.

    **Note:** Editing of the **Assignment group** field is available only when the **Editable Assignment group in Request** [option is configured](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/associate-categories-practice-area.md) in the associated intake form.

    When the assignment group is changed, existing group users who are not in the updated assignment group might lose access to the request. The **Assigned to** field is also cleared, and the assigned user is notified via email.

7.  If you need help from other fulfillers to work on the legal request, add them in the **Collaborators** field.

    **Note:** Users with the sn\_lg\_contracts.contracts\_fulfiller role are listed in the **Collaborators** field.

    The collaborators are notified via email that they have been added as collaborators to a legal request.

8.  Work on the legal request to fulfill the requested services or information.

    If the request needs detailed investigation, you can [promote the request to a legal matter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/promote-legal-request-to-matter.md).

    **Note:** To promote a legal request to a legal matter, you must have the Legal Matter Management app installed and the record producer type for the associated intake form must be set to **Request and Matter**.
