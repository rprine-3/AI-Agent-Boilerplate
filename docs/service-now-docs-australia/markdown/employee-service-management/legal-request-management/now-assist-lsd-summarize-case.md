# Summarize a legal request or matter by using ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\)

Generate a summary from the fields that you selected on the legal request or matter record and quickly understand the request context by using the Legal Request or Legal Matter summarization skill in the ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_gen\_ai.request\_fulfiller

## About this task

The Legal Request or Legal Matter summarization skill provides you with a concise summary of a legal request or legal matter, including the actions taken and resolution details. By viewing a summary, you can understand the context, refresh the summary, and post the summary to the work notes.

You can configure the variables of practice areas that you want to be considered as inputs for legal request or matter AI summarization. To add variables, see [Configure variables for AI summarization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/configure-variables-for-now-assist-summarization.md).

The summarization skills are available in Legal Counsel Center and in Core UI.

-   In Legal Counsel Center, you use the Legal Request summary by AI component to generate a summary. This component appears above the activity stream.

    **Note:** You can also generate a summary on demand from the ServiceNow Otto panel. For more information, see [Use the capabilities from the ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/now-assist-request-gen-ai-cap.md).

-   In Core UI, you select the **Summarize** button on the legal request or matter record to generate a summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center** and open a legal request or matter.

2.  In the Legal Request summary by AI component, select **Summarize**.

    The summary by AI component appears before the activity stream.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

3.  When you finish summarizing a record, you can add it to the work notes, expand or collapse it, provide feedback, copy it, or view information about it.
