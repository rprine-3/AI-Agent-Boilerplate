-   If the application requires plugins or other store applications, install them first if they are not already installed.
-   Review the [Legal Request Management](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/98add2f1b30313007a6de81816a8dc30) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
