# Add fields to the semantic index for legal records

Add the description, short description, and legal category field to the semantic index record to be indexed for a semantic search in the ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\) application. During AI Search, the legal records are retrieved based on the description, short description, and legal category fields that are added in the semantic index.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope to **Legal Counsel Center** in the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).
