# Document access in a legal request

Documents attached to legal requests are uploaded to the configured external storage system when the external storage option is enabled on the legal request intake form. The access of these documents to various personas is controlled in real time, via a scheduled job, or on-demand.

## Document access for various personas

</table>The scheduled job **Process External Storage Permissions** runs at the defined intervals to sync access for all unprocessed permissions on documents for legal requests stored in external storage.

-   Requesters can access documents attached to their legal requests from the **Documents** tab on the Standard Ticket page.

    **Note:** Requesters can delete only those documents from the request that they've attached.

-   The legal fulfiller assigned to the legal request can access documents from the **Documents** tab of the request record in the Legal Counsel Center.
-   Users added to the matter can request on-demand access to documents if they need access before the scheduled job is run.
-   The legal fulfiller can revoke a user's access to documents.
-   Ad hoc approvers lose document access after they approve or reject the requested item.
-   Delegates lose access after the delegation period expires.
