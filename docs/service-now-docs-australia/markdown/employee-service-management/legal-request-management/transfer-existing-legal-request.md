# Transfer a legal request

Transfer a legal request to a new practice area or category if the request was submitted with an inappropriate practice area or category.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the record producer is mapped to category. For more information, see [Add an intake form to a practice area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/associate-categories-practice-area.md).

The transfer request action is available to the users having write access to the request, such as Practice Area Leads, Group Managers, and users with Request manager roles in New state.​ It is also available to the respective fulfillers to whom the request is assigned in the Assigned state.

Role required: sn\_lg\_ops.request\_fulfiller

-   A new request is created and the old request is canceled.
-   The state of the new request is Draft.

-   Any attachments in ServiceNow® storage or external storage like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive are transferred to the new request.
-   After the request is sent to the requester, the fulfiller's name is moved from the Collaborators field to the Watch list.
-   The request state is changed to New after the variables are updated and submitted by the fulfiller.
