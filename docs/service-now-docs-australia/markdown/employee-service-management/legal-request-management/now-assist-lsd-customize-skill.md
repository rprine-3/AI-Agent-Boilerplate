# Customize a summarization skill in ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\)

If you have the admin role, you can customize a ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\) skill so that you can use the generative AI skills in Legal Counsel Center and in Core UI.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The legal request summarization and legal matter summarization skills are available in the base system with the required configurations. To customize the skill, you must create a copy of the skill that is in the base system before you modify the configuration. Activating a customized skill with the same base input table as the original skill automatically deactivates the original skill.

From the AI Admin Hub console, you can select the input table, related records, and fields for each input template of the request summarization skill, and then configure the prompt headers to include in the general summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub**.

2.  Select **AI Skills** tab.

3.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **LSD**.

4.  Create a copy of the ServiceNow Otto for LSD feature summarization skill for customization.

    1.  On the feature card that is associated with the skill that you would like to activate, select the More actions icon \[Omitted image "more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon and create a copy that you can customize by selecting **Make a copy**.

    2.  On the confirmation pop-up, select **Make a copy**.

        A guided setup leads you through the configuration of the general details, input, prompt, availability, display, review, and activation of the customized skill. If you complete the entire walk-through, the summarization skill is activated.

5.  In the General details step, fill in the fields.

    For information about the inputs for each skill, see [Skill inputs for ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/now-assist-lsd-skill-inputs.md).

    1.  Enter a name and description for the skill.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

6.  Customize the ServiceNow Otto context menu configuration.

    Customize the context menu configuration to control which options should appear and how they are displayed in the AI summarization.

    **Note:** Selecting the Enable Extended Tables check box applies the ServiceNow Otto context menu configuration to all the extended tables of the legal request and legal matter.

    For more information about the context menu summarization, see [ServiceNow Otto context menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-write-overview.md).

7.  View the input data for each skill, such as the base input fields and related lists for the different input templates \(New, Work in progress, or Closed states\).

    Each skill relies on a base input table and input fields with descriptions to provide context for the AI to generate a response.

    Select only those related tables that are offered as the base system, as part of the input data.

    1.  For each input template state \(New, Work in progress, or Closed\), select **+Add additional input field** and configure the base input table fields.

        Add multiple base input fields, as necessary.

        \[Omitted image "lsd-na-skill-input-customize.png"\] Alt text: View of all the input tables and fields that are used to define the prompt that determines where to pull the data from

        The following table lists the base input table fields and descriptions, including a relevant example.

<table id="table_c53_vp5_dbc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Base input field

</td><td>

Field in the table whose value this skill uses in its response.

 For example, `Short description`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field description

</td><td>

Description of the base input field value.

 For example, `Short description of legal request, provides quick info about the request.`

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    2.  For each input template state \(New, Work in progress, or Closed\), configure the rule conditions by using the condition builder to filter the data.

        The rule conditions determine when the input template is used. By default, the record state determines the input template that the AI uses.

        You can build the condition out further by selecting **+New condition set** and configuring additional parameters.

        The following table lists the input template states.

        |State|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |New|State is New.|
        |Work in progress|State is Work in Progress.|
        |Closed|State is Closed.|

    3.  For each input template state \(New, Work in progress, or Closed\), select **+New data source** to configure the additional related table and activity stream data, as needed.

        Adding input data sources, like the related tables and activity streams, provide more context to the AI in a related list.

        You can also add the rule conditions to these additional data sources.

        The selection of the related table fields may have a direct impact on the quality of the corresponding prompt header. For example, if a prompt header requires a specific field from the related table, but that field isn’t selected as input, the summary for that prompt header will contain missing information. For example, for a legal request, you see one related table, such as Service level agreement \(SLA\), that includes all the required fields and filtering conditions for the prompt header. The SLA prompt header is preselected to help you understand how the related table, its fields, and the prompt header work together to produce a summary. You can use the SLA as a reference to configure the other related tables to determine which fields to select and which description adds the requirements of their respective prompt headers. Apply any additional conditions to filter the data further.

    4.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

8.  Customize the prompt.

    Review and test the prompt for each input template configuration. You can edit the prompt in AI Skill Kit.

    1.  Select a record in the Test response section, and test the prompt response output format by selecting **Run Test**.

    2.  Edit the prompt in AI Skill Kit.

    3.  After publishing the prompt in the AI Skill kit, return and test the prompt.

    4.  On finalizing the prompt, select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

9.  Define how the skill is available to your users.

    1.  Configure the skill to be always available to users or select conditions that must be met before the skill is available.

        Selecting **Customize skill availability** displays a condition builder to filter the data further.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

10. Enable Legal Practice Area tables to be considered for summarization.

    1.  Select the check box **Enable extended table selection**.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

11. Define who can access the skilland the data.

    1.  Select **Define access** to determine who can access the skill.

        By selecting specific roles, you're controlling who can use it. The roles you choose will also be available in the next step **Select display**.

        Default and Custom Roles:

        -   If custom roles were added before the upgrade, they’ll be updated automatically by a script.
        -   If new roles are created after the upgrade, you’ll need to manually add them in both the **Define Access** and **Select Display**.

            **Note:** In the **Select Display** step, you can only choose roles that were added in the **Define Access** step. If you add a role in **Define Access**, you still need to manually select it in **Select Display** to make it active.

    2.  In the **Role restrictions to skill** section, grant data access to additional roles.

        For more information, see [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md).
