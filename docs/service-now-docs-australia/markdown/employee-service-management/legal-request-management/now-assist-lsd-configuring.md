# Configure ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\)

Configure generative AI skills in ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\) for legal users working in Legal Counsel Center, Core UI, and Employee Center.

## Before you begin

Confirm you have installed Legal Counsel Center \(sn\_lg\_cf\_workspace\) - Version 1.5.1 or a later version.

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Important:** These AI skills are now enabled by default. The skills will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. This change simply activates the skills and does not touch the roles that are needed to use them. The new default behavior works as follows:

-   **New customers**

    When you install an AI product, designated skills are enabled automatically.

-   **Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Zurich Patch 4\)**

    Any previously unconfigured skill is enabled automatically \(the skill was never enabled, then disabled\).

    There is no change to AI skills that are currently enabled and customized.

    Previously configured skills that were enabled, then disabled, remain inactive.


The legal request summarization and legal matter summarization skills are available in the base system with the required configurations. To customize the skill, you must create a copy of the skill that is in the base system before you modify the configuration. Activating a customized skill with the same base input table as the original skill automatically deactivates the original skill. For more information, see [Customize a summarization skill in ServiceNow Otto for Legal Service Delivery \(LSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/now-assist-lsd-customize-skill.md).

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).

The following table lists the features and skills that you can access from the AI Admin Hub console.

</table>## Procedure

1.  Install the Legal Service Delivery - Prime plugin \(sn\_lg\_ai\_prime\).

    -   For information about the plugin dependencies and plugin activation order, see [Application information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/now-assist-lsd-exploring.md).
    -   For information about the installation process, see [Install plugins for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-now-assist-feature-plugins.md).
2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **AI Admin Hub**.

3.  Select **AI Skills** tab.

4.  Navigate to **Employee** &gt; **LSD**.

    1.  Select **Edit** from the options icon \(\[Omitted image "cmpro-na-three-dot-icon.png"\] Alt text: Options icon.\) of the active skill.

    2.  Navigate to **Define access** to determine who can access the skill.

        By selecting specific roles, you're controlling who can use it. The roles you choose will also be available in the next step **Select display**.

        Default and Custom Roles:

        -   If custom roles were added before the upgrade, they’ll be updated automatically by a script.
        -   If new roles are created after the upgrade, you’ll need to manually add them in both the **Define Access** and **Select Display**.

            **Note:** In the **Select Display** step, you can only choose roles that were added in the **Define Access** step. If you add a role in **Define Access**, you still need to manually select it in **Select Display** to make it active.

    3.  In the **Role restrictions to skill** section, grant data access to additional roles.

        For more information, see [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md).
