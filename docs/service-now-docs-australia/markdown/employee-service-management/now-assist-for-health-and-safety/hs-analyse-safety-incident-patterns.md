# Analyzing safety incident patterns

The **Incident patterns** tab of the Health and Safety dashboard provides safety managers with an automated, real-time overview of the recurring patterns across their safety incident data.

The tab is designed to help the safety teams quickly understand where risks are clustering and how serious they are.

## Prerequisites

-   Verify that the Health and Safety Incident Management application is installed. For more information, see [Health and Safety Incident Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-incident-management/hs-incident-mgmt-landing-page.md).
-   Verify that the ServiceNow Otto for Health and Safety \[com.snc.sn\_hs\_gen\_ai\] plugin is installed.
-   Configure the inclusion of incident records that contain sensitive data. For more information, see [Configure the inclusion of sensitive data in incident patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-health-and-safety/hs-configure-sensitive-data-incident-pattern.md).
-   Verify that all the jobs are running. For more information on configuring the interval at which these jobs run, see [Configure the generation of incident patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-health-and-safety/hs-configure-generation-incident-pattern.md).

## Role required
