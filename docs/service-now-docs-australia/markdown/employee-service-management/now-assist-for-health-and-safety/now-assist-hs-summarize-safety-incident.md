# Summarize a safety incident by using ServiceNow Otto for Health and Safety

Generate a summary from the fields that you selected on the safety incident and quickly understand the incident context by using the Health and Safety incident summarization skill in the ServiceNow Otto for Health and Safety application.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

Verify that the Health and Safety incident summarization skill is enabled. For more information, see [Activate a ServiceNow Otto for Health and Safety skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-health-and-safety/now-assist-hs-activate-skill.md).

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.agent or sn\_ohs\_im.manager

## About this task

The Health and Safety incident summarization skill provides the summary of Health and Safety incidents including the details, actions taken, and root cause analysis. The safety agent and safety manager can view a summary to understand the context, refresh the summary, and post the summary to the work notes.

The incident summarization skill is available in Health and Safety Workspace and in the Core UI. When this skill is enabled on an instance, the Now Assist icon \(\[Omitted image "na-hs-panel-icon.png"\] Alt text: now assist icon\) appears in the workspace.

-   In Health and Safety Workspace, use the Health and Safety incident summary by Now Assist component to generate a summary. This component appears above the activity stream.

    **Note:** You can also generate a summary on demand from the ServiceNow Otto panel. For more information, see [Standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-standard.md).

-   In the Core UI, select the **Summarize** button on the incident record to generate a summary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace** and open a safety incident.

2.  Select **Activity** to open the activity stream.

3.  In the Health and Safety incident summary by Health and Safety component, select **Summarize**.

    **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

If you think that the summary wasn’t helpful, select the not helpful icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-not-helpful.png"\] Alt text: Not helpful icon.\).This feedback improves the generative AI model and can help to improve the future versions of this skill. The system gathers the feedback on each generated summary and stores it in the generative AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).
