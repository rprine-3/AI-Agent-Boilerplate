# Create actions for safety incidents agentic workflow

Use the **Create actions for safety incidents** agentic workflow to suggest actions automatically for a specific incident and create actions in the Health and Safety workspace.

To access the agentic workflow:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Overview**.
2.  Select **Create actions for safety incidents**.

Safety agents and managers with the \[now\_assist\_panel\_user\] role can view the ServiceNow Otto panel. This panel can automatically trigger responses and create actions once an incident is opened. Once the actions are suggested by agentic AI, the safety agents and managers can enter the preferred action number or description. Entering the action number automatically creates that specific action record in the health and safety action-related item in an open incident record.

For more information on the ServiceNow Otto panel, see [ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-overview.md).
