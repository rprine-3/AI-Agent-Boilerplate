## Non-disclosure agreement contract request - Workflow

When a requester submits a legal request, an NDA contract document is created using a standard contract template based on the information from the request. The information from the request is inserted at the appropriate places in the template.

If needed, requesters can request specific changes in the generated NDA contract document. The legal department can manage and process these requested changes to make necessary revisions to the NDA contract document from a centralized location.

If the generated NDA document doesn’t require any changes, the requester can send it to the signatories for an electronic or manual signature. After all signatories have signed the contract document, it’s stored in the ServiceNow instance or an external storage system. The requester and legal department members can access the signed contract document from the Legal Contracts repository.

## Workflow for a non-disclosure agreement contract request

A sample workflow for a non-disclosure agreement contract request might progress as follows:

1.  Setting up the following items in the application:
    -   Multiple variations of NDA templates
    -   Template selection rule to choose the correct template based on the legal request
    -   Internal signatories for different templates
    -   E-signature integration - Adobe Acrobat Sign or Docusign
2.  Employee fills out the NDA intake request form.
3.  Employee previews the generated contract with metadata and sends it to the signatories.
4.  All signatories submit the required signatures.
5.  The signed contract is attached to the legal request record.
6.  A contract repository record is created with the metadata and signed contract.
7.  \(Optional\) The signed contract is moved to the configured storage and referenced in the contract repository section.
