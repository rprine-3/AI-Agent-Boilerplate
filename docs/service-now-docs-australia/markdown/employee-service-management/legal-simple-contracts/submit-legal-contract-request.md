4.  Select **Submit**.

    -   A legal request for generating a contract document for non-disclosure agreement is created in the New state.
    -   A contract document in the Document Ready status is generated with data from the request using a contract template based on the contract template rules. Internal signatories based on the template are also populated in the generated document. For more information, see [Configure a rule for selecting a legal contract template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-simple-contracts/configure-legal-contract-template-rules.md).

        **Note:**

        -   If more signatories have been added in the request than are needed for the contract as defined in the contract template, only the default number of signatories are necessary for signing the contract. Other signatories are marked as Not Considered.
        -   If fewer signatories are included in the request than are required for the contract, you can add more signatories.
        In either case, you can submit a change request to update the number of signatories as required for your contract.

    -   A record for each external signatory is created in the Signer \[sn\_lg\_contracts\_signer\] table.
