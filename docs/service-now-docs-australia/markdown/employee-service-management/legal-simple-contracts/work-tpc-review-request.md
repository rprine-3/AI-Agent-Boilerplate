You can also access the legal contract repository record from the **Legal Contracts** tab.
    -   In the **Signatories** tab, the status of all signatories updates to Signed.
    -   If any signatory declines to sign the contract document, the document status updates to Contract Declined.If more changes are required in the contract document, update it and resend it to the signatories for signature.
3.  If the contract is signed by all parties, you can [close the request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/close-legal-request.md) by clicking **Close Complete.**
