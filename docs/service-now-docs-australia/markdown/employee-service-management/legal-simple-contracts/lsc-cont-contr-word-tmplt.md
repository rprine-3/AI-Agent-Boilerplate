# Add content controls in a Microsoft Word document

As a legal contract configurator, prepare a Microsoft Word document that you want to import as a contract template by marking the content with content controls so it can be efficiently parsed and reused.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you are on a Windows system to add content controls in a Microsoft Word document.

Role required: sn\_lg\_contracts.contracts\_config

## Procedure

1.  In Microsoft Word, open the document that you want to import as a contract template.

2.  Display the **Developer** tab in Microsoft Word.

    For more information, see the [Show the Developer tab](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45) topic in the Microsoft Office 365 documentation.

3.  Select the content to be tagged.

4.  Select **Plain Text Content Control** from the **Developer** tab.

5.  Select the **Properties** option from the **Developer** tab.

6.  In the **Content Control Properties** dialog box, enter a title for the content control.

7.  Enter a tag value.

    **Note:**

    -   The tag names are not case sensitive. If there are two tag names as field\_COMPANY and field\_company, both will be treated same.
    -   The maximum character limit for the tag is 200.
    Tag names contain a prefix with the content control type.

    |Content control type|Description|
    |--------------------|-----------|
    |field\_|Indicates metadata.|
    |signature\_|Indicates a signature.|
    |sign\_date\_|Indicates the signing date.|

    For example, Microsoft Outlook Add-In for Legal Service Delivery If you are adding a metadata for company name, you would name the tag **field\_company**.
