# Confirm the reported vaccination status for a user

As a Vaccination Status adminor manager, use the Employee Readiness Core Approval Portal toconfirm a user's reported COVID-19 vaccination status.

## Before you begin

Your organization must install both Health and Safety Testing and Vaccination Status to use the Approval Portal.

-   For more information on installing Health and Safety Testing, see [Install Health and Safety Testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-testing/install-health-testing.md).
-   For more information on installing Vaccination Status, see [Install Vaccination Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/install-vaccination-status.md).

Activate the **sn\_imt\_vaccine.allow\_managers\_ability\_to\_update\_vaccine\_response\_records** property to enable all managers to confirm the reported vaccination status of their direct reports. This property assigns the sn\_imt\_core.approval\_portal\_manager role to managers and grants access to the Approval Portal for vaccine responses.

Role required: sn\_imt\_vaccine.admin, sn\_imt\_core.approval\_portal\_manager, or sn\_imt\_core.health\_and\_safety\_approver

## About this task

In the Approval Portal, you can review the results of user-reported vaccinations and approve or reject the responses. Approvals can be based on a user's proof of vaccination, such as their attachments submitted with their vaccine response. If the **Reset Covid 19 Vaccine Complete to false if Vaccine Review Outcome is Rejected** property is enabled, a user's COVID-19 vaccine completed status depends on the responses being approved.

**Note:** Managers can only confirm the vaccine responses only of their direct reports. Vaccine admins and health and safety approvers can confirm the responses of all users.

For more information, see [Set up Vaccination Status properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/config-vaccination-properties.md).

Organizations that want to automatically review vaccine responses must configure Vaccination Status to support the functionality. For more information, see [Automate reviews of vaccine responses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/enable-automated-vaccine-response-reviews.md).
