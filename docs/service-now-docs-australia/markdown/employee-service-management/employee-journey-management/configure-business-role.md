# Configure a business role

Create or modify a business role based on job function, geography, and so on.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_businessroles.writer 

## About this task

Modeled after the organizational hierarchy for applications access, business roles enable you to provision applications to your employees. Depending on their job function, employees need different applications to perform their work. For example, the applications that a product designer requires differs from that of a software engineer. Each business role is mapped to one or more groups, and you can create default business roles and parent-child hierarchies to provision applications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Business Roles** &gt; **Business Roles**.

2.  Click **New** or open a record.

3.  Fill in the fields on the form.

<table id="table_d3b_cpj_2jb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the business role.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent business role

</td><td>

Other business roles of which this business role is a member. If the business role has a parent, then the child inherits all the applications that are provisioned to the parent.For example, say you have a parent business role called All Employees that provisions applications A and B, and a child business role called Marketing that provisions applications C, D, and E. When a new hire is assigned the Marketing business role, that user is provisioned applications A through E.

Description of the business role.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default

</td><td>

Option to set this record as a default business rule. If selected, the business role is automatically assigned to all new hires that meet the audience criteria for that record.For example, a default business role called Active Users can be used to provision basic applications that users across your entire organization require.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Audience

</td><td>

Defines the conditions or criteria that the new hire must meet for the hiring manager to be able to assign the business role on their behalf.For example, you can use audience records so that one business role is only available for on-site workers and another business role is only available for remote workers.

 For details on how to configure an audience record, see [Audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/ecpro-audience.md).
