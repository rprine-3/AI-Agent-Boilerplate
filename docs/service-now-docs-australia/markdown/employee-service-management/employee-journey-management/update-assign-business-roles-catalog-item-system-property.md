# Update the assign\_business\_roles\_catalog system property

The **assign\_business\_roles\_catalog** system property enables you to assign business roles to users through a catalog item as part of a lifecycle event, and is included with the Lifecycle Events for Enterprise \[com.sn\_hr\_lifecycle\_ent\] plugin. If you are using a custom catalog item with your lifecycle event, you must update the system property with the sys id of that item.

## Before you begin

Copy the sys id of the catalog item that you want to use to assign business roles as part of a lifecycle event.

Role required: sn\_hr\_le\_ent.admin

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    The System Properties list is displayed.

2.  Open the **sn\_hr\_le\_ent.assign\_business\_roles\_catalog** record.

3.  In the **Value** field, add the sys id of the catalog item that will be used to assign business roles as part of a lifecycle event.

    **Note:** The default value is the sys id of the **Assign business roles to new hire** catalog item that is included as part of the demo data for the lifecycle event for new hire onboarding.
