# Okta integration for new hire onboarding

Automatically provision relevant applications for new hires as part of the onboarding process with the Okta integration. This integration requires the Okta spoke v1.1.1 in IntegrationHub, and is configured to work with the lifecycle event for new hire onboarding that is included as demo data with the Human Resources Scoped App: Lifecycle Events for Enterprise \[com.sn\_hr\_lifecycle\_ent\] plugin.

## Setting up the Okta integration

To set up the Okta integration for new hire onboarding, you must first set up the Okta spoke v1.1.1, next fetch the Okta groups into your instance, and last configure the relevant business roles. For details on how to set up the integration, see [Set up the Okta integration for new hire onboarding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-journey-management/set-up-okta-integration-for-new-hire-onboarding.md).

## Using the Okta integration with new hire onboarding

Once the integration is set up, you can use it with new hire onboarding. The following components are included in the demo data for your use and example.

**Note:** The lifecycle event for new hire onboarding is included as demo data with the Lifecycle Events for Enterprise \[com.sn\_hr\_lifecycle\_ent\] plugin.

|Component|Name|
|---------|----|
|Lifecycle event activity|Account and Application Access \(in the Day One activity set\)|
|HR task template|Groups Assignment for New Hires|
|Catalog item|Assign business roles to new hire|

## How the application provisioning works

The application provisioning process works as follows. When an onboarding case is created, the hiring manager receives a task to assign business roles for the new hire. Once assigned, IT then receives a request to supervise the provisioning of those applications. When the provisioning is complete, the new hire should see their applications in the Okta service.

**Important:** New hires must have a user record in the Okta system in order for their applications to be provisioned to them.
