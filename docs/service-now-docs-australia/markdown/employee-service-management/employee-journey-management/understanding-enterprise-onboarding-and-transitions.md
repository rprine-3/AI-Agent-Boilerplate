</table>## Configuring Lifecyle events for enterprise

Depending on your role, you can access and configure the following:

-   **Lifecycle event administrator**

    Users with the lifecycle event administrator \[sn\_hr\_le.admin\] role can administer and configure any part of the application, including any lifecycle event and its associated activity sets and activities. For more information, see [Building a lifecycle event](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/lifecycle-events/hr-lifecycle-event-configuration.md).

-   **Activity set manager**

    Users with the activity set manager \[sn\_hr\_le.activity\_set\_manager\] role can build any lifecycle event and the associated activity sets. You can configure any lifecycle event activity, so long as you are a member of the owning group that owns the activity. For example, if you are a member of the HR owning group, then you can configure any activity that is owned by the HR group, such as an employee task to watch an onboarding video or a fulfiller task to provide relocation assistance.

    -   [Configure a lifecycle event](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/lifecycle-events/configure-hr-lifecycle-event-type.md) and the associated activity sets

-   **Activity writer**

    Users with the activity writer \[sn\_hr\_le.activity\_writer\] role can configure any lifecycle event activity, so long as you are a member of the owning group that owns the activity. For example, if you are a member of the IT owning group, then you can configure any activity that is owned by the IT group, such as to set up an active directory account or to set up equipment for a new employee. For more information, see [Configure a lifecycle event activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/lifecycle-events/configure-hr-lifecycle-event-activity.md) if you are a member of the associated owning group.

-   **Activity reader**

    Users with the activity reader \[sn\_hr\_le.activity\_reader\] role can read any lifecycle event and its associated activity sets and activities.

Once the Lifecyle events for enterprise application is configured, users with the following roles can write and read lifecycle event cases.

**Note:** A lifecycle event case is an HR case that is fulfilled by a lifecycle event.

-   **Lifecycle event case writer**

    Users with the lifecycle event case writer \[sn\_hr\_le.case\_writer\] role can create, manage, and monitor the status of any lifecycle event case.
