# Generate a fulfillment plan

Auto-generate a fulfillment/execution plan for a case. Accelerate the resolution process by providing planning support to HR agents.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer, now\_assist\_panel\_user

You can generate a case fulfillment plan from either Core UI or Agent Workspace for HR Case Management.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **HR Agent Workspace**.

    Alternatively, you can navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Case Management** &gt; **All HR Cases**.

2.  Open an HR case that is assigned to you.

3.  Select **Generate plan**.

    **Note:** This option appears only for the HR service of Fulfillment type: **Manual**. It does not appear for the Employee Relations and Life Cycle Events cases.

    The AI agent creates a fulfillment plan for a given HR case by fetching HR case details, employee details such as location and designation, relevant KB articles, and case fulfillment instructions, and resolution notes of similar past cases.

4.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   Type **Accept** to publish the AI-generated fulfillment plan to the work notes of the case.
    -   Type **Edit** to interactively revise the AI-generated fulfillment plan through a conversational interface.
    -   Type **Dismiss** to discard the AI-generated fulfillment plan.
