# Summarize a Sidebar discussion by using ServiceNow Otto for HRSD

Generate a summary of the Sidebar discussions between agents, requesters, and subject matter experts by using the chat summarization skill in the ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) application.

## Before you begin

[Configure ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/configure-now-assist-hr.md).

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer

## About this task

You can do these actions by using Sidebar discussion summarization:

-   Summarize the Sidebar discussion at any point during the discussion using the `/Summarize` quick action.
-   Share the Sidebar discussion to the work notes.
-   Provide feedback for the summary.

**Note:** The Sidebar discussion summarization skill can be found in the **HRSD** tab under the **Employee** group in AI Admin Hub.

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

You can make a copy of this skill to configure it to meet your business needs. For more information, see [Make a copy of AI skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/make-a-copy-of-a-now-assist-skill.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Agent Workspace for HRSD** and open an HR case that supports Sidebar discussion and summarization.

2.  Choose an existing discussion, or start a new discussion.

    Start a new discussion by doing these actions:

    1.  Select **Discuss**.

    2.  In the Start a Sidebar discussion modal, add participants.

    3.  Select **Start Discussion**.

3.  Generate a summary of the Sidebar discussion during the conversation either by using the Summarize quick action \(enter `/Summarize` in the Active sidebar discussion window\), or by selecting the quick action icon \[Omitted image "now-assist-sidebar-lightning-bolt-icon.png"\] Alt text: Quick action icon..

4.  After summarizing the Sidebar discussion, you can add it to the case work notes, and provide feedback about it.
