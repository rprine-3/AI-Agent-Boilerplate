</table>**Important:** All agentic workflow and AI agent records are read-only by default.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first duplicate the agentic workflow, and then do the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn't necessary.

For more information about duplicating an agentic workflow, implementing access control lists and activating the required components, see the following topics:
