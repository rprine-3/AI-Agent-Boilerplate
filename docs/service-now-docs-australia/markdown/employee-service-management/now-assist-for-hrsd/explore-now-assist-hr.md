# Exploring ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)

With the ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) application, your agents can summarize the customer chat conversations and case details to get the context of the case, generate the case resolution notes, and wrap up cases faster.

## ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) Overview

The following generative AI capabilities are available for an agent:

-   A case summary provides an agent with a concise summary of a case. It ​enables an agent to get the context by gathering information about an issue and taking actions more quickly​. It ​also enables an agent to refresh and post the summary to the work notes.
-   The case resolution notes can help an agent to wrap up cases faster and provide the context about the case resolution to the other agents who might encounter similar cases.
-   An interaction chat history provides the context about the chat conversation between the agents and requesters at different points of the handoff, such as when the Virtual Agent conversation chat history is handed off to a live agent.

The following generative AI capabilities are available for employees or administrators:

-   Get direct and actionable responses on customer-specific content by using generative AI in search.

## ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) Skills

The ServiceNow Otto for HRSD application includes the generative AI skills and features that enable your agents to understand the chat and case context so that they can propose resolutions to the requester more quickly.

-   **Chat summarization**

    Provides an agent with a chat summary of all points of the handoff, including the Virtual Agent conversation and the live agent conversation:

    -   Quick action summary: Provides a concise summary of the interactions with the quick actions that the agent took.
    -   Virtual Agent handoff summary: Summarizes the chat when Virtual Agent hands off the chat to a live agent​.
    -   Live Agent to Live Agent handoff summary: Summarizes the conversation when a live agent hands off a chat to another live agent and displays the summary in the Active Chat window. An agent can view a summary of the actions that were taken by a customer before hand off to another live agent.
    -   Chat wrap up summary: Accelerates the wrap-up time by populating the full chat summary when a conversation ends.
    -   Chat wrap up short description: Accelerates the wrap-up time by populating the short description that summarizes the requester issues when the conversation ends​.
    For information on activating the chat summarization skill, see [Configure chat summarization and chat reply recommendation skills in the AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-chat-summarization-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). For information on how to use the skill on Agent Workspace for HR Case Management, see [Summarize a chat conversation using ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/now-assist-hrsd-chat.md).

    -   1: The agent accepts the chat with the requester and gets any additional details.
    -   2: The agent provides the details and ends the conversation.
    -   3: The chat summarization skill automatically updates the short description in the **Short description** field.
    -   4: The chat summarization skill automatically updates the chat summary in the **Chat Summary** field.
-   **Case summarization**

    Provides an agent with a concise summary of a case, including the issue, actions that were taken, SLA, attachment summary and resolution information, depending on the state of the case. An agent can view a case summary to understand the case context, refresh the summary, and post the summary to the case work notes.

    For information on activating the case summarization skill, see [Configure case or incident summarization in the AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-case-or-incident-summarization-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). For information on how to use the skill on Agent Workspace for HR Case Management or Core UI, see [Summarize an HR case using ServiceNow Otto for HRSD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/now-assist-hrsd-summarize-case.md).

-   **Resolution notes generation**

    Automatically generates the resolution notes for an agent when the state of a case is changed to Closed Complete. An agent can accept the AI-generated notes or edit the notes before saving it to the case.

    For information on activating the resolution notes skill, see [Configure ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/configure-now-assist-hr.md). For information on how to use the skill on Agent Workspace for HR Case Management, see [Generate resolution notes using ServiceNow Otto for HRSD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/now-assist-hrsd-res-note.md).

-   **Knowledge generation**

    Enables an agent to generate a knowledge article from a case after proposing a resolution or closing the case.

    The knowledge generation skill displays a pop-up window that an agent can use to generate a knowledge article and review it before publishing the knowledge article draft.


## Redirection for sensitive topics

Certain subjects, such as workplace safety or employee compensation, might not be suited for generative AI conversations. ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\) includes out-of-the-box filters to detect sensitive topics.

The admin activates the filters or creates custom filters to enable the Virtual agent to detect if these kinds of subjects are included in the conversation and offer the following redirection options:

-   **Live agent**

    The employee is redirected to the relevant chat queue to connect with a live agent.

-   **Case**

    The employee can open a case, which is assigned to the respective HR service.

-   **Proceed, this is not sensitive**

    In situations where the LLM incorrectly identifies a phrase as a sensitive topic, employees can opt to continue the interaction with the Virtual Agent.


For more information on the out-of-the-box filters and how they are mapped to chat queues and HR case services, see [Sensitivity detection filters mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/reference-sd-info-values.md).

For information on setting up sensitivity detection, see [Configure sensitivity detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/config-na-sd-filters.md).

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis helps agents prioritize cases based on a sentiment score ranging from -5 to +5 to represent extremely negative to extremely positive. It is available in both the HR Agent workspace and core UI views.

For more information on using sentiment analysis in HR Service Delivery, see [Analyze sentiments in ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/analyze-sentiments-now-assist.md).
