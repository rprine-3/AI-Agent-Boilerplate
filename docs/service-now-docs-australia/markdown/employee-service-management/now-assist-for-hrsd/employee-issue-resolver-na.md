## Executing a test scenario

You can run this workflow on the Testing page of AI Agent Studio with the following utterance in the Task field:

"Resolve HRC000XXX"

The AI agent decision log displays the AI agents that are working to resolve the case, and you can watch their interactions, decisions, and thought processes as they happen in real time.

**Note:** The AI agent decision log is available in the **Testing** section in AI Agent Studio and is intended for testing purposes only.

.\[Omitted image "resolve-nc-workflow.png"\] Alt text: Testing input for the agentic workflow.\[Omitted image "resolve-noncritical-workflow.png"\] Alt text: Testing output for the agentic workflow.

The AI agent assesses each HR case to determine its criticality.

-   For non-critical cases, it retrieves and recommends relevant articles, then notifies the employee via ServiceNow Otto Virtual Agent or email. Employee can review the recommendations, provide feedback, or close the case.
-   For critical cases, Human agents intervention is requested.
