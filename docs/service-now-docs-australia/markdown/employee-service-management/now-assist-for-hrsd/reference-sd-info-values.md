# Sensitivity detection filters mapping

The `sys_gen_ai_filter` table includes eight out-of-the-box filters that determines which topics are regarded as sensitive. Each filter is mapped to an HR service that is used to create a case and a chat queue.

The filter to service and queue mapping is set by the `getFilterMetaData` function in the `SensitivityDetectionVAUtilSNC` script.

To modify the HR service used to create a case, update the HR service sysid that is associated to the filter in the `filterMap` object of the function.

To modify the live agent chat queue, update the text that is associated to the `queueType` object. The value is used to set the `liveagent_esc_pre_chat_category.`

Modify the condition that is associated with your `awa_queue`record so that you can check the value in this field.

|Filter|HR Service|Queue|
|------|----------|-----|
|Compensation and Career Advancement|Request accommodation|Employee relations|
|Employee Health Concerns|Request accommodation|Employee relations|
