# Customize the ServiceNow Otto for HRSD skills

Customize a generative AI skill so you can experiment with skill settings and configure the skill to fit your business needs.

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

The skills that come with the ServiceNow Otto applications have defaults configurations that are optimized to serve the most common use cases. The base system skills can be tailored to meet specific business requirements. Customization ensures that skills align with your organization's workflows, data sources, and user roles. There are two main ways to customize:

-   Using ServiceNow Otto Admin console: Modify base system skills, input configurations, and display settings. Make a copy of the skill as you cannot directly modify the base system skill. For more information, see [Make a copy of AI skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/make-a-copy-of-a-now-assist-skill.md).
-   Using AI Skill Kit: Build and publish custom skills for advanced use cases by customizing inputs and prompts, and then publish it. You can also use the AI Skill Kit to clone base system skills, as long as they are the latest versions created after the release of the AI Skill Kit. For more information, see [Using AI Skill Kit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/using-now-assist-skill-kit.md).

Unified Admin Experience for GenAI Skills:

-   Previously, skills cloned in AI Admin Hub console supported only prompt configuration in AI Skill Kit. Input configuration could not be edited in AI Skill Kit, creating a fragmented setup process. With the new unified admin experience, users can manage GenAI skills seamlessly in AI Skill Kit. This includes adding necessary headers as input, configuring or editing prompts, and maintaining all settings in a single location.
-   The unification migrates the AI Admin Hub console setup experience to AI Skill Kit for all configured skills in ServiceNow Otto for HRSD.
