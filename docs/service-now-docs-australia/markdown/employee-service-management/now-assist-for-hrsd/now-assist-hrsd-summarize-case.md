# Summarize an HR case using ServiceNow Otto for HRSD

Quickly understand the case context and respond to inquiries by using the case summarization skill.

## Before you begin

## About this task

You can use the case summarization skill in either Core UI or Agent Workspace for HR Case Management.

-   In Core UI, the summary appears in a banner in the case record.
-   In Agent Workspace for HR Case Management, the summary is generated in the **Details** tab.

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

You can make a copy of this skill to configure it to meet your business needs. For more information, see [Make a copy of AI skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/make-a-copy-of-a-now-assist-skill.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Agent Workspace for HRSD**.

2.  In Workspace, open an HR case that is assigned to you.

4.  Review the summary details.\[Omitted image "case-summarization2.png"\] Alt text: Case summary that is shown in Workspace. It lists the issue and actions taken.

    A concise summary of a case, including the issue, actions taken, SLA, attachments, and resolution information appears. The information that is displayed is based on the state of the case:

    -   Draft or Ready: Issue
    -   Work in progress: Issue and Actions taken
    -   Awaiting acceptance, Awaiting approval, Closed complete, or Closed incomplete: Issue, Actions taken, and Resolution
    -   Canceled or Suspended: Summary isn’t visible
5.  When you finish summarizing a case, you can add it to the work notes, expand or collapse it, provide feedback, copy it, or view information about it.
