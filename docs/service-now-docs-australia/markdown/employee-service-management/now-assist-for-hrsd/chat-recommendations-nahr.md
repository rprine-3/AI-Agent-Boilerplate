# Generate a chat reply recommendation by using ServiceNow Otto for HRSD

Generate a reply based on the context of the chat conversation using ServiceNow Otto icon. Chat reply recommendations can help provide agents with quick replies to common questions.

## Before you begin

[Configure ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/configure-now-assist-hr.md).

Role required: sn\_hr\_gen\_ai.admin

## About this task

You can do these actions by using the ServiceNow Otto icon:

-   Generate a recommended reply that is based on the context of the conversation.
-   Refine the recommendation by elaborating or shortening the response.

**Note:** The Chat reply recommendation skill can be found in the **HRSD** tab under the **Employee** group in AI Admin Hub. To learn how to activate this skill, see [Configure ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/configure-now-assist-hr.md).

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Agent Workspace for HRSD**.

2.  Open the inbox and accept the chat interaction.

    In the Active Chat section of the interaction, a summary of the Virtual Agent conversation is generated. The summary includes the actions that were taken before the requester engaged with the live agent. With this information, you can get an overview of what the requester has already mentioned in the Virtual Agent conversation and troubleshoot the issue.

3.  Chat with the requester to get any additional details about their question or issue, if needed.

    For example, if the requester is having an issue with hardware, you may need the hardware model number and serial number.

4.  In the chat message window, either type a response, or leave blank, and then select the ServiceNow Otto icon \[Omitted image "icon-ai-sparkle.png"\] Alt text: Sparkle icon for Now Assist.
