# Configure Gen AI Virtual Agent for HRSD

Enable your requesters to have a streamlined, conversational experience that is based on generative AI as they submit a catalog item request in Virtual Agent. By offering this generative AI experience, your organization can increase self-service and reduce operating costs.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

## About this task

The generative AI capabilities can provide a human-like, efficient catalog request experience over the Virtual Agent conversational interface. By using the generative AI capabilities with Virtual Agent, your organization can reduce the turnaround time for the request submission.

When the generative AI experience is configured for catalog item request submissions, the following experience is available for a requester:

-   Contextual question prompts that enable a more human-like conversation based on answers to previous questions.
-   Slot filling that recognizes answers to one or more questions on the requester's input. For example, inquiring about HR benefits or requesting leave of absence.
-   Ability to answer catalog item questions.
-   Ability to exit the request submission process at any point.
-   Although the following catalog item question types are supported in the conversation mode, natural language responses aren't supported:
    -   Reference
    -   Lookup select box
    -   Lookup multiple choice
    -   Requested For
    -   Attachment
    -   Multiple choice question with more than 10 choices

## Procedure

1.  Turn on the required Virtual Agent Skills: **Multi-Assist Multi-turn Catalog Ordering** and/or **Now-Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results**.
