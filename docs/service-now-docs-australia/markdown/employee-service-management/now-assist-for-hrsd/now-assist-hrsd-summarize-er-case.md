# Summarize an ER case using ServiceNow Otto for HRSD

Use the ER case summarization skill to obtain a comprehensive overview of the ER case, which includes key details such as allegations, evidences, and interviews.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_er.case\_writer

## About this task

You can use the ER case summarization skill in either Core UI or Agent Workspace for HR Case Management.

-   In Core UI, the summary appears in a banner in the case record.
-   In Agent Workspace for HR Case Management, the summary is generated in the **Details** tab.

**Note:** For information on how to configure the case summarization skill, see [Configure ServiceNow Otto for HR Service Delivery \(HRSD\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/now-assist-for-hrsd/configure-now-assist-hr.md).

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **HR Agent Workspace**.

2.  In Workspace, open an ER case that is assigned to you.

    Alternatively, you can navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Cases** and select an ER case.

3.  Select **Summarize**.

4.  **Note:** Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds.

5.  Review the summary details.

    A summary of a case is displayed. The summary varies based on the state of the case:

    -   In **Ready** state: Case Information, Case Overview, Involved Parties, Allegations, and Key Dates are displayed.
    -   In **Work in progress** or **Closed complete** state: Case Information, Case Overview, Involved Parties, Allegations, Interviews Summary, Evidence Summary, Allegation Outcomes, Corrective Actions, and Key Dates are displayed.

        **Note:** Attachment related details are added to the summary only when an attachment is present on ER case irrespective of case state.
