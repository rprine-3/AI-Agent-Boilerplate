# Configure a safety risk matrix

Configure a safety risk matrix to define levels of risk using likelihood vs severity and to define risk tolerances.​ You can review and modify the risk matrixes available with the application or add new ones for your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_data\_manager

## About this task

This video shows an example of how to set up a 3x3 risk matrix and explains its application in assessing risk levels during a risk assessment.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Risk matrix configuration video. Approximately one minutes thirty four seconds long.

The pre-defined risk matrixes can be used by safety team members to create and conduct risk assessments in the Health and Safety Workspace. The selected matrix is used by the risk assessment to evaluate the level of risk. For more information, see [Conduct a safety risk assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-conduct-risk-assessment.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the configuration icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-config.png"\] Alt text: Configuration icon\).

3.  In the **Configuration** tab, select **Risk matrices** and then **All**.

4.  Create a risk matrix or modify an existing one.

    -   To create a risk matrix, select **New**.
    -   To review an existing risk matrix, open the one that you want to configure. However, if a risk matrix is already used in a risk assessment, it can't be changed.
5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    1.  Describe your risk matrix and choose what kind of grid to use.

    2.  Define your custom likelihood and severity descriptions.

    3.  Configure your risk tolerance levels.​

    For more information about field descriptions, see [Risk matrix form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-risk-matrix-form.md).

6.  In the **Risk matrix preview** section, preview a visual representation of the configured risk matrix.

    The heatmap shows the defined levels, colors, and ranges for the risk matrix in the real time.​

7.  Select **Save**.


## Result

-   The risk matrix is listed in the **Risk matrices** list under **Configuration** and is saved in the Risk matrix \[sn\_hs\_rm\_risk\_matrix\] table.
-   The matrix is available for selection on the Risk assessment form when conducting a risk assessment.
