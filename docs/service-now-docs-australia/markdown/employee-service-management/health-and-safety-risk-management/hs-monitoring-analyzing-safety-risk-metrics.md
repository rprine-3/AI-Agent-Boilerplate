# Monitoring and analyzing safety risk metrics

The **Risk Management** tab of the Health and Safety dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive view for monitoring and analyzing safety risk metrics. By providing real-time insights into inspections, job safety analyses \(JSAs\), and various hazard and risk categories, it enables you to proactively identify trends, respond swiftly to emerging issues, and continuously enhance workplace safety across all organizational levels.

For any selected period and location, you can drill down into detailed data for granular visibility for risk mitigation strategies.
