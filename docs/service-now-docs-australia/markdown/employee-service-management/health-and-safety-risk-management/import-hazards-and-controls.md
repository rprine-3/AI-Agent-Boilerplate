# Create a risk analysis for a safety risk assessment from a job

Create a risk analysis by importing hazards and controls from a predefined job in the job register to a risk assessment.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_assessment\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_assessment\_writer

## About this task

You can conduct a risk assessment for the jobs in your organization to identify associated hazards and assign a risk rating to each job hazard. For information on predefined jobs, see [Jobs in the job register](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-define-job-register.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  Select the **Risk assessment** list and then **All**.

4.  Open the risk assessment to create the risk analysis for.

5.  Select **Create risk analyses**.

6.  In the **Select jobs** field, select the job to import hazards and controls from.

7.  Select **Create**.

    A risk analysis record is created for each job step in the selected job. For a job with no steps, only one risk analysis record is created.

8.  In the **Hazard assessments** tab of each risk analysis, review the imported hazards and their controls to assess their risk levels.

    For more information on how the risk level for a hazard is evaluated, see [Assess safety hazards and risk levels for a risk analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/add-a-risk-and-its-controls-for-a-safety-risk-assessment.md).


## Result

-   All hazards and controls from the selected job are imported in the risk assessment.
-   A risk analysis record is created for each job step in the selected job. These risk analysis records appear in the **Risk analyses** list under the Risk analyses tab of the assessment.
-   The imported hazards and their controls are listed in the **Hazard assessments** tab of risk analysis records.
