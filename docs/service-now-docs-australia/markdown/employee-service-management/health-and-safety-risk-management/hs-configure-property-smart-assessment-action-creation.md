# Configure creating actions from smart assessment questionnaire

You can configure the property that enables you to create actions for the smart assessment questionnaire. This action creation can be enabled for one or more questions as needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_manager or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety administration** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  In the property **Smart assessment fields enables for action creation. Please mention the sys\_id of the questions for which we need to have the in-line action enabled**, enter the sys\_id for each question that needs action creation enabled.

    For information on how to access the sys\_id, see [Unique record identifier \(sys\_id\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_UniqueRecordIdentifier.md).

3.  Select **Save**.


## Result

-   The **More actions** icon \(\[Omitted image "agent-workspace-more-ui-actions-icon.jpg"\] Alt text: More icon\) appears for configured questions in a smart assessment questionnaire and when selected, shows the **Actions list** button.
-   In the **Assessment action list** page within a smart assessment, selecting **More actions** again shows the **Create action** button, which enables users to add actions or findings for that question.

    For more information on creating action or findings, see [Create actions or findings for the smart assessment questionnaire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-create-actions-findings-smart-assessments.md).
