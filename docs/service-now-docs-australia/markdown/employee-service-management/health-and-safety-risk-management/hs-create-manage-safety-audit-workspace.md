    For information on audit field descriptions, see [Audit schedule form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-audit-schedule-form.md).

6.  In the **People involved** tab, add people involved in this audit and their responsibilities.

    For more information, see [Add people involved in a safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-add-people-involved-safety-audit.md).

7.  In the **Objectives** tab, define the audit objectives, the criteria used as benchmarks, and the items to be reviewed for this audit.

    -   For more information, see [Define an objective for a safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-define-safety-audit-objectives.md).
    -   Alternatively, if you have a previous audit with a similar scope, select **Import scope** to pre-populate these sections rather than entering them manually. For more information, see [Import scope from an existing safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-import-scope-existing-safety-audit.md).
8.  In the **Documents** tab, add standards and documents used to benchmark findings.

    -   Select **Add** to add an existing document from Health and Safety document library.
    -   Select **New** to upload a new document. For field descriptions, see [Health and Safety document version form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/hs-document-form.md).
9.  In the **Audit questionnaires** tab, add and assign smart assessments or surveys to be conducted as part of this audit.

    If the audit is part of an audit schedule with an associated audit questionnaire, that questionnaire is automatically added to the audit record. For information on audit questionnaire field descriptions, see [Audit questionnaire form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-audit-survey-form.md).

    -   The assigned user receives a notification to complete the smart assessment or survey.
    -   A smart assessment can be completed in the mobile app. For more information, see [Complete a smart assessment from mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-create-smart-assessment-inspection-audit-mobile-agent.md).
    -   A survey can be completed either through the Employee Center or on the mobile app. For more information, see [Complete a survey from the Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-complete-safety-insp-survey.md).
10. Conduct the audit and gather evidence as part of the audit, for example, document assessments, interviews, and observations.

    1.  In the **Audit questionnaires** tab, review the the smart assessment or survey responses that are submitted by the assigned user.

        When completed, the assessment results are available in the **Audit questionnaire results** tab.

    2.  In the **Findings** tab, record findings for audit's items for review.

        For more information, see [Add a finding for a review item in a safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-add-finding-rca-safety-audit.md).

        **Note:** Safety auditors can also create actions and findings for specific questions while completing a smart assessment in the mobile app. When an agent creates an action for a question, the system also generates a related finding record based on the response. The finding then appears in this tab in the workspace. For more information, see [Create actions and findings for the smart assessment questionnaire from mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-create-actions-findings-smart-assessments.md).

    3.  In the **Risk assessments** tab, select **New** to conduct a risk assessment as part of this audit.

        -   Alternatively, select **Add** to associate an existing risk assessment to the audit record.
        -   For more information, see [Conduct a safety risk assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-conduct-risk-assessment.md).
    4.  In the **Audit actions** tab, create and assign any actions based on findings and recommendations.

        For more information, see [Add an action for a safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-add-action-safety-inspection.md).

        **Note:** Any actions created for specific questions while completing the smart assessment or survey in the Employee Center or mobile app also appear in this tab.

11. If needed, complete the audit surveys directly from the audit record in the workspace.

    1.  Open the assessment to be completed.

        -   For a smart assessment, select **Open audit smart assessment**.

            **Note:** Only a user with the **Assessment reader role** can access and complete this smart assessment. This role is set during the smart assessment template configuration. For more information, see [Configure the smart assessment template for safety inspections and audits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-configure-smart-assessment-template.md).

        -   For an inspection survey, select **Open audit survey**.
    2.  Answer the survey questions and select **Submit**.

    3.  In the **State** field, select Closed Complete to close the audit survey.

12. In the **Overview** tab, review the audit progress and metrics.

13. If necessary, submit the safety audit, findings, actions, or results for approval.

    For more information, see [Submit a safety audit, finding, or action for approval](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-submit-audit-finding-action-approval.md).

15. In the **Details** tab, set the state to Closed Complete after all audit activities and objectives are complete, and then select **Save**.

    The audit moves to the Closed Complete state.
