# Define a category and measurement unit for an exposure type

Define a category and measurement unit for an exposure type. If needed, you can also associate a subcategory with an exposure type category.

## Before you begin

Verify that the application scope is selected as Health and Safety Risk Management. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Tables**.

2.  Create an exposure category or update an existing one.

    1.  Select to open the Exposure type \[sn\_hs\_rm\_exposure\_type\] table.

    2.  In the **Columns** tab, select `Exposure category` from the list.

    3.  In the **Choices** tab, select **New**.

    4.  Fill in the fields.

        The value set in the **Value** field is used to associate a sub-category or a measurement unit with this category.

    5.  Select **Submit**.

3.  Associate a subcategory with an exposure category.

    1.  In the **Columns** tab of the Exposure type \[sn\_hs\_rm\_exposure\_type\] table, select the `Exposure sub-category` from the list.

    2.  In the **Choices** tab, select **New** and fill in the fields.

    3.  In the **Dependent value** field, copy the exposure category's **Value** field defined in step 2d.

        This associates the subcategory with the required category.

    4.  Select **Submit**.

    The subcategory is listed as a choice in the **Sub-category** field for the associated exposure category when creating an exposure type. For more information, see [Define an exposure type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-define-exposure-type.md).

4.  Add a measurement unit for an exposure category.

    1.  Select to open the Measurement \[sn\_hs\_rm\_measurement\] table.

    2.  In the **Columns** tab, select `Measurement unit` from the list.

    3.  In the **Choices** tab, select **New** and fill in the fields.

    4.  In the **Dependent value** field, copy the exposure category's **Value** field defined in step 2d.

        The value in the **Dependent value** field links the measurement unit with the required exposure category.

    5.  Select **Submit**.

    The measurement unit is listed as a choice in the **Measurement unit** field during an exposure assessment for the exposure type.
