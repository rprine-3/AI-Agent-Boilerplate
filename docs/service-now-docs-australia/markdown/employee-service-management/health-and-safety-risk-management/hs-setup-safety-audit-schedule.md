# Set up a safety audit schedule

Create an audit schedule and define the top-level audit details and the recurrence, for example, monthly or bi-monthly.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.audit\_schedule\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  Select **Audit schedules** list and then **All**.

4.  Select **New** to create an audit schedule.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    Define the audit scope, finalize the goals, and choose regulations for the audit so that the audit process is well structured and organized. For more information on audit field descriptions, see [Audit schedule form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-audit-schedule-form.md).

6.  Select **Save**.

    The **Audit questionnaires** and **Scheduled audits** tabs appear for this audit.

7.  In the **Audit questionnaires** tab, select **New** to add smart assessment orsurveys to be added to each scheduled audit.

    -   For information on audit questionnaire field descriptions, see [Audit questionnaire form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-audit-survey-form.md).
    -   Audit surveys can also be added to each scheduled audit individually after they’re scheduled.
8.  To generate the scheduled audit records immediately, select **Create audits**.

    If an audit survey has not been created, a message prompts you to create one before scheduling audits.

    -   Select **Create next scheduled audit** to create the first upcoming audit from the selected start date. Subsequent audit records are automatically created one by one on scheduled dates, based on the defined duration and frequency.
    -   Select **Create all scheduled audits at once** to create all scheduled audits immediately.
    **Note:** If you don’t use the **Create audits** button, the system will automatically create the audit records. They are generated one by one from the start date, based on the duration and selected frequency of the inspection schedule.

9.  In the **Scheduled audits** tab, add details, for example, objectives and people involved and their responsibilities, to each scheduled audit record.

    For information on completing an audit, see, [Create and manage a safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-create-manage-safety-audit-workspace.md).
