# Set up a safety inspection schedule

Set up an inspection schedule to create a safety inspection at a future date, or to schedule recurring safety inspections, such as daily or weekly, or monthly at once.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_manager and sn\_hs\_rm.inspection\_schedule\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  Select the **Inspection schedules** list and then **All**.

4.  Select **New** to create an inspection schedule.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    Enter inspection details and the duration. For more information on inspection field descriptions, see [Inspection schedule form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-inspection-schedule-form.md).

6.  Select **Save**.

    The **Scheduled inspections** tab and the **Create inspections** button appear for this record.

7.  To generate the inspection records immediately, select **Create inspections**.

    -   Select **Create next scheduled inspection** to create the first upcoming inspection from the selected start date. Subsequent inspection records are automatically created one by one on scheduled dates, based on the defined duration and frequency.
    -   Select **Create all scheduled inspection at once** to create all scheduled inspections immediately.
    **Note:** If you don’t use the **Create inspections** button, the system will automatically create the inspection records. They are generated one by one from the start date, based on the duration and selected frequency of the inspection schedule.


## Result

-   All inspection records for an inspection schedule are generated in its **Scheduled inspections** tab. These inspection records are also available under **Inspections** &gt; **All** list.
-   All required fields are copied from the inspection schedule to its inspection records.
-   The assigned user receives a notification to complete the smart assessment or survey for the generated inspections. If the inspection format is digital, the notification includes a direct link to access the assessment or survey.
    -   A smart assessment can be completed in the mobile app. For more information, see [Complete a smart assessment from mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-create-smart-assessment-inspection-audit-mobile-agent.md).
    -   A survey can be completed either in the Employee Center or the mobile app. For more information, see [Complete an inspection survey from the Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-complete-safety-insp-survey.md).

## What to do next

In the **Scheduled inspections** tab, open the completed inspections, review the results, and add findings, RCA, and actions as needed.
