# Assess safety hazards and risk levels for a risk analysis

Review the identified hazards in a risk analysis and choose their control measures to assess how they impact and mitigate the risk.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_assessment\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_assessment\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  Select the **Risk assessment** list and then open the risk assessment.

4.  In the **Risk analyses** tab, open the risk analysis containing the hazard.

5.  In the **Hazard assessments** tab of the risk analysis, review hazards and their controls to assess their risk levels.

    -   To create a new hazard assessment, select **New**.
    -   To review the hazards and controls that are imported from a predefined job, select from the list.

        For more information, see [Create a risk analysis for a safety risk assessment from a job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/import-hazards-and-controls.md).

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    1.  Select a hazard to perform its assessment.​

        If this hazard assessment is for a predefined job in the job register, select the job and the applicable job step. For more information on job register, see [Jobs in job register](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-define-job-register.md).

    2.  Identify what effect this hazard could have, for example, burns.

    3.  Select control measures that could help prevent this hazard.​

        To define and use a control that is not available in the **Available Control Measures** field, select **Create new control**. For more information, see [Define Health and Safety control measures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-define-controls.md).

    4.  In **Inherent severity** and **Inherent likelihood** fields, choose the severity and likelihood of this hazard before controls.

    5.  In **Residual severity** and **Residual likelihood** fields, choose what the severity and likelihood of this hazard is, after those controls have been put in place.

    For information on field descriptions, see [Hazard assessment form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-hazard-assessment-form.md).

7.  Select **Save**.


## Result

-   The risk matrix used in the associated risk assessment evaluates the risk level for the hazard.

    -   The severity and likelihood of the hazard before controls are evaluated to show the hazard's risk level in the **Inherent risk** field on the form.
    -   The severity and likelihood of the hazard after controls are evaluated to show the hazard's risk level in the **Residual risk** field on the form. After controls, the risk level should be reduced.

    For more information on risk level calculation, see [Risk matrix form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-risk-matrix-form.md).

-   The hazard assessment is listed in the **Hazard assessments** tab of the risk analysis.

## What to do next

If a risk analysis includes more than one hazard, perform a hazard assessment for each.
