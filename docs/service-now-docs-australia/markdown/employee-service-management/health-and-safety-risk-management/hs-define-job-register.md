# Define a job in the job register

Define jobs and their steps \(if any\), in the job register to predefine hazards and controls for each job type in your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_data\_manager

## About this task

A job register is a list that safety managers and line managers can use to add jobs, along with their steps, if any, for their organization. Depending on the complexity, a job can be single-step or multi-step.

Each job and job step can have associated hazards and controls. Jobs with predefined hazards and controls for each step enable you to:

-   quickly submit job safety analyses \(JSAs\) and
-   perform risk assessments.

Consequently, these predefined jobs simplify the process of submitting JSAs and conducting risk assessments by automatically populating hazards and controls.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the configuration icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-config.png"\] Alt text: Configuration icon\).

3.  In the **Configuration** tab, select **Job register** and then **All**.

4.  Create a job.

**Using the New button**

</td><td>

To define a job from scratch, select **New** in the list.-   If the job has multiple steps and you want to outline the hazards and controls for each, select **Multi step**.
-   If the job is one step and you want to outline hazards and controls on the job level, select **Single step**.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d771036e150">

**Copying an existing job**

</td><td>

Use details from an existing job to create a new one in the job register. Copying lets you have a quick start to creating a job that is similar in details or is applicable to a new location. To copy a job:1.  In the list, open the job that you want to copy.
2.  Select **Copy job**.
**Note:** The **Location** field value is not copied in the duplicated job.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|

    |Job location|Location that this job or task applies to.|
    |Active|Option for making the job available for use. A job must be active to be used.|

6.  Select **Save**.

7.  If it's a multi-step job, add job steps.

    **Note:** Create a job step for each task involved in the job.

    1.  In the **Job steps** tab, select **New**.

        This tab appears only when **Multi step** is selected when creating the job.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    3.  In the **Order** field, select the order in which the job step appears.

        The value in this field determines the sequence in which job steps appear when submitting a JSA from the Employee Center.

    4.  Select **Save**.

8.  Associate hazards and controls with the job.
