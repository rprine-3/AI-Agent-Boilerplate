# Configure the smart assessment template for safety inspections and audits

You can create smart assessment templates and add instructions, questions, and reference information by using the template designer in the Smart Assessment Engine application.

## Before you begin

-   Smart assessments are built using the ServiceNow® Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) application. Familiarize yourself with the [Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-asmnt-engine-landing-page.md).
-   Verify that the application scope is selected as Health and Safety Risk Management. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_manager

## About this task

You can also convert your existing Survey templates related to Health and Safety into Smart Assessment templates using the Smart Assessment Engine migration tool. For more information, see [Creating an assessment template from legacy assessment metric types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/sae-asmnt-template-migrating.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the **Workspaces** tab and then select the **Assessment workspace**.

3.  In the **Purpose** field on the **Smart assessment template** form, select **Health and Safety**.

    You can also configure a category role for a specific purpose. For more information, see [Create an assessment template category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/sae-asmnt-template-category-create.md).

4.  In the **Assessment target** field, select the target table where this smart assessment is needed.

    -   For smart assessment for inspections, select the Inspection \[sn\_hs\_rm\_inspection\] table
    -   For smart assessment for audits, select the Audit survey \[sn\_hs\_rm\_audit\_survey\] table.
5.  Select **Create**.
