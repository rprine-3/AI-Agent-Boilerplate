# Add an action for a safety inspection or audit

Add an action for each finding to address any issues or implement measures necessary to improve workplace safety. You can add multiple actions for an inspection or audit finding.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   For safety inspections: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_manager, sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_writer, or sn\_ohs\_im.action\_writer
-   For safety audits: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_manager, sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_writer, or sn\_ohs\_im.action\_writer

## About this task

Inspection and audit agents can also create actions for specific questions while completing a smart assessment or survey from the mobile app. When an agent creates an action for a question, the system also generates a related finding record based on the response. For more information, see the following:

-   [Create actions and findings for the smart assessment questionnaire from mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-create-actions-findings-smart-assessments.md).
-   [Create actions and findings for survey responses from mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/add-actions-for-safety-inspections-survey-in-mobile-agent-app.md).

For information on adding an action for a safety inspection or audit through Mobile Agent, see [Add actions in mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/add-actions-for-safety-inspections-survey-in-mobile-agent-app.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  Create an action from an inspection or audit record or the Actions list.

    **Note:** You can add actions from the Actions tab on the record or by using the Action planner in the contextual sidebar. For more information on Action planner, see [Create and manage a safety action in the Action planner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/hs-create-action-in-action-planner.md).

</table>    **Note:** Any actions created for specific questions while completing the smart assessment or survey through the mobile app also appear in this tab.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For information on field descriptions, see [Health and Safety action form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/hs-action-form.md).

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  If necessary, add more actions.


## Result

-   If associated with a safety inspection, the action appears in the **Inspection actions** tab of the inspection.
-   If associated with a safety audit, the action appears in the **Audit actions** tab of the audit.
-   The action also appears in the assigned user's **My Tasks** list on both the Employee Center and the Now Mobile app. From either location, the user can respond to the action and update its status.

## What to do next

-   You can assign the action to yourself or to another safety team member to start working on it.

    If it is an audit action, you can submit it for approval to start the approval workflow. For more information, see [Submit a safety action for approval](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-submit-audit-finding-action-approval.md).

-   You can share the action, independent of the inspection or audit, with other groups or agents, so that they can prevent the similar situation from happening at any of their locations. To share an action, select **Copy action**.
    -   The action is duplicated and appears in the **My Tasks** list of the assigned user on the Employee Center.
    -   The action is also listed in the **Actions** list on the Health and Safety Workspace.
