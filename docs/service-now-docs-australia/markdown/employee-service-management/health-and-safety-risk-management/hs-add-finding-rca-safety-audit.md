# Add a finding for a review item in a safety audit

Record a finding for a review item during an audit and perform a root cause analysis \(RCA\) for it.

## Before you begin

The audit must have at least one item for review on the **Objectives** tab.

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_writer

## About this task

A finding can cite the specific criterion the item relates to, including a precise clause, section, or regulation from the cited source.

Safety auditors create actions for specific questions while completing a smart assessment from the mobile app. When they create an action for a question, the system also generates a related finding record based on the response. For more information, see [Create actions and findings for the smart assessment questionnaire from mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-create-actions-findings-smart-assessments.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  In the **Audits** list, select **All** and select an audit record to add a finding to.

4.  Create a finding from the **Findings** tab or directly from within an item for review.

    For field descriptions, see [Finding form for safety audits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-audit-finding-form.md).

6.  Select **Save**.

    The **5Whys RCA**, **ICAM RCA**, **Actions**, **Approvers** tabs appear.

7.  In the **5Whys RCA** tab, select **New** to perform an RCA using the Five whys technique of root cause analysis.

    1.  In the **Problem** field, enter the problem statement.

    2.  To identify the precise one underlying reason, ask why to each of the subsequent responses and enter in **Why?** fields.

    3.  In the **Root cause** field, enter the answer to the last Why.

    4.  Select **Save**.

8.  In the **ICAM RCA** tab, select **New** to perform an RCA using the ICAM \(Incident Cause Analysis Method\) root cause analysis technique.

    1.  Using the form's questions, determine the contributing factors to the finding.

    2.  In the **Key learnings \(Identify the root cause\)** field, identify the underlying root causes that led to the finding.

9.  If necessary, add more findings for the item for review.


## What to do next

-   In the **Actions** tab of the finding, add actions to ensure that any issues are prevented or corrected. For more information, see [Add an action for a safety inspection or audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-add-action-safety-inspection.md).
-   If needed, submit the finding and its associated actions for approval and start the approval workflow. For more information, see [Submit a safety audit, finding, or action for approval](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-submit-audit-finding-action-approval.md).

    **Note:** Before you can submit a finding or action for approval, at least one person must be added to the **People involved** list with the appropriate approver options selected. For more information, see [Add people involved in a safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-add-people-involved-safety-audit.md).
