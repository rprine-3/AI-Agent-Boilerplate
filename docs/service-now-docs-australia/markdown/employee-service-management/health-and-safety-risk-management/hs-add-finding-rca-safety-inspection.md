# Add a finding and root cause analysis for a safety inspection

Record a finding based on the survey results for a safety inspection and perform a root cause analysis \(RCA\) for it.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_inspection\_writer

## About this task

Inspection agents can also create actions for specific questions while completing a smart assessment or survey from the mobile app. When an agent creates an action for a question, the system also generates a related finding record based on the response. For more information, see the following:

-   [Create actions and findings for the smart assessment questionnaire from mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/hs-create-actions-findings-smart-assessments.md).
-   [Create actions and findings for survey responses from mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety/add-actions-for-safety-inspections-survey-in-mobile-agent-app.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  In the **Inspections** list, select **All** and open an inspection record to add a finding.

4.  In the **Findings and RCA** tab, select **New**.

    Any findings created for specific questions while completing the smart assessment or survey through the mobile app also appear in this tab.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    1.  In the **Hazard** field, select a risk for the finding to define the risk present.

    2.  In the **Potential consequence** and **Potential likelihood** fields, define a consequence and likelihood of the finding to understand its impact.

    3.  In the **Incident** field, select the related safety incident, if an incident is caused by this finding.

6.  Select **Save**.

    The **5Whys RCA** and **ICAM RCA** tabs appear.

7.  In the **5Whys RCA** tab, select **New** to perform an RCA using the Five whys technique of root cause analysis.

    1.  In the **Problem** field, enter the problem statement.

    2.  To identify the precise one underlying reason, ask why to each of the subsequent responses and enter in **Why?** fields.

    3.  In the **Root cause** field, enter the answer to the last Why.

    4.  Select **Save**.

8.  In the **ICAM RCA** tab, select **New** to perform an RCA using the ICAM \(Incident Cause Analysis Method\) root cause analysis technique.

    1.  Using the form's questions, determine the contributing factors to the finding.

    2.  In the **Key learnings \(Identify the root cause\)** field, identify the underlying root causes that led to the finding.

9.  If necessary, add more findings for the safety inspection.


## What to do next

Add actions for each finding to ensure that any issues are prevented or corrected.
