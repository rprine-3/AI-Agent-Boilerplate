# Define an objective for a safety audit

Define an objective to add detailed goal and scope of the safety audit. You can create as many objectives as the audit requires.

## Before you begin

-   People who should be assigned objectives are added to the audit's **People involved** list. The **Assigned to** field on an objective is filtered to people already added to the audit. For more information, see [Add people involved in a safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-add-people-involved-safety-audit.md).
-   Any documents or standards to be cited are uploaded and accessible.

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.safety\_audit\_writer

## About this task

Before an audit begins, define its scope by creating the audit objectives, the criteria used as benchmarks, and the items to be reviewed.

-   An objective describes a specific area of focus for the audit. Each objective has a method \(for example, interview, document review, or inspection\), a due date, and can be assigned to a person involved in the audit.
-   Criteria are the benchmarks or standards against which the audit measures compliance. Criteria are associated with one or more objectives.
-   Items for review are the specific records, documents, or assessments that should be examined to meet an objective. Items for review are assigned to a person involved in the audit, who is responsible for conducting that part of the review and raise findings against them.

**Note:** If you have a previous audit with a similar scope, you can select **Import scope** to pre-populate the objectives and the related sections rather than entering them manually. For more information, see [Import scope from an existing safety audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/hs-import-scope-existing-safety-audit.md).
