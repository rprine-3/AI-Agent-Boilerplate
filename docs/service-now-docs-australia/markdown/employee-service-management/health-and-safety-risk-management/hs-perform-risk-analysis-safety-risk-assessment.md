# Perform risk analysis for a safety risk assessment

For a risk assessment, perform risk analyses of identified hazards and choose control measures to assess how they impact and mitigate the hazard.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_assessment\_manager or sn\_hs\_rm.risk\_assessment\_writer

## About this task

A risk analysis can be associated with job steps in a job and have their inherent and residual risk assessed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the risk management icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-risk-assessment.png"\] Alt text: Risk assessment icon\).

3.  Select the **Risk assessment** list and then **All**.

4.  Open the risk assessment to perform the risk analysis for.

5.  In the **Risk analyses** tab, add risk analysis records.

**Import from predefined job**

</td><td>

To create risk analyses by importing hazards and controls from a predefined job, see [Create a risk analysis from a job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/import-hazards-and-controls.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d388314e139">

**Create in Risk analyses tab**

</td><td>

To add a risk analysis manually,1.  In the **Risk analyses** list, select **New**.
2.  On the form, fill in the fields and select **Save**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  In the **Hazard assessments** tab of a risk analysis, review hazards and their controls to assess their risk levels.

    For more information on how the risk level for a hazard is evaluated, see [Assess safety hazards and risk levels for a risk analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-risk-management/add-a-risk-and-its-controls-for-a-safety-risk-assessment.md).

    The inherent and residual risk levels \(severity and likelihood\) on the risk analysis form are calculated from the corresponding risk levels in its associated hazard assessments.

7.  When hazard assessments of all identified hazards in a risk analysis are complete, set the **State** of the risk analysis as Complete.

8.  Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each risk analysis record in the risk assessment.

9.  When all risk analyses in the risk assessment are complete, visualize the risk level \(severity and likelihood\) in the **Risk matrix** section.

    -   Select **Inherent risk view** to view the risk level of associated hazards before controls.
    -   Select **Residual risk view** to view the risk level of associated hazards after controls have been put in place.
    The number in the risk matrix shows the count of this risk level from all listed risk analyses in the assessment.


## Result

-   All risk analysis records for this assessment appear in the **Risk analyses** list under the Risk analyses tab.
-   The overall level of inherent and residual risk is determined based on the highest identified risk in the **Risk analyses** list.​
-   The computed risk levels from all risk analyses appear in the **Inherent risk** and **Residual risk** fields in the risk assessment's form header.
