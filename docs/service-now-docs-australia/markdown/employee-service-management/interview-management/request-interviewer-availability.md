# Request interviewer to share scheduling preferences

Request interviewers on a job requisition to share their scheduling preferences to plan a seamless interview process.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ta\_hiring\_core.recruiter or sn\_ta\_hiring\_core.recruitment\_coordinator

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Recruitment workspace**.

2.  Select the job requisition that you want to request the interviewer's scheduling preferences for.

3.  In the **Hiring team** tab, select one or more interviewers to request their scheduling preferences.

4.  Select **Request scheduling preferences**.

5.  On the Request scheduling preferences form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Request scheduling preferences form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/interview-management/request-availability-form.md).

6.  Select **Send**.


## What to do next

-   Once you have sent a request, you can navigate to **List view** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Scheduling preferences-All** &gt; **Interviewer name** and select **Send reminder** to remind the interviewer via an email notification to share their scheduling preferences. For more information, see [List view in Recruitment workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/recruitment-workspace/list-view-recruit-workspace.md).
-   By default, a scheduled job sends a reminder email to the interviewer on alternate days for 14 days from the day it was requested, if they haven't shared their preferences. This default value can be configured by an admin by updating the **sn\_ta\_int\_mgmt.remind\_availability\_in\_days** value.
-   If the interviewer is part of the same Microsoft organization as yours and have installed Proactive prompts application and configured Virtual Agent in Microsoft Teams, they will be notified about the reminder in Microsoft Teams.
