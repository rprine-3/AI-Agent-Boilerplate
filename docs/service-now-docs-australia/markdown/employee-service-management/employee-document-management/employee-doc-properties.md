# Properties for Employee Document Management application

Activating the Employee Document Management \[com.sn\_employee\_document\_management\] plugin adds the following properties.

Properties control the behavior of the Employee Document Management application.

For optimal system performance and depending on your internal processes, employee documentation is purged based on the security policy established by your company.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_hr\_ef.enable\_document\_viewer \(Enable "Document Viewer" to preview documents\)

</td><td>

Enables document viewer to view documents of type \(.docx, .txt, .png, .xls, and so on\) directly from Employee Document Management.The default value is **Yes**.

**Note:** If **No** is checked, you can still download the document and view it locally.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_hr\_ef.enable\_download\_multiple \(Enable "Download" UI Action to download multiple employee documents in a zip file.\)

</td><td>

Lets you download multiple employee documents from Employee Documents list into a .zip file.The default value is **Yes**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_hr\_ef.max\_file\_size \(Maximum file upload size in megabytes:\)

</td><td>

The maximum file size of a document you can upload. The default is 30 megabytes.You can change this value, but system performance can be affected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_hr\_ef.purge\_stride\_length \(The frequency in days that purge dates will be recalculated for Employee documents.\)

</td><td>

Determines the stride value for recalculating the purge dates for employee documents. The stride value determines the range of values that can be assigned to every user \[sys\_user\] record that has associated employee documents.

 For example, if 30 is entered, the range of values that can be randomly assigned is from 1 through 30. When the Refresh Purge Dates for Employee Documents scheduled job runs, based on the current date, it determines the stride value. Any user record assigned that stride value has their employee documents purge date recalculated.

 Also, purge dates are recalculated for employee documents that match the following requirements:

-   Employee document is active.
-   There are no legal holds or purge holds on the employee document.
-   The stride value for the user record matches the stride value for the current date.

 The number you enter determines the stride value range. For example, Entering a 1 indicates that there is no stride range and the purge recalculation is performed for all employee documents daily.

 Entering a larger number ensures that system performance is optimal since large companies can have large amounts of documents.

 The default value is **30** and can be modified.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_hr\_ef.purge\_authorization\_interval \(The number of days before the next month a purge notification is sent \(value between 1-15\):\)

sn\_hr\_ef.enable\_purge\_logs \(Enable purge logs to log the files deleted during document purge.\)

</td><td>
