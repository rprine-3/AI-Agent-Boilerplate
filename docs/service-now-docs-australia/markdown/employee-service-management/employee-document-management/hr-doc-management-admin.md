# Managing employee documents

Use Employee Document Management to search, create, move, or manage legal holds on employee documents.

Employee Document Management is your virtual file cabinet containing any or all your organization's employee documents. With Employee Document Management, you can:

-   Search for employee documents: There are many ways you can use to narrow down your search for employee documents.
-   Create employee documents:
    -   Employee documents can be added directly to the document repository.
    -   When combined with HR Service Delivery, HR agents can move documents from an HR case or add directly to the document repository.
-   Place an HR profile or document type on legal hold: Placing an HR profile or document type on legal hold prevents associated employee documents from being purged after the retention period has been reached.
-   Move employee documents: When employee documents are attached to an HR case, you can manually move them to the document repository. Or, you can configure HR services to automatically move employee documents when the case is closed/complete.
-   View employee documents: Employees can view their own employee documents on the service portal or Employee Center. Here [Define policies for a document type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-document-management/hr-doc-management-config.md) is how you give them access by document type. The base system provides example document types.

## Searching for employee documents

Search for and view employee documents using different filters from the employee document repository. You can also download documents for audit purposes.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.document\_reader

### About this task

Employee Documents is the repository for employee documents. No matter how large your repository of employee documents is, you can search on the fly or set up pre-set search filters to find the documents you need quickly.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Profile** &gt; **Employee Documents** &gt; **Search Documents**.

2.  Use the column filters to identify documents you are looking for.

    For example, sorting on the Employee column shows all documents by employee.

3.  To download documents, select the check the box next to the documents and then select **Download** from the Actions choice list.

    Downloading multiple documents with the same name appends each document with the employee name. A number is added when documents are still duplicated.

4.  To view more information about a document, click the document name.

    If **Yes** is checked in the**sn\_hr\_ef.enable\_document\_viewer** Employee Document Property, the employee document appears.


## Create or modify an employee document

With the employee document writer \[sn\_hr\_ef.document\_writer\] role, you can create or upload an employee document directly to the employee document management repository.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.document\_writer

### About this task

Documents can also be uploaded from the HR case form and then moved to the document repository.

**Note:** Employee documents can also be moved from the HR case form automatically when the case is closed by configuring the HR service. For information on configuring this feature, see [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Profile** &gt; **Employee Documents** &gt; **Create New Document**.

For more information, see [Properties for Employee Document Management application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-document-management/employee-doc-properties.md).

 After selecting a document, the read-only fields show the file size, file format, created on, and created by.

 The viewer within the UI only supports viewing .pdf documents. Other types of documents can be downloaded and then viewed.

 For optimal search results, do not use dashes \(-\) in the name of the document. Using full words separated by spaces or underbars provides better search results.

 The **Enable "Document Viewer" to preview pdf documents** in the Employee Documents property must be checked **Yes** to view .pdf documents.

## Move employee documents to the document repository

You can move employee documents from an HR case to the employee document repository. You can also move employee documents automatically by HR service when an HR case is closed complete.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.document\_writer or sn\_hr\_core.case\_reader

### About this task

Employee documents can also be added directly to the employee document repository. The employee document repository provides a central repository for quick and easy identification using different sorting features. See [Create or modify an employee document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-document-management/hr-doc-management-admin.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Case Management** &gt; **All HR Cases**.

2.  Select a case that has employee documents attached.

    From the list view, there is no way to identify HR cases with employee documents attached. The HR case number or the Opened for person are required to locate an HR case.

3.  From the form header, click **Move Attachments**.

    The **Move Attachments to Employee File** menu appears.

4.  Select the check box next to the documents you want to move.

    The **Select COE for attachments to be moved** and **Topic Detail** fields can be modified, but only if the document was added under the wrong type of HR case.

5.  Select the **Document Type** for each document.

    The document type determines categorization, who can access it, and the retention policy. If no document type appears for the associated topic detail, one should be created to ensure correct categorization. See [Define policies for a document type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-document-management/hr-doc-management-config.md).

6.  Click **Move Selected**.


### Result

The employee documents move from the HR case to the employee document repository. After an employee document is moved, the file name, format, and size are copied from the attachment to the document.

**Note:** You can also automate this process by checking the **Automatically move attachments** box from HR services. See [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md).

### What to do next

Once you have moved the attachments, the attachments are displayed in the Employee Documents section in the case.

## Add or remove a legal hold for employee documents

Legal or litigation holds prevent the deletion of documents related to a document type or all employee documents for an HR profile.
