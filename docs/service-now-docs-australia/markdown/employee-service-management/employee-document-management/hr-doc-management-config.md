# Defining and setting for employee documents

Use Employee Document Management to configure how employee documents should be handled based on company policy, processes, and regulatory compliance.

## Document types

Document types are at the center of the Employee Document Management application. All employee documents are required to have a document type assigned. Categorize your employee documents by assigning document types. Use document types to combine policies that determine handling of an employee document. Use document types to:

-   Associate a security policy. Security policies determine who can access employee documents and determine purge authorization.
-   Associate a retention policy. Retention policies determine how long to keep a document and who the document is applicable to.
-   Place a legal hold. Legal holds temporarily prevent document purging or changes to the document.
-   Allow access to employees.
-   Configure employee documents to be moved automatically when an HR case is closed. See [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md).

## Define policies for a document type

For each document type, you can determine who can access a document as well as define the retention policies associated with it, or place a legal hold. A document type can manage multiple documents.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.manager

### About this task

Document types combine topic detail, retention policies, and legal holds. The default retention period for a document type is defined on the corresponding Center of Excellence \(COE\). For details on COEs, see [HR Centers of Excellence data model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-centers-of-excellence-coes.md).

**Note:** The base system provides various document types as examples.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Employee Documents** &gt; **Document Types**.

2.  Click **New** or an existing document type to edit.

3.  Fill in the fields as appropriate.

## Define how long to retain employee documents

A retention period defines how long an employee document should be saved before being discarded. Retention periods are combined with conditions or criteria to form a retention policy.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.manager

**Note:** Retention periods are unique and cannot be duplicated. Before you can delete a retention period, you must be sure that a document type is not associated with the retention policy.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Employee Documents** &gt; **Retention Periods**.

2.  Fill in the fields as appropriate.

<table id="table_ibk_b4f_d2b"><thead><tr><th>

## Add or modify default retention policies

Default retention policies ensure that employee documents are not mistakenly purged. When a retention policy has not been assigned to a document type, the default retention policy is used.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.manager

### About this task

You can edit default retention policies.

The HR Service Delivery base system provides default retention policies for each employee document associated with a Center or Excellence \(COE\) table.

Default retention policies are assigned to all documents that fall under a COE and the retention period is indefinite and never purged.

**Note:** If you change the default retention period, all new documents are assigned the new period, but existing documents still use the original retention period.

Default retention policies cannot be deleted when being used by a document type. Only one default policy for a COE is allowed.

Once a purge date is calculated and a legal hold is placed, the purge date does not change.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Employee Documents** &gt; **Default Retention Policies**.

2.  Click **New** to create a default retention policy or on an existing policy to edit.

3.  Fill in the fields as appropriate.

</table>4.  Click **Submit** or **Update**.


## Add or modify a retention policy

Set policies determining how long documents should be retained and who is covered. Retention policies combine the retention period and conditions or criteria.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.manager

### About this task

Regulations, laws, and your company policies determine how long documents should be retained.

Once a purge date is calculated and a legal hold is placed, the purge date does not change.

To ensure that there are no accidental purging, the base system provides default retention policies. When a retention policy has not been assigned to a document type, the default retention policy is used.

When a document type is covered by multiple retention policies:

-   The policy with the longest retention period applies.
-   When there is a non-default default retention policy and a default retention policy with a retention period of indefinite, the non-default retention policy applies. Assuming the HR criteria matches and the retention period is applicable.

Retention policies have a one-to-one relationship to a document type, you cannot have the same retention policy for multiple document types.

**Note:** You can use the same retention period for multiple retention policies.

When you have multiple retention policies, but there is an overlap in criteria, the retention policy with the longest retention period is used.

For example: Document type = Disciplinary Notice

-   Retention policies:
    -   US employees \(retention period = End Date + 7 years\)
    -   US contract employees \(retention period = End Date + 5 years\)
-   If a user is both a US employee and contract employee, the US employees retention policy is used because it has a longer retention period.

**Note:** You can use the default retention policy for all document types. The default retention policy defines that all employee documents are retained while an employee is a current employee of your company. Once an employee leaves the company, a second retention policy is triggered based on HR criteria. When an employee does not satisfy the HR criteria and leaves the company, the original default retention policy is still in effect. The employee documents are retained indefinitely.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Employee Documents** &gt; **Retention Policies**.

2.  Click **New** or an existing retention policy to edit.

3.  Fill in the fields as appropriate.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Click **Submit** or **Update**.


## Add or modify default security policies

Default security policies ensure that employee documents are secure. The HR Service Delivery base system provides default security policies for each document type and determines who can access and has purge authorization.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.manager

Users are granted access to employee documents by:

-   Groups
-   Roles
-   Both groups and roles

The security policy can require authorization to purge and requires a user to belong to the group that has purge authorization.

See [Manage HR Groups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_ManageHRGroups.md) and [Manage HR roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/c_ManageRoles.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Employee Documents** &gt; **Default Security Policies**.

2.  Click **New** or an existing default security policy to edit.

## Add or modify document security policies

Many employee documents contain confidential and personal information. Use document security policies to define access to employee documents and ensure that they are secure.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.admin

### About this task

You can determine who can read, write, or authorize purging of documents by adding or modifying document security policies.

**Note:** You can provide employees visibility into their own employee documents through their HR profile. Check the **Employee access** box on the **Document type** form. See [Define policies for a document type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-document-management/hr-doc-management-config.md).

Users are granted access to employee documents by:

-   Groups
-   Roles
-   Both groups and roles

The security policy can require authorization to purge and requires a user to belong to a group that has purge authorization.

See [Manage HR Groups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_ManageHRGroups.md) and [Manage HR roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/c_ManageRoles.md).
