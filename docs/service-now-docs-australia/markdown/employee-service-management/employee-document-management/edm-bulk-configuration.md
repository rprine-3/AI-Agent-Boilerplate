# Configuring employee document management bulk import with source document repository

Use Employee Document Import Configuration to identify and communicate with the source document repository. The source document repository is where you currently store your employee documents.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.admin, sn\_hr\_ef.document\_import

## About this task

Before you can move your employee documents from your source document repository, you must:

-   Identify the type of repository you are pulling documents from.
-   Identify the URL and credentials from the repository you are pulling documents from. Or, identify the directory you are pulling documents from.
-   Test to make sure that there is communication from your source repository and Employee Document Management.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Bulk Import** &gt; **Import Configuration**.

2.  Fill in the fields on the form.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

A descriptive name that identifies your employee document bulk upload configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source type

</td><td>

Identifies the source you are moving employee documents from.-   Local: The source employee document repository is local.
-   URL: The source employee document repository is cloud-based.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Host

</td><td>

Appears when **Local** is selected from **Source type**.

The IP address of the local source employee document repository you are pulling from. When pulling from a local directory, the IP address of the source connected via the MID server.

</td></tr><tr><td>

URL

</td><td>

Appears when **URL** is selected from **Source Type**.The URL of the source third-party, cloud-based document repository.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Directory

</td><td>

The directory in the source employee document repository you are pulling from. For Local source type, you can specify a recursive directory structure.

 For third-party, cloud-based \(URL\) source type, you can only specify the root directory.

 **Note:** If you have multiple directories in your third-party, cloud-based repository, a separate Employee Document Import Configuration is required for each one. Use the **Clone Configuration** button to make cloning easier.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Staging record state

</td><td>

The state assigned to the imported employee document staging records before being inserted into the employee documents. -   Draft: Allows you to verify the staging records prior to inserting into the employee documents.

**Note:** Use the **Draft** state as the default in a testing environment when adjusting your mapping configurations. Employee documents that have a **Draft** state must be changed to **Ready** before the Capture step can process it.

-   Ready: When the staging records for employee documents are accurate and does not require verification, use this state. You can still fix any errors that occur. The state changes to Error when verification cannot be confirmed.

**Note:** Use the Ready state as the default in a production environment after testing ensures that your mapping configurations are error-free. Employee documents in the Ready state process automatically in the Capture step.

## Create or edit import configuration

To import employee documents, map the source employee documents from your local document repository or third-party cloud-based repository to Employee Document Management.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_ef.document\_import

### About this task

For a local document repository, name mapping acquires file meta data from the file name.

### Procedure

1.  From **Employee Document Import Configuration** form, click the **Employee Document Import Map** tab.

2.  Click **New** or on an existing import configuration.

3.  Fill in the form.

<table id="table_cmt_nkz_4fb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Configuration

</td><td>

The name of the employee document bulk import configuration. See [Configuring employee document management bulk import with source document repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-document-management/edm-bulk-configuration.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mapping type

</td><td>

Defines how you are locating the source employee documents within your source document repository.-   Field: Indicates that within an array of information about your source document you want to identify a specific part of the array to map.
-   Value: Indicates that you are identifying a specific term within an array of information from your source document you want to map.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Regex

</td><td>

The regular expression string that identifies files you want to include from the source repository.For example, \(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\).\(\\w+\) matches file names that contain alphanumeric, underscore, and a period. Once you have identified specific parts of information in the array, you can then map it.

 The more consistent your existing naming convention, the easier to locate your employee documents from your source repository,

</td></tr><tr><td>

Replace

</td><td>

The information you want the source employee document to contain when imported to Employee Document Management. For example, the array for your source employee document has school. You want the new value to equal transcripts for document type. Enter:

-   Replace: transcripts
-   Mapped element: docType
-   Source element: school
**Note:** You can also use regular expressions \(RegEx\) to define the replacement value. When using RegEx, use a regular expression test site to ensure correct parsing.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mapped element

</td><td>

Determines what meta data field is acquired and the value included in the final staging record created.Fields from the Import Document Staging \[sn\_hr\_ef\_import\_staging\] table that you want to map your source employee documents to.

 The base system provides the following fields you can map your source employee documents to:

-   docType: Document type
-   fileName: File name
-   employee: Employee name


</td></tr><tr><td>

Source element

</td><td>

The field or value from a local or third-party cloud-based employee document repository you want to map to Employee Document Management.For example, if your source file name contains the employee name, you can use the employee name as the source element and use the Mapped element of employee.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter regex

</td><td>

A regular expression sequence that matches text found in the array from your source employee document repository. Use this field to refine your identification of source employee documents.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter field

</td><td>

Locates specific text found in the array of information returned from the source repository when files matching the Regex are imported. **Note:** You can also use regular expressions \(RegEx\) to define the replacement value. When using RegEx, use a regular expression test site to ensure correct parsing.

 Use this field to help refine the information you want mapped.

 For example, to import only files with a file name formatted first\_last\_xxx.pdf \(abel\_tuter\_tuition.pdf\):

-   Regex: \(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\).\(\\w+\)
-   Mapped element: fileName
-   Source element: fileName
-   Filter field: .pdf


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    -   **File name example**

        The example file name is abel\_tuter\_tuition.pdf.

        To find and extract the file name from the source repository, see this example:

        \[Omitted image "import-map-filename.png"\] Alt text: Import Map — File name

        The import map is looking for a source element called fileName.

        The import map is going to translate this source element to a mapped element called fileName.

        The Regex is looking for the format of the file name first\_last\_xxx.pdf.

    -   **File name to employee name example**

        From the file name, the employee name is extracted. Employee name is a requirement for Employee Document Management.

        \[Omitted image "import-map-employee.png"\] Alt text: Import Map — Employee Name

        The import map is looking for a source element called fileName.

        The import map is going to translate this source element to a mapped element called employee.

        The Regex is looking for the format of the file name to be first\_last\_tuition.pdf \(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\).\(\\w+\).

        It replaces the original file name with first.last \($1.$2\)

    -   **File name to document type example**

        From the file name, the document type is extracted. Document type is a requirement for Employee Document Management.

        \[Omitted image "import-map-doctype.png"\] Alt text: Import Map — docType

        The import map is looking for a source element called fileName.

        The import map is going to translate this source element to a mapped element called docType.

        The Regex is looking for the format of the file name to be first\_last\_tuition.pdf \(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\).\(\\w+\).

        It creates a docType of tuition \($3\).

4.  Click **Submit** or **Update**.
