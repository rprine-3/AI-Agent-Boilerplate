# Activate Employee Document Management

You can activate the Employee Document Management \[com.sn\_employee\_document\_management\] plugin with the admin role. This plugin includes demo data and activates related plugins if they are not already active.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

## Request employee document management bulk uploads

The Employee Document Management Bulk Uploads requires separate subscriptions to the Orchestration \[com.snc.runbook\_automation\] and ServiceNow IntegrationHub Installer \[com.glide.hub.integrations\] plugins. These plugins must be activated by ServiceNow personnel.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

There is demo data available that provides configuration examples of a local directory and third-party, cloud-based document repositories. These examples help you to configure Employee Document Management bulk uploads with your own internal document repository.

To view the demo data, you must activate the Orchestration \[com.snc.runbook\_automation\] and ServiceNow IntegrationHub Installer \[com.glide.hub.integrations\] plugins first.

The Employee Document Management \[com.sn\_hr\_employee\_document\_management\] plugin must be activated last.

</table>To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. The account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.
