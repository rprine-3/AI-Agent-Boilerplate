# Bulk import map examples

Mapping your source employee documents to required elements in Employee Document Management is crucial for a successful bulk import.

This topic provides examples on how to map your source employee documents to the required elements in Employee Document Management. The values provided are examples designed to guide you through the import map configuration.

## Map fields and values directly from existing file names

Using your existing employee document file names is recommended when your source employee documents reside in a local repository.

For example, an employee document can have all the meta data in the file name Abel\_Tuter\_tuition.pdf to map to Employee Document Management.

**Note:** When using regular expressions \(RegEx\) to define the replacement value, use a regular expression test site to ensure correct parsing.

-   **File name example**

    The example file name is abel\_tuter\_tuition.pdf.

    To find and extract the file name from the source repository, see this example:

    \[Omitted image "import-map-filename.png"\] Alt text: Import Map — File name

    The import map is looking for a source element called fileName.

    The import map is going to translate this source element to a mapped element called fileName.

    The Regex is looking for the format of the file name first\_last\_xxx.pdf.

-   **File name to employee name example**

    From the file name, the employee name is extracted. Employee name is a requirement for Employee Document Management.

    \[Omitted image "import-map-employee.png"\] Alt text: Import Map — Employee Name

    The import map is looking for a source element called fileName.

    The import map is going to translate this source element to a mapped element called employee.

    The Regex is looking for the format of the file name to be first\_last\_tuition.pdf \(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\).\(\\w+\).

    It replaces the original file name with first.last \($1.$2\)

-   **File name to document type example**

    From the file name, the document type is extracted. Document type is a requirement for Employee Document Management.

    \[Omitted image "import-map-doctype.png"\] Alt text: Import Map — docType

    The import map is looking for a source element called fileName.

    The import map is going to translate this source element to a mapped element called docType.

    The Regex is looking for the format of the file name to be first\_last\_tuition.pdf \(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\)\_\(\\w+\).\(\\w+\).

    It creates a docType of tuition \($3\).

    **Note:** Having the source employee documents in a central repository, simple directory structure, and consistent file naming convention are highly recommended and reduces errors.


## Parse and map fields and values from a JSON output

Using a JSON output is recommended when your source employee documents reside in a third-party, cloud-based repository.
