## Workplace Concierge workflow overview

Workplace Concierge is an agentic workflow that operates directly from communication tools like email, calendar, and . When you add the Workplace Concierge to a conversation, it identifies the intent to schedule a meeting and gathers the necessary visit details. It validates the information with the host and then creates the visit and visitor invitations. If any mandatory detail is absent or ambiguous, Workplace Concierge pauses and communicates with the host before proceeding.

Workplace Concierge supports the following communication channels:

-   Calendar invite: Workplace Concierge can be added as a guest to a calendar invite
-   Email thread: Workplace Concierge can be added in the CC field of the email thread
-   Now Assist in Virtual Agent: Workplace Concierge can be invoked in the chat by entering keywords like `invite a visitor`

After a visit is created, the Workplace Concierge sends invitation emails with a link to the visitor portal. Workplace Concierge also monitors replies and updates the visitor records. Visitors can respond to the email or use the portal link based on their preference. Hosts can use simple commands to send reminders or cancel specific visits, and they receive progress notifications like how many visitors have completed the pre-check tasks.
