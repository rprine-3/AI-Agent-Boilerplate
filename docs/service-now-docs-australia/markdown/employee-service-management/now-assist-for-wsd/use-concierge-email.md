</table>    If any required information is missing, Workplace Concierge sends an email to request clarification.

3.  Reply to the Workplace Concierge email clarifying the information.

    For example, if an email thread contains two locations, or if the location is not found in the Workplace Service Delivery location hierarchy, reply with the exact location name.

    After receiving all the information, Workplace Concierge sends an email with the visit details for confirmation.

4.  Verify the details of the visit, then reply with a confirmation.

    After you confirm the details, Workplace Concierge creates a visit and invites the visitors using the email addresses. For more information about visitor registrations, see [Registering a visitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-visitor-management/registerring-a-visitor.md).


## What to do next

Visitors can reply to the invitation email to provide information for the prerequisite tasks. The Email Visitor Intake agent processes email replies and updates the visitor records.

If Workplace Concierge is included in any emails sent to the visitors, the Email Visitor Intake agent scans the email threads for relevant data. The agent then updates the visitor records.
