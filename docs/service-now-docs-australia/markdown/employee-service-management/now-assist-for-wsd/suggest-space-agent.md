# Using the workplace collaboration Agent for space suggestions

The Workplace Collaboration Agent provides insights on your team members in-office attendance. Based on this information, the reservation agent finds and reserves a space for reservation and collaboration. The collaboration agent considers your colleague's in-office days, location, and suggests a space for collaboration when you're in office.

The Create a reservation agent helps employees find a space for reservation. The Workplace collaboration agent provides suggestions for reservations based on colleague’s attendance and proximity. Employees can find and reserve a workspace near a colleague. The collaboration agent helps in improving collaboration and workplace productivity. The collaboration agent provides insights on your colleagues in-office days.

**Note:** Desks reservations are supported by the Workplace collaboration agent.

When providing suggestions for collaboration, the Collaboration agent prioritizes data in the following order: Employee Presence Exceptions, Employee Presence Routine, and your current reservations. If an employee's current reservation data and location are available but no workplace presence information exists, the agent prioritizes current reservations over workplace location. For more information, see [Workplace Concierge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-concierge/workplace-concierge-feat.md).

Your collaborators can be categorized as:

-   Employee collaborators information derived from Employee Presence Exceptions and Employee Presence Routine in Workplace Concierge.
-   Collaborator information is also derived from the invitees that you frequently add to your reservations with while making a reservation.
-   Colleagues with whom you collaborate frequently. Your team members and your manager. If you're a manager, your collaborators are your team members reporting to you.

The workplace collaboration agent improves employee's reservation and collaboration experience by providing the following:

-   Determines your collaborators \(your team members, your presence collaborators \(if available\), and your reservation attendees\).
-   Provides insights when collaborators are in office.
-   Provides insights about team members who are in office for a specific day.
-   Helps to reserve a space near a colleague.
-   When multiple collaborators with same name exists, the collaboration agent asks employees to select their preferred collaborator from a list of similar names. The collaboration agent makes suggestions and tries to find your preferred collaborator. For example, if there are two Abel in your organization, but you frequently collaborate with Abel Tuter, the collaboration agent selects Abel Tuter as your preferred collaborator.
-   Provides ability to change the workplace preferences of an employee \(remote to in-office and vice versa\). If employees change their remote day to in-office day, an exception is created by the application in the Employee Presence Exceptions table.

**Note:** If you're planning to sit near a colleague, and if your colleague has a desk reservation for one hour and doesn't have an All day reservation, you can make a reservation for one-hour only. If an employee doesn't have any Employee Presence Exceptions and has no reservations made for a day while in office, the collaboration agent prioritizes the employee's workplace profile location and spaces around that location is suggested to the employee for collaboration.
