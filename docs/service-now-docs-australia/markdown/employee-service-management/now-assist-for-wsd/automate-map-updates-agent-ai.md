# Automate map updates agentic workflow

This AI agent helps map admins configure the map during bulk updates to Indoor Mapping.

## Automate map updates workflow overview

The AI agent autonomously retrieves sources for the CAD file and resumes the import task. If the source isn't found, the AI agent moves the task to the `Waiting user input` state. For more information about import tasks, see [Work on an import task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/work-import-task.md).

The AI agent autonomously performs the following:

-   Retrieves all the sources for the uploaded CAD.
-   Sets the CAD source on the Import Task and resumes the task.
-   Moves the task to the `Waiting user input` state if the source isn't found.
