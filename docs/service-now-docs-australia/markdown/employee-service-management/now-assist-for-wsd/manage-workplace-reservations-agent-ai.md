# Help manage workplace reservations agentic workflow

The Help manage workplace reservations agentic AI workflow enables Workplace Event Planners with rescheduling a planned reservation. AI Agents gather relevant information from a workplace reservation and update an existing planned reservation with a new date, time, and duration.

AI agents retrieve the reservation from the change event reservation case details. AI agents analyze an existing reservation before updating it with a new date and time. If the old location is not available while updating an existing reservation, AI agents update and move the reservation to a new location. For more information, see [Submit a change event request for a reservation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-case-management/submit-change-event-reservation.md).

A change event request is submitted for updating an existing reservation by a workplace user. A workplace case is created with a new workplace service. The workplace case is assigned to a user in the Workplace Event planners assignment group.

The team of AI agents autonomously perform the following:

-   Retrieve the change event request workplace case details when it assigned to a Workplace Event planner.
-   Analyze the reservation retrieved from the previous step. If the old location is available while updating a reservation's date, time, and duration, AI agents update the reservation. If the old location is not available for reservation, AI agents move the reservation to a new location while updating the reservation date, time, and duration.
-   Send notification to Workplace Event planners using the ServiceNow Otto panel conversational interface.

    Workplace Event planners can respond to AI agents queries using the conversational interface of the ServiceNow Otto panel. AI agents take confirmation from Workplace planners before updating a reservation to another location if the old location is not available. It shows three workplace locations. You can select the location or ask the AI agents to show more locations. AI agent provides a link for you to select and navigate to the reservation page to manually select a location of your choice.

-   Update the change event request case work notes with all the actions taken. Workplace Event planners can review the activity log to see the actions taken by AI agents to update a planned reservation event.
