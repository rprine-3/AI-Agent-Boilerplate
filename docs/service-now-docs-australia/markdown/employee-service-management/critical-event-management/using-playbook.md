# Use a critical event playbook

A critical event playbook in Critical Event Management provides a step-by-step guide to help you manage a critical event from initiation to resolution.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_critical.agent

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Health and Safety** and select the **New Critical Event** button.

2.  On the Critical Event form, fill in the fields and select **Save**.

    For a description of the field values, see [Critical Event form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/critical-event-management/new-critical-event-form.md).

3.  Open the critical event and select the **Playbook** tab.

4.  Complete the Triage section.

    1.  On the **Review submission** task, review the record details, update the fields as needed, and select **Mark complete**.

        The playbook redirects you to the next task automatically.

    2.  If the critical event is related to a larger existing critical event, select that critical event from the list and then select **Link to this parent**.

        If the critical event is the only one for active emergency, select **Skip** instead.

    3.  On the Assign critical event form, fill in the fields and select **Move to Work in Progress**.

    4.  Mark the event as active by selecting **Activate Critical Event**.

5.  Complete the generic playbook section.

    1.  Select **Access critical event** under the **Work in progress** section of the playbook.

    2.  Choose the **Mark Complete** button or **Skip** button to move to the next task on the playbook.

    3.  Complete the **Review and update the critical event information** task as needed, then select **Mark Complete** to proceed.

    4.  Select **Compose** on an initial-communication template or select **Go to Notification center** to compose an ad-hoc communication for the impacted people.

    5.  Choose the **Activate on-site responder** template and send communication to on-site responders, to inform them of the ongoing event.

    6.  Close the sent communication notification and select **Mark Complete** in the **Playbook** tab to proceed to **Conduct roll call** step.

        View the cumulative count of **Total impacted**, **Need help**, **Unknown**, and **Accounted people** individuals.

    7.  Select **View Impacted People** to access the list of impacted people and update their status if needed.
