You can install the Legal Content Review application \(sn\_lg\_cont\_review\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

-   Review the Legal Content Review application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.

Install the Legal Request Management \(sn\_lg\_ops\) application before you install Legal Content Review.

Role required: sn\_lg\_cont\_review.admin
