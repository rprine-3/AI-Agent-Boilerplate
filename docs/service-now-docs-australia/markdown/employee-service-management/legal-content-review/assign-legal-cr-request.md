# Assign a Legal Content Review request

Assign a Legal Content Review request to yourself or to someone in your assignment group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lg\_cont\_review.content\_fulfiller

## About this task

When an employee submits a legal request, it's automatically assigned to a group or user in the legal department based on the assignment rules configured for the intake form of the associated practice area. If the request is assigned to a legal group, any member from the group can assign the request to themselves or assign it to another member of the group. For more information, see [Assignment rule to automatically assign legal requests or matters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/create-assignment-rules-intake-form.md).

The Assignment group permission level must be Read or Edit to view or change the permission level of the legal request for the users. By default, the permission level is set to Read. To change it to Edit, first select **Assign to me**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Legal Request** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center**.

2.  Select the List icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

3.  In the **Legal Requests** field, select **Unassigned**.

4.  In the list of unassigned requests, select the request number.

5.  Assign the request to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

    The fields in the legal request are in read-only mode until it has been assigned to you.

6.  Update the **Assignment group permission** to change the permission level of the legal request for the users.

    -   **No Access**: Only the practice area lead, group manager, and user in the **Assigned to** field can access the legal request and assign it to one of the members in the assignment group.
    -   **Read**: All members from the assignment group can only view the legal request. This option is the default permission level.
    -   **Edit**: All members from the assignment group can view and work on the legal request. The **Assigned To** field becomes optional if this option is set.
7.  To assign the request to another member, on the **Details** tab, select a user in the **Assigned to** field.

8.  To update the request, select **Save**.


## Result

The state of the request updates to Assigned.

## What to do next

The assigned user can start working on the legal request. For more information, see [Work on a legal request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-request-management/work-on-legal-request.md).
