# Managing workplace locations

Apart from the space administration features provided by Workplace Core, the Workplace Space Management application enables you to configure exclusive space-related settings.

To create workplace location records for buildings, floors, areas, and spaces you can use Workplace Core or Workplace Space Management. To add a workplace records using Workplace Core, see [Create records for your workplace data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/create-records-of-workplace-data-wsd.md).

Workplace Space Management provides more options for workplace-related functionality to the workplace location records. You can use the Workplace Space Management application to view the workplace location forms in the Space Management view.

The following features are available in the Space Management view on the workplace location form:

-   **Measurement details**

    Specify the measurement details of the workplace location such as the location size and the unit of measurement. For buildings, floors, and areas, you can also specify the total size and the usable size to plan infrastructure and other maintenance activities. For more information, see [Compute CAD file properties to extract space or room surface area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/indoor-mapping/compute-cad-properties.md).

-   **Allocation**

    Allocate or assign a cost center, department, or a workplace entity to workplace locations to track locations and perform workplace-related activities.

-   **Push down the allocation to child locations**

    Automatically assign the allocation type of the parent location to the child locations. Specify how you want to implement the push down functionality in the **Push down** field. You can track the progress of the push down process in the **Push down state** field.

    The push down functionality depends on the following conditions:

    -   If the child location has an existing allocation, the child location's allocation is either replaced or not replaced based on the **Push down** option specified in the parent location.
    -   The accessibility of the spaces assigned with an allocation depends on whether the user workplace profile configuration and the Space type configuration match. For more information, see [Allocation - types, setting, and impact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-space-management/setting-an-allocation-and-its-impact.md).
-   **Space usability**

    Specify whether a space type is usable. If a space type is usable, the spaces assigned to that space type are included in reservation-related activities and the usable size calculation of the parent location. If a space type isn’t set as usable, then the spaces assigned to that type aren’t included in reservation-related activities or the usable size calculation of the parent location.

-   **Flexible or permanent spaces**

    Configure a space as a flexible or a permanent space. This feature is applicable only to spaces of the space type **Workspace/desk**. If you configure a space as flexible, then the space is available for reservation on the Reservation portal. If you configure a space as permanent, then the spaces ares not available for reservation on the Reservation portal.

-   **View anomalies caused in a workplace profile**

    You can view the reason for anomalies in a workplace profile. Anomalies in workplace profiles are caused by a mismatch in the cost center, department, or assignment type between the user and the workplace location. For more information, see [Workplace location assignment anomaly types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/location-assignment-anomaly-types.md).
