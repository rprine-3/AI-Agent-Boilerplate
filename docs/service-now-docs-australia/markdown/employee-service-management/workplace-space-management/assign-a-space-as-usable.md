2.  Select the space type that you want to configure as usable.

3.  Open the form in the Space Management view.

    1.  Right-click the form header.

    2.  Select **View** &gt; **Space Management**.

        The form view changes.

4.  Select the **Usable** check box to enable the feature.

The size of all the spaces that are assigned to this space type is calculated in the **Usable size** fields of their areas, floors, and buildings.
