# Schedule Planning

Manage space assignments to help employees head back to the office.

## Schedule Planning overview

Schedule Planning provides a streamlined experience for project managers to assign and manage employee assignments based on project time frames.

As a project manager, you can do the following:

-   View a list of employees assigned to your project
-   View a list of spaces allocated for your project
-   Create a schedule plan for a specific period to map spaces to the employees
-   Execute a schedule plan to assign spaces to the Workplace Profile of the users

## Accessing Schedule Planning

You must install the following plugins to use the Schedule Planner module:

-   Workplace Central
-   Workplace Space Management

You can install the plugins from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home). You can also visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information of all the released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

**Important:** You must set a value for the **sn\_wsd\_core.ALLOCATION\_TYPE** property to enable schedule planning.

To access the Schedule Planner, navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Central**, then select the **Schedule Planner** module in the workspace.

As a project owner, you can view the created schedule plans, projects assigned to you, and the spaces and users assigned to the projects. You can create a schedule plan or edit existing schedule plans. For more information, see [Working with Schedule Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-central/working-with-schedule-planning.md).

**Note:** A project owner can create schedule plans for the projects that are assigned to them. Projects can be assigned to a user from the following fields:

-   **Primary contact** field of the department
-   **Manager** field of the cost center
-   **Managed by group** or **Managed by** field of the workplace entity

Only one of the fields is considered for the project list based on the **sn\_wsd\_core.ALLOCATION\_TYPE** property.

## Schedule Plan states

A schedule plan can be in one of the following states:

-   Draft: Project owner has created a new schedule plan but has not filled the details or started the workplace assignments.
-   In Progress: Project owner has filled the schedule plan details and the workplace locations are being assigned to the users.
-   Published: Schedule plan is created and the workplace locations are assigned to all the users.
-   Complete: Schedule plan has reached the specified end date and the workplace location assignments are made inactive.
-   Cancelled: Project owner has cancelled the schedule plan and the workplace location assignments are made inactive.

**Note:** The **Complete the lapsed schedule plan** job runs every day to check which schedule plans have reached the end date and move them to the **Complete** state.
