# Reviewing allocation changes

Review allocation changes in the Space Allocation Type Change Tracker table to plan changes for your scenarios.

The Space Allocation Type Change Tracker \[sn\_wsd\_spcmgmt\_space\_allocation\_type\_change\_tracker\] table contains information about allocation changes in your workplace.

You can review the table columns for information about the type of allocation changes.

After you review the allocation changes, you can make changes to your scenario. For example, if the parent of a workplace entity is changed, you can move the existing spaces to the previous parent and allocate spaces from the new parent. If a cost center or department is deleted or made inactive, you can remove the allocations from your scenario.
