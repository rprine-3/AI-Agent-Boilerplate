# Viewing HR Performance Analytics Scoped

HR Performance Analytics for the scoped version of HR Service Delivery helps you align resources and systems to strategic objectives.

Before you can view HR Performance Analytics data, your organization must purchase a subscription to Performance Analytics and an administrator activates the plugin.

After activating HR Performance Analytics, the collection job runs daily by default and is configurable. Collected data is kept for 30 days. The data in performance analytics reports is collected based on a daily scheduled job, therefore, the date is one day in the past. Over time, more data is available for historical trending.

-   **Scheduled Data Collection**

    There are two jobs specific to the Performance Analytics - Content Pack - Human Resources Scoped App \[com.sn\_hr\_pa\] plugin:

    -   \[PA HR Case\] Daily Data Collection
    -   \[PA HR Case\] Historic Data Collection
    See [Create or schedule a data collection job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/t_CreatASchedDataCollJob.md).

-   **Indicators**

    Each job has indicators to make data collection efficient and defines what data to collect.

    See [Configure a job indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/configure-job-indicator.md).

-   **View dashboards**

    After the PA jobs run, you can view the collected data from the **Dashboard**.

-   **HR Manager**

    Provides detailed data about open cases that helps managers quickly assign agents and look deeper into opened cases. You can sort this dashboard by assignment group.

    -   You can only filter this dashboard by Groups.
    -   The **Overview** tab provides summaries by backlog of all open cases, average time to resolution, and unassigned opened cases.
    -   The **Operational** tab shows the number of open cases by backlog, critical, breached SL, not updated in the last 10 days, and unassigned open. You can also filter by priority, state, assigned to, topic category, and HR service.
    -   The **Backlog monitor** tab shows the number of all open cases, average reassignment, cases not updated in last 3 days, unassigned, and the average age of open cases. You can also sort by COE, topic category, HR service, assignment group, agent, state, source, or priority and further by type of HR case. The format of the data is interchangeable.
-   **HR Agent**

    Provides detailed data for the logged in HR agent. It provides the number of backlog of open cases, breached SLA cases, approval requests, and unassigned cases.

    Group and stack the opened backlog cases by priority or state .

    You can filter by state, topic category, source, and priority.
