# Open an HR case to create a Journey Accelerator action plan

Journey Accelerator action plans can be created by opening an HR case with a related lifecycle event.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer

## About this task

When the Create Journey Accelerator Action Plan template is configured to automatically create Journey Accelerator action plans, a task is created and assigned to a manager for review.

When the template is not configured to automatically create Journey Accelerator action plans, a to-do task is created. The task is assigned to the manager \(**Opened for**\) to create a plan. The to-do contains the following information pre-filled in the plan:

-   Who is this plan for \(mapped from the subject person\)
-   Plan type \(mapped from the activity\)
-   Publish date \(mapped from the activity\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Case Management** &gt; **Create New Case**.

2.  Enter the name of the new employee in the Search for Employee field.

3.  Fill in the Case Details:

    -   **COE**: `HR Lifecycle Events Case`
    -   **HR service**: `New Hire Onborading`
    -   **Opened for**: `managers name`
    -   **Subject person**: `new hire name`
4.  Click **Create Case**.

5.  Review all the fields and make any updates that are needed and click **Ready for Work**.

    A to-do task is created in the managers to-do list in the Employee Center. Managers review and publish plans from the Employee Center.
