# Link knowledge articles or managed documents to an HR catalog item

Link knowledge articles or managed documents to an HR catalog item so that employees can refer to the articles or documents when requesting the service through the HR service catalog.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

For example, an HR catalog item for a beneficiaries inquiry can include links to knowledge articles on who can be named as a beneficiary, the difference between a primary and contingent beneficiary, and so on.

For the link to display on the HR catalog item, make sure the item has a variable that is:

-   **Type** set to **Macro with Label**
-   In the **Type Specifications** related list, with **Widget** set to **HRI Catalog to KB Article Display**

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **HR Services** &gt; **Manage HR Catalog**.

2.  Hover over the HR catalog item that you want to add the knowledge article or managed document to, and click **Manage KB articles**.
