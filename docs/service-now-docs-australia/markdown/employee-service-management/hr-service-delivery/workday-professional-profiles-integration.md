# Integrate Workday professional worker profiles

Bring-in professional worker profile data from Workday into ServiceNow. View professional worker profile details from Workday in ServiceNow HR Service Delivery.

**Note:**

-   Professional worker profiles data is additional to the existing employee profile data. So, make sure you have the employee data available in your ServiceNow instance.
-   You need an active Employee definition to generate employee profiles. For more information, see [Create an active employee definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/generate-profile-definition.md).

The following steps show how the professional worker profile data is imported into ServiceNow:

-   Activating and running the schedule flow **Run Workday Integration Flow** which contains the professional worker profile flow. For more information, see [Activating schedule flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/activate-w-schedule-flow.md).
-   Selecting the **Professional worker profile** check box that activates the **Get Professional Worker Profile** subflow.
-   Activating **Get Professional Worker Profile Service**.
-   Initiates the **Look up Professional Profiles Stream** action.
-   Pulling data into the staging tables, and transform maps move data into target tables. For more information, see [Use transform maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/transform-maps-w.md).
-   Controlling access to the HR profile table with six Restricted caller access privileges \(RCAs\).
