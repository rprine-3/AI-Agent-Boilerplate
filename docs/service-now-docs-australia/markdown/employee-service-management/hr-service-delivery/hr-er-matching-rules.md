# Employee Relations matching rules

Because ER cases do not use a subject person, matching rules try to find an agent with the required skills and in the same country where the case was opened to determine case assignment.

Matching rules look for:

-   Country the ER case was opened in.
-   If no country is available, find any involved parties with a type of complainant and use their country.
-   If there are no involved parties with type of complainant, look for involved parties with type of subject of allegation and use their country.
-   If there are no involved parties with a country that can be used, then only skills are used.

**Note:** For more information, see [Add or modify a matching rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/CreateModMatchingRule.md).

You can restrict an ER case to be assigned to only members of a specific group. See [Configure an employee relations case restriction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-create-case-restriction.md).
