# Interview Management for Employee Relations

Use Interview Management to create templates to capture questions, answers, and notes in a consistent and efficient way, sync scheduling with Microsoft Outlook, and better plan and track your interviews.

## Setting up Interview Templates

Set up HR Service Delivery Interview Templates so your agents can quickly, consistently, and accurately capture appropriate information.

Activate the Interview Templates plugin \(com.sn\_interview\_templates\) for the ServiceNow AI Platform if you have the admin role. For more information, see [Activate Interview Templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-interview-1.md).

-   Create interview question templates.
-   Create interview template tags. Tags help you filter your interview question templates so you can easily browse for relevant questions to use in an interview. For example, agents ask different questions depending on who they are talking to and what the specific allegations are. Template tags help agents to find the appropriate interview template.

|Role|Description|Contains roles|
|----|-----------|--------------|
|Interview questions template admin \[sn\_interview\_temp.admin\]|Can access, read, create, and edit interview question templates, template tags, and Employee Relations properties.|sn\_interview\_temp.reader, sn\_interview\_temp.writer|
|Interview questions template writer \[sn\_interview\_temp.writer\]|Can access, read, create, and edit interview question templates and template tags.|sn\_interview\_temp.reader|
|Interview template reader \[sn\_interview\_temp.reader\]|Can access and read interview question templates and template tags.|N/A|

### System properties

The **sn\_interview\_temp.filter\_attr\_allowed\_tables** system property determines the tables you are allowed to create interview template tags for interview question templates.

When entering multiple tables, separate the table names with a comma \(,\) but with no space between each table.

### Template tags

Template tags are a way to organize your interview templates and a way to filter them when looking for the correct template. Template tags allow you to find relevant questions easier and faster.

From the legacy UI, you can select the **Questions** button to show all interview templates. The template tags appear at the bottom of each interview template displayed.

In the HR Service Delivery Agent Workspace, the template tag appears at the bottom.

There are two types of template tags you can create:

-   Referenced: Uses the fields from the following tables to create reference tags:
    -   Allegation Subtype \[sn\_hr\_er\_allegation\_subtype\]
    -   Allegation Type \[sn\_hr\_er\_allegation\_type\]
    -   HR Service \[sn\_hr\_core\_service\]
-   Custom: You create you own interview template organization. For example:

    -   Customer category = Involved party type
    -   Custom tags:
        -   Complainant
        -   Subject of allegation
        -   Witness
    Involved party type becomes the top-level category in the organization with the tags being a way to organize the type of person you are interviewing.
