# Integrating with the Accurate Background service

The preconfigured Accurate Background integration uses REST services to request background checks through the Accurate Background service. You can use the preconfigured integration as-is or customize it to meet your needs.

**Important:** Integrating with the Accurate Background service is being prepared for deprecation. It will be hidden and unavailable for activation from Zurich, but will continue to be supported till Brazil. If you have an active subscription, you can still activate the plugin by submitting a [plugin activation request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_RequestAPlugin.md). For more details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

## Accurate integration overview

The Accurate integration is configured to request background checks as follows.

-   The HR agent creates a case to request a background check through the Accurate service.
-   The Accurate service evaluates the request to:
    -   Update the case with the background check applicant ID and status.
    -   Send an email to the employee with a link to sign up and complete a background check application through the Accurate website.
-   Once the employee completes the background check application, the Accurate service performs the background check.
-   When the background check is complete, the Accurate service will update the case with the background check status and details.

## Accurate integration setup

To set up the Accurate integration, you must provide the source credentials, verify the integration settings, and add the appropriate background check packages. Once the integration is complete, you can request background checks through the Accurate service.

1.  [Provide source credentials for the Accurate service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-integrations-sources-accurate.md)  
Provide the source and REST credentials for the Accurate service so that it can be accessed for integration.
2.  [Verify integration for the Accurate service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/verify-base-integration-for-accurate.md)  
The integration is configured to push background check data between the HR service in HR Service Delivery and the Accurate service. You can verify the preconfigured settings and determine whether they meet your needs or if further customization is required.
3.  [Add background check packages for the Accurate service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/background-check-package-for-accurate.md)  
Add one or more background check packages to your instance so they can be accessed when a request for a background check by Accurate is made. For example, you can add a package for a background check only and a package for both a background check and drug screening.
