# Configure an employee relations case restriction

Define what groups can view or access employee relations cases using Case Restriction Configuration.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin and sn\_hr\_er.admin

**Warning:** When creating case restrictions, be sure that you have at least one configuration that enables you to read these cases.

## Case restriction configuration

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Relations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Case Restriction Configuration**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_hzl_qtx_zkb"><thead><tr><th>

</table>4.  Click **Save** or **Submit**.

6.  Click **Update**.

    **Note:** Collaborators on an HR or ER case can override COE security. But, ER cases with restrictions override collaborators. For more information, see [Create COE security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-coe-security.md).

    COE security policies are a way to easily restrict access to different COEs via configuration. The underlying COE security policy implementations are [ServiceNow ACLs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control-rules.md).


## What to do next

Case restriction configuration enables the HR confidential group members to restrict a case using the **Restrict** button available on the case. When a case is marked as Restricted only the members in the HR confidential group can view the ER case.
