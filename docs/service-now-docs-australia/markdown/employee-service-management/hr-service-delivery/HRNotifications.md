# HR notifications

Notifications are reminders that are created using email templates and sent out for **Lifecycle Event Activities** and **HR Services**.

HR case writers or Lifecycle Event activity writers can set up reminder notifications on HR tasks and task templates to remind the **Assigned to** person about due dates. Reminder emails are created using email templates. See [Add or modify email content for notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/CreateModEmailTemplate.md).

HR notifications for HR services are recurring and are a one-time for Lifecycle Events.

**Note:** To view other notifications, you can navigate to **System Notification** &gt; **Notifications**.

## Process

-   Create or edit email content. See [Add or modify email content for notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/CreateModEmailTemplate.md).
-   Create or edit an HR task template. See [Configure an HR task template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-task-template.md).
-   Create or edit an HR Service. See [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md).
-   Create or edit an HR service activity. See [Configure a service activity for an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-service-activity-for-hr-service.md). Ensure the HR task template selected has the **Set reminder** box checked.

**Note:** Notifications for HR Services are only sent to the **Assigned to** person for the HR task.

-   **[Add or modify email content for notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/CreateModEmailTemplate.md)**  
Use the **Email Content** form to create notification templates to alert the assigned to of an HR task when a due date is approaching.
