When set to **true**, active employees onboarded in Magnit are pulled to ServiceNow AI Platform instance along with its associated onboarding items. A lifecycle case is created for the each user along with adhoc tasks based on the onboarding items.When set to **false**, new employees onboarded in Magnit \(since the last successful pull\) are synchronized to ServiceNow AI Platform instance.​ Any change in the details of contingent worker in Magnit which are already present in ServiceNow AI Platform is synchronized to the ServiceNow AI Platform via a delta pull. If there are new onboarding items that got associated to the employee after the last pull, new HR tasks are created.

**Note:** If there is an active lifecycle case for a contingent worker, then new onboarding tasks are created within the same lifecycle case. If there is no active lifecycle case associated to the contingent worker, then a new lifecycle case is created for the employee and onboarding tasks are created within it.
