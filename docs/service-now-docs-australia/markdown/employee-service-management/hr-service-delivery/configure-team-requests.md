# Configure team requests

Configure the type of team requests that you want to display on the **Requests opened by your team** widget in Manager Hub.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_mh.admin

This allows managers to be informed of any support requests their team has, that they may want to be aware of, even if no specific approval or task has been assigned to them.

In addition to the sn\_mh.manager\_hub\_user role, the logged in manager must also have the required ACLs or roles to view certain team requests. For example, if there are any open requests related to HR cases, then the logged in manager must also have the sn\_hr\_core.case\_reader role to view those requests.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Manager Hub** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Team Requests Configurations**.

2.  Click **New**.
