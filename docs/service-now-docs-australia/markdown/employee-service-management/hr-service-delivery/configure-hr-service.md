# Configure an HR service

Create or modify an HR service to define the request to fulfillment process for that case type. Examples of HR services include benefits enrollment, direct deposit setup, and background check requests by third-party providers.

## About this task

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **HR Services** &gt; **HR Service Configuration**.

2.  Click **New** or open a record.

    **Note:** The COEs available to you may differ depending on the HR package you have.

    -   The categorization of HR catalog items are employee-facing only, and have no relation to the categorization of HR services under the HR Centers of Excellence \(COEs\) data model.
    -   If you are creating a new HR service and plan to make it available for employee self-service, see . Creating a new HR catalog item automatically creates a corresponding HR service, and you can avoid creating duplicate services.
    -   If you have an existing HR service that you want to make available for employee self-service, do not create an HR catalog item. \(Creating a HR catalog item automatically creates a corresponding HR service.\) Instead, see  to add the existing service as an HR catalog item in the HR service catalog.
    -   The  for HR Case Management is highly configurable for HR agents. It supports the same functionality in the Classic  .

6.  Click **Submit** or **Update**.

    **Note:** If you added a custom column to an HR COE table, you must create a UI policy action \(**Visible** field is set to **False**\) to hide it from other HR services that use that HR COE table. For example, if you add a custom column to the HR Payroll Case \[sn\_hr\_core\_case\_payroll\] table, it appears in all HR services related to this table. The custom column appears even after you add it for a specific HR service. For more information, see UI policies.
