# Response templates for HR Service Delivery

You can use response templates with HR Service Delivery to resolve cases faster and more efficiently.

Response templates \(formerly known as templated snippets\) are reusable messages. You can copy these messages created from these templates to an HR case, task, email, or chat to provide quick and consistent messages to employees. For example, a response template for a payroll discrepancy case enables HR agents to use a standardized message when responding to that case type.

**Note:** For more information on response templates, see [Response templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/response-templates-templated-snippets.md).

## Response template channels

Response templates can correspond to multiple channels. A channel represents the media you want the response template to be available for. For example:

-   Chat channel: Provides response templates for chat conversations.
-   Email channel: Provides response templates for emails.
-   Form: Provides response templates for HR case or tasks.

If you create a new response template and do not assign it to a channel, it is not available to use.

To create a universal response template that is available for all channels, assign it to all channels.

**Note:** Any response templates created prior to the Quebec release are associated with all channels preserving their prior behavior and can be used universally.

## Activation information

The response templates feature automatically activates when Case and Knowledge Management activates. See [Activate response templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/activate-templated-snippets.md).

To use response templates in a chat in Agent Workspace for HR Service Delivery, activate: Advanced Work Assignment for HRSD \(com.sn\_hr\_awa\) plugin.

For more information on setting up chat in Virtual Agent, see [Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent-landing-page.md).

## How to use response templates with form \(HR case or task\)

HR administrators and managers can create response templates. Each template is associated with an HR table that is an extension of the Task \[task\] table. Configure the template to include variables pulled from that table. Also, use a condition builder to specify what a case must meet for the template to be available, such as for a specific HR service.

For more information on creating or modifying a response template, see [Create or modify an HR Service Delivery response template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-templated-snippets.md).

Response templates appear for an HR case form for templates associated with the Form channel and satisfy the conditions on the response template. For the HR case form, the **Responses** button appears at the top. If there are multiple templates available, you can select the appropriate one. See [Work an HR case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_CreateAnHRCase.md).

**Note:** For more information on using a response template with an HR case, see [Copy a response template to an HR case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-templated-snippets.md).

For Agent Workspace for HR Service Delivery, the Response Templates icon \(\[Omitted image "response-template-icon.png"\] Alt text: Response template icon\) appears in the Contextual sidebar. For more information, see [Using Agent Workspace for HR Case Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/agent-workspace-for-hr-case-management/agent-ws-hr-case-mgmt-use.md).

## Components installed with response templates

Several types of components are installed with activation of the Templated Responses \(com.sn\_templated\_snip\) plugin, including tables and user roles.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this feature.

### Roles installed

By default, the following HR roles contain the following response template roles.

**Note:** The Templated Responses \[com.sn\_templated\_snip\] plugin activates the sn\_templated\_snip.min\_admin\_count system property \[sys\_properties.list\]. This property prevents you from deleting your only Response Template admin user by requiring a minimum number \(default is two\) of active users with this role.

## Create or modify an HR Service Delivery response template

Create or modify a response template \(formerly known as a templated snippet\) to define a reusable message. You can copy these messages when responding to employees to provide quick and consistent messages.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.manager, sn\_templated\_snip.template\_snippet\_admin

Each template is associated with an HR table that is an extension of the Task \[task\] table. The template can be configured to include variables pulled from that table. For example, if you choose the HR Case \(sn\_hr\_core\_case\) table, you can select the Subject person variable to appear in the Template body and it will replace the variable with the actual name of the subject person when the response template is used.

Also, use condition builder to define when a case meets the criteria for a template, such as for a specific HR service.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **HR Administration** &gt; **Response template configuration**.

2.  Select **New** to create a response template.

    Or, select an existing response template to modify from the list.
