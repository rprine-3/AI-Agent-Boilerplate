# Employee Relations case restrictions

Use Case Restriction Configuration to determine what groups and agents can access or restrict ER cases.

## Groups

Restrict access by Center of Excellence \(COE\) for specific groups:

-   Define what groups can restrict ER cases.
-   Define what groups can view ER cases.

The base system provides one case restriction configuration that enables the HR Confidential group to access ER cases.

For more information, see [Manage HR Groups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_ManageHRGroups.md).

**Note:** When creating case restrictions, be sure that you have at least one configuration that enables you to read these cases.

## Roles

Members of groups that can access ER cases must have the sn\_hr\_er.confidential role.

For more information, see [Manage HR roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/c_ManageRoles.md) and [Evidence Management for Employee Relations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-evidence-mgmt.md).

## COE Security Configuration

Use COE Security Configuration to define group restrictions for a COE and for all or specific HR services under it.

You can then restrict the COE with read and write capabilities.

**Note:** If you choose to restrict other COEs besides Employee Relations Case \[sn\_hr\_er\_case\], you can cause performance issues. ER cases numbering more than 100 K can impact performance.

For more information, see [Create a COE security policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-create-coe-security-policy.md).

COE security policies are a way to easily restrict access to different COEs via configuration. The underlying COE security policy implementations are [ServiceNow ACLs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control-rules.md).

Collaborators and the COE for the HR case can conflict. The basic rules are:

-   For all HR cases, collaborators override any security on a COE.
-   Employee Relations \(ER\) cases can override collaborators when restrictions apply.

## ER assignment rules

Use ER assignment rules to assign a group to an ER case.

For more information, see [Employee Relations assignment rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-assign-rules.md).

## ER matching rules

Use ER matching rules to assign an agent that has the least number of cases, the required skills, and matches the location.

For more information, see [Employee Relations matching rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-matching-rules.md).
