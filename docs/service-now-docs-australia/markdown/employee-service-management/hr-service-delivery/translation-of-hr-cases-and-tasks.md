### Before you begin

Make sure to activate the languages that you want to support translations for.

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **HR Services** &gt; **HR Templates**.

2.  Click **New** or open a record.

3.  Fill in the fields on the form, as appropriate.

    -   [Configure an HR task template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-task-template.md)
4.  To enable translations, make sure that the **Use global descriptions for translations** field is selected.

    When selected, the **Global short description** and **Global description** fields display.

5.  Provide the global short description and description for each of your activated languages.

    **Note:** Make sure to provide global descriptions for each supported language. You cannot select the **Use global descriptions for translations** option within a single HR template for some languages and not others.

    1.  Go to **System Systems** &gt; **General**, and select the language that you want to provide translations for.

        For example, you can set the language to Spanish.

    2.  On the HR template form, provide the global short description and description in the selected language.

        For example, you can provide the global short description and description for dental benefits in Spanish.

    3.  Repeat the process for each language you are supporting.

        For example, if English, Spanish, and Korean are activated on your instance, then make sure to provide global translations for each of those languages in the HR template.

6.  Click **Submit** or **Update**.

7.  If you are configuring an HR case template, then you can also update the corresponding HR service to use case headers that support the use of global descriptions.

    1.  Navigate to **HR Administration** &gt; **HR Services** &gt; **HR Service Configuration**.

    2.  Open the corresponding HR service record.

    3.  Update the following fields:

        |Field|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |Opened for / Approver view|Opened for/approver case header configuration using global descriptions|
        |Subject person / Task assignee view|Subject person/task assigned to case header configuration using global descriptions|

    4.  Click **Update**.
