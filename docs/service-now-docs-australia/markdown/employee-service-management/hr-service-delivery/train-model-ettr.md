# Estimated time to resolve HR cases

Determine the Estimated Time to Resolve a Case \(ETTR\) for a case by analyzing similar closed cases in the past for better visibility and transparency.

**Note:** Support for creating new regression solutions was deprecated in the Washington DC release. You can train and edit any existing solutions, but you can't initiate new ones. The following information is provided for legacy context. For more information see [Create and train a regression solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-regression-solution.md).

Machine learning predicts the estimated time to resolve a case \(ETTR\) based on attributes of a case such as its short description, category, priority, and so on. For more information about configuring the machine learning regression solution definition for ETTR, see [HR PIWB template: Recommend estimated time to resolve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-piwb-ettr.md)

To make predictions, you can use the existing ETTR solution definition or change some of the default settings such as the fields, a filter, and the training frequency.

By analyzing the resolution time for similar closed cases in the past, the ETTR capability offers the following benefits:

-   Gives employees better transparency and set expectations on resolution time for their cases.
-   Helps agents in prioritization of work and measure performance.
-   Provides data that can help managers with insights into SLA management and estimated time to resolve for cases.

## ETTR for HR Cases

On configuring Estimated HR Case Resolution Time \(ml\_sn\_sn\_hr\_core\_global\_hr\_case\_resolution\_time\) and training the predictive model, you can see the **HR Case Resolution Time** option. See the **Estimated time to resolve** value from:

-   Employee portal view and Now Mobile view
-   Agent workspace
-   Platform view with a list of cases
-   Case configuration view for admins

For more information, see [Viewing ETTR predictions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/create-regression-solution-hr.md)

## ETTR predictive model

The Estimated HR Case Resolution Time \(ml\_sn\_sn\_hr\_core\_global\_hr\_case\_resolution\_time\) is configured and the predictive model is auto trained when all the following conditions are met:

-   The Human Resources Scoped App: Core \(com.sn\_hr\_core\) plugin is installed.
-   The Predictive Intelligence for Contextual Search \(com.snc.contextual\_search\_ml\) plugin is installed.
-   The **glide.platform\_ml.auto\_training.enabled** system property is set to true.

Business rules and system properties

Verify the following system properties and business rules:

-   Use or configure the following system properties and corresponding values to display the ETTR values per your requirement:
    -   **ml\_sn\_sn\_hr\_core.COE\_ETTR\_display\_agent**
    -   **ml\_sn\_sn\_hr\_core.COE\_ETTR\_display\_employee**
    -   **ml\_sn\_sn\_hr\_core.estimated\_resolution\_time\_confidence\_level**
-   Use or configure the **Predict Estimated Resolution Time** business rule per your business needs.

## ETTR model

Regression solutions such as ETTR enable you to predict a point estimate and prediction interval. This capability informs the agent, employee, and service owners on the estimated resolution time for a case based on the time taken to resolve similar issues historically.

-   **Actual resolution time**: Stores the actual time of resolution of a particular case. This field stores the resolution time from opening to closing of the case.

    **Note:** When you upgrade, run this **Populate Actual Resolution Time** schedule job once for populating the actual resolution time for existing HR cases. For all upcoming cases, the business rule **Populate Actual Resolution Time** automatically generates the resolution time.

-   **Max ETTR**: Indicates the maximum estimated resolution time in days for case completion. Estimate is based on the time taken for resolving similar HR cases.
-   **Min ETTR**: Indicates the minimum estimated resolution time in days for case completion. Estimate is based on the time taken for resolving similar HR cases.
-   **ETTR in days**: Stores the point estimated resolution time in days for case completion.
