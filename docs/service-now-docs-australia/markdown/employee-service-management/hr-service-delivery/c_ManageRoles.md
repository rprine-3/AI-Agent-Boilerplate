# Manage HR roles

Roles control access to features and capabilities in modules in the HR application.

The HR Service Delivery Scoped app can help prevent users outside of the HR organization from accessing HR data.

Scoped roles for both HR case workers and HR clients \(employees, contractors, alumni, and others\) grant access to HR services. Users without an HR scoped role typically cannot view HR cases or HR profile information. For information on all the roles installed with Case and Knowledge Management plugin, see [Components installed with Case and Knowledge Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/components-installed-with-case-and-knowledge-management.md).

Only the HR Administrator \[sn\_hr\_core.admin\] can assign scoped HR roles.

To configure your system, you must log in as a System Administrator \[admin\]. The HR Administrator \[sn\_hr\_core.admin\] role is contained in the System Administrator \[admin\] role. The combination of these two roles allows a user to perform all tasks associated with configuring your system.

After system configuration, ensure that only the HR Administrator \[sn\_hr\_core.admin\] role has access to sensitive information. Remove the HR Administrator role from System Administrator \[admin\] role to help prevent the System Administrator from viewing sensitive HR information via forms, lists and UI.

After granting access to a role, all the groups or users assigned to the role also have access. Roles can contain other roles, and grants access to any role that contains it.

**Note:** IT System Administrators \(admin\) can still impersonate ServiceNow users. When impersonating a user with an HR scope-protected role, an admin cannot access features granted by that role unless the admin already possesses those HR scope-protected roles. For more information on impersonating a user, see [Impersonate a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ImpersonateAUser.md).

## HR Performance Analytics

To configure the Performance Analytics \(PA\) dashboard, assign the Performance Analytics Administrator \[pa\_admin\] role to the HR Administrator \[sn\_hr\_core.admin\] role.

**Note:** Only the System Administrator \[admin\] can assign PA roles to employees.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>After system configuration, to help prevent the System Administrator from accessing sensitive information:

-   Remove the HR Administrator \[sn\_hr\_core.admin\] role from System Administrator \[admin\].
    -   The base system requires a user with the System Administrator role to run scheduled jobs. For details on HR scheduled jobs, see [Components installed with Case and Knowledge Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/components-installed-with-case-and-knowledge-management.md).
    -   To ensure the scheduled jobs run, change the user in the **Run as** field for each scheduled job to a user that has the HR admin role.

        **Note:** Changing the user allows the scheduled jobs to run, but only a user with the System Admin role can view and run a scheduled job on demand.

    -   Change the scope of the application to Human Resources: Core application. For information on changing the scope, see [Contextual development edit messages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_WarningMessages.md).
    -   Reveal the **Run as** field. For information on revealing hidden fields on a form, see [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md).
-   Log out and log back in to ensure that the changes take effect.

    **Note:** Ensure that you have completed setup before removing the HR Administrator role.

    -   **Minimum number of scoped admins required**

        System properties determine the minimum number \(default is two\) of scoped admins that must be active for an application.

        To list the properties, enter `sys_properties.list` in the filter navigator and search for the property to configure.

        The list of system properties and what scoped admin can access:
