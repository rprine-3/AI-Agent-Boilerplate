# HR Service Delivery integration with Service Portfolio Management and Digital Portfolio Management

HR Service Delivery integration with Service Portfolio Management and Digital Portfolio Management enables you to manage HR services in a standardized, structured format as suggested in the Common Service Data Model \(CSDM\) methodology. It ensures that the hierarchy in which you define services is consistent with the hierarchy of other business units.

## Integration with Service Portfolio Management and Digital Portfolio Management Overview

Larger enterprise customers on their journey to embrace the vision of Enterprise Service Management face the problem of different work flows following different data models and hierarchy which makes it difficult to provide a uniform view of all services. These customers require a common interface, a single place for monitoring metrics, viewing services, and getting similar information across the work flows. With this integration:

-   HR Services are mapped within the hierarchy of CSDM, providing a consistent way for the service owners to define appropriate business services.
