# Users for HR Service Delivery Integration with Cornerstone OnDemand

Users from the Cornerstone OnDemand system are mapped to the users in ServiceNow system using email Ids. User mapping helps in assigning learning tasks to the correct user in the ServiceNow system.

When the Trigger CSOD Sync schedule flow is run, users are pulled from the Cornerstone OnDemand system to the User Mapping Staging \[sn\_hr\_cornerstone\_user\_mapping\_staging\] table. Once the transformation scripts are run, mapped users are displayed in **HR Cornerstone Integrations** &gt; **Users**.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|CSOD ID|CSOD ID from Cornerstone OnDemand system.|
|Active|Option that indicates whether or not the user is active in the Cornerstone OnDemand system.|
|User|Name of the user in the ServiceNow system.|
|CSOD User|Name of the user in the Cornerstone OnDemand system.|
|CSOD User ID|ID of the user in the Cornerstone OnDemand system.|
|CSOD Email|Email ID of the user in the Cornerstone OnDemand system.|

**Note:** In case you want to use **CSOD ID**, **CSOD user**, and **CSOD User ID** fields for mapping users, you must override the getUser method in CSODIntegrationsUtil script.
