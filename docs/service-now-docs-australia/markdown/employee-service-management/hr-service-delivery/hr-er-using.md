-   After case creation, add:
    -   Involved Parties
    -   Allegations
    -   Interviews
    -   Evidence
    -   Corrective Actions
    -   Accommodations

## COE and HR service

HR Service Delivery supports the Employee Relations Case COE.

And it supports the following HR services: Report Misconduct and Accommodation Request.

## Opened for is not an employee

When creating HR cases, you must identify an Opened for person. For ER cases, you are not required to identify the Opened for person.

If you are an HR agent and using the HR case form or Agent Workspace, select **Skip verification** from the Case Creation Search for Employee form
