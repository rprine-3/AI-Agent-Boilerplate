# Create a COE security policy

Use **COE Security Configuration** to define group restrictions for a COE and for all or specific HR services under it.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_hr\_er.admin

Certain users will be able to access a COE even it is restricted. For example, Opened for, Opened by, Watch List and Collaborators get access to a restricted COE irrespective of its security policies.

COE security policies are a way to easily restrict access to different COEs via configuration. The underlying COE security policy implementations are [ServiceNow ACLs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control-rules.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **COE Security Configuration**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
