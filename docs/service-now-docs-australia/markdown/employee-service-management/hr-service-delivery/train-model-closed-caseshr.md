# Discovering similar closed cases for HR cases

Help an HR agent resolve the current case by displaying similar closed cases.

## Similar Closed HR Cases

When the Similar Closed HR Cases \(ml\_sn\_sn\_hr\_core\_global\_similar\_closed\_hr\_cases\) is configured and the predictive model is trained, the **Similar Closed HR cases** option is displayed on an HR case. This option displays the most relevant HR closed cases to an HR agent to help resolve the current HR case.

## Auto training the predictive model

The Similar Closed HR Cases \(ml\_sn\_sn\_hr\_core\_global\_similar\_closed\_hr\_cases\) is configured and the predictive model is auto trained when all the following conditions are met:

-   The Human Resources Scoped App: Core \(com.sn\_hr\_core\) plugin is installed.
-   The Predictive Intelligence for Contextual Search \(com.snc.contextual\_search\_ml\) plugin is installed.
-   The **glide.platform\_ml.auto\_training.enabled** system property is set either set to true or absent.
