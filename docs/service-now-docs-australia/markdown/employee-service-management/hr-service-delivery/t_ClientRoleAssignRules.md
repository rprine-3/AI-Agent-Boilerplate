# Client role assignment rules

Use Client Role Assignment Rules to automatically assign or reassign a role to an employee.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

A condition or set of multiple condition clauses based on the HR profile \[sn\_hr\_core\_profile\] table are used to automate assigning roles.

**Note:** Client role assignment rules are for access to the Employee Center only.

For example:

-   A newly hired employee can be automatically assigned the new hire \[sn\_hr\_core.hrsm\_new\_hire\] role. This role provides limited access to the Employee Center or service portal.
-   The Update Client Roles scheduled job runs and acknowledges the employee start date for the new hire has not been reached.
-   The Assign HR Roles business rule assigns the new hire role based on the conditions set on the client role assignment rules.

To map conditions to a client role:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Manage Roles** &gt; **Client Role Assignment Rules**.

2.  Click **New** to create a client role rule or click an existing client role rule to edit.

3.  **Active** is enabled by default.

4.  From **Condition**, click the **Lookup using list** and select an existing HR condition.
