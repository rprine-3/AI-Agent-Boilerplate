# Create COE security

Place security on a COE to prevent a group from accessing another group's cases.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin, sn\_hr\_le.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **COE Security Configuration**.

2.  Select the COE \(table that extends the HR case table\) you want specified groups to have access to.

3.  Perform one of the following steps:

    -   Select **Applies to all child COEs** if you want to apply the security policy to the child COEs.
    -   Select **Applies to all services** if you want all HR services under the selected COE to be included in the security policy.
    -   If you want to include specific HR services, leave **Applies to all services** unchecked. The **Services** field will appear for you to make selections.
4.  Verify that the **Application** field displays the scope correctly.

    For more information, see [System settings for the user interface \(UI\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/r_UI16BannerFrame.md).

5.  Check **Active** to enable security on the COE.

6.  From the **Type** field, select how the policy you are defining controls security for the COE.

    Your choices are:

    -   Read
    -   Write
    -   Case Restriction
    **Note:** The Case Restriction option is only displayed when Employee Relations is installed.

    Selecting Case Restriction displays the following fields:

    -   Able to restrict cases: Users that belong to the associated group can restrict cases under the COE.
    -   Able to view restrict cases: Users that belong to the associated group can view restricted cases.
7.  Applies When: Select the filter condition \(if configured\) the security policy must pass for the COE to be in effect.

    **Warning:** Selecting the filter condition might impact the security policy and affect all cases under a COE, including the non-active cases. Be sure you understand the full impact of the condition.

8.  In the Groups section, select **Insert a new row** to associate groups to the COE security policy.

    For more information on Groups, see [Manage HR Groups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_ManageHRGroups.md).

9.  Select **Save** to remain on the security policy you are working on or **Submit** to return to the list of COE Security Policies.
