</table>4.  In the **What it will contain**, **Accessibility**, and **Generated Record Data** related lists, fill in the fields as appropriate.

    You can provide a short description and description, configure a script, add images, define a template, and more.

5.  In the **Variables** related list, configure the variables for the HR catalog item as appropriate.

    Variables collect information from the user, and are used to ask questions and map answers to fields. You can add as many variables as you need to the HR catalog item. Commonly used variables types include:

    -   Checkbox
    -   Multiple Choice
    -   Reference
    -   Select Box
    -   Single Line Text
    To learn more about the different types of variables and how to configure them, see [Types of service catalog variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_VariableTypes.md).

6.  In the **Available For** and **Not Available For** related lists, configure the user criteria to apply to the HR catalog item as appropriate.

    User criteria controls which employees can access and request the HR catalog item in the HR service catalog. To learn more about user criteria and how they are used to control access to HR catalog items, see [Set security for items and categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_ServiceCatalogAccessControls.md).

    **Note:** User criteria applied to the HR catalog item is employee-facing only, and has no relation to the HR criteria that is used to control what HR services an HR agent can request for an employee from the **Create New Case** module. See [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md) for more information.
