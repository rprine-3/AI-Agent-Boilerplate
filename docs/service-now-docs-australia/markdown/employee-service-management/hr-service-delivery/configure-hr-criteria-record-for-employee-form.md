# Create an HR criteria record for an employee form

## About this task

Answers from the employee form are stored in the Metric Results \[asmt\_metric\_result\] table. You can query the answers using HR criteria. For example, if on an invention disclosure form, the new hire answers yes, then you can use that answer to trigger the creation of another task to collect details on the invention.

## What to do next

Depending on the case type, the HR criteria record will use the following survey instance:

-   If you are using the HR criteria record with any other HR case, it will use the latest survey instance.
