# Remove HR Administrator role from IT System Administrators

## Procedure

1.  Log in as admin.

2.  From **User Administration**, go to **Roles** \(left navigation menu\).

3.  Click **admin**.

4.  From the **Contains Roles** tab, click **Edit**.

5.  From the **Contains Roles List** column, highlight and move **sn\_hr\_core.admin** to the **Collection** column.

    **Note:** Also, remove other scoped HR Admin roles, such as sn\_hr\_le.admin.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Log out.
