# HR Integrations

Integrate HR Service Delivery with HR management systems to synchronize employee profiles, to-dos, and other data; background check systems to request background checks.

For select systems, preconfigured integrations are available to use. You can also configure your own custom integration with third-party systems that use SOAP or REST services.

**Important:** Workday integration and SuccessFactors integration that were available with the HR Integrations \[com.sn\_hr\_integrations\] plugin have been deprecated. For Workday integration, you can use the [HR Service Delivery Integration with Workday](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/w-integration.md) application, and for SuccessFactors integration, you can use the [HR Service Delivery Integration with SuccessFactors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-service-delivery-integration-success-factors.md) application.
