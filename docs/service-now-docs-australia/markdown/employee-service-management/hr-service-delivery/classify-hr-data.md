    In the Table search field, type `sn_hr_core` or in the Package search field, type `human resources`.

3.  Select each of the records that you want to assign to a specific data classification.

4.  After selecting the elements, click **Actions on selected rows** &gt; **Classify**.

5.  In the Assign to data class dialog, select the data classifications you want to assign to your selected dictionary elements, then click **Classify**.
