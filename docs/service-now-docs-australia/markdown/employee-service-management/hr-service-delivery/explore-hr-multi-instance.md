# Explore HR Multi Instance Integration

Learn about the benefits and key offerings of the HR Multi Instance Integration application.

## HR Multi Instance Integration overview

Partners and service providers for HR service fulfillment often are running their own instance of HR Service Delivery. HR Multi Instance Integration provides inter-instance communication and uniform HR service experiences \(for remote HR services and local HR services\) with fulfillment in different instances through the following capabilities:

-   Ability to control your organization employee’s experience according to your organization's culture, branding, and policies.
-   Ability to outsource services.
-   Consistent user experience for employees across the entire HR catalog, regardless of whether they are interacting locally or remotely from any third-party provider.
-   Because HR workflows or business process are not restricted to a single instance, they can flow seamlessly across instances. Ability to fulfill a case partially by providers and partially by consumers.
-   Uniformity and standardization for HR agents on the provider instance enables them to work on local cases or remote HR cases from the provider’s ServiceNow AI Platform instance with a minimal learning curve.
-   Managing and controlling access at the remote catalog level to meet security and compliance requirements at both the provider and consumer instances.
-   Synchronization of relevant information such as submitted request \(provider task\) status, comments, and attachments by service providers.
-   Use Universal Task as the remote tasking medium in consumer instance.
-   Ability to create HR tasks and approval tasks for remote cases.
-   Initiate document signing tasks for remote users via universal tasks.

**Note:** HR Multi Instance Integration is dependent on the following plugins:
