# Add or modify HR survey categories and questions

When an HR survey definition is created, a survey category is automatically added. You can create questions that are associated with this category or define another category for questions.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, hr\_admin, or hr\_manager

## About this task

For example, the HR Request Satisfaction Survey has one category, with four questions about satisfaction with the HR request process. You can define another category to ask about satisfaction with the HR agent who handled the case, or you can add more questions to the existing category.

The following steps describe how to work with survey questions in the Survey Definition form. You can also click **Survey Designer** to open the survey and its questions in the survey designer.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Surveys** &gt; **HR Surveys**, and open the survey to add questions.

2.  In the **Metrics Categories** related list, complete one of the following actions.

    |To|Do this|
    |---|-------|
    |**Add or edit questions in an existing category**|Click the category name.|
    |**Add a category and questions**|Click **New**. Enter the category name and description, right-click the form header, and click **Save**.|

    The Survey Category form that appears includes the **Assessment Metrics** related list, which contains any questions that are already defined.

3.  To edit a question, complete the following steps.

    1.  Click the question text and edit the fields on the form.

    2.  Click **Update**.

    3.  If required by the question type, add definitions in the **Assessment Metric Definitions** related list.

        For example, Likert and numeric scale data types require the scale metric definitions.

4.  To add a question, complete the following steps.

    1.  Click **New** and complete the form.

    2.  Right-click the header and click **Save**.

        Additional fields appear based on the selected data type. For example, if you select **Choice**, you must enter the scale definition.

    3.  If applicable, add definitions in the **Assessment Metric Definitions** related list.

        For example, the Choice data type requires that you enter the choices.

5.  Click **Update**.

    The Survey Definition reopens.
