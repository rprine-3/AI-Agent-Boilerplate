# Activate the Anonymous Report Center

You can activate the Anonymous Report Center plugin \(com.sn\_anonymous\_report\_center\) for the ServiceNow AI Platform if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

If the Human Resources Scoped App: Core \(com.sn\_hr\_core\) plugin is activated, the Employee Center is also included. On-demand delegations can be performed with the Employee Center or the ServiceNow® mobile.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Anonymous Report Center plugin \(com.sn\_anonymous\_report\_center\)using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed.
