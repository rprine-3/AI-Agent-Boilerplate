Use global descriptions for translations

</td><td>

Option to enable the use of global descriptions for translations. If selected, you can provide the short description and description for the HR case template in one or more languages. See [Translations for HR cases and tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/translation-of-hr-cases-and-tasks.md) for more information.You can use dynamic variables to personalize your short and global descriptions.

 Using dynamic variables in an HR task template works in:

-   HR tasks related to HR cases in the legacy UI or HR Service Delivery Agent Workspace
-   Employee Center Pro To-dos form
-   Lifecycle Events ticket form
**Note:** Because some dynamic variables might provide personal information, use the sn\_hr\_core.task\_template\_variable\_ignore system property to ensure privacy. For example, social security number \(ssn\) is excluded by default. You can add other variables to this system property to disable them but ensure they are comma separated with no spaces between each variable.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Add field

</td><td>

Fields to automatically populate on the HR case form when a request for that HR service is made. Select one or more fields from the **Add field** list and provide the desired values. For example, you can add the **State** field to set a default case state or add the **PDF Template** field to select a document for cases that require a document acknowledgement or signature.Any changes that you make to the template fields or values will take precedence over the original template values in the fields.

 **Note:** Select the Document Template option to associate a document template \(of Document Templates \[com.snc.document\_templates\] plugin\) with an HR service.
