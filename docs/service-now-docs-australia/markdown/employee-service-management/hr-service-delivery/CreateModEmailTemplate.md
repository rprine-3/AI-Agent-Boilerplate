# Add or modify email content for notifications

Use the **Email Content** form to create notification templates to alert the assigned to of an HR task when a due date is approaching.

## Before you begin

Roles required: sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer, sn\_hr\_le.activity\_writer

You must have the HR Case Writer \[sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer\] or Lifecycle Event Activity Writer \[sn\_hr\_le.activity\_writer\] role to select an **Email Content** template. For Lifecycle Events, you must have the Lifecycle Event Activity Writer \[sn\_hr\_le.activity\_writer\] role to create or edit an HR task template for Lifecycle Events.

When setting up notifications, an email template must be created. The base system provides an email template that can be used as a model.

Email notifications can be sent for HR tasks with due dates and can be configured:

-   To be sent relative to the due date.
-   To be sent at intervals until the task is completed or skipped.
-   With customized content.
