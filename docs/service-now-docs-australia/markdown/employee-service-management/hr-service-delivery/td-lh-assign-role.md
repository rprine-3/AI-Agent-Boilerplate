# Assign a leader or supporter role to a user record

Provide organizational leaders and supporters with access to Leader Hub by assigning the required roles to their user record.

## Before you begin

You must create an active employee definition to generate employee profiles. For more information about this process, refer to [Create an active employee definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/generate-profile-definition.md).

You must enable the new employee details and design. For more information, see [Opt in to the employee profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/profile-opt-in.md).

You must provide employees of your organization with a license to enable access to Leader Hub. For more information about employee licensing, refer to [License Talent Development Core users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/talent-development-core/egd-employee-profile-licensing.md).

Define eligible users to show up in the org chart. For more information, see [Organization chart in Employee Center Pro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-experience-foundation/employee-profile-org-chart.md). Select **Employee Profile** in the **Table** field.

Role required: sn\_egd\_lh.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Users**.

    The Users \[sys\_user\] table appears.

2.  Select a record in the list associated with an employee who is an organizational leader or supporter.

    The form for a user record appears.

3.  On the **Roles** tab, select **Edit**.

4.  Enter `sn_egd` in the **Collection** field.

    A list of roles beginning with "sn\_egd" appears.

5.  Double-click the role that corresponds to the employee's occupation in your organization.

    |Role|Occupation|
    |----|----------|
    |**sn\_egd\_lh.leader**|Organizational leader|
    |**sn\_egd\_lh.supporter**|Organizational supporter|

    The role appears in the Roles List.

6.  Select **Save**.
