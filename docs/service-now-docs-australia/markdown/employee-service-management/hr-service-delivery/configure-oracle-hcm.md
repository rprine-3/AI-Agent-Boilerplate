# Configuring HR Service Delivery integration with Oracle Cloud HCM

Set up Oracle HCM for HR Service Delivery to pull worker data from Oracle HCM into a ServiceNow instance. View worker profiles from Oracle HCM Cloud in ServiceNow HR Service Delivery.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: None
-   Activate HR Service Delivery integration with Oracle Cloud HCM that automatically activates Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework and Oracle HCM Cloud spoke.

    **Note:** If you are upgrading from HR Service Delivery integration with Oracle Cloud HCM V 1.0.1 to a later version, follow the instructions in this [KB article](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0997699).


## Procedure

1.  Install update sets.

2.  Allow RCAs manually in the Utah release.

    This step is not required if you have already upgraded to Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework 3.3.8 version.

    Allow the Restricted Caller Access records with Status = **Requested** and Source Scope = **Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework**.
