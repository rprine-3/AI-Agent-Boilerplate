# Work an HR case

After initial creation of an HR case, the next steps are to change the state, provide additional information, and ensure that any outstanding tasks are completed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer

HR case creation and completion require different information depending on the Center of Excellence \(COE\) and HR service selected. The HR service an employee is requesting determines the type of HR case.

## Procedure

1.  After employee verification, click **Create Case**.

    The following fields appear:

<table id="table_udl_fb4_sbb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

An HR case number is assigned and is a unique identifier, cannot be changed, and has an HRC prefix.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent

</td><td>

Populates the parent case when the displayed case is a child.For example, a **Request onboarding** case has multiple child cases and tasks under it.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Skills

</td><td>

The required skills of the person assigned to this category of HR case. Skills can auto-populate based on the HR case template associated with the HR service.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Company

</td><td>

Company account to which the remote case is associated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Remote case

</td><td>

Option indicating that the HR case is created due to a provider task from a consumer instance.**Note:** This option appears only when the HR Multi Instance Integration for Provider \(sn\_hr\_mii\_provider\) plugin is installed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

The state of the case. The state can auto-populate based on the HR case or task template associated with the HR service.-   Draft: The default state for a case when it is first opened.

**Note:** Can only be changed to Ready, Closed Complete, Closed Incomplete, Cancelled, or Suspended.

-   Ready: The case is ready to be worked on.
-   Awaiting Approval: Requires approval before it can move to the next state.

**Note:** Can only be changed to Ready, Closed Complete, Closed Incomplete, Cancelled, or Suspended.

-   Work in Progress: The case is assigned and being worked on.
-   Closed Complete
-   Closed Incomplete
-   Cancelled
-   Awaiting Acceptance: The **Opened for** person must accept the HR case before it can proceed. For example, a **Request for Onboarding** case was opened for a hiring manager. The hiring manager must accept the case before it can move to the next state.
-   Suspended: Use to temporarily prevent violation of a service level agreement \(SLA\). Refer to [Suspend and resume an HR case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_SuspendAndResumeAnHRCase.md).

**Note:** The **State** cannot be edited in List view.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Priority

</td><td>

The precedence of the case, based on the **HR service**. The priority automatically overrides the template and changes to **2 - High** for users flagged as VIP. Configured in HR Properties \(sys\_property\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source

</td><td>

From where the case originated. Sources are:-   Not selected
-   Self Service
-   Phone
-   Chat / Connect / Live Feed
-   In Person
-   Email
-   Other
-   Virtual Agent

**Note:** Cases created through email or self-service are automatically moved to **Ready** state and assigned to a group or user.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Opened by

</td><td>

The user who created the case.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

The group the record is assigned to. If the group is not set automatically, assign an HR group to provide a selection of HR users in the **Assigned to** field. Assignment groups are restricted to those groups with a type of human\_resources.To change the **Assignment group**, the **Assigned to** agent must be a member of the new group and the **State** must be **Ready**.

 **Note:** To automatically assign a group to an HR case, see [Assignment and matching rules in HR]() and [Configure an HR case template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-case-template.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assigned to

</td><td>

The user assigned to work on this case. When a group is automatically assigned, a user from the group is automatically assigned when the case is created. If the user is not auto-assigned, click the **Lookup using list** icon to select a user who is a member of the selected assignment group.To change the **Assigned to** HR agent, the agent must be a member of the **Assignment group** and the **State** must be **Ready**.

 If **Assigned to** is left blank, some features are not available from the Employee Center ticket page. For example, the **Ask a Question** link to chat directly about an HR case cannot assign an agent. Comments or work notes do not appear on a case until an agent is assigned.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Collaborators

</td><td>

Add collaborators or other HR agents to the case.Only HR agents can be added as collaborators. This action permits the original agent to still track the case. Or, an HR agent can add another HR agent as a collaborator to request help. Adding a collaborator populates the case on the collaborations list.

 Other factors related to adding collaborators:

 -   Collaborators can remove themselves from the case. To remove yourself, highlight your name in the **Collaborators** list and click the **X**.
-   Collaborators are not required to be part of the assignment group.
-   Assigned to person can add or remove collaborators.
-   Collaborators cannot add or remove collaborators.
-   Notifications are sent to collaborators when added to the HR case.
 Adding collaborators can alleviate the amount of emails requesting help on an HR case by consolidating communication.

 Collaborators and the COE for the HR case can conflict. The basic rules are:

-   For all HR cases, collaborators override any security on a COE. For more information, see [Create COE security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-coe-security.md).
-   Employee Relations \(ER\) cases can override collaborators when restrictions apply. For more information, see [Configure an employee relations case restriction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-create-case-restriction.md).
 **Note:** Agents must have the ER case writer \[sn\_hr\_er.case\_writer\] role in order to be a collaborator.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Case support team

Employees assigned to answer questions about onboarding a new hire. Only appears for Lifecycle Events cases.You can add users or define a group that can support the **Subject person** for a Lifecycle Event case. The **Subject person** can communicate with the case support team while the case progresses.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Watch list

</td><td>

The list of users who receive notifications regarding this case. Anyone in the company can be added to the **Watch list**. For example, an employee requests a travel visa. Add the manager of the employee to ensure that updates are communicated.
