Role required: sn\_doc.admin and Delegated developer

## About this task

\[Omitted video\] Description: Configure an HTML document template

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Document Templates** &gt; **All Document Templates**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select **HTML Document Template**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_dvm_fm3_zhb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the document template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table associated with the type of template. The table determines the available variables that can be used.**Note:** Tables appear based on the application scope that is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Document category in which the template is added.

</td></tr><tr><td>

User criteria

</td><td>

Audience criteria for this document. For example, you can create a letter intended for only Canadian employees.**Note:** When defining conditions like case sensitivity or null values, see API [GlideFilter - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideFilterScopedAPI.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Body

</td><td>

Text in the template.To insert variables, place your cursor in the desired location and select the variable. Available variables are listed under **Fields**.

Document template styles are applied to regular text fields, and not for rich description fields. A rich description field preserves its own HTML formatting and style and is not overridden by the document template formatting and style.

Use the formatting tools in the **Body** to apply formatting options, such as bold, italic, underline, font styling. The body is a place holder for HTML text and tokenized variables.

 **Note:**

-   Jelly and CSS Styling are not supported.
-   You can also use [Document template scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/document-template-scripts.md) to dynamically change the text in the HTML body.
**Note:** When the **Sanitize** option is enabled, final HTML generated after token replacement \(field tokens, document template scripts, template blocks, and similar elements\) is sanitized. Always enable the **Sanitize** option to secure your HTML templates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Start date

</td><td>

Date starting which the HTML document template is valid. **Start date** helps in maintaining multiple versions of same template.**Note:** Start date must be before the end date.

</td></tr><tr><td>

End date

</td><td>

Date until which the HTML document template is valid. **End date** helps in maintaining multiple versions of same template.By default, if the values in **Start date** and **End date** are empty it will imply that the template will always be valid.

If you specify an end date, you must also specify a start date.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Template date format

</td><td>

Format in which you want the date to appear when an agent previews the document, generates the attachment, or initiates document tasks for participants.**Note:**

-   When signing using a ServiceNow application or the AdobeSign application: If no value is selected in **Template date format**, the value specified in the **template\_date\_format** system property is considered. If both **Template date format** and **template\_date\_format** system property are empty, the value in the Date format field from the agent's user profile is considered.
-   When signing using a DocuSign application: The date format selected in Signing settings in the DocuSign application is considered over **Template date format** in the configured HTML template in a ServiceNow instance.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Sanitize

</td><td>

Option to remove potentially unsafe HTML from template-generated content. The **Sanitize** option is hidden by default; users with the `sn_doc.admin` role can access by selecting the Advanced View in Related Links.-   For new HTML templates: The Sanitize option is enabled by default.
-   For existing HTML document templates: The **Sanitize** option is inactive by default. Enabling sanitization on existing templates may remove some HTML content from the output. Review your templates before enabling this option to verify no critical information is lost.

**Note:** Always enable the Sanitize option to secure your HTML templates.

The sanitization happens using the default HTML sanitizer. See [Exploring HTML sanitizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/exploring.md-sanitizer.md) for more details.

By default, the HTML sanitizer works by checking the built-in inclusion list for HTML markup. To make configuration changes \(including or excluding HTML attributes or elements\) to the HTML sanitizer, see [Configuring HTML sanitizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_ConfigureHTMLSanitizer.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Template language

</td><td>

Language in which you want dynamic tokens to be translated when an agent previews the document, generates the attachment, or initiates document tasks for participants. The **Template language** field is also used for full template translation.**Note:**

-   Template language is a mandatory field. The default language is none.
-   Translation feature is available only when language plugins are installed on the instance.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Select variables

</td><td>

List of variables that can be used in the body of the template. Variables pull information from the selected table to customize the template.Offsets are supported for date variables. Offsets extend or subtract days, weeks, or months from a date used in a template.

Valid date offset variables are:-   + \(plus\)
-   - \(minus\)
-   d \(days\)
-   w \(weeks\)
-   m \(months\)
 Examples:

-   Offer letter \(five days after the stated date\): Your offer is valid until $\{Date +5d\}.
-   Benefits for terminated employee \(two weeks from termination date\): Your benefits end effective $\{subject\_person.hr\_profile.employment\_end\_date +2w\}.
 **Note:** Only variables that you have access appear.
