# HR Service Delivery Portal UI Components

The ServiceNow® HR Service Delivery Portal UI Components application contains common widgets, such as Direct Deposits, Holiday Calendar, Time Off Balances, and Total Rewards widgets that be used with any HR application.

## Application set up

You must have the HRSD Enterprise and Professional license to install the HR Service Delivery Portal UI Components application from ServiceNow Store.

## Add widgets to an HR application

Add the HR Portal Components, such as Direct Deposits, Holiday Calendar, Time Off Balances, and Total Rewards widgets that can be used with any HR application.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_oracle\_adv.admin, sn\_hr\_workday.admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Service Portal** &gt; **Widgets**.

2.  Embed the HR Portal Components widget in the main widget of your application by passing the source.

    A source refers to the system of data for these widgets, for example, Oracle or Workday. The HR Service Delivery Portal UI Components application uses scripted extension points to provide an implementation to fetch data based on the source that is passed through outer widgets. For more information on how to embed widgets, see [Embedded widgets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_NestedWidgets.md).
