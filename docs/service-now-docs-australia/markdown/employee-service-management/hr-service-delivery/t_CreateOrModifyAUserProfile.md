# Add or modify an HR profile

Employees can directly edit some information in their HR profile, such as emergency contact information, but they are restricted from editing certain fields. If employees want to change information that they are restricted from editing, they must submit a general request to HR for the changes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.secure\_info\_writer, sn\_hr\_core.basic, or sn\_hr\_core.manager

## About this task

The HR Administrator \[sn\_hr\_core.admin\] can configure which HR profile fields an employee can update. An update to information that the employee cannot change requires an HR employee information change request.

**Note:** Use the configurable allow list to add fields that users can modify themselves. This allow list is a system property and accessed by going to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **Properties**. The list of user editable fields appears as comma separated list. The property name is **sn\_hr\_core.hr\_profile\_editable\_fields**.

To update the HR profile when an employee information change request is assigned to you, complete the following steps.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Profile** &gt; **HR Profiles**.

    The HR Profiles list opens.

2.  Find the existing HR profile to update by selecting **User** from the HR Profiles list search menu, typing the name, and pressing Enter.

    Also, you can click a profile number to open a user profile.

    From **HR Profiles**, select **New** and type the user name in the **User** field on the HR Profile New record form to create the profile. You cannot change the user name after an HR profile is saved.

3.  Click the profile number to open the user profile.

    The profile opens displaying populated name, manager, department, location, and contact fields from the user record.

4.  Complete or update the form with as much additional information as you have.
