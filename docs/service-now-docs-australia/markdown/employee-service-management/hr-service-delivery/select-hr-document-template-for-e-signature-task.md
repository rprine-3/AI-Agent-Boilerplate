# Select an HR document template for an e-signature task

If the document type of the e-signature template you are using is an HR document template, then you must select the HR document template that the signatory will sign on the HR case form.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.basic or sn\_hr\_core.case\_writer

Depending on the HR service you are using to request the e-signature, you may need to configure the HR case form so that the **PDF template** field appears and an HR document template can be selected.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **HR Case Management**, and create a new or open an existing HR case.

2.  On the HR case form, in the **PDF Template** field, select an HR document template.

    **Note:** If the **PDF Template** field is not visible, make sure that the HR case form for the HR service you are using is configured to show that field. See [Configure the HR case form for an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-case-form-for-hr-service.md) for more information, and also [HR case form configuration examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-case-form-for-hr-service.md) for an e-signature-specific example.

## What to do next

The user to whom the case is assigned can:

1.  Click **Start Work**.
2.  Click **Preview Document**.
3.  From the Preview Document window, click **Generate** to generate the document for signing. The document to sign is added as an attachment to the HR case form.
