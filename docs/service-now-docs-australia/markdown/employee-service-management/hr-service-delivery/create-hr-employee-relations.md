# Create an Employee Relations case in Core UI

You create ER cases for employees that wish to report misconduct, discrimination or a disciplinary issue.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_er.case\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Case Management** &gt; **Create New Case**.

2.  From **Search for Employee or case number**, enter an employee name or click **Skip verification**.

    \[Omitted image "hr-er-case-creation-skip.png"\] Alt text: HR Employee Relations - Skip verification

    **Note:** Skipping verification enables you to create an ER case without identifying an Opened for person and takes you directly to case details.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

COE

</td><td>

The **Center of Excellence** associated with the HR case you are creating. Currently, Employee Relations Case is the only COE available for ER cases.

 Selecting a COE filters the choices for HR service. See [HR Centers of Excellence data model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-centers-of-excellence-coes.md).

 **Note:** You can also select an HR service first and the associated COE automatically populates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HR service

</td><td>

The HR service depends on the COE selected or what you select based on communication with the employee request. Select:

-   Accommodation Request
-   Report Discrimination
-   Report Misconduct
-   Performance improvement plan\(PIP\)
 HR services available to an employee filter by:

-   COE selected.
-   HR criteria for the **Subject person** based on the HR service configuration.

Limit services filter on the **Case Creation Configuration** form. If the HR service field is empty, ensure that you did not remove the Opened for field.

 **Note:** **Bulk Parent Case** does not appear as a selection because it only appears when creating a parent case for child bulk cases. Refer to [Add or modify bulk HR cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_CreateBulkCases.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Opened for

</td><td>

The person the HR service request is for. **Note:** This field does not appear if you selected the **Skip verification** link.

 Click the **Lookup using list** icon to find a user.

 Use the choice list to search and select another employee.

 Click the **Reference field** icon to view or edit **HR profile** information.

**Note:** Selecting the **Do Not Default Subject Person** HR Service Option for an HR service, prevents the **Subject Person** from automatically filling in when creating an HR case. For more information, see [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Work notes

</td><td>

Information specific to the case that can help other HR agents. **Work Notes** are not visible to the **Opened for** subject.The sn\_hr\_core.restrict\_guest\_email system property allows a user to send an email from a personal email account referencing an HR case. When the property has a value of false \(default\), the text from the email appears in the Work notes field. To access system properties, enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter.

 **Note:** Translate the text in your preferred language using the **Translate** option. For configuring the dynamic translation framework, see [Dynamic translation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation-overview.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Collaborators

</td><td>

Agents or interested parties you want to associate with the case. Collaborators can track and stay up-to-date on the progress of the ER case.If an ER case transfers from the assigned to agent to another agent, the original assigned to agent can add themselves as a collaborator and still monitor the case.

 By having visibility to the case, collaborators can also help the assigned to agent with the case.

 Other factors:

-   Collaborators can remove themselves from the case.
-   The Assigned to agent can add or remove collaborators.
-   Collaborators cannot add or remove collaborators.
-   Notifications are sent to the collaborators when added to the ER case.
 Collaborators and the COE for the HR case can conflict. The basic rules are:

-   For all HR cases, collaborators override any security on a COE. For more information, see [Create COE security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-coe-security.md).
-   Employee Relations \(ER\) cases can override collaborators when restrictions apply. For more information, see [Configure an employee relations case restriction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-create-case-restriction.md).
**Note:** Agents must have the ER case writer \[sn\_hr\_er.case\_writer\] role in order to be a collaborator.
