# Admin Workspace for Service Providers overview

HR Admin Service Provider is a consolidated view of customers service usage and consumption, which gives service provider admins the opportunity to make data driven decisions.

SP admins can perform the following functions:

-   View different aspects of the service consumption such as the number of services consumed per customer and the ticket volume per service.
-   View customer details including the number of services and HR users.
-   Access quick links related to daily work tasks such as domain and customer creations, and user management.
-   Access quick links for specific domain on the customer details page.

    **Note:** SP Admin \(sn\_sp\_admin\_ws.admin\) can access workspace and see a consolidated view of the demand and consumption of services offered to customers. This enables data driven decision making and access to portfolio level links.


Admin Workspace for Service Providers gives SP admins a centralized workspace to see a consolidated view of the demands and consumption of services offered to customers using KPIs.
