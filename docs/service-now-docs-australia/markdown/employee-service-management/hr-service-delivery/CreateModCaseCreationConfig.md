# Configure how HR cases are created

Modify how search results for an employee appear and configure the default HR case creation form.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

## About this task

HR case creation has multiple steps:

-   Search for an employee or related case.
-   Create an initial HR case.
-   Complete the details of the case.

Using the **Case Creation Configuration** form you can control the information returned from a search and the required fields when creating an initial HR case.

**Note:** Zing text search is used to search on indexed fields in the User \[sys\_user\], HR Profile \[sn\_hr\_core\_profile\], and HR Case \[sn\_hr\_core\_case\] tables. Refer to [Zing text indexing and search engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ZingTextSearch.md).

## Procedure

When a subject person is selected for an HR case, these fields determine the HR services available. When no subject person is selected, only services with no criteria are shown.
