# HR cases for VIPs

Your organization can assign VIP status to users, such as the CEO and vice-presidents, to ensure that the resolution of their tasks is given high priority.

If your organization uses the VIP feature, set up the following to ensure that VIP HR cases are handled appropriately.

-   Navigate to **Skills** &gt; **Groups**.
-   Add members or a group to **HR VIP Watchlist**. When an HR case is submitted, members of this group receive notification as the case progresses.
-   Review the HR service level agreement \(SLA\) for handling VIP cases. The duration is two hours. When the duration is reached, the SLA is breached and the members of the watchlist are notified.
-   Navigate to **HR Administration** &gt; **Properties**.
-   Enter a case priority number in the **Default case priority for VIP requestor** field.
-   For VIP employees, check the **VIP** box on their User \[sys\_user\] record.

    **Note:** The VIP check box does not show by default. Customize the User record form in the Form Designer to show the VIP check box.


You can identify VIP HR cases in the following ways:

-   **HR Cases** list: A VIP icon appears in the **Opened for** and/or **Subject person** fields. If the **Opened for** and/or **Subject person** fields do not appear, personalize the list.
-   **HR Case** form: The employee name in the **Opened for** and/or **Subject person** fields is red.
-   HR catalog items: When the form is submitted, a message appears at the top identifying the submitter as a VIP.
