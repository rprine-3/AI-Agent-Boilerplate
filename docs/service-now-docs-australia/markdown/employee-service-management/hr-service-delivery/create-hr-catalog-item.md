# Create an HR catalog item

Create an HR catalog item so employees can request HR services through self-service. This automatically creates the HR service, record producer, and case template.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HR Administration** &gt; **HR Services** &gt; **Manage HR Catalog**.

2.  Select a category.

3.  Click **New Catalog Item**.

    **Note:** The COEs available to you may differ depending on the HR package you have.

    -   The categorization of HR catalog items are employee-facing only, and have no relation to the categorization of HR services under the HR Centers of Excellence \(COEs\) data model.
    -   If you are creating a new HR service and plan to make it available for employee self-service, see [HR catalog item configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-catalog-item-configuration.md). Creating a new HR catalog item automatically creates a corresponding HR service, and you can avoid creating duplicate services.
    -   If you have an existing HR service that you want to make available for employee self-service, do not create an HR catalog item. \(Creating a HR catalog item automatically creates a corresponding HR service.\) Instead, see [Configure a record producer for an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-record-producer.md) to add the existing service as an HR catalog item in the HR service catalog.
    -   The Agent Workspace for HR Case Management is highly configurable for HR agents. It supports the same functionality in the Classic HR Service Delivery Agent Workspace.
4.  Fill in the fields on the form.
