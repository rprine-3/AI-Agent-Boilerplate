# Employee Relations integration with Universal Request and Legal Investigations

Employees can submit complaints through the Employee Center portal without worrying about who should investigate the complaint. During the triaging or investigation process, fulfillers working on these issues can transfer them back and forth between the Legal and HR departments as necessary for resolution.

## Better together solutions

Use Legal Investigations and HR Service Delivery Employee Relations with Universal Request together for the following key features:

-   Omni-channel modes for submitting complaints via the Employee Center portal, and Anonymous Report Center \(ARC\) portal.
-   Single triaging queue for all complaints through Universal Request.
-   Inter-departmental transfer of case details between Legal Service Delivery Legal Investigations and HR Service Delivery Employee Relations.

Complete the necessary configurations to start using the integration. See [Set up Legal Investigations with HR Service Delivery Employee Relations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-investigations/integrate-lsd-hrsd.md).

## Integration workflow

Use case explaining how routing agents, legal fulfillers, and HR agents can use the applications \(Legal Investigations, Employee Relations and Universal Request\) together to resolve complaint requests submitted by employees.

1.  Employees who observe an ethical violation or similar incident report it by submitting a universal request. See [Submit a complaint through the Quick Link in Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-investigations/submit-complaint-employee-center.md).

    Alternatively, an ethics compliance ticket can be raised via Anonymous Reporting Center.

2.  A universal request routing agent can triage these complaint requests and create tickets for the appropriate department to work on. An HR case can be created from a universal request with COE as Employee Relations Case, and HR Service as Report Misconduct. See [Create an HR case from Universal Request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/create-ur-hr-case.md).
3.  An HR agent who is assigned the ticket can work on it and close it, transfer it to another department, or transfer to the universal request.
4.  When a ticket is transferred from the HR department to the Legal department, the details in the HR ticket \(description, short description, comments, attachments, and underlying data of the investigation such as involved parties, allegations, interviews, and evidence\) are copied to the legal ticket. See [Transfer an HR case in Universal Request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/route-ur-hr-case.md).

    The HR ticket is closed and a legal ticket is created which is handled by a legal agent.
