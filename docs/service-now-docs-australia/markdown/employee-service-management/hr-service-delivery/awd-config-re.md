# Configure reports HR Service Delivery Advanced Integration with Workday

Configure the necessary reports to pull data, such as time offs plans, time off reasons, holiday calendar WID, and work schedule calendar WID, from Workday into the ServiceNow tables.

**Important:** Only a Workday administrator can create reports in Workday. A ServiceNow administrator must collect the report details from a Workday administrator.

-   Absence table reasons
-   Absence table tiers
-   Absence tables

-   Time off reasons
-   Time off types
