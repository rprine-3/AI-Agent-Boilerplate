</table>6.  Select **Create case**.

    The case returns with a **Case Timeline** that provides a visual of all tasks and key milestones and dates related to the case. The **Case Timeline** helps agents visualize and navigate the key investigation activities on a case and quickly understand the history and what still needs to be done. A **Show Legend** drop-down also appears to show or hide the number of events scheduled or conducted and the associated date.

    Below the **Case Timeline** are a number of tabs that you can provide additional information about the case.

    **Note:** Closed and completed events could still appear on the timeline, but not necessarily in the related tabs.
