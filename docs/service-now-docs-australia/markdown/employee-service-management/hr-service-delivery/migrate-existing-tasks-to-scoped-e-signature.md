# Migrate existing HR task templates and open HR tasks to e-signature

Migrate existing HR task templates and open HR tasks to the new HR task type for e-signature with the **Migrate HR e-signature tasks** scheduled job. The scheduled job automatically updates the HR task type and e-signature template based on your existing configurations. It also disables the old HR task types for credential, e-signature, and sign document.

## About this task

**Important:**

Starting with the Australia release, HR task types: Credential, E-signature \(e\_signature\), and Sign Document are now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. E-signature provides the latest experience for this functionality.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

The **Migrate HR e-signature tasks** scheduled job migrates existing HR task templates and open HR tasks from the **Credential**, **E-Signature**, and **Sign Document** HR task types to the new **E-signature** HR task type.

The associated document and signature configurations are also migrated to new or existing e-signature templates. If an e-signature template for the applicable document and signature configuration already exists, then the existing e-signature template is used. Otherwise, a new e-signature template is created.
