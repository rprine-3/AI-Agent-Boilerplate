# HR Service Delivery Advanced Integration with Oracle HCM

The ServiceNow® HR Service Delivery Advanced Integration with Oracle HCM is built by Bristlecone, Inc.

It enables you to complete the following Oracle HCM tasks from a ServiceNow instance without navigating into the Oracle HCM system.

-   From a ServiceNow instance, submit a query related to your direct deposit account that is in the Oracle HCM system.
-   From a ServiceNow instance, submit a query related to your time off balance in the Oracle HCM system.
-   View your holiday calendars from the Oracle HCM system in the configured portal in a ServiceNow instance.
-   View your total rewards information from the Oracle HCM system in the configured portal in a ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** These use cases don’t work if your Employee ID, Person ID, and Location details aren’t present in your HR profile.
