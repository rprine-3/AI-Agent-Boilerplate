# Install Health and Safety Testing

You can install Health and Safety Testing if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

Health and Safety Testing requires the ServiceNow® Employee Readiness Core application.

The ServiceNow® Contact Tracing application can optionally be installed to send an email notification to employees who are potentially exposed individuals in a contact tracing case. The notification informs the employee of the potential exposure and provides them with a link to request testing.

The ServiceNow® Emergency Response Management for Now Mobile application can optionally be installed to add a **Health** tab to the Now Mobile app where employees can request testing or report a test result.

Role required: admin
