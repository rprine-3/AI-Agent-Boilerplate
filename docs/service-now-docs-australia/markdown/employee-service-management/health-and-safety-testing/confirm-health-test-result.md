# Confirm COVID-19 test results for a user

Confirm a user's reported COVID-19 test results through the Employee Readiness Core Approval Portal.

## Before you begin

Your organization must install both Health and Safety Testing and Vaccination Status to use the Approval Portal.

-   For information on installing Health and Safety Testing, see [Install Health and Safety Testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-testing/install-health-testing.md).
-   For information on installing Vaccination Status, see [Install Vaccination Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/install-vaccination-status.md).

Activate the **sn\_imt\_health\_test.allow\_managers\_ability\_to\_update\_test\_result\_records** property to enable all managers to review and verify COVID-19 tests of their direct reports. This property assigns the sn\_imt\_core.approval\_portal\_manager role to managers and grants access to the Approval Portal for test results.
