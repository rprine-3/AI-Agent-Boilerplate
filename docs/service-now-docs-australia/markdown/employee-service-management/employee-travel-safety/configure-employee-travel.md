# Configure Employee Travel Safety

Complete all configuration tasks to ensure that travel notifications and approvals are set up correctly for your company.

**Parent Topic:**[Employee Travel Safety](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-travel-safety/employee-travel-safety.md)

## Set up travel approvers

Set up user groups and roles so that employee travel can be approved by managers or by designated travel approvers.

Setting up manager approval or designated approvers is a required configuration step for the Employee Travel Safety application.

-   **Manager approval**

    To set up travel approval by managers, assign the approver\_user role to all managers. With this role, managers can only view and approve travel requests for the employees they directly supervise.

-   **Designated approvers**

    To set up designated travel approvers, add users to the Travel Approvers group. Members of this group can view and approve travel requests for all employees. Don't add managers to the Travel Approvers group unless it's acceptable for them to view and approve travel requests for all employees.


By default, a travel request must be approved by both the employee's manager and a member of the Travel Approvers group. If the employee doesn't have a manager listed in your ServiceNow instance or there are no users in the Travel Approvers group, one approval is enough to approve the travel request. An employee's travel request is automatically rejected if the employee doesn't have a manager listed in your ServiceNow instance and there are no users in the Travel Approvers group. For information about changing the default approval settings, see [Modify the travel approval flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-travel-safety/configure-employee-travel.md).

## Modify the travel approval flow

Modify the travel approval flow to change the default travel approval settings.

### Before you begin

Role required: flow\_designer

### About this task

Modifying the travel approval flow is an optional configuration step for the Employee Travel Safety application. The travel approval flow is ready to use but can be modified to meet your company's requirements.

If you decide to modify the flow, deactivate the original flow and make a copy. Make any desired changes to the new flow, and then activate it. Modifying the copy makes it easier when you need to upgrade your ServiceNow instance.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Flow Designer** &gt; **Designer**.

2.  In the Flows section, click **Travel Approval Flow**.

3.  Click **Deactivate**, then click **OK** to confirm.

4.  In the upper-right corner, click the More actions icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_MoreOptions.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\), then click **Copy flow**.

5.  Enter a name for the new flow.

6.  In the **Application** field, select **Employee Travel Safety**.

7.  Click **Copy**.

8.  Make any desired changes to the new flow.

    For example, in cases where an employee has a manager listed in your ServiceNow instance and there are also users in the Travel Approvers group, by default, both the manager and a travel approver must approve the request. This setting is defined in action 8.1 of the flow. You can modify this action so that approval is only required from either a manager or a travel approver, not both. To make this change, the AND condition to approve must be replaced with an OR condition.

9.  When you're done modifying the flow, click **Activate**, then click **OK** to confirm.


## Customize notification emails

Modify the notification emails that are sent to employees, managers and travel approvers, and employee travel contacts to customize the notifications for your company.

### Before you begin
