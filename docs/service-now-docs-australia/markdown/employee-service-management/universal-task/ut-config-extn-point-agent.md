# Define the agent criteria for Universal Task

Define the criteria for an agent so that the agent can access the parent table for Universal Task. The default criteria is that agents must have write access to the parent table.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By using an extension point, you can add more conditions for agents to qualify as Universal Task agents. If this extension point is not implemented, agents with write access to the parent table are treated as UT agents for the parent table by default.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

2.  In the API name column, search for sn\_uni\_task.UniversalTaskParentAccess.

3.  To create an extension point script that defines the agent criteria for your service, click **Create Implementations** in the related link.

    To know more about extension points, see [Using extension points to extend application functionality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/extension-points.md).

4.  Specify the criteria for an agent to have access to the parent table.

    For example, you might want to ensure that the agent belongs to a specific assignment group in addition to having write access for the parent table.
