# Approve or reject a workplace contract in Core UI

As a lease administrator or manager, you can approve or reject a workplace contract after it is submitted for review.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_la.manager or sn\_wsd\_la.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Lease Administration** &gt; **Workplace Contracts**.

2.  Select a contract in the Requested state.

3.  Either approve or reject the contract.

    -   To approve the contract, select **Approve**.

        The contract substate changes to Approved.

    -   To reject the contract, select **Reject** and enter a rejection reason in the **Comments** field.

        The contract substate changes to Rejected.

4.  Select **Update**.


## Result

-   Contracts with the state set to Draft and a start date set in the future are kept in the Draft state until the start date is reached.
-   If the contract has a substate of Approved, the system changes the state to Active and removes the Substate value.
-   When a contract with a state of Draft and a start date set to a date in the past is approved, the State value is automatically set to Active and the Substate value is left empty.
