# Pre-hire experience

The Pre-hire experience is a portal that caters to employees who are in transition between the applicant phase and the onboarding phase. This onboarding portal is a solution that facilitates the preboarding process by enabling employees who have been selected by your organization to embark on their first journey.

The Pre-hire experience streamlines the preboarding process for newly hired employees. This portal provides your organization with the necessary elements that help newly hired employees integrate quickly into your company's culture. This portal supplies a centralized location for new hires to perform the following tasks so they can be ready for work from their first day on the job:

-   Complete necessary paperwork
-   Review benefits
-   Review HR policies and company resources
-   View training and orientation schedules

The Pre-hire experience assists new hires with connecting seamlessly to team members, mentors, and managers to whom they report so they can foster meaningful workplace relationships. This onboarding portal serves as a gateway into your organization to support new hires with assimilating faster into their roles while grasping the dynamics of their responsibilities.

## Pre-hire experience system requirements

To enable and use the Pre-hire experience, you must satisfy the following minimum system requirements:

-   **Application requirements**
    -   Upgrade the Journey designer application to version 7.0.
    -   Install and activate the Explicit Roles \[com.glide.explicit\_roles\] plugin.
    -   Install and activate Journey Accelerator \[sn\_ja\] Version 6.7.1 or higher.
-   **Software release requirements**

    Upgrade your instance to the Zurich release Patch 1.


## Pre-hire experience security components

To protect the data in your instance, the following components were created for the Pre-hire experience:

-   **Roles**

    The sn\_jny.pre\_hire role is created for the individual who is transitioning from applicant to employee and using the Pre-hire experience to initiate your organization's preboarding process. This role inherits the snc\_external role to restrict access to the sensitive data that resides in your instance.

-   **Access control lists**

    New access controls lists \(ACLs\) were created to provide an added layer of security for the sn\_jny.pre\_hire role. These new ACLs help to avoid the modification of existing ACLs that may be in use by your organization. New ACLs ensure that access to sensitive data is restricted by deterring you from using existing ACLs that provide access to data associated with specific roles. You can navigate to the Access Roles \[sys\_security\_acl\_role\] table to view the list of ACLs that support the sn\_jny.pre\_hire role.


## Lifecycle Events activities for the Pre-hire experience

The following Lifecycle Events activities were created to facilitate the transition of roles through which the employee navigates during the preboarding process:

The Day 1 activity set is triggered when the date in the **Employment start date** field in the HR profile record of the onboarding employee is equal to the system date.
