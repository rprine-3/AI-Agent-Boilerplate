**Template**

</td><td>

Template fields that appear only when a table is selected. Template fields are tracked in the Journey Accelerator Task \[sn\_ja\_task\] table.

 The following settings apply to the overall properties of the task:

-   **Mandatory**: Set to **true** to make the task required. Set to **false** to make the task optional.
-   **Editable**: Set to **true** to enable users to modify task fields. Set to **false** so that users can't modify certain fields in the task.

**Note:** When `editable = false`, the following occurs:

    -   The plan creator can't change the **To-do name**, **To-do description**, or **This to-do is optional** fields.
    -   Users can't delete the to-do task from a plan.
-   **Type**
    -   **Regular**: Standard to-do task template.
    -   **Calendar**: Schedulable task. Creates to-do task linked to Microsoft Office 365 calendar event.

**Parent plan table**

Higher-level table that associates an entry in the Journey Accelerator Task \[sn\_ja\_task\] with the table that tracks plans, Journey Accelerator Plan \[sn\_ja\_plan\]. Selecting the Journey Accelerator enables access to the plan-related fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Assign to source**

</td><td>

User who is assigned the task:-   Employee
-   Manager

**Note:** Initially, only the first mentor is assigned with to-do tasks in the list with multiple entries. Managers can reassign the to-do tasks to other mentors after the plan is created.


</td></tr><tr><td>

**Relative due date trigger**

</td><td>

Condition that is used to trigger when a task is assigned based on the publish date of the plan. This condition is evaluated with **Date offset type** and **Date offset type**.-   **Created**

-   **Start on**
-   **Updated**

 **Note:** Only use the **Start on** condition. **Start on** is selected by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Date offset type**

</td><td>

Condition that is used to trigger when a task is assigned. This condition is evaluated with **Relative due date trigger** and **Number of offset days**.-   **On**
-   **After**

 **Note:** The **After** condition is the default selection. We recommend that you use only the After condition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Number of offset days**

</td><td>

Condition that is used to trigger when a task is assigned. This condition is evaluated with **Relative due date trigger** and **Date offset type**.-   **Days**

 **Note:** Only specify days, and keep hours set at 0 \(zero\).

For example: If the `Relative Due Date Trigger = Start On`, `Date Offset type = After`, and `Number of offset days = 5 days`, the task is configured to trigger 5 days after the publish date of the plan.
