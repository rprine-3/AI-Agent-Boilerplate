# Creating and managing quick links for journeys

Quick links give employees quick access to varied resources directly from a journey. Administrators, journey owners, and mentors are able to add linked resources to journeys.

**Note:** Journey owners and mentors must be given **Can add quick links** permission by an administrator. Journey permissions are assigned and managed in journey configurations. See, [Update users' permissions for journeys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/journey-designer/jny-dsgnr-update-user-permissions.md).

There are two types of quick links that can be added to a journey from **Journey designer**.

-   Administrator configured links: Administrators add quick links to journey types. These quick links are added to all journeys that are created from that journey type.
-   User configured links: Journey owners and mentors with **Can add quick links** permission add or delete web-based links directly to a user's journey.

    **Note:** Administrator added quick links can't be deleted by journey owners or mentors.


## Quick links added by administrators

From the **Manage Journey Type Quick Links** page, administrators create and configure quick links in a journey configuration.
