## About this task

RCA requests that are generated after the installation of a newer version of the Journey designer application that are in the **Requested** state can be manually updated to **Allowed**. You can manually update the requests, or you can follow the directions in [KB1432208](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fkb%3Fid%3Dkb_article_view%26sys_kb_id%3D334062e0973b69d08a073cbe2153afb3) to upload and run a script to update RCA requests in bulk.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Application** &gt; **Application Restricted Caller Access**.

2.  In the **Status** column, right-click **Allowed** and select **Filter Out**.

    A list of **Requested** RCA privileges is displayed.

3.  In the **Operation** column, double-click the entry you want to update.

    **Note:** If needed, change to the application that the request is for.

4.  Select **Allowed** in the **Status** list.

5.  Select **Update**.

    If there are multiple RCA requests, you must follow this task for each request.
