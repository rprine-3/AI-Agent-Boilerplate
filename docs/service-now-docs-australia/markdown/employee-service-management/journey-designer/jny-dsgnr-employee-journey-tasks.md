# Employees view and complete journeys

Employees have access to the journeys that are assigned to them.

## Before you begin

Role required: Employee with HR profile

## About this task

Any employee assigned to a journey can view the journey to complete tasks that are part of the journey. Employees access assigned journeys from the Employee Center.

## Procedure

1.  In the Employee Center portal, select **Journeys**.

2.  Select the journey that you want to work on.

    Stages contain the tasks for you to complete.

3.  To view details about a particular task and to manage its progress, select that task.

    Tasks have a process or steps that you take to complete the task.

    **Note:** The total task count in the journey progress bar may be different from the **Journey overview** **Your tasks** count. This total task count discrepancy is because the **Journey overview** count displays the task count for only those tasks the employee has access to.

    The following table reflects the status of a journey based on whether overdue tasks exist for the journey or the subject person to whom the journey belongs:

    |Journey status|Persona|Subject person has overdue tasks|Other person has overdue tasks|Visible tasks|Invisible tasks|Message|
    |--------------|-------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
    |Overdue|Employee/Mentor|Yes|No|Yes|No|No message|
    |Overdue|Employe/Mentor|No|Yes|Yes|No|Your journey is overdue because tasks assigned to other people haven't been completed yet.|
    |Overdue|Employee/Mentor|No|Yes|No|Yes|Your journey is overdue because some tasks haven't been completed. You may not be able to see them because they are assigned to other people.|
    |Overdue|Manager|Yes|No|Yes|No|No message|
    |Overdue|Manager|No|Yes|Yes|No|Your journey is overdue because tasks assigned to other people haven't been completed yet.|
    |Overdue|Manager|No|Yes|No|Yes|This journey is overdue because some tasks haven't been completed. You may not be able to see them because they are assigned to other people.|
