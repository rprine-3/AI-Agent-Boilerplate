# Record producers for legal investigations

A record producer helps you set up an intake form containing fields that a requester has to fill in and initiate a request.

When Legal Investigations is installed, record producers for ethic complaints are installed.

When an employee submits a complaint, a legal request or universal request is created based on the active record producers' mapping to different tables.

**Important:** At any given time, only one set of record producers mapped to a specific table can be active.

## Legal requests

The following record producers can be activated for creating legal requests when a complaint is submitted.

**Note:** To submit a legal request via the Anonymous Report Center portal, you require a HRSD Pro/Enterprise license in addition to the Legal Investigations subscription.

</table>## Universal requests
