3.  On the Submit an anonymous report page, click **Ethics Complaints**.

4.  On the Ethics Complaints form, fill in the fields.

    Based on the [active record producers for ARC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-investigations/record-producers-legal-investigation.md), different sets of fields might appear on the Ethics Complaints form.

    For field descriptions, see [Ethics complaints intake form in the Anonymous Report Center portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-investigations/ethics-complaint-intake-form-arc.md).

5.  Enter the text verification code.

    **Note:** For the text verification code to work, you must install the HR Scoped Security plugin.

6.  Click **Submit**.

7.  To download and save the reported request on your system, in the Thank you for submitting your report dialog box, click **Download report copy**.

8.  Note the report key and report number from the respective fields to access your anonymous report in future to track its progress.


## Result

Either a legal request or a universal request is created based on the [active record producers for legal investigations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-investigations/record-producers-legal-investigation.md).

To maintain the anonymity of the requester or requested for users, the request is submitted with the following values for the corresponding fields:

-   **Opened by** is populated as `Guest`.
-   **Requested for** is empty.

-   **[Access your anonymous report from the Anonymous Report Center portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-investigations/access-anonymous-complaint-arc.md)**
