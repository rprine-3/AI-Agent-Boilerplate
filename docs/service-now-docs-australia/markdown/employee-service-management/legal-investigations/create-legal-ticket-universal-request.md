# Create an ethics legal matter from a universal request

Create an ethics legal matter from a universal request to get the Legal department's assistance in resolving the complaints.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have the Universal Request application installed and [related configuration for legal services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-service-delivery/configure-universal-request-legal.md) completed by the administrator.

Role required: sn\_lg\_investigate.fulfiller and sn\_uni\_req.sensitiveinfo\_agent

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Legal Request** &gt; **Legal Counsel Center**.

    Alternatively, you can also open a universal request by navigating to **All** &gt; **Universal Request** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Click the list icon \(\[Omitted image "lsd-lcc-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\).

3.  Under the **Ethics Complaints**, click **All**.

4.  Open the universal request on which you want to work.

5.  Assign the universal request to yourself or to another member from the assigned group.

    -   To assign the request to yourself, click **Assign to me**.
    -   To assign the request to another member, on the **Details** tab, select a user in the **Assigned to** field and click **Save**.
    The assigned member can start working on the universal request and perform the next steps.

6.  Based on the subject of the complaint, you can route it to the appropriate department by creating either an ethics legal matter or an HR case.

    For more information on creating a Report Misconduct HR case, see [Using HR Service Delivery Employee Relations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/hr-er-using.md).

7.  Click **Create Legal Ticket**.

8.  In the Create Legal Ticket dialog box, fill in the fields.

    1.  From the **Ticket type** list, select **Ethics Complaints**.

    2.  In **Additional comments**, enter details about the service and support required from the Legal department.

    3.  Click **Create**.


## Result

-   An ethics legal matter is created and becomes the primary ticket for the universal request. The legal matter number is populated in the **Primary Ticket** field.
-   All attachments from the universal request are copied to the legal matter. The ethics complaints legal matter template is applied to this legal matter by default.
-   The state of the universal request changes to In Progress.
-   The **State reason** field displays with the pre-populated value Primary Ticket - In Progress.

## What to do next

-   If an ethics legal matter is created: In the Legal department, the legal matter is assigned to a matter owner. The assigned matter owner [works on the legal matter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/legal-investigations/work-legal-investigations-matter.md) and provides the resolution, or transfers the legal request to another department or back to the universal request.
-   If an HR case is created: In the HR department, the HR case is assigned to an HR agent to work on. For more information, see [Work an HR case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_CreateAnHRCase.md).
