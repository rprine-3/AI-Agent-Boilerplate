When a service is updated or edited on the Workplace Reservation Management portal, the workplace case that was originally raised is replaced by a new workplace case.This notification is meant for the workplace manager or workplace agent and does the following:

-   On the old case, a notification is displayed pointing to the new case.
-   On the old case, a notification is displayed to enable easy access to the previous case to look up past actions.

For example: If while making a reservation, the original case that you raised for a service request is WCASE0001207. After you edit or update while changing a space \(location\), date, and time, a new service case, WCASE0001208, is raised as a replacement to the original case request \(WCASE0001207\). When you open the newly created request WCASE0001208, the following notification is displayed: `This is a replacement task, please check the parent case comments to see the changes, if required. The previous parent case: WCASE000127`.

For more information about retaining or discarding services while updating a reservation location, see

[Create a reservation]().
