# Submit a change event request for a reservation

As a workplace employee, request a change to the date, time, and duration of your planned event reservation.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Only reservations created by an employee or if they are set as requested by in Workplace Reservation Management are visible for you to select and update.

Select a reservation that you want to update and select the new date, time, and duration for which you want to update your reservation. A workplace case is created with an updated or a new workplace service.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Home** &gt; **Catalog** on the navigation menu bar.

    You can also access the Emergency Maintenance request form using the Employee Center portal. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **Workplace Services** &gt; **Maintenance** &gt; **Change Event Reservation**.

2.  Select **Change Event Reservation** record form.

3.  Fill in the field information.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Reservation details|Description that you gave while creating a reservation. Select the description from the drop-down list. As you type, system auto-fills the description from the cached information.|
    |Reservation subject|Reservation purpose for which you are reserving a room. When you select the Reservation details field, this information is automatically updated.|
    |Start Date and Time|Start date and time for a reservation. Select the start date and time.|
    |End Date and Time|End date and time for a reservation. Select the end date and time.|
    |Comments|Optional. Add any comments, if required.|

4.  Select **Submit**.

    When a change event request is submitted, a workplace case is created. The case is automatically assigned to the Workplace Event Planners assignment group. It is then assigned manually to a user in the Workplace Event Planners assignment group.

    When the change event request case is assigned to a Workplace Event Planner, AI agentic workflow **Help Manage workplace Reservations** is triggered. AI agents retrieve a reservation from case details, analyze the reservation, and update the reservation case notes for workplace event planners to review. If the same location is available for the updated date and time, application reserves a space for you. If you cannot find a location of your choice when you are changing the date, time, and duration of a reservation, application provides a link for you to select a preferred location manually.
