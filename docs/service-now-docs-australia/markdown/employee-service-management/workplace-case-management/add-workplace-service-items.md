# Add a workplace service item to a workplace service

Configure a workplace item that an employee can order along with a workplace service request or as part of the reservation. For example, while making a reservation, an employee can order a workplace service item such as catering, an additional chair, whiteboard, marker, and more.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_wsd\_case.manager

## About this task

Add a workplace item to make it available for employees to order when they make a workplace service request. Specify the following details related to the workplace item:

-   Specify a name for the workplace item. The item is displayed to the employees with the specified name.
-   Select a template to prefill certain values when creating a workplace case or a workplace task.
-   The parent workplace service to which you’re adding the workplace item.
-   The subcategory to which the item belongs.
-   An image describing the workplace item. The image is displayed to the employees while they’re making a selection. The image is displayed to the customers while using the Reservation portal and Workplace Reservations for Microsoft Outlook Add-in.
-   A brief description about the workplace item. The description is displayed to the employees while they’re making a selection. You can add a normal text or an HTML text. The description can contain a text and a link. If you enter a long description, the text is displayed to the employees along with a **Show more** option. The description is displayed to the customers while using the Reservation portal and Workplace Reservations for Microsoft Outlook Add-in.

    **Note:** The Workplace Reservations for Microsoft Outlook Add-in doesn't inform about the services in lead time instead the services aren’t requested when the reservation gets submitted.

-   Cost of the workplace item. You can select the applicable currency based on your location.
-   Time duration required to prepare the item and clean up the item. You can specify the time in days and or hours.
-   Specify if you want to enable employees to specify their required quantity or capacity.
-   Configure the locations where the workplace service item shall be available.

**Note:** Some fields might not be applicable based on whether the case is standalone or linked to a reservation.

For example, while reserving a room with a projector from 10:00 am to 11:00am, the preparation and cleanup time is applicable to set up and remove the projector. If the preparation and cleanup duration is 30 minutes each, the room is reserved from 9:30am to 11:30am.

For standalone cases, users have the flexibility to raise a request at any time. The request doesn't need a start time and end time, therefore, preparation and cleanup time aren't applicable.

Example: Workplace service items added with 'Request Furniture' workplace service:\[Omitted image "wcasemgmt-workplceserviceservice-itemsl.png"\] Alt text: Workplace service items added with 'Request Furniture' workplace service.

## Result

The workplace service item is added to the workplace service. An employee can order the workplace item while requesting the workplace service.

**Important:** While adding a service item to a reservation, if the item is within the lead time, then that service item doesn't appear in the items list.

A regular employee can’t remove any service items to an existing reservation in the following scenarios:

-   When a reservation is arranged
-   When the service items are within the **Lead time of ordering**
-   When the **Restrict cancellation of requested services** option is enabled

Employee can move a reservation to another date or time. While moving, if one or more services collide with the Lead time for ordering, then the employee is informed.

The employee shouldn't be able to remove any services that are being prepared or arranged.

The employee is informed if there are one or more services in the lead time while saving the reservation.

**Note:** Canceling a reservation cancels the requested service, even when the service item is restricted from cancellation.

## What to do next

Specify the workplace locations where the workplace service item is available for ordering.
