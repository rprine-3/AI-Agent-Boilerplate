# Raise a space assistance request

Submit a workplace service request to get space allocation recommendations using the Workplace Service Portal. The Workplace Service Delivery space assistance provides you with the best space allocation plan options based on the space quantity and the department that you specify. You can select the most suitable allocation or none. Depending on your selection, the Space planner deploys the plan to use.

## Before you begin

Ensure the following:

-   Workplace Central plugin is installed.
-   Workplace Case Management plugin is installed.
-   To view the space recommendations on the map, the floor map must be configured using Workplace Indoor Mapping.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user

## About this task

Specify the department and number of spaces that you want to assign to that department on a floor. Specify the location where you want to see the allocation recommendation. Depending on the specification submitted on the form, the system provides you with options containing the most suitable space allocation plans in that building. If the selected department exists on the floor that you selected, then the spaces are recommended nearby to that department.

You can select the best option and submit the selection. If an approval is configured, then the plan is sent for an approval to your manager. The selected space plan is directed to the space planner. The space planner reviews the plan and deploys it accordingly.
