# Configure a workplace service record producer as a Universal Request

Enable an employee to submit a universal request using a workplace service record producer from the Workplace Service Portal. Configure a workplace service to create Universal Request whenever an employee makes a selection.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have activated the Universal Request plugin.

Ensure that you have the following:

-   A workplace service that is linked to a record producer. For more information, see [Configure a Record producer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-case-management/wsd-create-record-producer.md).
-   An active record producer.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_case.admin or sn\_wsd\_case.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Case Management** &gt; **Workplace Case Management - Setup** &gt; **Record producers**.

2.  Select the record producer that you want to configure as a universal request.

3.  Select **Universal Request Config** tab.

4.  To enable the universal request feature, select **Create Universal Request**.

5.  If the universal request requires an extra review, select **Requires Additional Review**.

6.  Click **Update**.


## Result

The workplace service record producer is configured as a universal request.

When an employee submits an inquiry using this workplace service, a universal request is created. The request is automatically assigned to the Workplace services assignment group.
