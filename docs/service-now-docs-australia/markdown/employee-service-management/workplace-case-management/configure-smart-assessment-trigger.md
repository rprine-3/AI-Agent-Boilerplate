# Configure Smart Assessment Trigger

Smart assessment triggers define the conditions when assessment templates are applied to workplace cases or tasks.

## About this task

Smart assessment triggers automatically create assessment instances when specific conditions are met on workplace cases or tasks. Conditions can be based on state changes, field values, or other criteria. You can also specify whether the assessment is mandatory and apply filters to target specific cases.
