# Create stock rules for PPE

Create a stock rule to automatically resupply a stockroom with an item.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_ppe.ppe\_admin

## About this task

When an item drops below a specified quantity, the stock rule automatically creates a transfer order. The transfer order resupplies the stockroom by transferring the required items from another stockroom.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **PPE Inventory Management** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Stock Rules**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Model|The product model for the rule.|
    |Threshold|The item quantity that triggers a restock. For example, enter a threshold of 150 for masks that should be restocked when inventory drops below 150 in the specified stockroom.|
    |Restocking option|Stockroom. This value is automatically populated.|
    |Parent stockroom|The stockroom that the new items are transferred from.|
    |Active|When selected, the rule is active and items are automatically restocked. When cleared, the rule is not active and items are not automatically restocked.|
    |Stockroom|The stockroom that you want to be automatically restocked by the rule.|
    |Order size|The number of new items to order for the stockroom.|

4.  Click **Submit**.
