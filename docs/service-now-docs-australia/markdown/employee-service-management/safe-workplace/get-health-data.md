# Subscribe to request for entry updates

Send the result of each Employee Health Screening entry request to a third-party system by configuring a webhook.

## Before you begin

Sending outbound webhook calls requires the following plugins.

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   Workflow Studio Action Step - Payload Builder \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.payload\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)

These plugins must be requested through the Now Support Service Catalog. For instructions, see [Request a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_RequestAPlugin.md).

When you set up the webhook, the system automatically sends a REST request to a third-party endpoint every time an employee or visitor requests entry. Work with an administrator for the third-party system to determine the correct endpoint to provide.

**Note:** The webhook does not include authentication headers in the request. Ensure that you provide an endpoint that includes query parameters to authenticate the request.

To learn more about the Employee Health Screening Request Entry module, see [Conduct a health screen for entry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/safe-workplace/screen-returning-employee.md).

Role required: sn\_imt\_core.admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Health and Safety Status** &gt; **Outbound Webhooks**.

2.  In the Webhook \[sn\_imt\_core\_webhook\] table, click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Provide parameters in the format `?param1=value&param2=othervalue`.**Tip:** If the third-party system that you're sending data to doesn't provide a securely generated authorization token, you can generate a token in your ServiceNow instance with the following script.

```
var secureRandom = GlideSecureRandomUtil;
var secret = secureRandom.getSecureRandomString(30);
gs.log(secret);
```
