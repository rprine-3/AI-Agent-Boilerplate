        When reducing hardware models, if the asset tag and model number are not entered, the stock is removed from the stockroom listed first and the amount is set to zero \(0\).

        When a model and asset tag are entered, or if the model and serial number are entered, hardware stock is matched and the amount is set to zero \(0\).

    -   **Consumable stock**

        If you try to enter a quantity larger than the quantity that is in stock, the system does not allow you to proceed.

3.  Click **Submit**.

    The stock log is updated with the PPE stock that you removed. To view the stock log, navigate to **PPE Inventory Management** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Stock Log**.
