# Define arrival schedules at the workplace for employees

Define arrival slot times in Workplace Core for different locations at your workplace and indicate the capacity for each slot. Establishing arrival schedules enables safe staggered entry of employees to these locations.

## Before you begin

-   [Add your workplace data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/providing-your-workplace-data-wsd.md).
-   Ensure you have the data for arrival schedules of the locations of your workplace.
-   Ensure that your time zone is set to the time zone of the building that is used for the arrival.

    **Important:** Starting with Workplace Core version 2.3, time zones are introduced in the application. All the arrival schedules that were created on Workplace Core version 2.2 and earlier are deactivated after the upgrade. Both existing customers and new customers must perform the following actions on existing arrival schedules to set them to active:

    1.  Set the time zone of the building where you are creating or updating the arrival schedule.

        **Note:** If you are creating or updating the arrival schedule for a floor, area or a space, then select the building where it is located.

        1.  Go to **Workplace Safety Management** &gt; **Space Administration**.
        2.  Select **Buildings**, **Floors**, **Areas**, or **Spaces** based on where you are scheduling an arrival slot.
        3.  Select the building, floor, area, or the space for which you want to set the time zone.
        4.  Set the building time zone.
            -   If you selected a building, set the time zone in the **Time zone** field.
            -   If you selected a floor, area, or the space, on the form, select the preview icon \(\[Omitted image "info-icon.png"\] Alt text: workplace location info icon\) that is next to the **Building** field.
                -   In dialog box, select **Open record**.
                -   On the Buildings form, set the time zone in the **Time zone** field.
        5.  Select **Update**.

            **Note:** All the active arrival schedules that were created on this building and on associated floors, areas, or spaces will be deactivated. Any future arrival requests that are related to this schedule will be canceled.

        6.  Select **Ok** on the warning that appears.
    2.  Change your session's time zone to the building's time zone.

        **Note:** Ensure that the sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager role is included in the **glide.timezone\_changer.roles** property. If it is not included, ask your system administrator to include the role so that you can change your time zone.

        1.  Select the settings icon \(\[Omitted image "system-settings-icon.png"\] Alt text: Settings icon.\) on your instance header.
        2.  Set the **Time zone** field to the time zone of the building where you are creating or updating the arrival schedule.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager
