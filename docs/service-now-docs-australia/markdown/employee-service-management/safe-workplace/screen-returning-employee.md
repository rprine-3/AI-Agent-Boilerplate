# Conduct a health screen for entry

Use a health screen to verify a person's return requirement status to determine whether the person is able to enter the location.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_monitoring.monitoring\_user

## About this task

Conduct a health screen before people enter a location, such as employees returning to the workplace or students returning to campus. Verify the person's return requirement status on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Then complete and submit a health screening form to determine whether the person is able to enter the location.

The following procedure includes the steps your organization might use in setting up health screening. Some of the steps might not be applicable to your location.

**Note:** If the ServiceNow® Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application is activated, the health screen can be performed for CSM consumers and contacts. The customer service agent \[sn\_customerservice\_agent\] and consumer service agent \[sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent\] roles can optionally be given to health screeners so that they can view additional CSM information on the health screening form, but these roles are not required for screening consumers and contacts. For more information about using Customer Service Management with Employee Health Screening, see [Integrate Customer Service Management with Safe Workplace applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-integration-safe-workplace.md).

    If the status is **Not cleared** and your organization's policy is to deny entry at this check point, provide the person with the next steps to take based on your organization's policy. Then, assist the next person in line.
