# Get employee or visitor health data

Send a GET request for Employee Health and Safety Status data to use in your third-party system. Get data to determine an employee or visitor's current health status.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_core.reader

## Procedure

1.  Send a GET request to the Table API on your instance.

    For more information, see [Table API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/c_TableAPI.md).

    1.  Construct the endpoint using the Health and Safety User \[sn\_imt\_core\_health\_and\_safety\_user\] table.

        ```
        https://<your-instance>.servicenow.com/api/now/table/sn_imt_core_health_and_safety_user
        ```

    2.  Add a query parameter to query a specific user's email address.

        In the API explorer, you can enter one of the following strings in the **sysparm\_query** field to generate an endpoint that includes the correct query parameter:

        -   `user.email=<user-email-address>`: Queries the provided employee's email address.
        -   `visitor.email=<visitor-email-address>`: Queries the provided visitor's email address.
        \[Omitted image "sysparm-query.png"\] Alt text: Example sysparm\_query value to query a specific user's email address.

    This example cURL request queries the Health and Safety User table and returns records associated with Abel Tuter's email address.

    ```
    curl "http://<your-instance>.servicenow.com/api/now/table/sn_imt_core_health_and_safety_user?sysparm_query=user.email%3Dabel.tuter%40example.com&sysparm_limit=1" \
    --request GET \
    --header "Accept:application/json" \
    --user 'username':'password'
    ```


## Result

The Employee Health and Safety Status application returns the Health and Safety User record associated with the email address in the request. The JSON payload contains the following data.
