# Create workplace reservations for multiple employees

Automatically generate workplace reservations in bulk for all employees assigned to a shift for a single day or multiple days.

## Before you begin

-   [Define shifts for your workplace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/create-shifts-wsd.md).
-   [Assign employees to a shift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/associate-employees-with-shifts-wsd.md).
-   [Associate areas and spaces with a shift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/associate-workspaces-with-shifts-wsd.md).
-   Ensure that the number of locations associated with the shift is greater than the number of employees assigned to the shift.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workplace Safety Management** &gt; **Shift Management** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open a shift for which you want to generate the bulk reservations.

3.  Select **Generate Bulk Reservation**.

4.  Select a date range from the **Start date** and **End date** fields.

    If you want to create the bulk reservation for a single day, you can set the start and end date to the same day. Otherwise, set a date range.

5.  Select **OK**.


## Result

Reservations for the employees in this shift are created for the locations associated with the shift for the provided dates. You can view these reservations by navigating to **Workplace Safety Management** &gt; **Space Reservations** &gt; **All Reservations**.
