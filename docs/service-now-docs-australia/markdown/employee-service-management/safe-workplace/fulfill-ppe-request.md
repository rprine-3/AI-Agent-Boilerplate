# Fulfill a request for PPE

View employee requests for personal protective equipment \(PPE\). Fulfill the requests to make sure that employees get the PPE they need to stay safe at the workplace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_ppe.ppe\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **PPE Inventory Management** &gt; **Requests**.

2.  Click the request that you want to work on.

3.  In the **State** field, select **Work in Progress**.

4.  In the **Stockroom** field, select the stockroom that you want the items to come from.

    When you select a stockroom, the **Manager** field is automatically populated with the manager for that stockroom. When you update the request, the **Assigned to** field is also automatically populated with that manager unless you specify another user.

5.  In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to assign to the employee.

    This number might be different from the requested quantity if the employee requested too many items, or if the stockroom doesn't have enough inventory to fulfill the request. If the stockroom doesn't have enough inventory, you will see an error message when you update the request so that you don't assign more items than you have in stock.

6.  Click **Update**.


## What to do next

When the employee receives their PPE, update the request state to **Closed Complete**. A record is added to the assignment log and the consumable state changes to Consumed.

If the request won't be fulfilled, update the state to **Closed Incomplete**.
