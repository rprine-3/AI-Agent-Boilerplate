# Making workplace reservations

Make workplace reservations in Workplace Core when you are ready to return to the office. You can reserve a workplace for a day or less directly or request a workplace for a specified period. Once a reservation request is approved and confirmed, you are notified about the reservation details.

## Reserving a workplace

As an employee, you can request a workplace reservation using Employee Center.

When making a reservation, you can choose an available space that you want to access or select an available area. If you have made a reservation for an area, you can work from any available space within that area when you return to the office.

You can select a shift of your choice from the shift schedules defined by your organization. If your organization doesn’t use shifts, you can select a custom time period. Depending on your organizational guidelines, your reservation request might require an approval.

**Note:** If you need a workplace for only a day or less, you can reserve it directly and don’t have to submit a request and get approval.

## Space reservation request states

After you submit a space reservation request, the status changes based on the action taken on it by your approving manager or the workplace manager.

-   If your manager hasn’t acted on your request, the state of the request remains Awaiting approval.
-   If your manager approves your request and the space availability is confirmed, the state of the request changes to Closed complete.
-   If your manager rejects your request, the state of the request changes to Closed incomplete.
-   If your manager approves your request but the space you requested for isn’t available for all or some days, the state of the request changes to Pending.

    You can follow up with your workplace manager to get a new space assigned and resolve your pending space request.

-   If you cancel your request, the state of the request changes to canceled.

## Email and push notifications

If you submit a space reservation request from the catalog item, or if a request is submitted on your behalf, you will receive an email notification about the request. If you have the Now® Mobile app, you will receive push notifications about your reservation requests.

The notification contains campus details, space details, and the reservation duration.

As an admin, you can create custom notifications for upcoming reservations by using the **sn\_wsd\_core\_reservation** table. You can also use the **sn\_wsd\_core.upcoming\_reservation** event to decide when the notification must be sent. For more information about notifications, see [System notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-notifications-landing.md).
