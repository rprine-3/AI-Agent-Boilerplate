# Configure Employee Health Screening

Set properties to specify the global maximum temperature thresholds in Fahrenheit and Celsius. Temperatures taken during a health screening are compared to the global temperature threshold, established by the company, to allow or deny entry.

Another property lets you decide whether to generate QR codes when a health verification is submitted. You can also determine whether to store temperature readings within the application, and establish overrides by location.

Add an email notification and configure an outreach notification for the daily health verification. Send the outreach notification on demand or as scheduled to employees before they return to the workplace. For more information, see [Send notifications for daily health verification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-outreach/send-daily-health-verif-notif-outreach.md).

## Set up Employee Health Screening properties

Decide whether you store temperatures recorded during screening events. Also set the maximum temperature threshold to use to determine whether it is safe for employees or visitors to enter the workplace.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_monitoring.monitoring\_admin or admin

### About this task

Employers remain solely responsible for complying with their legal obligations under applicable law, including data protection laws on collection, use, disclosure, and retention of personal data, and should enable, choose not to enable, or customize any functionality available within the application to meet the Employers’ specific requirements.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Health Screening** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  Set the following property values.

<table id="table_n1r_jl4_rlb"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Clear health verification dailysn\_imt\_monitoring.clear\_health\_verification\_daily

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is selected, the **Response** field on health verification records is reset to **No** every day at the specified time. If the Employee Health Verification Requirement is active, the employee's requirement status is reset to **Not Cleared**.This property is not enabled by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Time to reset health verificationssn\_imt\_monitoring.time\_to\_reset\_health\_verifications

</td><td>

Sets the time when health verification responses are reset to **No** each day. The reset uses the local time for each user. For example, if you enter `17:00:00`, a user in Seattle has their verification reset at 5:00pm Pacific time and a user in Boston has their verification reset at 5:00pm Eastern time. The default time is midnight.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Limit health verification submissions to once per day.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.limit\_health\_verification\_submission\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is selected, each employee can only submit the health verification once per day. If the **Yes/No** check box is cleared, there is no limit on the number of times per day that an employee can submit the health verification.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enforce cleared status as condition for Health Screening.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.enforce\_cleared\_status\_on\_screen\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** box is selected, each employee must have a **Cleared** status to gain entry to a location. If the **Yes/No** box is cleared, a user's health and safety status does not automatically deny entry.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Setting this value to true will track employee temperature.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.track\_temperature\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is cleared, the temperature thresholds entered are used only to determine whether the employee can enter. This information is not stored. By default, recording and storing temperatures is turned off.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Disable temperature check for vaccinated employees.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.disable\_temperature\_check\_for\_vaccinated\_employees\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** box is selected, vaccinated employees do not require a temperature check during health screening.**Note:** The **Temperature** field is hidden during health screening for vaccinated employees.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Setting this value to true will track employee PPE data.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.track\_ppe\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is cleared, the PPE values entered are used only to determine whether the employee can enter. This information is not stored.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Global property for employee temperature fever cutoff in Fahrenheit. Values at or above this temperature are considered a fever.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.temperature\_threshold\_fahrenheit\]

</td><td>

Set this threshold based on what you consider a safe temperature in Fahrenheit to allow returning employees into the workplace.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Global variable for employee temperature fever cutoff in Celsius. Values at or above this temperature are considered a fever.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.temperature\_threshold\_celsius\]

</td><td>

Set this threshold for Celsius as described in the previous entry.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Setting this value to true will track visitor temperature data.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.track\_visitor\_temperature\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is cleared, the temperature thresholds entered are used only to determine whether the visitor can enter. This information is not stored. By default, recording and storing temperatures is turned off.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Setting this value to true will track visitor PPE data.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.track\_visitor\_ppe\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is cleared, the PPE values entered are used only to determine whether the visitor can enter. This information is not stored.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Global property for visitor temperature fever cutoff in Fahrenheit. Values at or above this temperature are considered a fever.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.visitor\_temperature\_threshold\_fahrenheit\]

</td><td>

Set this threshold based on what you consider a safe temperature in Fahrenheit to allow visitors into the workplace.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Global variable for visitor temperature fever cutoff in Celsius. Values at or above this temperature are considered a fever.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.visitor\_temperature\_threshold\_celsius\]

</td><td>

Set this threshold for Celsius as described in the previous entry.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Setting this property to true will show QR code for entry.\[sn\_imt\_monitoring.show\_qr\_code\]

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is selected, a QR code is displayed when an employee agrees to the health verification form. A health monitor at an entry point scans the code to review the employee's health requirements status. **Note:** Requirements are created in the Employee Readiness Core application. For more information, see [Employee Health and Safety Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-readiness-core/employee-health-safety-status.md).

 The QR code can be printed or displayed on a mobile device with the Now Mobile app.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create entry request record when screener views Health Status record.sn\_imt\_monitoring.auto\_create\_request

</td><td>

If the **Yes/No** check box is selected, a record is created in the Request for Entry table \[sn\_imt\_monitoring\_request\_for\_entry\] every time that a user with the sn\_imt\_monitoring.monitoring\_user role views an employee's [health and safety status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/employee-readiness-core/employee-health-safety-status.md) by scanning the QR code or manually looking up the employee. If the employee's health and safety status is **Cleared**, the **Access Granted** field is set to **true** otherwise it is set to **false**.

 This property is not enabled by default.
