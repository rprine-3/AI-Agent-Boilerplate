# Employee Readiness Surveys

The ServiceNow® Employee Readiness Surveys application lets you evaluate the readiness of your workforce to return to the workplace by asking users to complete a survey.

Employee Readiness Surveys is an application that you install to use with Emergency Outreach. For information about Emergency Outreach and how surveys are sent via outreach notifications, see [Emergency Outreach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/emergency-outreach/emergency-outreach.md).

After you install the application, the check-in administrator for Emergency Outreach can view and edit the survey questions to suit your needs. New surveys can be added, for example, to evaluate users in different regions or address other concerns.

The check-in administrator sends the surveys to targeted audiences using the Emergency Outreach notification methods.

-   With the [Workplace Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-core/workplace-service-delivery-overview.md) application, prepare for the return of users by configuring and maintaining clean and socially distanced workspaces for them to use.
-   You can manage the inventory of safety equipment for your workforce with the [Workplace Personal Protective Equipment Inventory Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/safe-workplace/ppe-inventory-management.md) application.

All Safe Workplace suite applications are available in the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).
