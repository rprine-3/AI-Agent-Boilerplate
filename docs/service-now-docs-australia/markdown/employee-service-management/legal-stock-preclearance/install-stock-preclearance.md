# Install Legal Stock Preclearance

You can install the Legal Stock Preclearance application \(sn\_lg\_stock\_cp\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they aren’t already installed.

## Before you begin

**Note:**

The Legal Stock Preclearance application is installed automatically when you install the Legal Simple Compliance suite.

-   Verify that the application and all of its associated store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Review the [Legal Stock Preclearance](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/523a117673da2300844489b954f6a7d6) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Legal Stock Preclearance application \(sn\_lg\_stock\_cp\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can’t find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    Dependent plugins and applications are listed that are already installed, will be installed, or must be installed. If any plugins or applications need to be installed, you must install them before you can install Legal Stock Preclearance.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select the **Load demo data** check box.

    Demo data are the sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load the demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.
