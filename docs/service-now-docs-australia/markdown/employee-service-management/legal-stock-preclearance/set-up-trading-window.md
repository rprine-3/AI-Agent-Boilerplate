Exclude trading holidays

</td><td>

Option to exclude trading on holidays that fall within the trading window. Selecting this option extends the approval validity days by the number of holidays during the trading period.**Note:** By default, weekend days are excluded for calculating the validity due date.

 For example, say that a trading window opens from January 1 to January 31 and you have set the approval validity days to 10 days. If January 24 and 25 are trading holidays, then,

-   If the preclearance is approved on January 8, the approval validity is until January 22 \(10 days from January 8 + 4 days of two weekends\).
-   If the preclearance is approved on January 15, the approval validity is until January 31 instead of January 25 \(10 days + 4 days of two weekends + 2 holidays from January 15\).
-   If the preclearance is approved on January 21, the approval validity is until February 6 \(10 days + 2 holidays from January 20 + 4 days of two weekends\). However, as the trading window closes earlier than the validity of approval, the last date is January 31 rather than February 6.
