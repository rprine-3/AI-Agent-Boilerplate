# Enable a Health and Safety table for configuring report field mapping

Enable a Health and Safety table for report field mapping. You can then configure its mapping with your reporting PDF template, enabling safety agents to generate reports for records in this table.

## Before you begin

Verify that the application scope is selected as Health and Safety Core. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety administration** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  In the property **Report field mapping tables**, add the table name, for example, `sn_ohs_im_action`, to enable it for report field mapping.

    `sn_ohs_im_incident`, `sn_ohs_im_observation`, and `sn_ohs_im_injury_illness` tables are set as default value in this property.

3.  Select **Save**.


## Result

-   The table is available in the **Mapping table** field when configuring a report field mapping for this table.
-   The **Generate report** button becomes available in all records for this table.
-   Once a report field mapping is set up for this table, the **Generate report** button becomes available for all its records.

## What to do next

To generate a report for this table's records, you must configure its report field mapping.
