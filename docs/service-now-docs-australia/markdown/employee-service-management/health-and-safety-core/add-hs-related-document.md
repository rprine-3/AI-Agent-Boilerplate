# Add a new Health and Safety related document

Add and store documents Health and Safety related documents so that they can be easily and appropriately referenced in related records.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.document\_writer

## About this task

-   The ServiceNow® Document Management \(com.snc.platform\_document\_management\) plugin is installed with Health and Safety applications and enables you to manage your safety documents. For information on document management, see [Document repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/doc-mgt-view-documents-repo.md).
-   All Health and Safety documents are stored in the Health and Safety document \[sn\_ohs\_im\_document\_v2\] table. The previous **Standards and Documents** list and its associated table \[sn\_ohs\_im\_document\] have been deprecated. To access your existing safety documents, migrate them from the deprecated table into the new Health and Safety document \[sn\_ohs\_im\_document\_v2\] table. For more information, see [Migrate existing safety documents to the Document library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/hs-migrate-sync-existing-safety-document-docs-library.md).
