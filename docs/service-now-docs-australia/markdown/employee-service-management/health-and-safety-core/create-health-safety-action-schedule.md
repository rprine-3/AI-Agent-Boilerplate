# Create a Health and Safety action schedule

Create an action schedule to schedule actions across the organization such as learning activities and recurring tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.agent

## About this task

The action scheduler uses the condition builder to create and assign actions to individuals based on specified conditions.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the incident management icon \(\[Omitted image "list-icon-hs.png"\] Alt text: Incident Management icon.\).

3.  Select the **Action schedules** list and then **All**.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For information on field descriptions, see [Health and safety action schedule form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/hs-health-safety-action-schedule-form.md).

6.  In the **Assign to** field, add conditions to auto-assign the generated actions.

    This criteria is based on the Health and Safety profile \[sn\_ohs\_im\_health\_and\_safety\_profile\] table. It automatically adds users with the Health and Safety profile to the action records generated for this schedule.

    1.  Select **Set conditions**.

    2.  In the condition builder, define conditions to choose people this action should be assigned to, and select **Set**.

        You can choose fields from the Health and Safety profile table and dot-walk fields when selecting a field in the condition builder. For example, the following image shows the conditions to select users in the Warehouse department in Dublin.

        \[Omitted image "hs-affected-people-conditions.png"\] Alt text: Assign to conditions showing location and dot-walked condition for user's department name

7.  Select **Save**.


## Result

-   The action schedule is saved in the Action schedule \[sn\_ohs\_im\_action\_schedule\] table.
-   The **Actions** tab appears for the action schedule.
-   In the **Actions** tab, the action scheduler creates and auto-assigns actions based on the condition builder. An action schedule might generate multiple actions for people over time.
-   The created actions appear in the assigned user's **My Tasks** list on both the Employee Center and the Now Mobile app. From either location, the user can respond to the action and update its status.
