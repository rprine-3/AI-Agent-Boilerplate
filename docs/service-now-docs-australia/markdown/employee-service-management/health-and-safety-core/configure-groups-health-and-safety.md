# Configure groups for Health and Safety

Configure user groups for Health and Safety for assignment of safety records. You can assign roles to groups to provide access to all group members or assign roles to individual users.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.admin and admin

## About this task

User groups are used across most processes in the ServiceNow AI Platform for assigning work to teams and requesting approvals.

Any rule that is applied to a group is automatically assigned to group members. For example, roles and assignment rules applied to a group are automatically assigned to group members.

The following groups and their related roles are installed by default as part of the Health and Safety applications regardless of whether demo data is installed:

-   Health and Safety Meeting Managers
-   Health and Safety Meeting Minute Takers
-   Health and Safety Agents
-   Health and Safety Meeting Sensitive Content Group

These groups are available for assignment.
