# Add a Health and Safety visitor

Create a record for a Health and Safety visitor so that they can be easily referenced in the **Visitor** field on related records.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ohs\_im.hs\_profile\_writer

## About this task

A visitor is a person from outside the organization who came to visit the site.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health and Safety** &gt; **Health and Safety Workspace**.

2.  Select the configuration icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-config.png"\] Alt text: Configuration icon\).

3.  In the **Configuration** tab, select **Health and safety visitors** and then **All**.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |First name|Visitor's first name.|
    |Middle name|Visitor's middle name.|
    |Last name|Visitor's last name.|
    |Visitor ID|System-generated ID for the visitor.|
    |Phone number|Visitor's contact number.|
    |Company|Organization that the visitor works for.|
    |Email|Visitor's email address.|

6.  Select **Save**.

    A Visitor ID is generated for the visitor.

7.  Assign the Health and Safety user profile to the visitor record.

    For more information, see [Assign Health and Safety profile to a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/health-and-safety-core/assign-hs-profile-user.md).

    **Note:** Only a visitor with the assigned Health and Safety profile is available to select in the **Visitor** field on a form.


## Result

-   The visitor is listed in the **Health and safety visitors** list under **Configuration** and is saved in the Health and Safety visitor \[sn\_ohs\_im\_health\_and\_safety\_visitor\] table.

    **Note:** If the Workplace Visitor Management \(com.sn\_wsd\_visitor\) application is also installed on your instance, then the list of WSD visitors from the Visitor \[sn\_wsd\_visitor\_visitor\] table is automatically synchronized with the Health and Safety visitors list in the Health and Safety visitor \[sn\_ohs\_im\_health\_and\_safety\_visitor\] table. So, the WSD visitors also show up in the **Health and safety visitors** list and should be assigned the Health and Safety user profile.

-   The visitor's Health and Safety user profile is saved in the Health and Safety profile \[sn\_ohs\_im\_health\_and\_safety\_profile\] table.
-   The visitor is available to be referenced in the **Visitor** field on Health and Safety records such as safety incidents that the visitor is involved in.
