# Configure vaccine or vaccine booster types for Vaccination Status

Create or modify vaccine or vaccine booster types that people can use to report their vaccination status.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_imt\_vaccine.admin

## About this task

Vaccine and vaccine booster reporting requires Vaccine response definition records. Each record contains vaccine-specific information so that users can properly report their vaccination status with the correct type of vaccine. For example, you can create a record for single-dose or multi-dose vaccine and set the number of days between doses. These configurations determine the questions users must answer when reporting their vaccination. Vaccination Status contains several generic COVID-19 vaccines that do not require configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Vaccination status** &gt; **Vaccine response definitions**.

2.  Click **New** or open a record.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
