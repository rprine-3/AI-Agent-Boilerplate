# Configure the Investigative case narrative refinement skill in ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\)

Activate and customize the Investigative case narrative refinement skill in the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) application so that investigators can use the generative AI skills in CSM Configurable Workspace.

## About this task

The Investigative Case Management Case narrative refinement skill helps investigators refine a investigative case narrative or case summary for tone, length, and clarity. By activating and using this configuration, investigators can adjust the case summary or narrative with one of several options: Casual, Formal, Shorten, or Elaborate.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Some generative AI skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. The default behavior works as follows:

-   **New customers**

    When you install an AI product, designated generative AI skills, AI agents, or agentic workflows are turned on automatically.

-   **Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Zurich Patch 4\)**

    There is no change to skills, agents, or agentic workflows that are currently enabled and customized.

    An AI asset is turned on if:

    -   The AI plugin is installed, but the asset was never turned on.
    -   An admin has never adjusted roles for the skill.
    An AI asset is not turned on if:

    -   The asset was previously turned on, and then turned off again.
    -   An admin has adjusted roles for the asset.

For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

-   Confirm that the following applications and plugins are installed:

    -   ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\)
    -   Investigative Case Management
    **Note:** AI Admin Hub \(sn\_nowassist\_admin\) and ServiceNow Otto for Platform \(sn\_genai\_platform\) plugins must be installed.

-   Perform this task in your ServiceNow instance, ensuring the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) Application scope is selected.
-   Role required: admin

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **Experiences**.

2.  In the side panel workflow list, select **ServiceNow Otto Context Menu**, and select the Configurations related list.
