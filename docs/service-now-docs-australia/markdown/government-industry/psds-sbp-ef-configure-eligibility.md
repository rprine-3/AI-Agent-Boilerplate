# Configure Eligibility Rules Engine Policies in Social Benefits Playbook

Use the Social Benefits Playbook Eligibility Rules Engine, powered by Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\), to manage the life cycle of a policy and create, update, review, and execute policies. In the Policy Home of the CRM Workspace, you can create, remove, and update the policies used for determining eligibility for an application routed through the Social Benefits Playbook.

You can define and manage your eligibility rules engine policies in a single management console, the Policy Management Home in CRM Workspace.

Here, you can:

-   Create policies.
-   Review existing policies.
-   Assess and implement changes to each policy.
-   Determine if a policy should be used as the template for another policy.
-   Understand why a policy may not be working as expected.

You can create any number of policies, which can be updated as required.

## Create an eligibility policy using the Social Benefits Playbook Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\) Eligibility Rules Engine​

Create an eligibility policy using Social Benefits Playbook Eligibility Rules Engine​.

### About this task

Use Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\) policies to build out the logic that will determine eligibility and benefits. Policies can be saved as templates to quick-start policy creation. You can create a policy from scratch using Policy Management, and define the logic for that policy using the Policy Builder tool. Policy logic is a set of conditions that is used for determining whether or not an applicant is eligible for one or more of the social benefit programs offered by your agency. You can set conditions for the policy using the condition fields.
