</table>## Before you begin

Install the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) plugin \(sn\_psds\_gen\_ai\), and ensure that it is up to date.

Role required: admin, sn\_gsm\_ai\_agents.admin

To access AI agents for use with Public Sector:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Overview**.

2.  Select **Create and manage** &gt; **AI agents**.

3.  Under AI agents, select and activate all the AI agents one by one to make them available in the ServiceNow Otto panel.

4.  Select **Define the specialty**, review the fields, and confirm that the AI agent meets your requirements.

    If it doesn't meet your requirements, you can edit the AI agent. To modify the AI agent, [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements. You can activate the AI agent template by making triggers active and setting the display settings to include the ServiceNow Otto panel.

    **Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

5.  Select **Add tools and information** to review the skills, scripts, and tools available for the AI agent to perform its role.

6.  Select **Define Security Controls** to review:

    -   User access: Users who can access and interact with the AI agent \(an ACL is generated automatically\).
    -   Data access: The user identity that the agent runs as, which determines roles and data access permissions.
7.  Select **Add triggers** and configure conditions that start the AI agent.

    Triggers can include record conditions, schedules, or inbound email.

    For more information, see [Add a trigger to an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/add-trigger-aia.md).

8.  Select **Channels and status** to choose the channels where this AI agent will be available for users to initiate interactions, and set its availability status.

    For more information, see [Select channels and status for an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/channels-access-aia.md).

9.  Select **Save and test**.

    On this page, you can test how the AI agent completes a task.


## What to do next

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

Use the Testing playground to [Manually test the execution of an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-ai-agent.md) using example utterances.

If activation fails, check roles and skill configuration.
