# Life cycle of a Public Service case

A public service request case within one of the three Public Sector Digital Services playbook applications can be in one of several states as it progresses through the fulfillment cycle.

## Public Service request case stages

A public service request case has four stages:

-   Intake
-   Review
-   Process
-   Decision

As a public service request case moves through the stages listed above and toward a resolution, the case status is updated. Stage and status are related to each other as described in the following table.

-   **Reject Solution**: Reject the solution proposed by the agent. The case state changes to **Open**.

</td><td>

</td><td>

After proposing a solution, the agent waits for a constituent response. -   If the constituent clicks **Accept Solution**, the case state changes from **Resolved** to **Closed**.
-   If the constituent clicks **Reject Solution**, the state changes from **Resolved** to **Open**, and the agent must propose another solution.

 Closing a case as an agent or agent manager requires comments to be added to the **Resolution notes** field. This is not required when a customer closes a case.

 A case cannot be updated once it is closed.
