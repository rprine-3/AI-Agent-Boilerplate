# Configure pre-eligibility questions in Grants Management

The Grants Management Program Setup enables grant program managers to use decision trees to define a series of pre-eligibility questions to check if the applicants qualify for the program.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_svc\_appl\_pgm\_mg.grant\_program\_manager, sn\_gsm\_grnt\_mgmt.grant\_admin, admin

The Grants Management incorporates the use of pre-eligibility criteria, a series of questions that may be posed to an applicant to determine whether they are eligible to apply for a grant. The purpose is to deflect proposals in which the applicant is not eligible to obtain a grant.

The Eligibility &amp; Screening activity allows the user to either select an existing decision tree or create a new decision tree with a series of pre-eligibility questions to check if the applicants qualify for the program. Note: there can only be one decision tree per Grant Program.

You can configure the pre-eligibility questionnaire in one of two ways:

-   By navigating directly to the **Decision Tree \(ga\_decision\_tree\)** table and following steps to create a new decision tree
-   Through the **Eligibility and screening**activity during the Grant Program creation process, where you are provided with the option to either:
    -   Select a decision tree that an admin has already created by selecting the search icon in the Decision tree field, or
    -   Create a new decision tree by selecting **Open the Decision Trees list**. Here, you can configure a new decision tree and define the associated pre-eligibility questions.

To configure the Pre-Eligibility questions for a new Grant Program using a decision tree:

## Procedure

1.  Set the scope to **Grants Management Playbook**.

2.  In the Decision Tree \(ga\_decision\_tree\) table, select **New** to open a new Decision Tree record form where you can define the details of your decision tree.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

4.  Unselect the checkbox next to **Show a dismiss button**.

5.  Select **Submit** to create the decision tree record.

6.  Select **Open in Builder** to open the Decision Tree builder, where you can add questions, define branching logic, and set eligibility criteria.

7.  Select the **New** node and enter the Node name, then select the relevant reference table.

    Enter `PreEligibility` as the Node name, and select Grants Management Case as the reference table.

8.  Select **Add question** and enter the desired Question.

9.  Select **Choice** in the Type of answer field, and provide options `Yes` and `No`.

10. Select **Save and Close**.

11. Select the **+** icon below the Pre-Eligibility node to add a new path and node.

12. Select **New Path** to define a branching path from the Pre-Eligibility node.

    This will be the Eligible Path.

13. Select **Submit** to save the new decision tree.

14. Set the Path name to **Eligible Path**.

15. Define the conditions by selecting the questions and entering their answers.

16. Select **Save and close** to save the path configuration.

17. Select **Add node** under the Eligible Path, then select **Propose a guidance as an outcome**, then select **Continue**.

18. Set the Node name to **Eligible**, and set the guidance as **Grants Pre-Eligibility**.

19. Select the check box next to **Eligible**, then select **Save and close**.

20. Set the Guidance for **Non-Eligible Path** and enter the Node name as **Not Eligible**.

21. Select **Grants Pre-Eligibility** under Guidance, and unselect the checkbox for **Eligible**.

22. Select **Save and Close**.

23. Select **Activate** to publish the decision tree for use within the Grant Program.

When applicants proceed to answer eligibility questions, they are presented with the questionnaire that you have just created using the decision tree. Based on their responses:

-   \[Omitted image "psds\_gm\_pre\_eligible.png"\] Alt text: pre-eligibility questions view

    If eligible, they will see a success message and the option to proceed with their proposal.

-   \[Omitted image "psds\_gm\_pre\_not\_eligible.png"\] Alt text: pre-eligibility questions view

    If not eligible, a message will indicate that they may not be eligible and suggest reviewing their answer.
