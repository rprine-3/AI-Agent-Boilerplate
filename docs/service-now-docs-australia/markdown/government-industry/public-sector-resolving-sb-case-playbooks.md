# Resolving a social benefits case using Social Benefits Playbook

You can use playbooks to create cases and to complete the tasks and activities that are needed to resolve specific types of cases.

**Note:** Verify that the Social Benefits Playbook application, which is separate from the Public Sector Digital Services Core application, has been installed and configured. For instructions, see [Install and configure the Social Benefits Playbook application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/configuring-social-benefit-playbook.md).

By default, the following stages are available to you as a government service agent in the Social Benefits Playbook in the CRM Workspace.

-   Intake
-   Review
-   Processing
-   Decision

## Case Stages in Social Benefits Playbook

The Social Benefits Playbook experience starts with the **Intake** stage. This stage is the default playbook stage for a new social benefits request case.

Use this playbook stage to gather and confirm information about the applicant, the social benefit program being applied for, and whether the applicant is eligible for this type of social benefit program. You can also request additional information from the applicant at this stage, upload additional documents, add additional beneficiaries, and schedule a interview, if needed.

If the case was submitted by a constituent through the Government Service Portal, the constituent will be able to upload documents, review proposed benefits, and respond to interview requests before the case continues. At the end of the Intake stage, agents must review and verify the information provided before proceeding.

The playbook continues with the **Review** stage. In this stage, agents must review and verify the information provided, verify supporting documents and credentials \(and flag any for follow-up\), check for duplicate requests, and set up any interviews needed for social benefit program approval. You can move the case to the next stage when all documents have been verified and there are no pending case tasks.

The playbook continues with the **Process** stage. In this stage, the agent proposes their decision. The case might then be routed to a higher-tier agent, who can assess the entire application, create any additional case tasks, request or perform additional interviews, add or request additional information, or simply approve or deny based on the information provided. Once requests for any additional information and any open case tasks are complete and all agents have reached a decision, the case is moved to the **Decision** stage.

The final stage of the Social Benefits Playbook is the **Decision** stage, where the status of the decision is relayed to the constituent. The status of the social benefit application is changed to **Granted**, and the social benefit program can be routed to the constituent. A notification is sent to the applicant via the Government Service Portal, letting them know that their application has been has approved.
