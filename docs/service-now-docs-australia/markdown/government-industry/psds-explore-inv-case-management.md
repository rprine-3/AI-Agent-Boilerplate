Investigative Case Management is a process solution for government investigative agencies to organize, track, and resolve investigations at all levels of government, across multiple case types. Whether the case involves fraud, organized crime, public safety incidents, or regulatory violations, investigative agencies can use ICM a structured way to manage leads, manage evidence, coordinate across roles, and see an investigation through. Investigative Case Management helps provide investigators with the structure they need to revisit facts, make connections across cases, and manage a web of people, organizations, vehicles, and physical evidence simultaneously. Agencies can use ICM for multiple investigation case types, such as:

-   Fraud, waste, and abuse
-   Corruption and misconduct
-   Public safety investigations
-   Regulatory and compliance violations
-   Supply chain resource diversion
-   Child Welfare

Designed for government investigative agencies at the federal, state, and local level, Investigative Case Management aims to provide a complex data ecosystem that allows centralized visibility across every case, entity, and piece of evidence on a single platform.

## Key Features

Key features of Investigative Case Management include:

-   **Entity Management**

    The Investigative Entity Management feature provides investigative agencies with a structured system that enables the creation and management of master indexes for persons, locations, organizations, vehicles, and property associated with an investigation, as well as a dedicated firearm master index. It enables creation and management of incident and investigation event timelines, role assignments, and entity linking within case workspaces.

    With Entity Management, investigators can:

    -   Create common master indices for Persons, Locations, Organizations, Vehicles, Property associated with the case.
    -   Create and manage a centralized Firearms master index to unify firearm records across investigations, storing critical identifiers, traits, and historical data in a dedicated Firearms tab and allowing firearms to be linked to related entities \(persons, events, cases, evidence, organizations, locations, property\) within the case.
    -   Create incident and investigation event records to help capture the timeline for important events that happen during the investigation, and the timeline of the investigation itself.
    -   View audit logs for all firearm record changes and relationship updates.
    -   Associate multiple entities to each other and to the case, as well as manage all entities and their relationships to the case.
    For more information on Entity Management, see [Using Entity Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-explore-icm-entity-management.md).

-   **Evidence Management**

    The ICM Investigative Evidence Management feature users to upload or log evidence—such as documents, images, or physical items— and and map them to the relevant investigations, subjects, events, locations, vehicles, organizations, and properties, capturing key metadata like type, source, date received, notes, and optional custody tracking. With Evidence Management, investigators have a single, centralized interface for viewing and managing all evidence associated with a case, regardless of where it is physically stored, ensuring evidence can be consistently classified, accessed, and associated with relevant investigative records.

    With Entity Management, investigators can:

    -   Create evidence record objects to track and link evidence to investigations.
    -   Link to external evidence storage solutions via a configurable URL field.
    -   Introduce a digital chain of custody feature that tracks the movement, transfer, and status changes of evidence records with timestamps and responsible personnel for each action.
    -   Enable relationship mapping between pieces of evidence and all relevant case entities \(People, Locations, Vehicles, Events, Property, and Organizations\).

    Synthesize case narratives, entities, evidence, and activity into a condensed, structured summary using the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) Investigative Case summarization skill, allowing agents to grasp case context, respond to inquiries, propose solutions, and integrate generated resolution information for investigative outcomes into the case record. This skill integrates into the ICM workspace, allowing agents to generate a summary directly from the case record page.

    Refine the case narrative before supervisory review using the ICM Narrative refinement AI skill. This skill, accessible through the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) context menu directly on the case record page, integrates into the ICM workspace.


## Key Personas

Key personas of Investigative Case Management include:

-   the Investigator, who leads or participates in the investigation from initiation to resolution, and has a team of experts &amp; leadership.
-   a Witness, who wants to be able to report a potential crime to an investigative agency. An investigator can create a case from a witness complaint.
-   an Attorney, who prepare cases for court and advises on legal compliance and case strategy. An investigator can create a case based on information received from an Attorney's office.
