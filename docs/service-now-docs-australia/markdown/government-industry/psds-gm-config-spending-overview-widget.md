# Configure the Spending Overview Widget and Filter pills

Use script includes to configure the **Spending Overview** widget and filter pills on the **Funding Allocation** tab for the rolling grant approvals feature. Admins can add, remove, relabel, and reorder chart widgets and filter pills, and create custom ones to match program requirements.

## Before you begin

The **Spending Overview** widget and filter pills are available on the **Funding Allocation** tab starting with Grants Management version 1.31. Verify that the grant program is open and in an active state before making configuration changes. For information about using script includes, see [Use script includes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/zurich/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.html?section=c_UseScriptIncludes).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The **Spending Overview** widget is a UI Builder component on the **Funding Allocation** tab. It contains two built-in chart areas: **Overall Spending** and **Decisions in Progress**. You can add custom chart widgets to the panel alongside the built-in charts.

The filter pills appear in the **Proposals** tab under the **Scored Proposals** list. They provide quick-access views by proposal status. The default filter pills are:

-   **All**
-   **Undecided**
-   **Marked**
-   **Pending approval**
-   **Returned**
-   **Decided**

You can relabel, reorder, add, remove, or create custom filter pills with custom filter conditions by configuring the `FundingAllocationUtil` and `FundingAllocationUtilImpl` script includes.

You can also use UI Builder to configure the Funding allocation tab widgets of the Grants management playbook. In UI Builder, navigate to **Page collections** &gt; **Grant Program Record Page Collection** and select the **Funding allocation** page. Configure the values in the **Funding allocation review task record page** and the **Funding allocation tab page**. For more information, see [Working in UI Builder](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/application-development/ui-builder/using-ui-builder.html).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Activity subscriptions** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Script Includes**.

2.  Open the `FundingAllocationUtilImpl` script include.

3.  Configure the values by overriding the methods and add them to the `FundingAllocationUtil` script.

4.  Select **Save** to apply your changes.

    Once you reload the page, the **Funding Allocation** tab reflects the updated widget layout and filter pill configuration for all users with access to the grant program workspace.


## What to do next

To verify the configuration, open a grant program record and select the **Funding Allocation** tab. Confirm that the **Spending Overview** widget and filter pills display as configured.
