# Configure the GOV.UK Design System Service Portal Case Details \(standard ticket\) page

Configure individual request types to display case details, the request-specific information shown to constituents when viewing submitted requests. They can view case statuses and request history, and communicate with caseworkers and agents.

The standard ticket case details page provides UK citizens with updates on their submitted cases. Citizen users can view case status, last updated timestamp, and communication history on the Case Detail Page.

To display the related information, you can configure the standard ticket page for requested services on the GDS Service Portal. This configuration verifies a consistent experience when viewing submitted requests in the portal. For example, in the GDS Service Portal, you can access the ticket page for a requested service using the **Your Cases** option from the main menu header.

The information displayed in each section of a standard ticket page depends on the individual request type. If a configurable section has no specified values or if a user doesn’t have access to the information, it isn’t visible. For new GDS Service Portal instances, the standard ticket page is available by default.

## Header Widget

By default, this header widget instance displays the following information on the standard ticket page for a submitted service request:

    **Note:** Instead of the State field, you can also configure any other field that represents the state of the ticket.


To customize the content of this header widget instance, navigate to **All****Service Portals****Service Portal Configuration****Designers**. Confirm that **UK Government Portal** is the portal selected.

## Info Widget

If configured, this section displays the following regions for a submitted request:

-   Case description with the short description, and optionally the description.

    **Note:** You can map the Description field to any other field on the record.

-   Actions region
-   Case details

## Tab Widget

This widget displays the following tabs for a submitted request, allowing constituents to switch between views and navigate case sections. Each tab is a widget instance.

-   Activity
-   Attachments

You can configure the tabs for standard ticket page. For more information, see [Configure tabs for standard ticket page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-tabs-for-standard-ticket-page.md).
