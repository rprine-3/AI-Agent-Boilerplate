# Resolving a license and permit case using License and Permit Playbook

You can use playbooks to create cases and to complete the tasks and activities that are needed to resolve specific types of cases.

**Note:** Verify that the License and Permit Playbook application, which is separate from the Public Sector Digital Services Core application, has been installed and configured. For instructions, see [Install and configure the License and Permit Playbook application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/configuring-license-permit-playbook.md).

By default, the following stages are available to you as a government service agent in the License and Permit Playbook in the CRM Workspace.

-   Intake
-   Review
-   Processing
-   Decision

## Case Stages in License and Permit Playbook

The License and Permit Playbook experience starts with the **Intake** stage. This stage is the default playbook stage for a new license and permit request case.

Use this playbook stage to gather and confirm information about the requester, the license or permit being requested, whether the requester is eligible for this type of license or permit, and whether they are exempt from the fees associated with the license or permit. You can also request additional information from the requester at this stage, upload additional documents, add additional comments, add related parties, and schedule a consultation through the work notes.

If the case was submitted by a constituent through the Government Service Portal, the constituent will be able to upload documents, and review the fees and disclaimers associated with the license or permit application before the case continues. At the end of the Intake stage, agents must enter details about the payment that was processed or waived.

The playbook continues with the **Review** stage. In this stage, you can do the initial troubleshooting on the case, verify supporting documents and credentials, and set up any inspections needed for license or permit approval. You can move the case to the next stage when details are provided in the work notes on the inspections \(open work orders or work performed during\) or verifying documents.

The playbook continues with the **Process** stage. In this stage, the case might be routed to a higher-tier agent, who can assess the entire request for the license or permit, approve a fee exemption, create case tasks, request or perform additional inspections, and add or request additional information.

Once requests for any additional information and any open case tasks are complete, the case is moved to the **Propose Decision** activity. Additional information may be solicited from the requester at any time during this stage. After the decision, often made by a higher-tier agent, is proposed, it is routed to the original agent, who may request or perform their own additional inspections, and add or request more information. This agent then has the option of confirming or vetoing the decision proposal of the other agent.

The final stage of the License and Permit Playbook is the **Decision** stage. At the Decision stage, the status of the license or permit is changed to **Granted**, and the license or permit can be generated and routed to the constituent. A notification is sent to the requester that lets them know that license or permit approval has been has obtained and the requested license or permit has been digitally generated within the playbook, and delivered via the Government Service Portal.

The requester can then either accept or reject the license or permit. If the requester accepts the outcome, the case is automatically closed. If the requester rejects the solution, the case is reopened, and the agent must propose another outcome. A request for a license or permit may also be conditionally approved, or denied. The agent can specify why in the work notes.
