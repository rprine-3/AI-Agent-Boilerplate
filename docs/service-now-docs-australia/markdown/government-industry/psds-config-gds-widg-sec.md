# Configure widget security in the GDS Service Portal by role

Configure widget security to verify that your GDS Service Portal widgets are being accessed only by the intended audience.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sp\_admin

## About this task

There are several ways to configure widget security:

-   Restrict the widget to users with a login only \(authenticated users\)
-   Restrict the widget to users with certain roles only
-   Restrict which tables a public widget can access and return data from for guest \(unauthenticated\) users

When you configure widget security, configure the page security accordingly so that users can access the widget via the page on which it appears. For more information, see [Configure page security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-gds-page-sec.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Widgets**.

2.  Open the record of the widget to configure.

3.  On the form, configure the widget security.
