# Summarize an investigative case using the ServiceNow Otto for PSDS Investigative case summarization skill

Generate a summary directly from the investigative case workspace to help you understand the case context using the investigative case summarization skill in the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) application.

## About this task

Investigators can utilize investigative case summarization to gain contextual understanding of the investigation throughout its lifecycle. The investigative case summarization skill auto-generates summaries that distill key details from work notes, comments, and other case data, which can help agents resolve cases faster.

The Investigative Case Management case summarization component appears on the case record page, and is collapsed by default. When an agent generates a case summary by selecting **Summarize**, the component expands to display the summary information, including a description of the issue, the actions taken, and the next steps. For longer summaries, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the content.

The case summarization skill enables you to do the following actions:

-   Select Summarize to create a summary of the case details.
-   Select Share to work notes to copy the summary text to the activity stream.
    -   Review the summary text in the Share to work notes pop-up dialog and modify the text as needed.
    -   Select Save to work notes on the pop-up dialog to add the text to the activity stream.
-   Select the refresh icon in the component footer to refresh the text and get the latest summary.

After generating a summary, you can:

-   Review the summary information and edit as needed.
-   Provide feedback on the generated summary.
-   Add the summary information to the case work notes.
-   Copy the summary information to the clipboard.

**Note:** You can also generate a case summary on demand from the ServiceNow Otto panel. .
