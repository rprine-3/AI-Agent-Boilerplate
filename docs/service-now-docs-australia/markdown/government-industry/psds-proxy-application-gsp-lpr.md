# Create a License and Permit request on behalf of a constituent or business

Government service agents can create requests on behalf of constituents or business from the Government Service Portal. Constituents can also create and submit license/permit requests on behalf of someone else through the Government Service Portal.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_gsm.constituent\_agent, sn\_gsm.relationship\_agent, sn\_gsm.government\_service\_manager, sn\_gsm.business\_agent, sn\_gsm.agency\_constituent\_agent, sn\_gsm.agency\_manager, sn\_gsm.agency\_agent

## Procedure

1.  In the CRM Workspace, navigate to **Lists** &gt; **License &amp; Permit Requests** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select **New** to create a case.

3.  Select **General License/Permit** under the Service dropdown, and **New License/Permit Request** under the Case Type dropdown.

4.  Select **Create Case**.

    The License and Permit Playbook opens and initiates the first activity for collecting the request details.

5.  On the **Enter Application Details** activity card, confirm the applicant's eligibility and select **Continue**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields with the requester's contact information and details of the request.

7.  Under Representation, select the check box for **Requesting on behalf of someone else**.

8.  Enter the name of the constituent or business that the requester is submitting the application on behalf of, and select **Save**.

    **Note:** All license/permit co-applicants must have a business contact account associated with your business to be included on a license/permit application. Each contact can create an account by registering on the Government Service Portal, or a government service agent can create a business contact record for them. For information on how agents can create a business contact record from information entered in a License and Permit application, see [Create a business contact account from license or permit application data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-multi-party-create-business-contact.md).

9.  Select any add-ons, such as permit endorsements.

    You may add more than one. The pricing of the license or permit varies with each selection or combination of selections.

10. Review the fees associated with the requester's choices.

    The fee total changes dynamically based on the options selected. If the constituent or requester is fee exempt, select the **Fee Waiver** check box and enter a justification to claim an exemption for them.

11. Select **Submit** to move to the next activity.

12. Add any additional related parties.

    Related parties may include business partners, managers, or any business contact who may need access to this license/permit. They must be contacts already registered on the Government Service Portal and associated with your business.

13. Select **Mark Complete**.


## Result

A case is created with the license or permit request information and all related parties, and is now routed to the constituent via the Government Service Portal. In the Government Service Portal, agents can upload any applicable identity documents, credentials, or supporting documentation required for this license/permit request. The case continues once the constituent has uploaded these documents.
