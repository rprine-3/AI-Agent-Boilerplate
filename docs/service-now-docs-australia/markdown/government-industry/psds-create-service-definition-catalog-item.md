# Configure service definition catalog items for License and Permit Playbook application

Create a service definition for use with the License and Permit Playbook in Public Sector Digital Services.

## Before you begin

Service definitions are records used to store details about a service that is available to end customers. You can create service definitions for each license/permit service offered by your government agency.

**Important:** After upgrade to Public Sector Digital Services v8.0, you will now be required to create a Service Definition for every previous Service Offered record. The deprecation of Services Offered means that Service Definitions now must be created for every Service that your agency offers. For more information, see [Services Offered and Services Received Migration Guidance](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1559449).
