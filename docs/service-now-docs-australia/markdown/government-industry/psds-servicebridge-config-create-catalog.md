# Create remote service catalog items in Service Exchange for Providers for Public Sector Digital Services

As a government agency provider, you can create remote catalogs to automate the task fulfillment process for constituents that are using the Government Service Portal. By using remote catalogs, agency providers can maintain the development of shared service catalogs on their instances and provide consumers with native catalog items in their instances remotely.

## About this task

Remote record producers in Service Exchange for Providers are service request catalog items that are remotely published to consumer instances, and contain the variables that determine the information that a consumer can or must provide to submit a request. They enable your consumer to request provider services through their service catalog by auto-generating a Provider Task record on the provider's instance and triggering a Create Case, Create Incident, or Create Change Request fulfillment task when a request is submitted.

By using remote catalogs, agency providers can maintain the development of shared service catalogs on their instances, and provide constituents with native catalog items in their instances remotely. The Remote Catalog is maintained on the Provider’s instance and made available selectively through Authorized Users.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** Ensure that the catalog scope is set to Global.

## Procedure

1.  Log into the provider instance and navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Bridge Provider** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Remote Catalog Items**.

2.  Select **New** to create a new catalog item.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
