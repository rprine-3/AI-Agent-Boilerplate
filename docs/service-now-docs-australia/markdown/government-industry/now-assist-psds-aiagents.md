# Standalone AI Agents in Public Sector Digital Services

Use standalone agents to achieve specific automated outcomes with the Public Sector Digital Services AI Agent Collection application. ​

**Important:** In the **Define availability** screen for the AI agent, make sure that the **Status** field is enabled to activate the AI agent.

The following table describes the available AI agents in the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) application.

</table>**Note:** Verify that AI Search is enabled on the instance before configuring the agents.

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:**

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).

Enable security implementation to execute AI agents and agentic workflows through Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) and user identities. ACLs provide the Run As capability to let agents and agentic workflows execute actions either as a dynamic user or as an AI user. For more information, see [Implement access control in AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-security-implementation.md)

**Important:** By default, all agent workflow and AI agent records are read-only.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first [duplicate the agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. The triggers for each agentic workflow must be unique. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn’t necessary.
-   Azure OpenAI is recommended for ITSM agentic workflows. For information on Large Language Models \(LLMs\) for AI agents and agentic workflows, see [Select the LLM for AI agents and agentic workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/select-aia-llm.md).
