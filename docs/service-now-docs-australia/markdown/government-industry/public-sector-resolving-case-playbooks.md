# Resolving a service request case by using playbooks in Public Sector Digital Services

You can use playbooks to create cases and to complete the tasks and activities that are needed to resolve specific types of cases.

**Note:** Verify that the Service Request Playbook application, which is separate from the Public Sector Digital Services Core application, has been installed and configured. For instructions, see [Install and configure the Service Request Playbook application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/configuring-service-request-playbook.md).

By default, the following stages are available to you as a government service agent in the Service Request Playbook in the CRM Workspace.

-   Intake
-   Review
-   Processing
-   Decision

## Stages in a Service Request Playbook

The Service Request Playbook experience starts with the Intake stage. This stage is the default playbook stage for a new service request case. Use this playbook stage to gather information about the requester and the complaint for the service request case. You can also request additional information from the requester.

The playbook continues with the Review stage. In this stage, you can do the initial troubleshooting on the case, check for similar or duplicate case requests, and determine what services need to be rendered and if a field service agent needs to be dispatched. For more information on the Public Sector Digital Services integration with Field Service Management, see [Integration with Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-integration-fsm.md).

The playbook continues with the Process stage. In this stage, you can assess resources, request resource approval, create case tasks, and add or request new information before case resolution begins. If a field service agent needs to be dispatched to the service request location, you can create a work order during the process stage. The case status changes to Work in Progress after the field service agent begins work on the service request case. After work has been completed, the case is moved to the Decision stage.

The final stage of the Service Request Playbook is the Decision stage. At the Decision stage, the state of the case is updated from Work in Progress to Ready for Decision after an agent sends in a decision. A notification is sent to the requester that lets them know that a decision has been reached. The requester can then either accept or reject the solution. If the requester accepts the solution, the case is automatically closed. If the requester rejects the solution, the case is reopened, and the agent must propose another solution.

For more information, see [Configure the Similar Records Activity UI in Service Request Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-srp-configure-similar-records.md).

    -   If the current case is not a duplicate of any of the cases displayed in the Similar Records UI, select **Existing Case Check Done** to move to the next activity.
