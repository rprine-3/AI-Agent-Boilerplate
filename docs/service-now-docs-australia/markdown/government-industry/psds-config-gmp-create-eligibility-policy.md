# Create an eligibility policy in Grants Management using PaCE

Create an eligibility policy using Grants Management Eligibility Rules Engine​ to model eligibility rules that can be used to evaluate grants cases.

## About this task

Use Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\) policies to build out the logic that will determine eligibility and grants. Policies can be saved as templates to quick-start future policy creation. You can create a policy from scratch using Policy Management, and define the logic for that policy using the Policy Builder tool. Policy logic is a set of conditions that is used for determining whether or not an applicant is eligible for one or more of the grant programs offered by your agency. You can set conditions for the policy using the condition fields.

**Note:** Published policies cannot be edited. To edit a published policy, select **Create a copy**.

-   View version details
-   Create a new version
-   Switch from low-code to the code editor
-   Save the policy as a template
-   Compare versions
-   Duplicate policy versions

## Result

An eligibility policy is now created, and is ready to be mapped to one of more grant models of the Grants Management. See [Map an PaCE eligibility policy to a grant model using Grants Management Eligibility Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-gmp-map-eligibility-policy.md) for information on how to map the published policy to a specific grant.
