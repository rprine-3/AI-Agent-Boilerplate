</table>The default theme for the GDS Service Portal employs Gov.UK design system standards, and includes the official Gov.UK color palette \(primary, secondary, background, text colors\). To choose other colors, navigate to the Theme colors tab. The theme preview updates as you make changes. Changes made to the theme colors in the Branding Editor appear in the CSS variables field of the portal form in the platform UI.

## Add a header or footer

To add a header or footer to your portal, you must configure it through the theme of the portal.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Configuration** &gt; **Portal Tables** &gt; **Themes**.
2.  Select the theme you want to add the header or footer to.
3.  In the header or footer field, select the header or footer you want to use for your portal.

    By default, the toolkit provides a GDS-compliant base system Stock Header or Sample Footer widgets that you may select for reuse.

4.  Optional: Select **Fixed Header** or **Fixed Footer** to lock the header or footer in one place so when users scroll up or down they remain in the same location on the page.
5.  To configure the appearance of the header, in the Service Portal configuration page, open the Branding Editor.
6.  Under the **Theme Colors** tab, use the color selectors in the Navbar section to control the colors in the header.

For information on creating and customizing the header/footer menu, see [Create a portal header menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-header-menu.md).

## Customizing the Portal CSS

Changes made in the Branding Editor or to specific components of the portal \(such as a widget or a page container\) override any customizations made to the theme. If your portal needs more customization than Branding Editor can provide, you can edit the CSS of the existing theme. For information on how to customize the portal theme using CSS, see [Create a portal theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_CustomCSS.md).
