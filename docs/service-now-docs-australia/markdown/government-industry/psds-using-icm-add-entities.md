# Add entities to an investigative case using Investigative Case Management Entity Management

Add an associated entity to an investigative case for increased tracking and traceability surrounding all assets related to the case.

You can add the following entities to a case using the Investigative Case Management Entity Management feature.

## Add an associated person to an Investigative case

Add an associate person to an investigative case. This person can be a subject, victim, witness, or another category.

### Before you begin

Role required: icm.investigator, supervisory\_agent

### About this task

**Note:** Not all of the fields are mandatory, but there is a minimum amount of information required for the record to be considered complete and thus searchable within the case workspace. For more information on entity completeness rules, see [Completeness Rules by Investigative Case Management Entity Type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-icm-ref-entity-man-completeness-rules.md).

**Note:** Adding a person through the Persons tab does not affect roles at the user level.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the CRM Workspace and select **My active cases**.

    Alternatively, you can select a case using the CRM Workspace Lists menu by selecting **Lists** &gt; **Investigative Cases** &gt; **All** and selecting the case.

2.  Select the case you wish to add a person entity record to.

3.  Select the **Persons** tab.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields with identifying information.

5.  Enter a brief description of the relationship this person has to the case, then select **Save**.

    The person is now associated to the case as a witness, victim, subject, or other category.

6.  Once other entities have been added to the case, you can link them to any number of persons associated with the case.

    For example, if you've already added a vehicle in the Vehicle entity tab, you can associate this person with the vehicle. To do so, select **Link Associated Entity**, and select the existing entity via the dropdown.
