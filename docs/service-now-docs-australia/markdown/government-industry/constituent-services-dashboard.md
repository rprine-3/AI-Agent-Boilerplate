</table>## Indicators

-   **Average response time for cases**

    Average hours for agents to respond to a new government case. This score is calculated by using this formula: \[\[GSM-Summed duration of FirstResponseTime\]\] / \[\[GSM-Number of Responded Cases\]\]

-   **GSM-Number of Open Cases**

    Number of open cases created daily.

-   **GSM-CSAT**

    Customer satisfaction score based on survey results. The score is calculated by using this formula: \[\[GSM\_Number of satisfied customers \(CSAT\)\]\]/\[\[GSM\_Number of CSAT survey respondents\]\]\*100.

-   **GSM-Average close time of cases**

    Average number of days to close cases. This score is calculated by using this formula: \[\[GSM-Summed duration of closed cases\]\] / \[\[GSM-Number of closed cases\]\] / 24.

-   **GSM-Average age of open cases**

    Average number of days that cases remain open. The score is calculated by using this formula: \[\[GSM-Summed age of open cases\]\] / \[\[GSM-Number of Open Cases\]\] / 24.

-   **Average resolution time of cases**

    Average number of days to resolve cases. The score is calculated using this formula: \[\[GSM\_Summed duration of resolved cases\]\] / \[\[GSM\_Number of resolved cases\]\] / 24

-   **GSM-Case Average Response Time**

    Average length of time for an agent to respond to a case. The score is calculated using this formula: \[\[GSM-Summed duration of FirstResponseTime\]\]/\[\[GSM-Number of Responded Cases\]\].

-   **GSM\_Number of resolved cases**

    Daily count of government cases resolved. The goal for this indicator is to maximize the count.

-   **GSM-Number of closed cases**

    Daily count of closed cases.

-   **GSM-Number of Responded Cases**

    Daily count of cases to which agents responded.


The following indicators are not shown directly on the dashboard but are used in calculating formulas:

-   GSM-Summed duration of closed cases \(hours\)
-   GSM-Summed duration of FirstResponseTime \(hours\)
-   GSM-Summed age of open cases
-   GSM-Summed duration of resolved cases \(hours\)

-   GSM-Age
-   GSM-AssignedTo
-   GSM-AssignmentGroup
-   GSM-Category
-   GSM-Channel
-   GSM-Contact
