## Granular roles

You can use predefined functional and granular roles installed with Public Sector Digital Services to establish relationships between users and public sector entities. These functional and granular roles provide different levels of access to public sector data.

-   Functional roles: A set of roles required to perform a function or meaningful action that requires access on multiple entities.
-   Granular roles: Roles that provide access to cases, services used, and related public sector entities. One or more granular roles can be bundled together as a functional role.

A granular model controls access to data through UI-based interactions by granting the appropriate level of access to the corresponding public sector entities. With this functionality, each role is associated with a set of privileges or responsibilities that determine users' access to information via forms, lists, and application features. You can have fine-grained access control by setting granular policies that authorize individuals to access the information needed to work efficiently and effectively, ultimately helping improve the constituent experience.

**Note:** Role-based access controls govern UI interactions. They do not restrict access by users with system-level scripting privileges or elevated platform roles. These roles control access to public sector data through UI-based features such as forms and lists.

For example, if you extend the Government Service Case table or other tables in the Public Sector Digital Services app, you must replicate the access control lists for the extended tables. You can assign granular roles to public sector users to control access to those extended tables.
