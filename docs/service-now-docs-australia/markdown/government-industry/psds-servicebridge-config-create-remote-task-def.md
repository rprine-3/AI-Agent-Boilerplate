# Create remote task definitions in Service Exchange for Providers in Public Sector Digital Services

As a government agency provider, you can create remote task definitions that trigger the assignment of remote task\(s\) to your constituent. Remote tasks originate in the agency provider instance \(where they auto-create an associated government case record\), and are pushed to your constituent through the Government Service Portal, enabling both provider and consumer to keep case records and details in sync.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Bridge Provider** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Remote Task Definitions**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_r2f_zkw_d5b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the remote task definition record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

This is a read only field and is set by default based on the application scope.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

Shows the status of the remote task definition. When you create a remote task definition, this field is set to the **Draft** state. **Note:** This field is automatically updated when you Publish, Archive, or Retire a remote task definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Provider table

</td><td>

Any task table that you select from the list. For example, you can choose a case table or an incident table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Consumer table

</td><td>

Any task table that you select from the list. For example, you can choose a case table or an incident table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Compatibility

</td><td>

This field is populated by default. It shows the Service Exchange version that is being used by the provider. If the consumer is using a compatible Service Exchange version, data can be synced between the provider and consumer instances. But if the consumer is not using a compatible version, any new remote task definitions cannot be activated until the corresponding Service Exchange version is upgraded.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Maintain SysID

</td><td>

If this field is checked, then the unique identifier, SysID, associated with the parent that created the remote task will be used and assigned to the parent task created for the remote task on the consumer instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Send attachments

</td><td>

If this is selected, if an attachment is added on the parent record, it is sent to the remote task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Copy attachment to parent

</td><td>

If an attachment is included with a remote task, a copy is sent to the parent record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short description

</td><td>

Brief information about this remote task definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

More detailed information about this remote task definition.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Click **Submit**.

5.  Open this new Remote task definition record.

6.  On the **Inbound fields** related tab, click **New**.

7.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    The inbound fields enable you to receive data from the consumer's instance when a remote task is created or updated.

    **Note:** If the inbound field values are updated, the updated information is shown in a work note on the parent record.

<table id="table_lkx_vzd_25b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Field label

</td><td>

Field label that appears on the remote task form.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field name

</td><td>

Field name that is used in the remote task flow and script.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max length

</td><td>

Maximum length of the source field name.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sync when

</td><td>

Enables you to specify when a target field on the remote task's parent record is directly updated. You can select:-   **Insert:** Updates the target field on the remote task's parent record only when the remote task is initially inserted.
-   **Insert or Update**: Updates the target field on the remote task's parent record every time the remote task is updated.
-   **Never**: The inbound field never updates a target field on the remote task's parent record directly. For example, you can use this field for state mapping where a flow is used to convert the incoming value before updating the target field.
**Note:** Irrespective of the option you select here, whenever an inbound field is updated, the changes are reflected in a worknote on parent record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source Mapping tab

</td><td>

This tab is not displayed if you have selected the **Virtual** check box to define a virtual field mapping.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source table \(read-only\)

</td><td>

The Consumer table that you selected while creating the remote task definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source field

</td><td>

Field from the source table that is sent to another ServiceNow instance.Source fields allow for [Dot-walking to data in related tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_DotWalking.md), which is useful when reference data is not available between ServiceNow instances. For example, you can create multiple inbound mappings for change incidents \(CIs\) to include the name, class, IP address, and asset tag.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target Mapping tab

</td><td>

Displayed only in the following conditions:-   Sync when: You select **Insert** or **Insert or update**.
-   Virtual: You select this check box to enable virtual field mapping.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Target table \(read-only\)

</td><td>

The Provider table that you selected while creating the remote task definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target field

</td><td>

Field from the target table that is sent to another ServiceNow instance.**Note:** If you are defining a virtual field mapping, the field you select in the target table is not present in the source table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

This field is enabled by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Virtual

</td><td>

Select this check box to enable virtual inbound field mapping. A virtual field is a field that is present in the target table but does not exist in the source table.

 When a source table doesn’t contain a field that exists on a target table, the field is configured as a virtual field. The values specified for the virtual field are passed from the source instance to the target instance. The consumer can create a remote task to sync data and update the value of the virtual field in the associated target task record.

 The target field can be updated either by using the Virtual Inbound option described in the [Create a transform in Service Exchange](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/service-exchange/service-bridge-v2-create-transform.md) or by using the `updateVirtualField` API.

Sync when suggestion

</td><td>

Enables you \(the provider\) to suggest to the consumer when a target field on the remote task's parent record should be directly updated. The consumer can change this setting before activating the definition-   **Insert:** Updates the target field on the remote task's parent record only when the remote task is initially inserted.
-   **Insert or Update**: Updates the target field on the remote task's parent record every time the remote task is updated.
-   **Never**: The inbound field never updates a target field on the remote task's parent record directly. For example, you can use this field for state mapping where a flow is used to convert the incoming value before updating the target field.

</table>11. Click **Submit**.

12. On the **Consumer criteria** related tab, click **New**.

13. On the form, fill in the fields.

    Consumer criteria enable you to manage which consumers can use these remote task definitions.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Consumer condition|Customer company or account that you want this remote task definition to be entitled to.|
    |Remote task definition|Name of this remote task definition record. This name is auto-filled.|

    For more details on consumer criteria, see [Creating entitlements in Service Exchange for Providers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/service-exchange/service-bridge-v2-entitlements.md).

14. Click **Publish**.

    Remote task variables are automatically created when you publish a remote task definition. These variables are the data variables for the inbound fields displayed and can be accessed on the remote tasks.


## Result

A remote task definition record is created on your instance. This record is also synchronized with your customer's instance and is now pending activation on your consumer's instance. If the **Auto activate remote task definition** field has been enabled by the consumer, the remote task definition is automatically activated on your consumer's instance.
