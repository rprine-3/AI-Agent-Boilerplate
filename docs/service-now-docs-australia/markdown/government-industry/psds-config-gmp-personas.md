# Grants Management Personas

Understand the key personas involved in Grants Management and their responsibilities in supporting grants.

## Understanding Grants Management personas

Grants Management supports collaboration between multiple personas, each playing a distinct role in managing, delivering, and consuming services. Understanding these roles helps administrators assign the right access, responsibilities, and tools within the framework.

Grants Management supports access based on predefined personas that reflect the type of work users perform within an agency. These personas can be assigned and tailored to match your agency’s needs. A persona role may contain several roles within. The roles within are automatically added to the user when the persona role is added.

Grants Management models this flexibility through:

-   **Personas and Roles**

    Defined at the user level. Delegates access for the user across the entire agency.

-   **Responsibilities**

    Defined according to each grant program, at the grant program level only. Delegates access for the user according to the specific grant program. A user can be a point of contact for a grants program, part of the internal program team, or part of the external merit reviewer team. All of these are added at the grant program level, through activities in the program setup playbook.


The combination of user roles and responsibilities determines what a user can do within each grants agency, and within each grant program.

## Grants Management user personas

A persona role is pre-configured role in the application that is made up of multiple granular roles, and are designed to correspond to common job titles for members of an agency. Each persona role represents a different way a user interacts with an agency.. The following table contains the persona roles included with the Grants Management, and a description of each persona as it may pertain to an agency. For more information on the roles installed with Grants Management, including the roles contained in each persona, see [Grants Management roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/roles-installed-with-public-sector-digital-services.md).
