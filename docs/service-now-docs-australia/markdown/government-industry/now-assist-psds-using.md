# Using generative AI with ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\)

You can use various generative AI skills with the ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) application.

Summarize the case details to help you understand the case context quicker. These summaries are useful for long-running or complex cases that include multiple conversations between agents and constituents.

Synthesize and summarize information from multiple KBs to deliver relevant answers in a conversational format using the ServiceNow Otto for AI Search for CRM Workspace plugin​. This skill provides actionable AI-generated or AI-selected answers to a search in CSM Workspace, and can replace a list of possible findings with a single-turn conversational result.

## Skills

The ServiceNow Otto for PSDS application includes the generative AI skills that enable your agents to understand the case context so that they can propose resolutions to the constituent or approve an application faster.

-   **Investigative case summarization**

    Synthesizes case narratives, entities, evidence, and activity into a structured summary, enabling agents to grasp case context and respond to inquiries. Generates detailed resolution information for investigative outcomes, allowing agents to propose solutions and integrate generated information into the case record.

-   **Investigative case narrative refinement \(via ServiceNow Otto Context Menu\)**

    Reviews text and surfaces gaps, inconsistencies, and tone issues before a case narrative is submitted for supervisory review. Delivers real-time refinement suggestions grounded in linked entities, evidence, and case activity, and allows investigators full control over accepting, rejecting, or editing every suggestion. Accessed via the ServiceNow Otto Context Menu upon text selection within a case narrative field.

-   **Document screening**

    Review and validate uploaded documents autonomously, checking IDs, tax forms, and other supporting documents. This skill flags potential issues and surfaces key details, applying consistent validation logic across every submission.

-   **Government case summarization**

    Condenses comprehensive case records into concise summaries, including the issue and the actions taken, enabling agents to grasp case contexts and respond effectively to inquiries. Generates detailed resolution information for specific government case types, allowing agents to propose solutions to constituents or business contacts and integrate this information into the case record.

    The case summarization skill generates a case summary and displays it above the activity stream. The summary includes the information that the agent enters in the following case record fields:

    -   Short description
    -   Description
    -   Work notes
    -   Additional comments
    -   Email
    -   Service level agreement \(SLA\)

-   **Chat Summarization**

    Automatically generate summaries of agent-facing chats, capturing the context of conversations between agents and constituents or virtual agents at different points of the handoff, such as when a Virtual Agent chat history is handed off to a live agent, or when one live agent hands off a chat history with a customer to another live agent. This functionality enables critical information from interactions to be readily accessible for future reference and action.

-   **ServiceNow Otto for AI Search**

    Leverage single-turn capabilities for legislation and policy summarization, providing agents with succinct overviews of complex documents and enhancing the ability to navigate and comprehend extensive legislative materials. This skill provides actionable AI-generated or AI-selected answers in searches, synthesizing and summarizing information from multiple knowledge bases to deliver relevant answers in a conversational format​.

-   **Fee Waiver AI agent skill**

    Determines the fee breakdown for an information request by working to arrive at a subtotal fee estimate, a recommendation for whether a fee waiver request should be approved or rejected, including reasons for any rejection, and a total fee estimate, with the fee waiver, if applicable. This skill works via the Information Request Fee Estimation AI Agent to provide an autonomous decision based on guidelines added in a specific knowledge article.
