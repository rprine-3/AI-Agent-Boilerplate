# Creating and resolving case tasks as a government service agent in CRM Workspace

Service request case tasks in Public Sector Digital Services are automatically created and assigned to agents as each service request case moves through its life cycle. Government service agents can view and complete these case tasks \(or even create their own tasks\) in the CRM Workspace.

## View existing service request case tasks in CRM Workspace

View a list of the case tasks that are associated with a service request case, regardless of whether the case task was created automatically or manually, in the CRM Workspace.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_gsm.agency\_manager, sn\_gsm.government\_service\_manager, sn\_gsm.constituent\_agent, sn\_gsm.business\_agent, sn\_gsm.agency\_constituent\_agent, or sn\_gsm.agency\_agent

### Procedure

1.  From the Lists menu in the CRM Workspace sidebar, navigate to **Service Requests** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the service request case by selecting the case number.

3.  In the Related List header, open the Tasks related list by selecting **Case Tasks**.

### About this task

When an agent creates a service request case task, the system uses information from the service request case to automatically fill in the fields on the Case Task form. Agents can use auto-filled information, as well as the data collected from the end user, to create service request case tasks. After the agent creates and saves a case task, it appears in the Case Tasks related list on the Service Request Case form.

### Procedure

1.  Open the case.

2.  From the Case Tasks related list, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For more information on the fields, see [Service Request Case Task form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/service-request-case-form-new.md).

4.  Select **Save**.
