# Viewing the dynamic related records in License and Permit Playbook

You can view the dynamic related records in the playbook contextual side panel in CRM Workspace. These records dynamically change based on the current record or playbook activity.

## Using related records in License and Permit Playbook

You can view, search, and sort the records in the **Related Records** tab in the contextual side panel after you create an license and permit request record.

The **Related Records** tab displays the related records that dynamically change based on the context of the current record or playbook activity. The records that are displayed in the **Related Records** tab depend on the following settings:

-   The related record contexts and definitions that have been configured for a record or playbook activity.
-   The agent's access permissions to data.

Different related records appear based on each playbook stage and step. At the Intake and Review stages, the agent should see similar Closed License/Permit Requests, so they can compare the outcome of similar requests. At the Process and Decision stages, agents should see any Open Case Tasks that are preventing the case from moving to the next step, or being resolved and closed.

## Types of related records

The related records appear in the list as a read-only card. The initial set of records that display in the list is determined by the record type that you select in the filter at the top of the list. Depending on the related record configuration for the source record or playbook activity, you can see the following types of related records:

-   SLAs
-   Escalations
-   Blocked By
-   Open Case Tasks
-   Similar License/Permit Requests
-   Emails
-   Draft Emails
-   Documents
-   Approvals
-   Knowledge Gaps
-   Install Base
-   Attached Knowledge
-   Requests
-   Interactions
-   Related Cases
-   Special Handling Notes
-   Appointments
-   Related Parties
