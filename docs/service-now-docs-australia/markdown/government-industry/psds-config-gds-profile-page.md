# Configure the GOV.UK Design System Service Portal User Profile page

Configure the user profile page using widgets and widget instances, enabling UK citizens to view and manage their personal profiles, preferences, and activity history.

By default, constituents editing their profile in the GDS Service Portal will be shown the user profile page, which houses several GDS-adherant widgets and page components that allow them to add, update, or delete information from their user profile.

This default page provides the basic structure for a user profile page that specifies details about an user like their name, company, title, and location. By default, the User Profile page contains the following widgets that can be customized or removed:

-   Header widget, which controls which options appear in the page header. Contains GOV.UK logo, global navigation, language selector, notifications, user profile.

    **Note:** This widget cannot be cloned for modification. Instead, configure the header menu by associating the header menu with a portal. For more information on configuring a header menu, see [Configure a portal header menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-header-menu.md).

-   Breadcrumbs widget, which displays information based on where a page is located in a portal, allowing users to navigate around.

    **Note:** You can customize this widget only to change the breadcrumb path. For more information, see [KB0719179](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0719179).

-   User Profile portal widget, which displays profile photo, name, contact details, and other user profile information.

    **Note:** You can use this base system widget as-is on the User Profile portal page, modify the widget instance \(which makes changes on this page **only**\), or clone it to make modifications across multiple pages that suit your own business needs. For more information on how to clone widgets and use widget instances, see [Configure the GOV.UK Design System Service Portal Widgets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-govuk-dev-tk-portal-widgets.md).

-   Footer Widget, which displays support links, other resources, and legal disclaimers.

    **Note:** Add or edit a footer for your portal by configuring it in the Theme form. For more information on adding a footer to a portal, see [Add a header or footer to a portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-header-menu.md).
