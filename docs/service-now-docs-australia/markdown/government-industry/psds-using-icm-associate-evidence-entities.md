# Associate and link evidence to entities

Link associated evidence records to other entities within a case created in the Investigative Case Management application workspace. All evidence records available in the master index can be linked to an entity.

## Before you begin

Role required: icm.investigator, supervisory\_agent, admin

With ICM Evidence Management, investigators can create and associate the record for an item of evidence to other entities within the case, all from one workspace.

Before you can link an entity to an evidence record, make sure an entity record has been created for it **within** the case. For more information on how to create an entity record for a related person, property, vehicle, or other entity and associate it with the case, see [Add entities to an investigative case using Investigative Case Management Entity Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-icm-add-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the CRM Workspace and select **My active cases**.

    Alternatively, you can select a case using the CRM Workspace Lists menu by selecting **Lists** &gt; **Investigative Cases** &gt; **All** and selecting the case.

2.  Select the **Evidence** tab.

3.  Within the Evidence record, select the tab that contains the entity you wish to associate with the open evidence record.

    This can be a vehicle, person, organization, firearm, property, location, or event.

4.  Select the plus icon to add the entity to the evidence record.

    In this view, you can see all of the entities that this evidence record has been associated with, in each tab.

5.  Select the existing entity from the dropdown menu.

    If the entity does not appear in the dropdown, verify that it has been created within the open case.

6.  Select the related case.

    Here, choose the case that is linked to this entity. If the case you need isn't listed, make sure it's linked to the chosen entity.

7.  Select the relationship type.

    The choices displayed here vary based on what two types of entities you are trying to link. If you are trying to link evidence to a location, for example, that location can be the crime scene, OR that evidence can either:

    -   Have been found at that location
    -   Be related in some way to a witness of the incident.
8.  Provide a brief description of the relationship between the entity and evidence.

9.  Select **Save** to link the open evidence record to the selected entity.

10. Select the pencil icon next to the entity to edit the record.

    In this view, you can see all of the entities that this entity has already been associated with.

11. Select **Link Associated Entity**.

12. Select the entity type from the dropdown menu.

13. Select the existing entity from the dropdown menu.

    If the entity does not appear in the dropdown, verify that it has been created within the open case.

14. Select the relationship type.

    The choices displayed here vary based on what two types of entities you are trying to link. If you are trying to link a person to a location, for example, the person can either:

    -   Have witnessed an event at that location
    -   Resides at that location
    -   Works at that location
    -   Experienced an incident or event at that location
15. Select **Save** to link the open entity to the selected one.

    The entity has now been associated with the evidence record.
