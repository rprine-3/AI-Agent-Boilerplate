# Viewing the dynamic related records in Service Request Playbook

You can view the dynamic related records in the playbook contextual side panel in CRM Workspace. These records dynamically change based on the current record or playbook activity.

## Using related records in Service Request Playbook

You can view, search, and sort the records in the **Related Records** tab in the contextual side panel after you create a service request record. For details on how to create a record, see [Create a service request record using playbooks in Public Sector Digital Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-playbook-create-record.md).

The **Related Records** tab displays the related records that dynamically change based on the context of the current record or playbook activity. The records that are displayed in the **Related Records** tab depend on the following settings:

-   The related record contexts and definitions that have been configured for a record or playbook activity.
-   The agent's access permissions to data.

## Types of related records

The related records appear in the list as a read-only card. The initial set of records that display in the list is determined by the record type that you select in the filter at the top of the list. Depending on the related record configuration for the source record or playbook activity, you can see the following types of related records:

-   Similar Service Requests
-   Open Case Tasks
-   Related Work Orders
-   Blocked Tasks
-   Emails
-   Approvals
-   SLAs
-   Escalations for the case or customer

## Default related records

The following table shows the default related records that are based on each playbook step.
