## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CRM Workspace**.

2.  Navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Grant Programs** &gt; **All** and select **New**.

    Here, you have the option to create a program from the default template, or start by copying data and configurations from an existing grant program.

    -   To create a grant program without using any pre-existing configurations, choose **New**.
    -   To copy data and configurations from a pre-existing grant program, choose **Create a new program from an existing program**. Choose the existing grant program from the drop-down menu and select **Continue**.

        You can determine which fields are copied over to the new grant program record, as well as fields in related records, including default fields. You can add or remove fields.

    A new grant program is created within the Grant Program table \(sn\_svc\_appl\_pgm\_mg\_grant\_program\), and the playbook is moved to the **Define Program** stage. A product model record, service definition record, and draft playbook content item have been automatically created for the grant program.

3.  Select **Save**.

4.  On the **Grant Program** form, fill in the details of the grant program.
