# Using the Grants Proposal Management Playbook in Grants Management

Use the Grants Proposal Playbook to manage the life cycle of grant applications submitted by organizations through the portal.

The Grants Management case, or the Grant Proposal, is designed as a case type which extends the Government Service Case and functions as the primary transactional entity for receiving Grant Applications/Proposals. When proposals are submitted, they are entered into this dedicated table. A workflow is then initiated, which is presented to Grants Program managers and directors as a Proposal Playbook. This structured process ensures the efficient management and review of grant proposals. "Proposal" and "application" are used interchangeably.

The Grants Management Proposal Playbook includes Application Intake, Proposal Screening, Proposal Evaluation and Scoring, and Decision. It is designed to systematically manage the life cycle of grant applications submitted by organizations through the portal. This workflow is divided into four stages, each with specific objectives and activities that guide the application from initiation to final decision.

A grant proposal is the formal submission prepared by an individual, non-profit, or organization seeking funding for a specific project or initiative. The Grants Management workflow provides agents with a playbook that guides them step-by-step through reviewing, scoring, and deciding on proposals submitted by individuals to a specific grant program that is has been made available. Grants **proposal** and grants **application** are used interchangeably.

## Proposal Intake

Role required: Grant Applicant \(role: sn\_gsm.business\_contact\)

For applicants, the application intake experience happens entirely on the Grants Management Portal, separate from the grants program manager/agent view. This feature improves self-service with a Grants Management Portal that simplifies finding, applying for, and tracking grants. Reduce applicant effort with guided intake, including save, resume, and export functionality​. Increase agent productivity with tools to make screening submissions easy​. This is where applicants will submit proposals for a grant program that was published by a GPM using the setup step. They can then be screened in the agent portion of the intake and screening feature. With a guided intake setup, including save, resume, and export functionality, Grants Management Intake aims to simplify the process of finding, applying for, and tracking grants for applicants.

An applicant submitting a proposal is the first stage of the grants proposal playbook. The playbook is in the screen stage by the time it arrives to the agent. An agent cannot submit an application on behalf of an agent.

Once the application is routed to the Grant Program Manager, the intake stage and all of its activities will show as complete in the Grant Manager's proposal playbook, and it will become read-only.

## Proposal Screening

Role required: Grant Program Manager \(sn\_svc\_appl\_pgm\_mg.grant\_program\_manager\).

For grants program managers \(case agents\) and directors, the application screening feature provides visibility across all proposal and submission details related to the grant program, once an applicant submits a proposal for an active grant program created by the grant program manager. Tools for agents to streamline the screening of submissions. The Grants Proposal Workflow in Public Sector Digital Services Grants Management provides a structured process for managing grant proposals from submission for the pre-award phase.

Using the Grants Management Screening feature, managers can:

-   Review the proposal
-   Confirm eligibility
-   Approve new contacts
-   Verify documents submitted by the applicants

-   **Review Proposal Details**

    \[Omitted image "psds-gmp-conf-elig.png"\] Alt text: Enter Applicant information view

    Determine the eligibility of an applicant based on the execution of PaCE polices linked to the proposal’s program, defined during the Program Setup phase. For more information on setting up or modifying PaCE policies to determine post-submission eligibility of a grant application, see [Configure Eligibility Rules Engine Policies in Grants Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-gmp-eligibility.md).

The case cannot proceed until the Grant Program Manager approves or rejects the contact.

-   **Verify Documents**

    \[Omitted image "psds-gmp-verif-doc.png"\] Alt text: Enter Applicant information view

## Proposal Evaluation

Required role: Grant Program Manager \(sn\_svc\_appl\_pgm\_mg.grant\_program\_manager\).

Grant proposals that pass the screening stage enter the evaluation phase, where the grants program manager creates and assigns proposal evaluation tasks to a group of external evaluators known as merit reviewers. Once all evaluation tasks are completed, the application is ready for the funding proposal phase, where certain grant applications will be selected for approval.

\[Omitted image "psds\_gmp\_proposal-playbook\_evaluation\_view.png"\] Alt text:

The funding proposal workflow involves the assessment of the evaluations conducted by the merit reviewers, and the definition of a proposal which will be sent to the Grant Program Director \(GPD\) for final approval. The funding proposal contains the individual grant applications which the grants program manager has selected for approval, as well as the proposed award amount for each.

**Note:** A grants program director can only approve or decline the entire funding proposal, not the individual grant proposals \(applications\) contained within it. A decline involves the creation of a new funding proposal which must be submitted again for approval.

-   **Conduct Merit Review**

    \[Omitted image "psds-gmp-cond-mer-rev.png"\] Alt text: create merit review tasks view

Required role: Grant Program Manager \(sn\_svc\_appl\_pgm\_mg.grant\_program\_manager\).

The final stage of the workflow is the decision phase. Based on the funding decisions made by the Grant Program Management team, a corresponding result letter is generated for each application. When all result letters across all applications are prepared, they are released, and the process awaits the acceptance of the outcome by the respective applicants. Applicants can access the results letter on the portal and either acknowledge or decline the award, and managers can capture the outcome of the proposal and close the record.

-   **Create Results Letter**

    \[Omitted image "psds-gmp-create-res-letter.png"\] Alt text: create results letter
