## About this task

By default, the GDS Service Portal experience begins on the homepage for authenticated users when referenced by the URL suffix \(/ukgds\). The homepage houses several widgets and page components that contain the major information and actions that users see when they access the portal or log in. Each homepage widget offers different interaction options for accessing detailed information and completing actions.
