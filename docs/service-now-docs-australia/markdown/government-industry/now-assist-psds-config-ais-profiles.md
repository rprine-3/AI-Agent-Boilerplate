# Configure AI search profiles with ServiceNow Otto for PSDS

You can enable AI Search users to search content and metadata from documents in all or part of the knowledge bases, external repositories, and remote tables.

ServiceNow Otto for PSDS supports additional configuration for AI Search, such as search profile configuration.

AI Search for ServiceNow Otto for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) stores search experience settings in search profiles. Define a search profile for each unique search experience that you want to offer users in a ServiceNow AI Platform application. Create and populate synonym and stop word dictionaries. Configure typo handling dictionary settings. Define Genius Results and result improvement rules.

A search profile contains settings that determine how AI Search generates search results for a given search. The search application's configuration specifies which search profile to use, and also determines how the generated results are displayed to users.

For more information on AI search profiles, see [Search profiles in AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/defining-search-profiles-ais.md).
