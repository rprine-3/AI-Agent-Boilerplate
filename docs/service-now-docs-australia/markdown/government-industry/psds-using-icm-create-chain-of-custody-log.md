# Create a chain of custody log for an evidence record in an investigative case

As an investigator or supervisory agent, you can create a Chain of Custody \(CoC\) log within the workspace to keep track of evidence if or when it is transferred or moved.

## Before you begin

Role required: icm.investigator, supervisory\_agent, admin

**Note:** The ability to create a Chain of Custody Log for an evidence record is strictly tied to write access for that evidence record. If the particular user does not have write access to the open evidence record, they will not be able to create a record. For more information on modifying the security classification for an evidence record or for a case, see .

## About this task

With Investigative Case Management Evidence Management, investigators can create a chain of custody log within the workspace. The log tracks the movement, transfer, and status changes of evidence records associated with the case. Audit logging captures timestamps and responsible personnel for each action, including when and by whom evidence was opened and viewed.

**Note:** A Chain of Custody Log cannot be created if the evidence record is in Draft state.

The Chain of Custody Log form collects the following information about a piece of evidence:

    Attachments can be deleted or renamed until the chain of custody log is added to the evidence record. After the log is added, the user can add attachments but not delete or rename existing ones. Work notes can be added in the activity stream after creating the log.

11. Select the checkbox to affirm that you have complied with all evidence handling requirements, and enter your signature.

    You can type or draw your signature. The signature image is saved as an attachment to the log.
