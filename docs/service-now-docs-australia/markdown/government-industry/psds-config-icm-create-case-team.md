# Create a case team for an investigative case

You can add existing users within your investigative organization to the case and assign them a responsibility. Responsibilities determine a users relationship to the case, at the case level.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Creating case teams and assigning responsibilities is distinct from creating user groups and assigning roles. Case teams are created at the case level only, and do not affect roles or groups at the user level. For more information on roles, case teams, and responsibilities, see [Assign user personas, roles, groups, and responsibilities in Investigative Case Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-icm-assign-user-roles-responsibilities.md). To create a case team, you must either create a case, or a case must already have been created within the workspace.

Role required: icm.investigator, admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the CRM Workspace and select **My active cases**.

    Alternatively, you can select a case using the CRM Workspace Lists menu by selecting **Lists** &gt; **Investigative Cases** &gt; **All** and selecting the case.

2.  Select the case you wish to create a case team for.

3.  Select the **Team** tab.

4.  Select **Add Team Member**.

5.  Select the User from the dropdown.

    If you do not see the desired User's name, have an admin verify that a user record has been created for them on the organization level. For more info on assigning users, see [Assign user personas, roles, groups, and responsibilities in Investigative Case Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-icm-assign-user-roles-responsibilities.md).

6.  Select their case-level responsibility from the **Investigation role** dropdown.

    Multiple team members can have the same responsibility, but only one team member with the Case Agent responsibility can be created.

7.  Select **Save**.

8.  Repeat these steps as needed until you have added all your desired team members to the case.


## Result

A case team is now created for the open investigation, and team members now have the necessary access to begin working on the case.
