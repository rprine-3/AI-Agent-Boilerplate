# Configure export application functionality in Grants Management

Configure the export to PDF functionality so that grants program can export grants proposals directly to PDF.

## About this task

The export application function generates a PDF format of the confirm application details involving the information from all the sections from the intake stage in sectional formatting.

PDF export functionality uses the Document Templates table and a script to generate a PDF. However, these reside in different scopes, requiring RCA records to be created and manually allowed.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Verify that the scope is set to **Document Templates**.

**Note:** This may have configuration implications across all ServiceNow applications in your instance. Verify the RCA settings of other applications after completing this procedure.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Application** &gt; **Application Restricted Caller Access Privileges**

2.  Open the **Read** operation record and change the value of Status field to **Allowed**.

3.  In the Confirm Application Details activity, select **Export**.

4.  Open the **Execute API** operation record and change the value of Status field to **Allowed**.


## Result

The export PDF functionality should appear in the Confirm Application Details activity of the playbook.

## What to do next

The data that shows up in the exported PDF is generated based on a pre-configured document template. This configuration can be modified to add/delete fields, change formatting of the document, and more.
