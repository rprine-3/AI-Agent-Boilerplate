# Configure a service definition for Playbooks in Public Sector Digital Services

Create a service definition for use with Playbooks in Public Sector Digital Services.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Service definitions are records used to store details about a service that is available to end customers. You can create service definitions for each public service offered by your government agency.

After upgrade to Public Sector Digital Services v8.0, Services Offered, an extension of Product Model, will no longer be used to model government services. Services Received, an extension of Sold Product, will no longer be used to model the government services that have been granted/delivered to constituents. The Service Definition table will be used to model all public services offered by governments. The following fields from the Service Offered table will be removed and replaced with Service Model fields:

-   Type
-   Status
-   Number
-   Period Start Date
-   Period End Date
-   Jurisdiction
-   Category
-   Subcategory
-   Payment source

**Important:** When upgrading to Vancouver, any data in the Services Offered and Services Received tables will need to be manually migrated into the Service Definition table. You can do so by creating a Service Definition for each entry in the Services Offered table. Services Offered and Services Received data will not be accessible within the application until this step is completed. This is an optional task for previous releases.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Service Definitions**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Enter the details for the Service Definition.
