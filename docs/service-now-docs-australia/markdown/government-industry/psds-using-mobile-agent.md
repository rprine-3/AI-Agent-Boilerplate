# Mobile Agent experience for Public Sector Digital Services

If you're a government agent, you can use the Mobile Agent app on your mobile device to create, update, and monitor the status of non-emergency service requests in the Public Sector Digital Services application. You can also get an overview of your case load, including your new and active cases.

Use the Mobile Agent to review your case details and complete your case tasks. With a government service agent role, you can use the app to do the following tasks:

-   Get a quick overview of your case load.
-   Add comments or work notes to cases.
-   Review your case details, activity stream, and related information, such as the service level agreements \(SLAs\), case tasks, and related cases.
-   Edit case information.
-   Complete case tasks.

The following video highlights some of the capabilities of the ServiceNow® Mobile Agent app.

**Note:** To use the Mobile Agent, the required plugins must be enabled by an administrator. If you're an administrator, see [Configure Mobile Agent for Service Request Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-mobile-agent.md) to get the information on configuring the Mobile Agent. For instructions on how to get started with the app after an administrator configures these settings, see [Get started with the Customer Service mobile application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/install-customer-service-mobile-app.md).

## Mobile Agent homepage

When you open the Mobile Agent and log in, an applet launcher is displayed with all the applets that are configured to that launcher.

The following example shows the homepage of the Mobile Agent, which displays an overview of cases.

\[Omitted image "psds-agent-mobile-app-landing-page.png"\] Alt text: Homepage view of the mobile agent app showing an overview of cases and approvals.

The applet launcher includes all the applets that you need to address or resolve service request cases. You have access to the following applets:

| | |
|---|---|
|New Service Request Cases|All service request cases that are assigned to you in the **New** state.|
|Active Service Request Cases|All service request cases that you have access to but haven’t been resolved or canceled, including the cases in the **Open**, **Awaiting Info**, and **Resolved** states.|
|New Information Request Cases|All service request cases that are assigned to you in the **New** state.|
|Active Information Request Cases|All information request cases that you have access to but haven’t been resolved or canceled, including the cases in the **Open**, **Awaiting Info**, and **Resolved** states.|

To launch an applet, select it in the app.

## Applets and cards

Each applet on the applet launcher screen displays the records that correspond to the applet function. The Active Service Requests applet, for example, when tapped, displays a list of all the active service request case records.

The following example shows a service request card view with a list of all active service request case records.

\[Omitted image "psds-mobile-agent-case-card-list.png"\] Alt text: Service request card view that shows a list of all active service request case records.

The cases in the list are displayed as cards, and the state of the case is displayed at the top of the card. For more information on the case states, see [Life cycle of a Public Service case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/government-service-case-states.md).

Select a card to see the case record details. For example, you can see the case activity, related lists, and case escalations, if any.

You can narrow down or sort the list of cases by using the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "psds-mobile-agent-filter-option.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon.\).
