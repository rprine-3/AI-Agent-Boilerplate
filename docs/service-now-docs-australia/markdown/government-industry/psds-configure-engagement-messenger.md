## Configure Engagement Messenger for Service Request Playbook

Configure Engagement Messenger settings for creating and tracking non-emergency service requests.

### Before you begin

### About this task

Public sector end users can create and track service requests in Engagement Messenger. They can choose from a catalog of pre-packaged service requests that are provided with the Service Request Playbook application. If Virtual Agent is implemented, they can use the pre-built Virtual Agent conversation, Create a Service Request, to submit and update non-emergency service requests from Engagement Messenger. You must enable the Government Service Catalog and this pre-built Virtual Agent conversation in Engagement Messenger.

### Procedure

2.  Customize the Catalog feature to use the Government Service Catalog, which provides the pre-packaged, non-emergency services that users can select from when creating a service request.

    1.  From the **Features** section, open the **Catalog** feature.

    2.  Select **Edit** to search for and then add the Government Service Catalog.

3.  Customize the Chat feature by enabling the pre-built Virtual Agent conversation for creating a service request.

    1.  From the **Features** section, open the **Chat** feature.

    2.  Under **Reference chat**, find and select the **Create a Service Request** conversation topic.

4.  Select **Update**.
