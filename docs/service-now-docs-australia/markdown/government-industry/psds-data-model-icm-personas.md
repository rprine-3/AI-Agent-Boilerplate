# Investigative Case Management Personas

Understand the key personas involved in Investigative Case Management and their responsibilities in supporting investigations and operations.

## Understanding Investigative Case Management personas

Investigative Case Management supports collaboration between multiple personas, each playing a distinct role in managing, delivering, and consuming services. Understanding these roles helps administrators assign the right access, responsibilities, and tools within the framework.

Investigative Case Management \(ICM\) supports access based on predefined personas that reflect the type of work users perform within an organization. These personas can be assigned and tailored to match your organization’s needs. A persona role may contain several roles within. The roles within are automatically added to the user when the persona role is added.

ICM models this flexibility through:

-   **Personas and Roles**

    Defined at the user level. Delegates access for the user across the whole organization.

-   **Responsibilities**

    Defined according to each case, at the case level. Delegates access for the user according to the specific case.


The combination of user roles and responsibilities determines what a user can do within each organization. For information on configuring role responsibilities, see [Configuring Investigative Case Management responsibility definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-icm-create-responsibilities.md).

## Investigative Case Management user personas

A persona role is pre-configured role in the application that is made up of multiple granular roles, and are designed to correspond to common job titles for members of an organization. Each persona role represents a different way a user interacts with an organization . The following table contains the persona roles included with the Investigative Case Management, and a description of each persona as it may pertain to a investigative organization. For more information on the roles installed with Investigative Case Management, including the roles contained in each persona, see [Investigative Case Management roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/roles-installed-with-public-sector-digital-services.md).

|Persona|Description|Organization Example|
|-------|-----------|--------------------|
|Admin|An administrator is a certified ServiceNow system administrator of the organization. An administrator doesn't use the application directly, but supports configuration of the organization, hierarchy management, and assignment of member roles and responsibilities, including related-party configurations, as well as user and data management.|Admin|
|Investigator|An investigator, or case agent, works within an investigative organization to create cases, create reports, set the narrative, and create all the entities and evidence records within the case. A user or group with this role can create and work on investigative cases. An investigator can only view or work on a case within an organization if they have created it, or are added as a team member on that team. If any case tasks are assigned to them, they may work on them.|A detective \(or group of detectives\) at an investigative organization may submit a case regarding a stolen laptop. They are able to work on the case they submitted, as well as view other cases submitted by other detectives within the organization as long as they are added as a team member. They may also link other detective's cases to theirs, if they have access to that case.|
|Supervisory Agent|A supervisory agent functions similar to a manager or supervisor, reviewing and approving cases and managing an assignment group of investigators \(case agents\), for which they have full access to all cases within that group. For more information on how to create an assignment group, see [Assign user personas, roles, groups, and responsibilities in Investigative Case Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-config-icm-assign-user-roles-responsibilities.md).|An investigator creates a case draft and adds the entities and support information. A supervisory agent, or supervisor, has a checkpoint to make sure all information is correct and logged, and can approve it to proceed. These agents primarily review cases rather submitting them.|
|Special Agent in Charge|The Special Agent in Charge functions as a director, focusing on the high level, overseeing the department and managing all cases created within their organization. This role allows them to create and fulfill all cases submitted in the organization.|A piece of classified evidence is added to a case, and only the special agent in charge, such as the head detective at an investigative organization, can have access to this evidence.|
|Expert Analyst|The Expert Analyst is a specialist that helps out with the case. Similar to an investigative contributor, the expert analyst may be brought in for their expertise on a subject. This role allows them to work on any part of the case if they are assigned a case task, as well as add or edit evidence and entity records.|A detective may be brought in from another department and added to the team as an expert analyst. They may work on case tasks if they are assigned to them.|
|Investigative Contributor \(Team member\)|The Investigative Contributor role functions similar to an investigator, but has less access to work on the case. They can view and edit cases to which they have a task assigned to them, and can only view and edit they are added as a team member to. They can view but not add or edit entity or evidence records.|An investigator contributor may be brought in from another department to contribute information to the case or complete case tasks. These agents primarily view cases and contribute information related to the case, rather than being assigned to create or work on an entire case. These team members are organization contributors.|
|Task Agent|The Task Agent is assigned to a case task of the case. They can complete case tasks, and view the details of cases for which they have tasks assigned to them.|At the investigative organization, a desk agent primarily handles administrative work, such as completing case tasks. These team members are organization contributors, and mainly view case information pertaining only to that case task.|
