# Configure read/write access roles for the Grants Management internal program team

In a Grant Program, certain access is granted to each Internal Program Team user on a case-by-case basis. As an admin, you can delegate read/write access to users within internal teams by mapping specific roles to read/write access.

## About this task

By default, users with the Observer and Approver roles within a grant program have read-only access to the grant program. Users with the Program Lead, Co-Lead, and Collaborator roles have read and write access to the entire grant program. To update the access configurations for the aforementioned personas:

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Grant Program** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the Grant Program Record for which you want to configure read/write access roles.

3.  Select the context menu, then select **Configure** &gt; **Form Layout**.

4.  Select and add **Read Resource Roles** and **Write Resource Roles** to the program information form.

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  Select the lock icon to add roles to the Read or Write access fields.

7.  Add roles under the **Read Resource Roles** field to grant read access to those roles, and roles under the **Write Resource Roles** fields to grant write access to those roles.

8.  Select **Update**.

    Users with these roles now have read access to program or read/write access to the grant program.
