# Using Playbooks Public Sector Digital Services

A playbook provides government service agents with step-by-step guidance through the life cycle of a public service request case. Use Playbooks to fulfill requests for license and permits, government records and other public information, or non-emergency service requests.

A playbook takes a workflow and breaks it into multiple stages or lanes. Each stage in a playbook includes one or more activities, or steps, for you to complete. Stages can also include automated activities, such as auto-sending an email to a customer when a stage or activity is complete. When using a playbook, you can:

-   View the playbook stages and activities.
-   Select an activity and perform the work to complete that activity.
-   Mark an activity as complete and move to the next activity or stage.
-   Complete the stages and activities to resolve the case.

The following applications are available with Public Sector Digital Services that enable you to create and use playbooks:

-   [Grants Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-grants-management-playbook.md)
-   [Social Benefits Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-sb-playbooks.md)
-   [License and Permit Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-lp-playbooks.md)
-   [Information Request Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-ir-playbooks.md)
-   [Service Request Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-sr-playbooks.md)

The corresponding playbook for each case type automatically appears in the **Playbook** tab when you create an public service request case as an agent in the CRM Workspace, or when a constituent puts in a request through the Government Service Portal.

The workflows for a type of case and the activities that you need to resolve these cases are in the playbook. By using a playbook, you can visualize the entire life cycle of the public service case workflow.

## Playbook stages

Each playbook contains four stages \(Intake, Review, Process, and Decision\) and several activities in each stage. Below is a diagram illustrating the base playbook workflow. This workflow can be modified to match a specific public service request use case, depending on what your agency offers.

The base Playbook workflow stages are listed in the following table.

|Task|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Intake|Guides you through the record creation process by capturing the details of the request and assigning it to the right agent.|
|Review|Acts as a checkpoint for duplicate cases and provides you with an opportunity to review the case details.|
|Process|Guides you through the activities for request fulfillment.|
|Decision|Captures and communicates the decision and any supporting information to the constituent and any other agents or involved parties.|

## Playbook layout

A playbook is made up of several areas, including the playbook life cycle, the playbook work area, and the contextual side panel. The activity view determines how the stages and activities appear in the playbook.

The default activity view for Playbooks in Public Sector Digital Services is the process-based experience view. This view, which is shown in the following example, shows constituent or business information and case task information at the forefront of the playbook work area as you work on it.

The process-based playbook layout shows the following features:

-   A horizontal stage picker that gives the agent a complete view of the entire process and where they currently are in that process. Agents can use the stage picker to track their overall progress as they work on cases.
-   Record information on the left side of the page, such as the contact information that is always available.
-   Related records in the contextual side panel supported by the dynamic related records component.
