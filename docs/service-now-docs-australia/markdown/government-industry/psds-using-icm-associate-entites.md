# Associate and link multiple entities

Add associated entities to each other within a case created in the Investigative Case Management application workspace. All entities available in the ICM master index can be linked together.

## Before you begin

Role required: icm.investigator, supervisory\_agent

With ICM Entity Management, investigators can create and associate multiple entities to each other and to the case, as well as manage all entities and their relationships to the case, all from one workspace.

Before you can link entities, make sure an entity record has been created for it **within** the case. For more information on how to create an entity record for a related person, property, vehicle, or other entity and associate it with the case, see [Add entities to an investigative case using Investigative Case Management Entity Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-icm-add-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the CRM Workspace and select **My active cases**.

    Alternatively, you can select a case using the CRM Workspace Lists menu by selecting **Lists** &gt; **Investigative Cases** &gt; **All** and selecting the case.

2.  Select the tab that contains the entity you wish to associate with another.

    This can be a vehicle, person, organization, firearm, property, location, or event.

3.  Select the pencil icon next to the entity to edit the record.

    In this view, you can see all of the entities that this entity has already been associated with.

4.  Select **Link Associated Entity**.

5.  Select the entity type from the dropdown menu.

6.  Select the existing entity from the dropdown menu.

    If the entity does not appear in the dropdown, verify that it has been created within the open case.

7.  Select the relationship type.

    The choices displayed here vary based on what two types of entities you are trying to link. If you are trying to link a person to a location, for example, the person can either:

    -   Have witnessed an event at that location
    -   Resides at that location
    -   Works at that location
    -   Experienced an incident or event at that location
8.  Select **Save** to link the open entity to the selected one.


## Result

The entities are now linked to each other, allowing an investigator can build a web of assets related to the case.
