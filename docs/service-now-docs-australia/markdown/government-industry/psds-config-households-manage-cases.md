# Create and manage cases for a constituent or household in Public Sector Digital Services

Staff members with the location agent role can create and manage cases for constituents and households.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager, sn\_customerservice\_manager, admin

## About this task

Staff members at a business location who have the location agent role can create cases for households and constituents.

Staff members or internal users who have a relationship with a household \(based on the Relationship Manager responsibility\) can create cases for that household and its members. Users with relationships to a household are listed in the following locations:

-   The Household Team related list on the Household form.
-   The Household Team Members list.

Relationship managers can perform the following actions on the cases that they can access:

-   Add comments and work notes.
-   Add attachments.
-   Close cases.

When a constituent case is created or updated, the constituent receives an email notification. If a household is added to a case, the head of household is also notified when a case is created or updated.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CRM Workspace** &gt; **List**

2.  Navigate to the related list of the type of case you want to create.

3.  Under that related list, select **All** and select **Create New**.

4.  Perform one of the following actions.

<table id="choicetable_cyw_rnc_gmb"><tbody><tr><td id="d62237e138">

**Add a constituent.**

</td><td>

Select a constituent in the **Constituent** field. -   If the constituent belongs to only one household, the **Household** field is automatically updated.
-   If the constituent belongs to more than one household, select a household from the households that a constituent belongs to in the **Household** field.
-   If the constituent does not belong to a household, you can leave the **Household** field empty.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d62237e171">

**Add a household.**

</td><td>

Select a household in the **Household** field. -   If the household only has only one current member, the **Constituent** field is automatically updated.
-   If the household has multiple current members, select a constituent from the household members in the **Constituent** field.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Fill in the remaining fields on the [Case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/government-service-case-form.md) form.

6.  If desired, add other members of the household to the watch list.

    If a user with a Relationship Manager relationship is creating a case for a household or household member, this user is automatically added to the watch list.

7.  Select **Submit**.

    The case is added to the **Cases** related list on the Household form.
