# Configure Advanced Work Assignment for Public Sector Digital Services

Use the Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) for Public Sector Digital Services feature to automatically assign work items to agents based on their availability, capacity, and skills. AWA for Public Sector Digital Services pushes work to qualified agents using work item queues, routing conditions, and assignment criteria that you define. Agents see their assignments in their Agent Workspace inbox.

## Plugins

The Advanced Work Assignment for Public Sector Digital Services feature is available with the Customer Service plugin \(com.sn\_customerservice\).

To use the chat feature with AWA for Public Sector Digital Services, you must also activate the Agent Chat plugin \(com.glide.interaction.awa\).

For more information, see [Activate related plugins for Advanced Work Assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-related-plugins.md).

## Inbox layouts

Three chat inbox layouts are included with the Chat service channel.

|Chat Layout|Included Fields|
|-----------|---------------|
|Default Chat Layout|Short description|
|Business Contact Chat Layout|Short description, Business, Business Contact, and Case Type|
|Constituent Chat Layout|Short description, Constituent, Case Type|

Two case inbox layouts are included with the Case service channel.

|Case Layout|Included Fields|
|-----------|---------------|
|Default Case Layout|Short description, Business Contact, Account, Priority, Category|
|Consumer Case Layout|Short description, Constituent, Case Type|

## Variable work item sizing

Organizations may like to size cases based on the complexity of the case, time and effort required to complete work. This helps in estimating agent utilization accurately. Advance work assignment currently treats every case as one unit of work. However, sometimes, certain cases may require more work than others. These cases may account for a greater share of an agent’s capacity. Work item sizing allows to size the case differently based on the case attributes. For more information, see [Service channel capacity and utilization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-service-channel-capacity.md).

## Agent affinity

Agent Affinity is an Advanced Work Assignment enhancement that enables you to streamline the routing of work items. Advanced Work Assignment automatically assigns work items based on historical, task-based, or account team affinity. For more information about agent affinity, see [Using Agent Affinity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-agent-affinity-concept.md).
