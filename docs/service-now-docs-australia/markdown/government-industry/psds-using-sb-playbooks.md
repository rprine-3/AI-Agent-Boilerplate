# Using Social Benefits Playbook

If you're a social benefits case agent or manager, you can use the Social Benefits Playbook for Public Sector Digital Services to manage and resolve requests for social benefits.

The Social Benefits Playbook automatically appears in the **Playbook** tab when you create a social benefits request case by using the CRM Workspace. A playbook takes a workflow and breaks it into multiple stages or lanes. Each stage in a playbook includes one or more activities, or steps, for you to complete. Stages can also include automated activities, such as auto-sending an email to a customer when a stage or activity is complete. When using a playbook, you can:

-   View the playbook stages and activities.
-   Select an activity and perform the work to complete that activity.
-   Mark an activity as complete and move to the next activity or stage.
-   Complete the stages and activities to resolve the case.

The workflows for a type of case and the activities that you need to resolve these cases are in the playbook. By using a playbook, you can visualize the entire life cycle of the information request workflow.

## Playbook stages

Like other Public Sector Digital Services playbooks, this playbook contains four stages \(Intake, Review, Process, and Decision\) and several activities in each stage. Below is a diagram illustrating the base Social Benefits Playbook workflow. This workflow can be modified by an admin to match a specific social benefits use case.

The Social Benefits Playbook stages are listed in the following table.

|Task|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Intake|Guides you through the record creation process by capturing the details of the social benefits request and assigning it to the right agent.|
|Review|Acts as a checkpoint for eligibility verification and provides you with an opportunity to review the case details.|
|Process|Guides you through the activities for social benefits request fulfillment.|
|Decision|Captures and communicates the decision and next steps to the constituent and any other agents or involved parties.|

## Playbook layout
