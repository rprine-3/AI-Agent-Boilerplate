# Pricing endorsements in License and Permit Playbook

Pricing endorsements are selections made on an application that affect which fees are charged by a government agency to process and issue a license/permit.

Applicants can customize their permit by selecting one or more permit endorsements. Each endorsement represents a subtype of the main permit model, and are stored as fields in a License Permit extended table. Each endorsement maps to a specific fee in the Decision Table for Pricing.

## Example of Endorsements for an Extended License Permit Case Type

An applicant can select as many endorsements as desired. Driver’s license endorsements are special permissions added to a driver’s license that allow the holder to operate specific types of vehicles or carry out specific driving-related tasks not covered under the standard license. The following table contains some examples of endorsements that can be added to the pricing decision table of a driver's license permit request case.
