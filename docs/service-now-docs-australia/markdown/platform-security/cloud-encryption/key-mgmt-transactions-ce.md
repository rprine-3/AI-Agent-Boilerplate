# Key management transactions

The Key Management Transactions submodule displays all transactions that have occurred for the keys in your ServiceNow instance.

-   A key transaction is defined by the following:
    -   composed of several request steps.
    -   A single Request ID is shared across all request steps.
    -   The initial step, request sequence 0, of a transaction provides the current state of the overall transaction.

        As seen in the image below, the initial step 0 has an overall Request Status of Completed.

-   The following can be identified for the transaction by the individual request step:
    -   The order of each step in a transaction can be identified by the sequence number for the step.
    -   The status of each transaction is visible through the status of the request step.
    -   If any steps beyond the initial step fail, the overall transaction has a status of Failed. If all steps are completed, the transaction status is also completed.

The following screen is a sample of the type of information that displays with a ServiceNow key rotation.

</td><td>

Displays whether a step is being processed in the system during key rotation. The quantity and content of the steps vary based on the type of key operation performed.1.  request\_preparation: Creates a request to trigger and the wrapping and rotation.
2.  request\_integrity\_check: Validates that the request is legitimate and secure.
3.  request\_validation: Validates that there’s a request in progress, only one rotate request can be processed at a time.
4.  attachment\_process: Extracts the wrapped key material from the attachment. \(Additional step when rotating a Customer Managed key.\)
5.  hsm\_&lt;key type&gt;\_upload: Uploads the wrapped key material to the HSM, KeySecure.
6.  key\_metadata\_rotate: Generates the new key metadata.
7.  post\_rotate\_request: Sends a request to perform the key rotation.
8.  post\_rotate\_response: Response to perform the key rotation based on the request from the customer instance.

 **Note:** Provide the request step to Customer Service and Support to analyze the status progression in case a request step doesn’t complete.
