# Summarize Access Observer logs agentic workflow

Use the summarize Access Observer logs agentic workflow to review and summarize access logs for a specific field, identifying access sources, users, and their roles.

## Summarize Access Observer logs agentic workflow overview

Generate a summary of the user, role, and caller types that attempted to access a table column configured in Access Observer. For example, ask the agentic workflow to summarize access logs to view users who accessed a field, along with their roles and how they accessed the data.

When you install ServiceNow Otto for Vault, this agentic workflow is turned on by default.

To modify the agentic workflow, [duplicate it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements.

## Summarize Access Observer logs

Generate a summary of all Access Observer logs. The workflow requires that you have the following roles and elevate to them:

-   sn\_vault\_console.vault\_console\_admin
-   security\_admin

To access and configure the agentic workflow:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Select **Summarize Access Observer logs**.

**Note:** The summarize Access Observer logs agentic workflow is triggered automatically when you secure custom applications using ServiceNow Vault console dashboard. You can also invoke the agentic workflow manually in the ServiceNow Otto panel.
