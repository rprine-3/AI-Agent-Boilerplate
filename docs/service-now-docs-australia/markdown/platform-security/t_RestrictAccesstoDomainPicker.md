# Restrict access to the domain picker

Use a system property to restrict access to the domain picker in Core UI and Next Experience.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, users with the ITIL role, and roles that include the ITIL role \(such as the administrator\), can access the domain picker in Next Experience. You can grant other roles access by adding them to the property or restrict roles by removing them. It is recommended to restrict the role to admins only.

Admins can grant access to users by creating a system property in the sys\_properties table.\[Omitted image "domain-sep-global-polaris.png"\] Alt text: Polaris domain picker UI

## Procedure

1.  Open the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table.

2.  Add this property: `glide.ui.polaris.domain_picker.role`

3.  Configure the property value as a comma-separated list of roles: **admin, itil**.
