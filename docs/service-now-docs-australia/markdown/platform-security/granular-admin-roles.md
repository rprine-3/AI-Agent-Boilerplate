# Granular admin roles

Granular admin roles enables you to verify proper access management by assigning roles that define user permissions and responsibilities. By doing so, organizations can maintain security, enforce conformance, and optimize their operations effectively.

Roles are a fundamental part of managing access and maintaining security within your instance. They define what you can see and do, verifying that you have the appropriate level of access based on your responsibilities. By assigning the correct roles to the users, organizations can safeguard sensitive data, enforce conformance, and streamline operations.

To optimize access management within the ServiceNow AI Platform, consider adopting granular admin roles. This approach enables you to assign specific permissions to developers or users who perform minor administrative tasks, without granting them unrestricted access to the full admin role.

**Note:**

-   Users who are assigned with admin role previously will have its granular admin roles assigned based on the product or module that they had access to earlier.
-   Each product within the ServiceNow AI Platform has its own set of granular admin roles. To determine the appropriate roles for your administrators or developers, refer to the specific product documentation.
-   You can assign the Instance operator \(`instance_operator`\) role for users who handle day-to-day operations without elevated system configuration privileges. Assign this role to users who need to:
    -   Check logs and diagnose problems
    -   Perform routine maintenance
    -   Keep workflows running smoothly
-   Granular admin roles are separate from the existing admin role and must be assigned independently.

By adopting granular admin roles, you can create a more secure and efficient access management system that aligns with your organization's needs.
