# Manually manage the domain for particular records

By default, the system automatically assigns a domain based on the user's company record. In some cases, however, domain administrators want to manually manage which domain a particular record belongs to.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The **Managed domain** field allows domain administrators to manually select a domain for the user, group, department, location, or CI record, rather than using the domain assigned automatically from the company record. The **Managed domain** field is available on these record types.

-   User records
-   Group records
-   Department records
-   Location records
-   CI records

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the record you want to manually manage.

2.  Select the **Managed** domain check box.

3.  From the **Domain** field, select the domain for the record.

4.  Click **Update**.

    Clearing the **Managed domain** check box hides **Domain** field and the record uses the domain value from the record's company.
