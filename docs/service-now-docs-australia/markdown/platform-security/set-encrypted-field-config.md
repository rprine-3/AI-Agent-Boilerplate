# Set encrypted field configurations

Configure which table columns or attachments that the system encrypts using a preconfigured cryptographic module.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager or sn\_kmf.admin and security\_admin or elevate role to security admin.

## About this task

Make sure you are in the correct application scope so you can see the tables in that scope.

Only users with access to the cryptographic module used in this configuration can read the data in the encrypted table column or access the attachment.

-   If a user has write access but not read access, the field displays in edit mode and the data entered displays as asterisks.
-   If a user has read access but not write access, the field displays the decrypted data in read-only mode.
-   If a user has all access, both read/write functionality is available on the encrypted field.

See [Create a cryptographic module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/create-cryptographic-module.md) or [Create cryptographic module for Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-PE-cryptographic-module.md) to begin.

You can create configurations in various ways:

-   Select the **Encrypted Fields** option from a module tile on the Field Encryption Experience Module page.
-   Within an open module pending initial configuration, select **Configure fields encrypted in this module** or **Encrypted Fields**.
-   Select **Create new** from the **Configurations** tab.

**Important:**

After encrypting a column, any new data inserted into the column is encrypted automatically. However, data that existed in the column before the encryption was active is not automatically encrypted.

In order to encrypt data that existed before the column was encrypted, you must run a separate mass encryption job. Learn more about mass encryption in [Run mass encryption or decryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/mass-enc-dec.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Field Encryption** &gt; **Field Encryption Experience**.

2.  Select **View module details** for the module you are setting up encrypted field configurations.

3.  Select the **Configure fields encrypted in this module** option from the **Complete these steps in any order to set up the module** section.

    **Note:** To establish a Field Encryption configuration that will be used by multiple modules or manage the Encrypt by default option, navigate to the **Configurations** tab and select **Create new**. This method allows you to select the module the configuration will apply to.

4.  Select **Configure**.

5.  Complete the form.

<table id="table_kfg_lzv_bkb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

**Column** to encrypt a table column or **Attachment** to encrypt all of a table's attachments.

 Types of data encrypted are:

 -   String text \(Full UTF-8\)
-   Attachments
-   Date, Date/Time:

**Note:** You can create encrypted field configurations to encrypt existing Date and Date/Time fields. You can add a new encryption configuration to a parent table only. You can’t add a new encryption configuration to a child table.

-   URL
-   HTML
-   Journal
-   Translated


</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table whose fields or attachments are to be encrypted. **Important:** Attachment-type Encrypted Field Configurations \(EFCs\) don't automatically apply to extended \(child\) tables. For example, if you create an EFC for attachments on the task table, attachments on extended tables such as incident, case, or problem aren't automatically encrypted. You must create a separate EFC for each extended table that requires attachment encryption.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Column

</td><td>

Column \(field\) to be encrypted if you selected **column** as the type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Select to mark the configuration active. Deselect if the configuration isn’t yet in use.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Crypto module

</td><td>

The cryptographic module that the encrypted field configuration applies to.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Method

</td><td>

Select **Single Module** to set the field configuration across one module. Select **Multiple Modules** for role-based access that spans across more than one cryptographic module.-   **Single Module**

Use this option to encrypt all attachments using a single module. Your users need access to this module, otherwise they aren't able to upload attachments.

-   **Multiple Modules**

Use this option to allow users to choose a module when uploading attachments. Users with access to at least one module can select a module to use for encryption. Users with no module access can upload unencrypted attachments.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Algorithm Encrypted Preserving\[read-only\]

</td><td>

Indicates if the crypto module that you selected is already configured to support non-deterministic encryption. This means that if the same data is encrypted more than once, the encryption is different each time.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Select **Submit**.
