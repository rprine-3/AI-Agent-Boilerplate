# Authenticator applications

Use third party authenticator applications to generate temporary MFA pass codes.

An authenticator application is third-party software that generates temporary pass-codes. You can use these pass-codes along with your password to login into an instance that requires multi-factor authentication \(MFA\).

If your administrator has enabled MFA on your instance, you see a prompt for a pass-code after entering your user and password during login.

**Note:** Install an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator on your mobile device before scanning the QR code. The QR code configures your authenticator app for this account; it does not install the app.

ServiceNow requires authenticator applications that support Time-based One-time Passwords \(TOTP\).

ServiceNow tests MFA with the following authenticators:

-   Google Authenticator
-   Microsoft Authenticator
-   LastPass Authenticator
-   Authy
-   FreeOTP
-   Duo
-   Okta Verify

**Note:** Other authenticators not listed might also be compatible, but are not tested by ServiceNow.
