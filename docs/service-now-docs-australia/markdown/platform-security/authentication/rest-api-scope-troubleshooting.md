# REST API scope troubleshooting

Troubleshooting actions can help resolve common issues when setting up or running the REST API scope.

REST API is linked with auth scope, however in runtime there is no auth scope check even using Bearer token authentication.

</td><td>

-   Make sure the sys\_api\_access\_policy record is active. Runtime ignores inactive records.
-   Check if property **com.glide.rest.api.auth.scope.check.enable** is set to false.
-   Check if the OAuth token has `useraccount` auth scope.

</td></tr><tr><td>

REST API is linked with **auth\_scope1**, however the access token which has **auth\_scope2** is also able to access it.

</td><td>

-   Check if this record is active.
-   Check for this REST, check if any other records, which have the same APIs but different apply methods, versions, or resource.

</td></tr><tr><td>

REST API is linked with auth scope, however in runtime there is no auth scope check for **basicAuth** and **mutualAuth**.

</td><td>

It is expected since the REST API auth scope only applies to the OAuth access token or OIDC token. It doesn’t apply BasicAuth, Session Cookie and Certificate based authentication.

</td></tr><tr><td>

REST API call return 403 when using the OAuth access token.

</td><td>

Check for the error message "Missing required api access scope". If found then the auth scope check fails for this REST API

</td></tr><tr><td>

Pre-defined `useraccount` is deleted and not sure to restore.

</td><td>

Export `useraccount` as `xml` from the other instance and import it or create an `useraccount` and modify system property **glide.oauth.token.scope.useraccount** to the newly created sys\_id record.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Frequently asked questions

Following are some of the frequently asked question when using the REST API Auth scope:

-   **Can one OAuth token be linked with several auth scopes?**

    Yes, one `oauth_entity` can be linked with multiple auth scopes, every OAuth token issued by this `oauth_entity` has the same auth scopes.

-   **Can different OAuth tokens with different auth scopes access the same REST API?**

    Yes, for the same REST API, it may be accessed by different auth scopes. As long as one auth scope is matched, the auth scope returns the results.

-   **Can OAuth access token with `useraccount` auth scope access any REST APIs?**

    Yes, the `useraccount` has full access to auth scope.

-   **Can OAuth access token OAuth scope be changed dynamically?**

    Yes, the auth scoped is not hard-coded with the access token in the `oauth_credential` table. Instead auth scope is getting from linked `oauth_entity` during runtime.

-   **Can OAuth token keep same auth scopes after refresh?**

    Yes, auth scope will not change after token refresh, unless `oauth_admin` modify auth scope linked with `oauth_entity`.

-   **Pre-defined `useraccount` auth scope record is deleted, can a new auth scope with name `useraccount` be created?**

    Creating a new auth scope with the same `useraccount` doesn't work. In the runtime, it uses the `sys_id` instead of name to do the auth scope check, modify the system property **glide.oauth.token.scope.useraccount** to the newly created `sys_id` record.

-   **If admin modify auth scoped linked with `oauth_entity`, are all the existing OAuth access token issued by this OAuth entity changed also?**

    Yes, the auth scope is not directly linked with the OAuth access token, it is getting from `oauth_entity` during runtime.

-   **Can different OAuth access tokens issued by the same `oauth_entity` have different auth scopes?**

    No, all access to the token is issued by the same `oauth_entity` and always have the same auth scopes.

-   **Can a user define different auth scopes for a particular endpoint?**

    No, there is a unique constrain check for a particular REST API endpoint. However for the same REST API endpoint, it may have more than one matched auth scopes.

-   **Is the auth scope check used for BasicAuth also?**

    No, auth scope check is only OAuth access token and OIDC token, it is not applied for **basicAuth** and **mutualAuth**
