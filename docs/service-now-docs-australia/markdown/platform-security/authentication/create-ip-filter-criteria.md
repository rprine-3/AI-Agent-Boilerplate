4.  Right-click the form header and click **Save**.

5.  From the **IP Range** tab, double-click **Insert a new row**.

    You can enter a single IP address or multiple ranges of IP addresses. For example, for a range of IP addresses enter `192.0.2.0` in the **Start IP** column and `192.0.2.255` in the **End IP** column.

    **Note:** For a single IP addresses, make sure that you enter the same IP address in the **Start IP** address and **End IP** columns. When you enter an IP address in the **Start IP** column, leave the **End IP** column blank and then save the record. The **End IP** column is auto-populated with the same **Start IP** address.

6.  From the **Subnet \(CIDR\)** tab, double-click **Insert a new row**.

    Enter the Network IP address and Netmask in the Classless Inter-Domain Routing \(CIDR\) format. For example, enter `255.255.255.0` as Network IP and `25` as Netmask.
