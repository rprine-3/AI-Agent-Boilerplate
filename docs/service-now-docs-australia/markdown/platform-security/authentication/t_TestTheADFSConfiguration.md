# Test the ADFS configuration

Test your ADFS configuration to verify that it is properly functioning as an identity provider.

## Before you begin

Role required: sso\_config\_admin, business\_rule\_admin, script\_include\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Open an Internet Explorer browser.

2.  Navigate to your ADFS portal.

    For example, `https://samportal.example.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx`. This page contains a drop-down list of all configured Relying Party Trusts.

3.  Select the relying party that is associated with your instance.

4.  Click **Continue to Sign In**.

    If you have configured the SAML 2.0 external authentication properly, you should be automatically logged into the instance.

5.  Test a direct login URL by navigating to `https://samportal.example.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx?logintoRP=https://company.service-now.com`.
