# SAML 2.0 configuration using Multi-Provider SSO

You can create or update a SAML 2.0 SSO configuration from the Multi-Provider SSO feature.

## Before you begin

Role required: sso\_config\_admin, business\_rule\_admin, script\_include\_admin

## About this task

**Note:** New to the Jakarta release, you must validate your configuration by using the Test Connection functionality before you can activate your IdP configuration. You can still use the Update functionality to save your configuration data, but it is not an active configuration without a successful test connection.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-Provider SSO** &gt; **Identity Providers**.

2.  Do one of the following options.

    -   To update a configuration, select an SSO configuration record.
    -   To create configuration, select **New** &gt; **SAML**.
3.  Enter the IdP information by one of the following methods.

<table id="choicetable_okg_pdd_4z"><tbody><tr><td id="d229269e119">

**Using a metadata descriptor URL**

</td><td>

Select the URL check box and enter the URL of the IdP that you're using.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d229269e128">

**Using metadata descriptor XML file**

</td><td>

Select the XML check box and paste in the XML data generated from the IdP you're using.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d229269e137">

**Entering metadata manually**

</td><td>

Close the pop-up window and manually enter the data in the property fields.

</td></tr></tbody>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Yes

</td><td>

Enter the name for the IdP. This IdP is the auto redirect sys id.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default

</td><td>

No

</td><td>

The Auto Redirect IdP, formerly known as the Primary IdP, automatically redirects users to access the base instance URL. This property sets this IdP configuration as the default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Auto Redirect IdP

</td><td>

No

</td><td>

Sets this IdP configuration as the Auto Redirect IdP.**Note:** If you make a new Auto Redirect IdP configuration active, the**glide\_sso\_id**cookie updates with the new Auto Redirect IdP. The **glide.authenticate.sso.update.idp.cookie** system property, automatically enabled, controls this feature.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Choose the client type, based on the type of your client. Options:**Iframe Embedded**.**Note:** If client type field is required for your configuration, you can edit the form and add the field.

</table>4.  Encryption And Signing tab

    **Note:**

    -   You should use your own self-signed or CA-signed certificate. The following types of certificates are supported:
        -   [BCFKS \(FIPS-compliant\) keystore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/create-fips-certificate-for-saml.md) \(Recommended\)
        -   Java keystore
    -   The **FIPS approved mode** requires different certificates for **Encryption** and **Signing**.
    -   Use different certificates for **Encryption** and **Signing** for a better security posture.
    -   While using the certificates, make sure to update the following system properties with the sys\_id of the certificates \(x.509 Certificates\):
        -   **Signing** \(`glide.authenticate.sso.saml2.keystore`\)
        -   **Encryption** \(`glide.authenticate.sso.saml2.encryption.keystore`\)
    -   Make sure to update the key alias and key password of the **Signing** and **Encryption** keystores in the Identity Provider record and generate the metadata \(Select **Generate Metadata**\).
    -   Upload the signing and encryption certificates present in the generated metadata \(XML\) to the Identity Provider.
    -   To configure certificate expiry notification, use **Notify on expiration** and **Groups to notify on expiration**, and set the notification timing using **Warn in days to expire** and **Frequency**.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Auto Provisioning User

</td><td>

Enable automatic user provisioning, creates the users when user doesn't exists in the instance User Table based on the information provided by the IdP.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Update User Record Upon Each Login

</td><td>

Updates user information in the instance User table with the information in the IdP each time the user logs in using SAML.

</td></tr><tr><td>

User groups applied to provisioned users

</td><td>

Specifies the user groups that are automatically assigned to users created through SAML user provisioning.

 When a user is provisioned from the SAML identity provider, the instance adds the user to each group listed in this field, so provisioned users receive consistent group membership — and any roles or access those groups grant — without manual assignment.
