# IP address access control

Apply an IP access control to outbound traffic, inbound traffic, or bidirectional traffic. The system only blocks an IP address if a matching Deny rule exists and no matching Allow rule exists. By default, there are no restrictions on access to your instance.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Use the Adaptive Authentication \(AA\) pre-authentication context policy to enforce IP based authentications and restrictions for additional capabilities. For more information, see [Adaptive authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/adaptive-authentication.md).

Role required: admin

**Important:** IP Address Control access control rules can affect the MID Server outbound traffic. If you configure the denylist, add the MID Server IP addresses as allowlist exceptions to avoid connectivity disruptions. For MID Server IP requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **IP Address Access Control** to see a list of your IP access controls.

    You might have to activate the IP Range Based Authentication \[com.snc.ipauthenticator\] plugin.

2.  Complete the form.

    **Note:** To find your instance IP information, Log in to [ServiceNow - NOW Support](https://support.servicenow.com/now), and Search for the **My IP Information** service catalog item.

MID Server traffic

</td><td>

MID Server outbound connections use the MID Server host IP address and not the instance. When using rules, add the MID Server host IP addresses to allowlist with the **Outbound** direction to avoid blocking MID Server traffic. For a list of MID Server IP requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Type of access control rule to include.

 -   Allow: Any IP address in this range can interact with this instance.
-   Deny: Any IP address in this range cannot interact with this instance unless it is listed in an Allow rule. Also, when adding deny rules, you cannot deny your own public IP address or your instance does not update a deny rule.
 **Note:** To support maintenance, upgrades, and Customer Service and Support, some ServiceNow internal IPs cannot be blocked by Deny rules.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Direction

</td><td>

Direction of the IP access control rule.-   **Inbound**: Choose Inbound to allow or deny inbound transactions. These are transactions initiated from outside of your instance.
-   **Outbound**: Choose Outbound to allow or deny outbound transactions. These are transactions initiated from within your instance.
-   **Bidirectional**: Choose Bidirectional for the configuration to apply for both Inbound and Outbound.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Range End

</td><td>

Ending range of IP addresses to allow or deny.**Note:** To limit access to specific VPN addresses only, enter a Deny range of **0.0.0.0** through **255.255.255.255** into the **Deny** field, and only enter the specific allowed VPN ranges.

Comma-separated list of ports to which the access control rule applies. Leave it empty to apply the rule to all ports.
