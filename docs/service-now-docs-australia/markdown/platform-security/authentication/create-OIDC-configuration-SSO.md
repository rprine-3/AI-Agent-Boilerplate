# Create an OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) configuration for Single Sign-On \(SSO\)

Create or update an OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) configuration by using the Multi-Provider SSO plugin.

## Before you begin

-   Register an OIDC application with your Identity Provider \(IdP\) and note the Client ID, Client Secret, and Well-known configuration URL.
-   [Activate Multi-Provider SSO plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/t_ActivateMultipleProviderSSO.md). Multi-Provider SSO feature supports domain separation, you can specify different IdP's to different domains.
-   [Configure Multi-provider SSO properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/t_ConfigureMultiProviderSSOProps.md)
-   [Activate Approval with e-Signature plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/activate-approval-esignature.md) to enable eSignature for the OIDC IdP.
-   Role required: sso\_config\_admin, business\_rule\_admin, script\_include\_admin

If you have a client ID, client secret, and well-known configuration URL of the identity provider, you can directly import the OIDC configuration for SSO.

**Note:**

-   The **Login with OIDC** button is not shown on the login page for OIDC based IDPs if the domain separation plugin is installed.
-   Admin can use OIDC based IdP to enable SSO for a user of specific company or domain.
-   ServiceNow support the JSON Web Encryption \(JWE\) as part of the OIDC SSO flow. To know more, see the [KB Article](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2546935).

If you do not have the required information about the identity provider, you can manually configure OIDC for SSO. After completing the configuration, users can log in to ServiceNow applications using third-party social identity providers like Google Okta.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-Provider SSO** &gt; **Identity Providers**.

2.  Choose one of the following options.

    -   To update an existing configuration, click an OIDC Identity Provider record.
    -   To create a new configuration, click **New** and select **OpenID Connect**.
3.  For a new configuration, enter the OIDC configuration information in one of the following methods.

<table id="choicetable_okg_pdd_4z"><tbody><tr><td id="d209276e169">

**Import OpenID Connect Well-Known Configuration**

</td><td>

If you have the well-known configuration URL along with your associated client credentials, you can directly import an OIDC configuration.**Note:** If you import the OIDC well-known configuration, all related fields are auto-populated.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d209276e181">

**Manually configure the OIDC Identity Provider form**

</td><td>

If you do not have an existing OAuth OIDC Entity, close the Import OpenID Connect Well-Known Configuration pop-up and manually fill the fields in the OIDC Identity Provider form.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    |Property|Description|
    |--------|-----------|
    |Name|Unique name for the OIDC identity provider configuration.|
    |Client ID|Client ID of the application registered in the third-party OIDC identity provider.|
    |Client Secret|Client secret of the application registered in the third-party OIDC identity provider.|
    |Well-known Configuration URL|URL that contains metadata about the third-party OIDC identity provider.|

    All required fields must be filled in on the OIDC Identity Provider form.

    Before you manually fill the OIDC Identity Provider form, ensure that you already have an OAuth Entity Profile for the OIDC IdP.

    If you do not have a OAuth Entity Profile, you can create it using the default External OIDC Provider templates, like Okta, Azure and others.

    The grant type of the OAuth Entity Profile must be with an authorization code. For more information, see [Configure an OAuth OIDC provider on the ServiceNow AI Platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/add-OIDC-entity.md).

    **Note:** You can use the templates of third-party identity providers, Auth0, Azure AD, Google, and Okta are available in the demo data of the Multiple Provider Single Sign-On Installer plugin.
