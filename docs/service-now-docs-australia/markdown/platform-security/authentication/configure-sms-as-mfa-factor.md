    The new policy is created. For more information, see [Role Filter Criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/create-role-filter-criteria.md).

7.  On the Policy - Display SMS OTP as an MFA Factor Policy page, click Policy conditions.

    \[Omitted image "sms-mfa-condition.png"\] Alt text: Policy form with Policy Conditions highlighted.

8.  Click **New** to add **Policy Conditions**.

</table>10. Click **Submit**.

11. Repeat step 8 to create additional policy conditions.

    **Note:** If you create multiple policy conditions, the final output of the access policy depends on the logical OR output of the all policy conditions. This means that the policy evaluates to true if any one of your policy conditions is met.

    Based on the role filter \(users\) policy and the conditions specified for the role is matched, the SMS as MFA factor is shown as an option for authentication for the users.
