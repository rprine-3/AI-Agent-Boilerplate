# Configure REST API Auth scope

Link the OAuth entity with an auth scope to manage the token to access the REST APIs that are linked with the auth scope.

## Before you begin

Install the following plugins:

-   OAuth 2.0

**Note:** The **REST API Auth Scope** plugin is added as part of the Tokyo release.

Role required: api\_service\_admin, adaptive\_auth\_policy\_admin

## Consider creating three REST API Auth Scope for Table API

The first auth scope is mapped to the **Table API** with all the http methods, versions, and resources enabled.

The second auth scope is mapped to the **Table API** with all the versions and resources enabled. But, you choose the HTTP Method, in this example, the **GET** method.

\[Omitted image "auth-scope2.png"\] Alt text: REST API Auth Scope2

The third auth scope is mapped to the **Table API** without the http methods, versions, and resources enabled. But, you choose the HTTP Method, Version, and Resource manually. In this example, HTTP Method is **GET**, REST API Version is **latest**, and Resource is `/now/table/{tableName}`.

\[Omitted image "auth-scope1.png"\] Alt text: REST API Auth Scope1

If all these auth scopes are created, you can use **GET** method with all the three scopes, but for **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, or **PATCH** methods only **scope3** can be used.
