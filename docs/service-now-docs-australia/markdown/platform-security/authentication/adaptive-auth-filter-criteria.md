# Filter criteria

Filter criteria \(also called policy inputs\) are used as inputs for policy conditions to verify and meet the requirements of an authentication request.

Use filter criteria to supply information authentication policies such as a user's IP address, roles, or groups. Add these criteria in the **Policy conditions** section of your policies.

There are seven types of filter criteria used in adaptive authentication. Your authentication policies can use one or more of these criteria to evaluate authentication requests.

**Note:** Location filter and Identity Provider filter are available with Zero Trust Access feature. For more information, see [Zero Trust Access \(ZTA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/session-access.md).

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|IP filter criteria|Use IP filter criteria to filter users based on the user's IP addresses. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.|
|Role filter criteria|Use role filter criteria to filter users based on their roles.|
|Group filter criteria|Use group filter criteria to filter users based on the user group to which the user belongs.|
|Location filter criteria|Use location filter criteria to filter users based on the user location.|
|Identity Provider Attribute filter criterias|Use the Identity Provider attributes that are received from SAML response from the IdP as a filter criteria for authentication.|

## Generic Criteria

In addition to the previously listed types, there are four generic filter criteria. These criteria do not appear in your filter navigator, but you can select them while adding policy inputs to your authentication policies.
