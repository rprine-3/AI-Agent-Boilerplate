# Activate REST API access policy

You can activate the REST API Access Policy plugin \(com.glide.rest.policy\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

## About this task

The following items are installed with REST API Access Policy:

-   Plugins: com.gilde.auth.profile, com.snc.adaptive\_authentication, com.snc.platform.security.oauth
-   Tables: sys\_api\_access\_policy, sys\_auth\_profile\_mapping, auth\_policy\_mapping, inbound\_auth\_profile, std\_http\_auth.

For more information, see [Adaptive authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/adaptive-authentication.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the REST API Access Policy plugin \(com.glide.rest.policy\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
