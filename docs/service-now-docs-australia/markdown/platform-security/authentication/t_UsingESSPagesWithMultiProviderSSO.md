# Use Service Portal with Multi-Provider SSO to redirect a URL

Service Portal uses a combination of system properties and script includes to determine how the system handles URL redirects for users logging in to the portal.

## Before you begin

Role required: sso\_config\_admin, business\_rule\_admin, script\_include\_admin

## About this task

If you are using the system property to automatically redirect to your primary Identity Provider \(IdP\), then Service Portal automatically redirects to that IdP. If you have multiple IdPs, Service Portal shows a link on the login page to **Use external login**.

## Procedure

1.  [Configure the Service Portal login page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_SPSSOLoginAndRedirects.md)

2.  [Redirect to Service Portal after login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_SPSSOLoginAndRedirects.md)
