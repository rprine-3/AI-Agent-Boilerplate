# Enable password policies on your instance

Implement password policy controls at login. Force users to change their password if the password does not meet the password policy criteria.

## Before you begin

Role required: password\_policy\_admin

## About this task

The Password Policy plugin \(com.glide.password\_policy\) is enabled by default. The policy goes into effect when a user changes or resets the password.

The **Password Strength Preset** field is automatically set to **Default Strong**. If you want to add new criteria, you can perform the following procedure.

If you customized your instance through the **ValidatePasswordStronger** installation exit or your Password Reset credential store **pwd\_cred\_store** property, then see [password policy properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/password-policy-properties.md) to know how to implement a password policy for your instance.

**Note:** The active password policy is highlighted for the Instance as shown.
