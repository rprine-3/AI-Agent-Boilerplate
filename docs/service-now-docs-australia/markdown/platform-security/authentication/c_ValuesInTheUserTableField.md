# Values in the User table field for SAML

Ensure that the integration's User table field contains appropriate matching values.

For example, if the integration uses the email field as the `NameID` token, ensure that the instance lists the same email address as the IdP. The integration fails to authenticate any user who does not have a matching value for the `NameID` token.
