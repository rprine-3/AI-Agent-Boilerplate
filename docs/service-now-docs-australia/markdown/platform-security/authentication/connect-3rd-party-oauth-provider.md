-   **Resource owner password credentials**: The user name and password of the user that is trying to obtain access to the resource.
-   **Client Credentials**: The client ID and client secret, which are both used to get the access token. This method does not provide refresh tokens.
-   **JWT Bearer**: An authorization server validates a JWT token which enables identity and security information to be shared across security domains.

**Note:** For outbound request to SuccessFactors use the **SAML2 Bearer** as the Default Grant Type.
