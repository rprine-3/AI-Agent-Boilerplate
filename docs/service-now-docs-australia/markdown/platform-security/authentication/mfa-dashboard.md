# MFA Dashboard

View the different MFA metrics to understand the MFA adoption and usage.

The MFA enhances security by requiring an additional verification step during the login process. The MFA Dashboard helps you to monitor and manage MFA settings for your organization. This dashboard provides an overview of MFA user enrollment, privileged admins who haven't opted MFA, and compliance. You can use it to ensure that all users have MFA enabled for enhanced security.

To access the MFA Dashboard, navigate **All** &gt; **Multi-factor Authentication** &gt; **MFA Dashboard**.

**Note:** You must enable MFA to view the metrics. For more information, see [Multi-factor Authentication system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/mfa-properties.md).

Following are the types of metrics displayed on the MFA Dashboard:

Description

Users enrolled in Multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\)

</td><td>

The percentage of users who can perform username-password based login and enrolled in MFA. This metric provides an insight on the adoption of MFA by the users over a period of time.**Note:** Ideally, the score should gradually increase and should be 100% over a period of time \(Refreshed once a day to collect records for a day before\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Privileged admins without Multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\)

</td><td>

Privileged admins not using MFA is a significant risk to platform security. It’s recommended that you get these people using MFA. **Note:** Privileged admins are the users who have at least one role from the sys\_icenter\_role\_config table. \(Refreshed once a day to collect records for a day before\).
