# Using Multi-factor authentication

Learn how to use multi-factor authentication tools to securely access your instance.

## Login with MFA

ServiceNow requires authenticator applications that support Time-based One-time Passwords \(TOTP\). ServiceNow tests MFA with the following authenticators:

-   Google Authenticator
-   Microsoft Authenticator
-   LastPass Authenticator
-   Authy
-   FreeOTP
-   Duo
-   Okta Verify

**Note:**

-   Other authenticators not listed might also be compatible, but are not tested by ServiceNow.
-   For information related to browser specific behavior change, see this [KB article](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0998122).

## Register an authentication app

<table id="table_g22_2j4_dpb"><tbody><tr><td>

-   **Authenticator App**

You can use authenticator apps to use a second factor of authentication.


</td><td>

If your administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) on your instance, you are prompted for a second authentication after entering your user name and password. For details on the MFA login process, see [Log in with Multi-factor Authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/t_LogOnWithMultifactorAuth.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

-   **Validation with Authenticator app**

Enter the code displayed on your authenticator app to login.


</td><td>

If you haven't configured a second form of authentication, you will see a configuration page after logging in to guide you through the process of setting up an authentication app. For details on this setup, see [Set up Multi-factor authentication for the first time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/t_SetUpMultiFactorAuthUponLogin.md).

</table>## Register an authentication device

<table id="table_qm1_zj4_dpb"><tbody><tr><td>

After you've configured an authentication app, you can register other methods for authentication.

-   **Biometric authenticators**

You can use biometric authenticators like fingerprint or facial recognition as your second MFA authentication. If your administrator allows this option, you can configure biometric authenticators using the steps in [Register a biometric authenticator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/mfa-setup-bio-auth.md).

-   **Hardware key authenticators**

Hardware keys are physical security devices you can use for authentication. You can register a hardware device for use with your instance using the steps in [Register a hardware security key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/mfa-setup-hardware-key-auth.md).


</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

-   **Validation with Biometric or Hardware Key**

Use the biometric or hardware key to login.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Register a phone number for OTP

<table id="table_bjc_2wb_2vb"><tbody><tr><td>

-   **SMS**

Use SMS based OTP to require users who attempt to login.


</td><td>

When users attempt to login to ServiceNow, SMS OTP is sent to the mobile number associated with the sys\_user record. Users can enter the six-digit verification code that it sent to the mobile device and verify their identity.

 \[Omitted image "sms.png"\] Alt text: SMS.

</td></tr><tr><td>

-   **Validation with SMS**

Use the validation with SMS to login based on the OTP generated.


</td><td>

You need to enter the 6-digit code sent to the mobile number to login. The code sent is valid for the next 5 minutes. You can use resend code to again send the code.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Register an Email address for OTP

<table id="table_xwx_dwb_2vb"><tbody><tr><td>

-   **Email address**

Use Email based OTP to require users who attempt to login.


</td><td>

 \[Omitted image "email.png"\] Alt text: Email.

</td></tr><tr><td>

-   **Validation with Email**

Use the validation with Email to login based on the OTP generated.


</td><td>

You need to enter the 6-digit code sent to the email address to login. The code sent is valid for the next 5 minutes. You can use resend code to again send the code.\[Omitted image "email-screen-mfa.png"\] Alt text: MFA-Email.
