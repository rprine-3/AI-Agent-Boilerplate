# User Metrics

User Metrics displays the user MFA enrollment trends on ServiceNow.

User Metrics on the MFA Dashboard are as follows:

-   [Users enrolled in Multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/user-metrics.md)
-   [Privileged admins without Multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/user-metrics.md)

## Users enrolled in Multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\)

The percentage of users who can perform username-password based login and enrolled in MFA. This metric provides an insight on the adoption of MFA by the users over a period of time.

**Note:** Ideally, the score should gradually increase and should be 100% over a period of time \(Refreshed once a day to collect records for a day before\).

## Privileged admins without Multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\)

Privileged admins not using MFA is a significant risk to platform security. It’s recommended that you get these people using MFA.

**Note:** Privileged admins are the users who have at least one role from the **sys\_icenter\_role\_config** table. \(Refreshed once a day to collect records for a day before\).
