# Remember me

When the **Remember me** check box is selected at login, a cookie is stored on the user's computer. This cookie automatically authenticates the user upon subsequent visits.

If the user logs out, the cookie is destroyed. The default value of the **Remember me** check box is controlled by one property, and whether or not the check box appears on the login page is controlled by a different property.

Two properties, **glide.ui.user\_cookie.life\_span\_in\_days** and **glide.ui.user\_cookie.max\_life\_span\_in\_days** control the glide\_user system generated cookie expiration value. When a user accesses an instance with 'remember me' enabled, the access resets the cookie expiration period until the maximum \(glide.ui.user\_cookie.max\_life\_span\_in\_days\) life span limit is reached.

## Remember me properties

Configure the following properties to control the **Remember me** cookie behaviour:

**Note:** To learn more about these properties, see the following topics in Instance Security Hardening Settings:
