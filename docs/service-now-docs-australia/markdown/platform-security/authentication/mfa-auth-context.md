# Multi-factor Authentication context

The Multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\) policy context uses a policy to define how and when MFA is enforced during the login process.

## MFA context record

The MFA policy context defines whether your users must provide a second form of authentication when logging in. This context does not deny access to your instance as the post-authentication and pre-authentication policies. The policy you select in this context takes precedence over user or role-based configurations for multi-factor authentication.

To access the MFA context, navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-factor Authentication** &gt; **MFA Context**.

Use the fields in the Post-authentication policy context record to define how your instance uses your policy.

**Note:**

-   If the default policy is **Step-Up MFA Policy**, users will be shown with Multi-factor Authentication if policy configured in **Step-Up MFA Policy** evaluates to true. Policy takes precedence over the user or role based configuration.
-   MFA with SSO login will only be available if `glide.authenticate.mfa.with.multisso.enabled` Property is set to true.
-   You can navigate to the Authentication Policy record to Add or Edit the 'Policy Input\(s\)' to the referenced Policy field \(**Step-Up MFA Policy** or **Step-Down MFA Policy**\).
-   MFA context policy applies only for user log ins. It does not apply for API authentication, basic auth, and OAuth resource owner password credential grant.

Default Policy

Defines the default behavior of this context when evaluating the policy. Select from the following options.-   **Step-Up MFA Policy**

Enforces MFA to users when the policy conditions defined in the **Step-Up MFA Policy** field evaluate to true.

-   **Step-Down MFA Policy**

Enforces MFA by default. MFA is not enforced only when the policy conditions defined in the **Step-Down MFA Policy** field evaluate to true.

</table>## Policy inputs and conditions

The **Policy Input** and **Policy Conditions** tabs display the inputs and conditions of the policy selected in the **Step-Up MFA Policy** or **Step-Down MFA Policy** field. These tabs serve as a reference, but cannot be used to change the policy inputs or conditions. To modify your policy settings, navigate to the policy using the reference icon \(\[Omitted image "reference-icon.png"\] Alt text: Reference icon\) next to the **Step-Up MFA Policy** or **Step-Down MFA Policy** field.

**Note:** Policy conditions can be created from here, but as a good practise it is recommended to add new policy conditions from policy page.

This example shows an MFA context record configured using a step-up MFA policy. This default policy means that MFA is enforced only when the conditions defined in the policy evaluate to true. The context uses a policy called **Step-Up MFA policy**. That policy has a set of inputs and conditions that are displayed in the **Policy Input** and **Policy Condition** tabs.

## MFA factor policies

MFA factor policies are a critical component of an organization's security posture, enabling you to enforce additional verification steps beyond passwords. These policies define the authentication methods that users must employ to access providing a flexible and customizable approach to authentication.
