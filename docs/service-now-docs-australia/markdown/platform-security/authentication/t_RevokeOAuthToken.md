# Revoke an OAuth token

You might want to revoke an OAuth access or refresh token for security reasons.

## Before you begin

Role required: oauth\_admin

## About this task

Revoking the token pertains to the situation where your instance acts as the OAuth resource server. You can revoke the token through a URL.

## Procedure

-   Access your instance using `oauth_revoke_token.do` and append the access or refresh token.

    For example: `https://[Your_ServiceNow_Instance]:[port]/oauth_revoke_token.do?token=[access or refresh token]` without the brackets `[ ]`.


## Result

This endpoint access does not require authentication. The token in this request is marked as expired.
