</table>You can use several different methods to authenticate users. User credentials are matched to different saved credentials for each method.

**Note:**

-   The Okta SSO plugin is deprecated.
-   To learn more about the security properties that affect authorization processing, see [Access control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-access-control.md) in Instance Security Hardening Settings.
-   You can use SAML and Digest Authentication through the Multiple Provider SSO application.
