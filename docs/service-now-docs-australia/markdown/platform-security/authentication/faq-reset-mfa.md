# MFA reset

FAQ related to MFA reset and why it’s important.

1.  Lost the authenticator app setup. How can I reset?

    It’s better if the users enroll in multiple factors so that they aren’t locked out due to MFA. For example, you can have the TOTP authenticator app, passkey, and email OTP-based MFA.

        -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-factor Authentication** &gt; **User Multi-factor Setup**.
        -   Search for the user in the table.
        -   Delete the record associated with the user
    2.  Clearing the FIDO2 authenticators and passkeys:
        -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-factor Authentication** &gt; **Web Authentication** &gt; **User Public Credentials**.
