# Post-authentication context

The Post Authentication policy context defines how and when a policy is enforced during the login process. The policy used in this context executes after your users see a login screen.

## Post-authentication context record

Policies in the post-authorization context execute after your users enter their credentials or SSO response. Your instance allows or denies access based on your selected policy. Because your users have identified themselves via their login credentials, the policy can use user information such as role or group to determine whether to grant access.

Use the fields in the Post-authentication policy context record to define how your instance uses your policy.

</table>## Policy inputs and conditions

The **Policy Input** and **Policy Conditions** tabs display the inputs and conditions of the policy selected in the **Allow Policy** or **Deny Policy** field. These tabs serve as a reference, but cannot be used to change the policy inputs or conditions. To modify your policy settings, navigate to the policy using the reference icon \(\[Omitted image "reference-icon.png"\] Alt text: Reference icon\) next to the **Allow Policy** or **Deny Policy** field.

This example shows a post-authentication policy context record configured to deny access by default. The context uses a policy called **Deny access policy**. That policy has a set of inputs and conditions that are displayed in the **Policy Input** and **Policy Condition** tabs.
