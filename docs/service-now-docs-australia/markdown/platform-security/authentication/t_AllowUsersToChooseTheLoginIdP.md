# Enable users to choose the identity provider for login

SSO federation support enables users to choose which IdP to log in to.

## Before you begin

Role required: sso\_config\_admin, business\_rule\_admin, script\_include\_admin

## About this task

SSO federations aggregate metadata from multiple IdPs and service providers, including your instance. Federations then publish the metadata as an XML file, which includes information like IdP names and IdP certificates. Administrators can then instruct the instance to read the XML file and automatically populate the SSO Properties table with all the necessary IdP information.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-Provider SSO** &gt; **Federation**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields, as appropriate \(see table\).

4.  Click **Submit**.

5.  After you configure a federation, enable the Refresh SSO Metadata scheduled job, and then [configure the users who you want to access the federation IdPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/idpauthflow.md). Use the sys\_ID of the federation record you just created.

    Use the sys\_ID of the federation record that you just created.

    The instance populates the SSO properties table with the IdP information. When users who are configured to use the federation log in, they are redirected to the discovery service URL you configured. Then they select the IdP and provide the necessary credentials. Alternatively, you can send users a URL with the IdP in the parameter.
