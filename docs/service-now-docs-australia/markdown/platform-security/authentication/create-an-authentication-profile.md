# Create an authentication profile

Create an authentication profile and add one or more authentication policies to the profile. You can also configure the **ID Token** and **OAuth Token** authentication profiles that are available by default.

## Before you begin

Role required: api\_service\_admin, adaptive\_auth\_policy\_admin

**Note:** You can apply authentication policies, IP range, role-based, user-based, and so on with mutual authentication and customized authentication.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **API Access Policies** &gt; **Inbound Authentication Profiles**.

2.  Select **New**.

    The system displays the message. `What kind of authentication profile?`

3.  Choose **What Kind of authentication profiles?**.

    -   **Create standard http authentication profiles**
    -   **Create WSSE authentication profiles**
    \[Omitted image "auth-profile.png"\] Alt text: Authentication profile

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name to identify the authentication policy.|
    |Description|Description of the authentication policy.|
    |Active|Option to make the authentication policy active.|
    |Application|Scope of the authentication policy.|
    |Type|Type of the authentication available. You can select **Basic Auth**, **ID Token**, **Certificate based Auth**, **OAuth**, or **WSSE** \(In case of WSSE Authentication profile\).|
    |OAuth Entity|OAuth Entity profile. This field appears only when **ID Token** or **OAuth** is selected from **Type**.|

5.  Double-click **Insert a new row**.

6.  Select an authentication policy from the list and select the save icon \[Omitted image "green-checkmark.png"\] Alt text: save icon.

    **Note:** Don’t select **Allow Access Policy** or **Deny Access Policy**. These policies are meant only for user logins.

    You can add one or more authentication policies for an authentication profile.

    When there’s a change in the authentication profile, the Authorization header returns a value specific to the changes made at that time. To have the ability to get all the authentication schemes returned in the \`WWW-Authenticate\` header, you must activate `glide.security.response.authenticate.header.auth_profile.first_scheme_only` to **false**. The response is returned with multiple headers. For example:

    ```
    < WWW-Authenticate: BEARER realm="Service-now"
    < WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="Service-now"
    ```
