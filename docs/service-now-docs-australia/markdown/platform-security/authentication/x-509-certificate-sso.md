# X.509 certificates for SAML

Store and activate the necessary IdP certificates for your SAML configuration.

The X.509 certificates are the IdP certificates that a SAML configuration uses. After you install a certificate, you can add as many certificates as necessary. When there are multiple certificates, the system uses the first active certificate that is found. If you set the URL for the **Metadata URL from which IDP properties are imported field**, the system automatically polls the IdP for a current, valid certificate when your certificate is no longer valid. It appends this certificate to your instance, and uses it for your active SAML configuration.

**Note:** Polling occurs if the IdP is accessible outside of your network.
