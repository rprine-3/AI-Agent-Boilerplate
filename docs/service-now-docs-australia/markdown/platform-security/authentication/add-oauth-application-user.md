# Add the OAuth Application User

Add the OAuth Application User field on the OAuth Entity form to use the Client Credentials grant type for OAuth inbound integrations.

## Before you begin

Role required: oauth\_admin

Plugin required: OAuth 2.0.

You must create an OAuth client. For more information, see [Create an endpoint for clients to access the instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open the OAuth client record that was created.

2.  Select more options icon on the page header.

3.  Select **Configure** &gt; **Form Design**.

4.  On the Form Design page, add **OAuth Application User** from the list of fields.

5.  Save or Update the form.

6.  Select the user for the **OAuth Application User**.

    For example, System Administrator.\[Omitted image "add-oauth-application-user.png"\] Alt text: OAuth Application User

    **Note:** You must use the REST API Auth Scope with client credentials grant type to control the access provided to the 3rd party client.

7.  Save or Update the form.

    Any authorization request with the **Grant Type** as **Client Credentials**, **Client ID**, and **Secret** is passed for the associated OAuth Application User in ServiceNow®.

    **Note:** If the OAuth Application User isn’t selected on the OAuth client record or the Client Credentials property is set to `false`, then the authorization request isn’t passed.
