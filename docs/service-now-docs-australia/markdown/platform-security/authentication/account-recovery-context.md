# Account recovery context

The account recovery context uses a policy to define how and when the account recovery can be established.

Administrators can view and modify this context and its associated policy by navigating to **Multi-Provider SSO** &gt; **Account Recovery** &gt; **Account Recovery Context**.

**Note:** By default the policy is **Allow Policy**. The Login for users are restricted by default and the login is allowed only if the conditions defined in **Allow Policy** evaluates to true.

Use the fields in the account recovery context record to define how your instance uses the policy.

</table>## Policy inputs and conditions

The **Policy Input** and **Policy Conditions** tabs display the inputs and conditions of the policy selected in the **Allow Policy** or **Deny Policy** field. These tabs serve as a reference, but cannot be used to change the policy inputs or conditions. To modify your policy settings, navigate to the policy using the information icon next to the **Allow Policy** or **Deny Policy** field.

**Note:** Policy conditions can be created from here, but as a good practice it is recommended to add new policy conditions from policy page.
