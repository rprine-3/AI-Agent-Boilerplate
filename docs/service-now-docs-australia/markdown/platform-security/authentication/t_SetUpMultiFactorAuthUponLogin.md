# Set up Multi-factor authentication for the first time

If your administrator enabled MFA on your profile but you have not yet set up the application, you can set it up upon login.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your instance using your user name and password.

    The multi-factor authentication set up screen intercepts your login.

    **Note:** If you want to skip the authentication set up now, click **Bypass Setup**. You can bypass multi-factor authentication for a limited number of times that your administrator allows. Eventually, you must configure multi-factor authentication.

2.  Select one of the following methods to complete the mfa setup.

    1.  **Setup authenticator app**

        Follow the instructions on the screen to pair device and login.

    3.  **Get a verification code sent to your email**

        Enter the verification code that is sent to your email.

    After the successful completion of the either of the setup, you are logged in to the instance.
