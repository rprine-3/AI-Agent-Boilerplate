# Email as an MFA factor

Multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) with Email as a factor for your authentication.

Admin can configure ServiceNow instance to require users who attempt to login to the instance using Email based OTP.

**Note:** MFA with Email is activated with the Integration - Multifactor Authentication \(`com.snc.integration.multifactor.authentication`\) plugin by default. You need to configure the policy inputs and conditions.

When users attempt to login to ServiceNow, Email OTP is sent to the Email address associated. User's can enter the six-digit verification code that it sent to the email address and verify their identity.
