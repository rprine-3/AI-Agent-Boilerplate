# Identity Provider attributes for OpenID Connect

Use the Identity Provider attributes that are received from the OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) from the Identity Provider \(IdP\) as a filter criteria for authentication.

You can manually create the IdP attributes based on the claims received as part of the ID token.

**Note:**

-   Identity Provider filter is available with Zero Trust Access feature. For more information, see [Zero Trust Access \(ZTA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/session-access.md).
-   IdP attribute filter criteria can be used in [Post-authentication context](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/post-auth-context.md), [Zero Trust Access \(ZTA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/session-access.md) session relegation, and [Multi-factor Authentication context](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/mfa-auth-context.md).

Start the configuration by adding the IdP attributes by selecting **New** from the Identity Provider Attributes section and use those attributes for Adaptive Authentication by setting it to `true`.

The **RiskFactor** defined in the OIDC configuration in the Identity Provider Attributes is from the ID token claims. This value can be an existing claim or custom claim as configured in the IdP side. Use this claim in various authentication context to customize and control the log in behavior of the user.

The **Identity Provider Attributes** are displayed with the following details:

<table id="table_tz3_bww_vnb"><thead><tr><th>

</th><th>

</table>**Note:** Attributes that are populated from Azure IdP have name and display name limited to characters, due to the name length of the attribute.

You can also add new attributes by selecting **New** in the **Identity Providers Attributes** section.

If the Use in Adaptive Authentication is set to true, then the selected attribute is added as filter criteria in the Generic Filter Criteria. For example, **risk\_score** set to `true`. The Generic Filter Criteria page has a new filter created.
