# Log in with Multi-factor Authentication

Login with MFA when it is enabled by your administrator on your instance.

## Before you begin

You must have MFA enabled for your profile. You can enable it yourself on your user profile or your administrator can enable it for you.

Role required: none

**Note:** The last used MFA verification factor is automatically shown for the users in the subsequent log in.

## Procedure

1.  Go to the URL of your instance to open the login screen.

2.  Enter your user name and password.

3.  Click **Log in**.

    The multi-factor authentication screen appears.

4.  Select one of the methods to complete the MFA setup.

    For more information about each setup, see [Set up Multi-factor authentication for the first time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/t_SetUpMultiFactorAuthUponLogin.md).

    If you wish to postpone the setup, select **Postpone setup**. The maximum number of time you can postpone the setup is displayed on the screen and this value is configured by your administrator.


## Result

If you have already setup MFA, the recently used factor is displayed when you login your instance after entering your username and password.

## Recently used MFA factor

If the recent used factor was Biometric login, then upon login using your username and password, you're directly displayed with the Biometric MFA setup screen.
