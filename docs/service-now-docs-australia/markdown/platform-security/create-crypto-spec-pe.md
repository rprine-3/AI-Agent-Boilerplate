# Create a cryptographic specification for Field Encryption

After you create a cryptographic module, access the corresponding cryptographic specification to define the algorithm.

## Before you begin

Role required: security\_admin  and sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager  or sn\_kmf.admin

## About this task

This procedure describes options that are available with Field Encryption with the base system and additional configuration options that become available with Field Encryption Enterprise functionality. Field Encryption Enterprise functionality is available with a paid subscription. Refer to [Encryption and Key Management subscription bundle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/encryption-sku.md) for supported features and options available with each offering. See [Activate Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/activate-platform-encryption.md) for more information on obtaining Field Encryption Enterprise.

A cryptographic specification will be created by the system when you create a cryptographic module for Field Encryption Enterprise.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Security** &gt; **Field Encryption** &gt; **Field Encryption Experience**.

2.  Select **View module details** from the **Field Encryption overview** to open the module record you want to configure.

    **Note:** The names displayed in the list are appended with the scope, for example, `global.[your Field Encryption Module name ]`.

3.  Select **Manage Specifications Settings** from the **Cryptographic Specification**.

    For Field Encryption Enterprise see [Configure advanced algorithms for Field Encryption Enterprise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/adv-algorithm-cleent.md).


## What to do next

Perform one of the following operations:

-   Select an entry in the Key Lifecycle table to define key lifecycle behavior. See [Configure key lifecycle states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/configure-key-lifecycle-states.md) for details to complete the lifecycle definition for the key.
-   Click **Next** to create a cryptographic key. For details on this process, see [Generate a ServiceNow cryptographic key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/generate_sn_key.md).
