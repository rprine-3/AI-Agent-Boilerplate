# Log history

The system uses table rotation and table extension to archive older logs.

By default, the system uses the following schedule to archive common logs:

|Table|Archive schedule|Rotations|Type|
|-----|----------------|---------|----|
|Event \[ecc\_event\]|Every day|7|Rotation|
|Queue \[ecc\_queue\]|Every day|7|Rotation|
|Event \[sysevent\]|Every day|7|Rotation|
|Log \[syslog\]|Every week|8|Rotation|
|Transaction Log \[syslog\_transaction\]|Every week|8|Rotation|

**Note:** The Email \[sys\_email\] table is not managed using table rotation or extension. Instead, use the [Email retention](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/email-retention.md) plugin to archive and destroy email records. By default, email records are archived after one year and destroyed after an additional year in the archive.
