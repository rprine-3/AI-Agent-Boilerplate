# Analyzing data classifications using the Overview dashboard

The Overview dashboard reports the current state of data classifications within your instance and how your users are distributed by location.

If you have a data classification administrator or auditor role, you can visualize the current sensitivity of instance data, which helps increase security and compliance with privacy laws. By using the Location field in user records, administrators map users across different regions that have differing privacy regulations.
