# Configure properties for customer-supplied key

Review the system properties for the ephemeral public wrapping key that your instance uses to unwrap customer-supplied keys.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_kmf.admin or sn\_kmf.cryptographic manager

## About this task

You must wrap your symmetric data encryption key with a ServiceNow ephemeral public wrapping key before you can upload it to your instance.

When your key is uploaded to your instance, the instance unwraps it using the private side of the public key.

You can use system properties on your instance to define key padding, ephemeral key pair size, and a key validity period for this ephemeral public key.
