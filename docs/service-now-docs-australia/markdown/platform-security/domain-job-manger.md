# Domain Job Management

Queue multiple Domain Separation updates sequentially into a single background job using the Domain Job Manager.

When a Domain record is modified such as reparenting or a change in hierarchy, by default, a job executes to fix all the records in domain separated tables. You can control when this behavior occurs with the **Domain Job Manager** and monitor ongoing job progress with the **View Job Progress** button.

Use the **Domain Job Manager** to pause domain jobs, queue multiple domain table changes and trigger the queued job when ready with all the changes.

|Label|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Job Type|The current job type|
|Status|The status of the job, see **Job state** in the job manager for more information.|
|Progress|Ongoing job progress|
