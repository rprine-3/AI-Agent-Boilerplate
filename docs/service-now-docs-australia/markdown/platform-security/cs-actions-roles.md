# Code Signing actions and required roles

Reference table of Code Signing actions, their descriptions, and the roles required to perform them.

## Role-based access control

Code Signing uses role-based access control so that only authorized users can perform specific actions. The following table maps all Code Signing actions to their required roles.

Unless otherwise noted, all listed roles are required to perform the action.

## Role hierarchy

Code Signing includes three primary roles with different levels of access:

-   **codesigning\_admin**

    Highest level access. Can assign codesigning\_manager and codesigning\_auditor roles to other users and access all configuration features.

-   **codesigning\_manager**

    Operational access. Can create and update signature configurations and create and run Code Signing jobs.

-   **codesigning\_auditor**

    Read-only access. Can view signature configurations and signing jobs but can't create or modify them.


Many Code Signing actions also require the security\_admin role, which is an elevated role. Users must manually elevate to security\_admin by selecting the profile icon and selecting **Elevate Roles**.
