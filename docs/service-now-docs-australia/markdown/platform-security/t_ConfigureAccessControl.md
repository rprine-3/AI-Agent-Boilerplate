# Configure ServiceNow access control

Configure an access control record to specify one or more Customer Service and Support employees who have permission to log in your instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** The SNC Access Control \(com.snc.snc\_access\_control\) plugin prevents Customer Service and Support personnel from accessing the instances without your express permission. However, other authorized ServiceNow Operations personnel, in their capacity to support and manage the product, are required to perform administrative actions on the underlying infrastructure. This infrastructure includes servers and databases, among other infrastructure components that make up the SaaS solution. This access method is fully auditable and tracked.

This plugin enables you to restrict access to your instance without your express permission, so it may affect support service levels and the Availability SLA. Availability SLA is then measured from the time that Support staff personnel are granted access to your instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **SNC Access Control**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Fill in the form fields \(see table\).

4.  Click **Submit**.

-   To enable all Customer Service and Support employees login rights to access the instance, enter an asterisk \(**\***\) in place of the name.
