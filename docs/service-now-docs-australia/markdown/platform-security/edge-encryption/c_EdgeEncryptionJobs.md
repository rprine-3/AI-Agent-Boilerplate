# Repair or recover order-preserving encrypted data

If you have the security-admin role, you can schedule jobs performed by the Edge Encryption proxy to repair or recover fields that use order preserving encryption.

Schedule jobs to:

-   Repair order tokens.
-   Recreate the proxy database.

Running these jobs can be a time-consuming operation that might impact the performance of the Edge Encryption proxy. Schedule these jobs at a time when no users or a minimum set of users are using the system, such as midnight on the weekend.
