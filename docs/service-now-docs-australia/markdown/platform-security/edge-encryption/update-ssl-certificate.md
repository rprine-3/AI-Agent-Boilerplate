# Update SSL certificate

When updating an SSL certificate on an Edge proxy server, you must delete the old one.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When updating the SSL certificate on the Edge proxy server, you must also delete the old certificate. If you don't, the old certificate \(in the form of an alias in the KeyStore file\) continues to be used even though the Edge proxy server is configured to use the new certificate.

## Procedure

1.  On the Edge proxy server, list the entries in the Java KeyStore:

    ```
    keytool -list -keystore keystore.jceks -storetype jceks -storepass MY_SUPER_PASSWORD
    ```

2.  Remove the old SSL certificate:

    ```
    keytool -delete -alias MY_OLD_ALIAS -keystore keystore.jceks -storetype jceks -storepass MY_SUPER_PASSWORD
    ```

3.  Add the new SSL certificate into the Java KeyStore.
