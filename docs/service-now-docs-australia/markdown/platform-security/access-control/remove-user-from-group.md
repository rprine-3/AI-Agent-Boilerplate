# Removing users from Groups

Use the **Simulate Remove from Group** for simulating the user's access changes for a resource \(table\).

## Before you begin

Role required: access\_analyzer\_admin

Enable Take actions. For more information, see [Configuring the Access Simulator \(Take actions\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control/configure-access-simulator.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Access Analyzer** &gt; **Access Simulator**.

2.  Select **Simulate** from the **Remove the user from a Group** section.

3.  In the **Simulation criteria** view, configure the following fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Select user \*|Specify a user name and select from the list. In this example, **ITIL User**.|
    |Select group \*|Specify a group and select from the list. In this example, **Incident Management**.|
    |Rule type \*|Rule type is auto-populated and can’t be changed.|
    |Select table \*|Specify a table name and select from the list. In this example, **Incident**.|
    |Select record|Specify a record name and select from the list.|

    **Note:**

    -   To know more about an ACL \(operation\) in the **Simulated results** view, click its operation link.
    -   To start the simulation again for a different role, click **Start over**.
    -   To exit the simulation, click **Exit**.
8.  Click **Next**.

9.  To apply the simulated changes, on the **Take action** view, click **Remove and complete**.

    **Note:**

    -   If Access Simulator isn’t enabled, you can't complete the simulation. To enable it, select **Enable actions** and accept the legal information.
    -   To hide the simulation, select **Hide actions**. To unhide and enable actions, go to **Settings**. For more information, see [Configuring the Access Simulator \(Take actions\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control/configure-access-simulator.md).
    -   To exit the simulation without applying the simulated changes, select **Skip and Exit**.
    If you clicked **Remove and complete**, the simulated group is successfully removed from the user. You can verify the access again by using the Access Analyzer. For more information about how to verify access of a user, see [Access Analyzer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control/access-analyzer.md).
