# Security jump-start - ACL rules plugin

The Security jump-start access control level \(ACL Rules\) plugin is installed automatically on all new instances. Use this plugin to quickly secure multiple system tables and expedite the production launch process for your organization.

This plugin isn’t intended for existing instances, as it may alter security access to tables already in use in a production environment. If an admin strongly desires to install this plugin on an existing instance, you should test it thoroughly in a test instance first. Doing so helps to verify compatibility with the organization's current implementation.

If an admin is interested in the new ACL rules provided by this plugin, they can manually create one or more in an existing instance, using the list of ACLs as a guideline.

The following ACLs are included in this plugin. Select the icon in a header row to sort that column in ascending or descending order. The Operation key is as follows:

-   R=read
-   W=write
-   D=delete
-   C=create
