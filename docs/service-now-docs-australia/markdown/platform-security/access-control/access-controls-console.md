# Explore Access management console

Use the Access Management Console within Security Center to review and remediate access issues and misconfigurations. The Access Management Console provides enhanced visibility and control of your Access Analyzer findings, and streamlines remediation efforts. Within the console you can track, prioritize, and resolve access issues by assigning tasks.

Access the console by navigating to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Security Center** &gt; **Access management console**.

The access management console is divided into 3 tabs:

-   Overview
-   Access findings
-   Access analyzer

## Overview tab

Use the Overview tab to get an overview of access issues and misconfiguration on your instance. From the overview panel you can see your findings and evaluate permissions for users, roles, and groups. You can also review additional resources to learn about user administration on ServiceNow instances.

<table id="table_vv1_ks5_bhc"><tbody><tr><td>

-   **Findings**

Review the findings section, which displays a chart showing access issues and potential misconfiguration detected on your instance. These findings are categorized by severity, with a total count displayed in the center of the chart.

Select the chart, or section of the chart to open the **Access findings** tab, and view a list of access findings.

**Note:** If you had muted a finding, make sure you unmute the finding first to mark the finding as resolved.
