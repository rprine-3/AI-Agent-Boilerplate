# Use Scripting Governance Tool

Use the Scripting Governance Tool to provide a single, centralised control for managing scripting access across your ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Before you begin

Role required: security\_admin

**Important:** You must have elevate your role `security_admin`. See [Elevate to a privileged role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_ElevateToAPrivilegedRole.md).

The Scripting Governance Tool helps you review user scripting governance your ServiceNow AI Platform. The **Conditional Script Writer** group grants scripting permissions to its members via the `snc_required_script_writer_permission` role. Users are added to the group by either an automated assignment or manual configuration. You can manage both of these settings from the Scripting Governance Tool.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Scripting Governance Tool**.

2.  Use the following features to learn more:

Scan for users who have scripted \(Recommended\)

</td><td>

Scans for users in the ServiceNow AI Platform who have modified records containing script fields such as business rules, script includes, or client scripts. When running the scan, you can define a time period for which the scan checks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Manual Configuration

</td><td>

You can manually select users that stay in the **Conditional Script Writer** group. Select the **Manage scripting access** button and enter the users into the text field for manually managing the user removal process from the **Conditional Script Writer** group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Groups containing a scripting role

</td><td>
