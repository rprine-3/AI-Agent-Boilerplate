# Using Access Insights

Use Access Insights to understand users' peer-level access to a selected resource.

## Before you begin

Role required: access\_analyzer\_admin

**Note:** To view the details of though Access Insights feature, you must use the [Compare user access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control/comparing-access-controls.md) feature.

The following procedure describes the steps for viewing the peer level role or group assignment statistics within the Access Insights feature.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Access Analyzer** &gt; **Analyze Permissions**.

2.  On the Analyze access and permissions home page, select the **Compare user access** tab.

3.  Fill in the following fields:

<table id="table_urw_xh5_szb"><thead><tr><th>

    The **Compare user access** results show the access evaluation status for the operation per user. For example, **Charlier Fuhri** and **Charlie Knower**.

5.  Click an operation.

    For example, click the **read** operation.

6.  Select an **Access Control** to learn more about access.

7.  Select **Show role Hierarchy** to view a peer-level access comparison.

    **Access Insights** show:

    -   **Peer Insights**: Displays how many users have the same role assigned within their peers \(the same manager or department\).
    -   **Org Insights**: Displays how many users have the same role assigned within the organization.
