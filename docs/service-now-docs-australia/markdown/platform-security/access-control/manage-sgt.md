# Manage Scripting Governance Tool

Enable or disable the Scripting Governance Tool on your instance by running the appropriate script. Only users with the `security_admin` role can run these scripts and modify the associated properties.

## Scripting Governance Tool states

Scripting Governance Tool operates in one of two states. The active state determines whether scripting governance policies are enforced and whether users are provisioned to the Conditional Script Writer group.

**Note:**

-   Scripting Governance Tool is enabled by default. You can choose to disable.
-   You must elevate your role to `security_admin` to enable or disable Scripting Governance Tool.
