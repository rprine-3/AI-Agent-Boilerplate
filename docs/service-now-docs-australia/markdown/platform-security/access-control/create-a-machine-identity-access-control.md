# Create a machine identity access control

Enable administrators to define and enforce granular control for integration users by introducing User Access Profiles. This feature provides an additional layer of security and control, allowing admins to specify the exact resources \(REST APIs and SOAP APIs\) that an integration user can access, ensuring tighter governance and minimizing security risks.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Machine Identity Access Controls**.

2.  Select the **New** button.

3.  Fill in the fields of the form.

<table id="table_mmy_wnz_zfc"><thead><tr><th>

</table>4.  Select the `Insert a row below` prompt and add users to apply the control to.

    You can add multiple users to the access control.

    **Note:** You can only select users with Web Service Access.

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The following is an example of a machine identity access control form that has been filled out:

\[Omitted image "machine-acl-example.png"\] Alt text: An example of a machine identity access control form filled out.

A user with an machine identity access control cannot access any other APIs \(REST or SOAP\) and will only be able to access the resources explicitly stated in the access control, even if they have the required roles.
