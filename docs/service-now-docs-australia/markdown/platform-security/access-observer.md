# Access observer

Use Access Observer to understand people and processes access data on your instance.

With Access Observer security administrators can:

-   Understand which entities like users, roles, scoped apps, and scripts that access your data.
-   Use this foreknowledge to know how best to apply security to limit unnecessary access to your data, while confirming those requiring access and still operate normally.
-   Avoid broken automation by seeing a clear view of how your data is accessed before making security changes.
-   Address the need to provide information regarding how encryption is applied on your instance.

Configure Access Observer by creating Access Observer configuration records. Within these records, you define a specific table and column to be observed and the time in which the column is observed.

Find the results of your observations on the Access Observer log record table. On this table you can see a record detailing each time the specified column is accessed.
