## Attributes

-   Dedicated instances require that you have separate administration and dedicated teams. You need multiple licenses for the administrators and developers who log in to multiple instances.
-   Each instance has a finite number of requesters and fulfillers. When you get a new customer, you must procure an instance that is based on the size and scale of your customer's company.
