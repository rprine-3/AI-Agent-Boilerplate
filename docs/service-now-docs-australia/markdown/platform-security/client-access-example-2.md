# Add your certificate to the ServiceNow Trusted Key Store

Upload your key and certificate to the ServiceNow Trusted Key Store.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

The public certificate that you created in this example is considered a “self-signed” certificate \(meaning it didn't come from a trusted root authority\). You must add the certificate to the ServiceNow Trusted Key Store for it to be used. When using a certificate that came from a Certificate Authority, you don't need to complete this step.

## Procedure

1.  In your local environment, open Terminal \(on Mac or Linux\), or Command Line \(in Windows\).

2.  Using the terminal, use `cd` to move into the folder where you have created your encryption keys.

3.  In the terminal, enter the following command:

    ```
    cat sm_public_cert.pem
    ```

    You must view the contents of your public certificate to copy it into the trusted key store. This `cat` command displays the certificate.

4.  Copy the certificate information to your clipboard.

    Start with and include the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` line and end with and include the `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` line.

5.  On your ServiceNow instance, navigate to the **X.509 certificate** list by entering `sys_certificate.LIST` in the navigation filter.
