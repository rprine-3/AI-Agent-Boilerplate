# Log Export Service actions and required roles

Log Export Service uses role-based access control to restrict actions to authorized users.

## Role-based access control

Log Export Service uses role-based access control so that only authorized users can perform specific actions. The following table maps Log Export Service actions to the roles required to perform them.

Unless otherwise noted, any one of the listed roles is sufficient to perform the action.

## Log Export Service roles

Log Export Service includes the following three primary roles:

-   **sn\_logstoanalytics.admin**

    Application administrator role. Installed with the LES application and allows a non-admin user to configure and use LES.

-   **admin**

    System administrator role. Required to install the LES store application and to perform platform-level setup tasks.

-   **hermes\_admin**

    Required to generate the certificates that secure the connection between LES and the Hermes Messaging Service.
