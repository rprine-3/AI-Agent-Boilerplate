# Cloud credentials

Cloud credential types manage access to cloud-based applications, including Amazon Web Services and the Microsoft Azure cloud.

## AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) roles

If you have a MID Server installed on Amazon EC2 in an AWS cloud, and if that MID Server is configured to discover resources within the cloud, you can use security credentials provided by AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) roles rather than credentials managed on your instance. These AWS credentials grant permissions in the cloud through an instance profile, based on roles. These credentials are temporary and rotate automatically on a configurable interval. When an IAM role is defined on the MID server. For details, see [Configure the MID Server for AWS IAM roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/config-mid-iam-roles.md).

Discovery ignores any credentials stored on the instance in favor of the credentials granted by the role in the instance profile. For more information on AWS instance profiles, see [IAM Roles for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html).

Enable or disable these credentials for use.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Specify **AWS**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

User name

</td><td>

Enter the CIM user name to create in the Credentials table. Avoid leading or trailing spaces in user names. A warning appears if the platform detects leading or trailing spaces in the user name.

</td></tr><tr><td>

External credential store

</td><td>

Select this check box to use an external credential storage system. When you select this option the **User name** and **Password** fields are replaced with the **Credential ID** field. Currently, the only supported external storage system is CyberArk.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Applies to

</td><td>

Select whether to apply these credentials to **All MID servers** in your network, or to one or more **Specific MID servers**. Specify the MID Servers that should use these credentials in the **MID servers** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Classification

</td><td>

Enter the Application Classification for CI discovery.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order \(sequence\) in which Discovery tries this credential as it attempts to log on to devices. The smaller the number, the higher in the list this credential appears. Establish credential order when using large numbers of credentials or when security locks out users after three failed login attempts. If all the credentials have the same order number \(or none\), the instance tries the credentials in a random order.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Cloud Management \(CMP\) node credentials

Cloud Management \(CMP\) node credentials associate credentials for a virtual server that Cloud Management provisions. The Cloud Management application automatically creates these credentials.

**Note:** You might need to deactivate these credentials if you no longer want them used, change the order precedence, or select a MID Server that is allowed to access them. Otherwise, you do not need to manually create or modify this type of credential.

</table>## Cloud Management \(CMP\) SSH key pair credentials

Cloud Management \(CMP\) SSH key pairs store the keys that the Cloud Management application automatically generates when users provision stack resources.
