# Check IP service affinity for Discovery and Orchestration

You can check the IP Services table for a list of IP addresses that are associated with a protocol.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The IP Services table maps a port to a protocol. Several mappings are provided by default for commonly used port-protocol combinations, such as port 80 for HTTP, port 22 for SSH, and port 161 for SNMP.

A system property called **glide.discovery.ip\_service\_affinity** allows Discovery to remember the last port of the IP address that was discovered.

**Important:** You should not modify IP services unless your organization uses custom ports.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **IP Services**.

2.  Filter the list to find the appropriate IP service.

3.  Select the name of the service to go to that IP service page.

4.  Select the **IP Service Affinities** tab for the list of IP addresses associated with that service.
