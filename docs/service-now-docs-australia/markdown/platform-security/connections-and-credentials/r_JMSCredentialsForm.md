</td></tr><tr><td>

Credential alias

</td><td>

Allow workflow creators to assign individual credentials to any activity in an Orchestration workflow or assign different credentials to each occurrence of the same activity type in an Orchestration workflow.To discover CIs not belonging to this CI type using Service Mapping and Discovery patterns, enter the table name for the CI type to which the CI belongs. For example, enter `cmdb_ci_apache_web_server`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

External credential store

</td><td>

Select this check box to use an external credential storage system. When you select this option the **User name** and **Password** fields are replaced with the **Credential ID** field. [External credential storage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/c_ExternalCredentialStorage.md) is only available when the External Credential Storage plugin in activated. **Note:** Currently, the only supported external storage system is [CyberArk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/c_CyberArkCredStorageIntegrate.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select whether to apply these credentials to **All MID servers** in your network, or to one or more **Specific MID servers**. Specify the MID Servers that should use these credentials in the **MID servers** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID servers

</td><td>

Select one or more MID Servers from the list of available MID Servers. The credentials configured in this record are available to the MID Servers in this list. This field is available only when you select **Specific MID servers** from the **Applies to** field.**Note:** Selecting Specific **Specific MID servers** doesn’t affect mid server selection. It’s used only to decide which mid servers should have visibility to the credential. **Specific MID servers** isn’t supported in Orchestration activities.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order \(sequence\) in which Discovery tries this credential as it attempts to log on to devices. The smaller the number, the higher in the list this credential appears. Establish credential order when using large numbers of credentials or when security locks out users after three failed login attempts. If all the credentials have the same order number \(or none\), the instance tries the credentials in a random order.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Windows MID Server Service Account

</td><td>

When active, the defined credential represents the MID Server service account.
