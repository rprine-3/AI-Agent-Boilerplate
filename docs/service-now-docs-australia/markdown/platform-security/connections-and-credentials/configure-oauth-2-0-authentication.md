# Configure a connection to send OAuth request via the MID Server using external vault

Configure a connection to send requests for OAuth 2.0 tokens to a third-party auth server via the MID Server. The MID Server adds OAuth 2.0 credentials \(Client ID and Client Secret\) from the CyberArk external vault, OAuth scope, and token URL from the instance to the request and sends them to the third-party auth server.

## Before you begin

Verify the following items.

-   Confirm that you have subscribed to the ServiceNow IntegrationHub Standard Pack Installer. For more information, see [https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).
-   You have created a JAR file that enables the MID Server to resolve credentials with the CyberArk external vault. See [Create a JAR file to resolve credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/external_cred_storage_configuration.md).
-   You have imported the JAR file to the MID Server.
-   The MID Server is set up for CyberArk. See [Configure the MID Server for CyberArk AIM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/t_ConfigureTheMIDServerForCyberArk.md).
-   OAuth 2.0 are configured on the CyberArk external storage. See [Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials on CyberArk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/configure-oauth-2-0-credentials-on-cyberark.md).

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the connection and credential with a configuration template or manually. A configuration template defines the connection record form components and is reusable for other connection records. Manually, you can configure the connection for this purpose only. The topic shows both approaches.

## Procedure

1.  Configure the connection with a configuration template.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **IntegrationHub** &gt; **Configuration Templates**.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  Select **HTTP Connection with OAuth Client Credentials grant type \(External Storage\)**.

    4.  Update the form, as required.

        For example, you can provide the scope in the `oauth_entity_profile_scope` and `oauth_entity_scope` fields in the Default Data Template section. To learn to create a configuration template, see [Create a configuration template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/create-template.md).

    5.  Select **Submit**.

        You have created the configuration template.

    6.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **IntegrationHub** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

    7.  Update the form.

<table id="table_oqy_4fl_ccc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the alias. An alias can only contain alpha, number, and underscore characters. During an upgrade, the tag in the credential record migrates to a Connection &amp; Credential Alias. If the credential tag contains special characters other than alphabets, numbers, and underscores, it preserves the tag name after the upgrade. You can still use this migrated alias, but you cannot update the alias until you change the name to meet the naming restrictions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Unique identifier for the Connections &amp; Credentials alias, based on the format `scope_name.alias_name`. -   If the scope is Global, the ID is the alias name. For example, if you create a Workday alias in the global scope, it sets the ID to `workday`.
-   If you create a workday alias in the HR app scope, it sets the ID to `x_hr_app.workday`.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent Alias

</td><td>

Option to select the alias under which you're creating this connection and credential alias. The connection and credential alias that you're creating is a child alias. A child alias is listed under the **Child Aliases** tab on the parent connection and credential alias page.\[Omitted image "child-alias-location.png"\] Alt text: Child alias under the Child Aliases tab.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Option to indicate the type of alias you're creating. Choose from the following options.-   Credential: Alias that contains a credential record.
-   Connection and Credential: Alias that contains both connection and credential record. This option is selected by default.
Confirm that Connection and Credential is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Support Multiple Active Connections

</td><td>

Designator that indicates whether the alias supports multiple active connections. Add connections using the Connections table and associated them to the alias using the Connections related list.
