# Set up OAuth integration via MID Server

Create a connection record that enables the sending of an OAuth token request to a third-party server via a MID Server.

## Before you begin

Confirm that you have subscribed to the ServiceNow IntegrationHub Standard Pack Installer. For more information, see [https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

Role required: Admin

## Procedure

1.  Configure the connection with a configuration template.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **IntegrationHub** &gt; **Configuration Templates**.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  Select **HTTP Connection with OAuth Client Credentials grant type**.

    4.  Update the form, as required.

        For example, you can provide the scope in the `oauth_entity_profile_scope` and `oauth_entity_scope` fields in the Default Data Template section. To learn to create a configuration template, see [Create a configuration template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/create-template.md).

    5.  Select **Submit**.

        You have created the configuration template.

    6.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **IntegrationHub** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

    7.  Update the form.

Name

</td><td>

Name of the alias. An alias can only contain alpha, number, and underscore characters. During an upgrade, the tag in the credential record migrates to a Connection &amp; Credential Alias. If the credential tag contains special characters other than alphabets, numbers, and underscores, it preserves the tag name after the upgrade. You can still use this migrated alias, but you cannot update the alias until you change the name to meet the naming restrictions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Unique identifier for the Connections &amp; Credentials alias, based on the format `scope_name.alias_name`. -   If the scope is Global, the ID is the alias name. For example, if you create a Workday alias in the global scope, it sets the ID to `workday`.
-   If you create a workday alias in the HR app scope, it sets the ID to `x_hr_app.workday`.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent Alias

</td><td>

Option to select the alias under which you're creating this connection and credential alias. The connection and credential alias that you're creating is a child alias.
