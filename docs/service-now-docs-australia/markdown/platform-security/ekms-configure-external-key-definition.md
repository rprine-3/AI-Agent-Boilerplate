# Configure an external key definition

Configure your external encryption key to use in External Key Management Service \(EKMS\).

## Before you begin

Roles required: admin, security\_admin, and sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager

**Note:** To configure EKMS, verify that you have an enabled key with your external key management provider, and the configured user has the necessary permissions to use the key.

The user must have permissions to run the following AWS KMS API operations:

-   kms:DescribeKey
-   kms:Encrypt
-   kms:Decrypt

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Field Encryption** &gt; **EKMS Configurations** &gt; **New**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Application|Automatically populated with **Global**.|
    |Cloud KMS Provider|Automatically populated with **AWS**.|
    |EKMS Integration Name|Choose a name for the key definition. This name is referenced when running scripts.|
    |Key Region|Enter the key region associated with your external key. Example: ex. us-east-2.|
    |External Key Identifier|Enter the Amazon Resource Name \(AWS ARN\) for your external key.|
    |Primary Region URL|Enter the unique Primary Regional URL that begins with KMS. Example: https://kms.\[key region\]\_amazonaws.com.|
    |KMS Credentials Access Key|Enter the key management service \(KMS\) for your credentialed AWS user.|
    |KMS Credentials Secret Key|Enter the secret key for your credentialed AWS user.|

3.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The external key definition is configured. Verify that the key status displays as Active for the new configuration. To confirm if the key is usable, select **Test EKMS Config**. Wait for the key status to change to Active before using it.\[Omitted image "ekms-active-key-definition.png"\] Alt text: External Key Management Service key definition with an active status
