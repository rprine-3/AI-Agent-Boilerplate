# Exploring Column Level Encryption

Learn more about Field Encryption.

## Column Level Encryption overview

Column Level Encryption is a base system feature that permits encryption of data stored within an instance using AES128, or AES256.

Column Level Encryption enables you to encrypt selected database fields and stored files through the use of encryption contexts. In these contexts you define what is encrypted, choose which algorithm to use, and supply the encryption key, which is stored within your instance.

After the context is created, you can associate it to a user role. Users assigned to this role, either directly of through a group, are able to access the encrypted data.

Because Column Level Encryption bases access to data on role assignment, it’s important to be familiar with administering roles on your instance. For more information, see [Managing roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ua-creating-roles.md).

Choose between standard and equality preserving encryption. When enabled, equality preserving encryption ensures that the encrypted value of a field is the same when the field value remains the same. This type of encryption enables equality comparisons and group by operations on a field.**Note:** Non-deterministic encryption isn’t supported.

</table>## Cloning considerations

When you clone an instance that uses Column Level Encryption, the encrypted field data and encryption modules are copied to the target instance. Because encryption keys are re-encrypted with a secondary key that is unique to the source instance, the target instance can't decrypt the field data after cloning.

Until a key exchange is performed, encrypted fields on the cloned instance appear empty or unreadable. This is expected behavior and does not indicate data corruption or loss.

To restore access to encrypted fields on the target instance, complete a key exchange from the source instance. See [Configure Key Exchange](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/configure-key-exchange.md).

The tour gives a brief overview of the Column Level Encryption setup needed to encrypt table fields or attachments.​ Steps for the creation of Field Encryption Modules, Module Access Policies, and Encrypted Field Configurations are also covered. The tour includes links to detailed documentation and the ServiceNow University Column Level Encryption Overview course.​
-   **[Column Level Encryption Enterprise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/now-platform-encryption-2.md)**  
Column Level Encryption Enterprise uses the Key Management Framework \(KMF\) to enable you to customize and manage how fields and attachments are encrypted and decrypted on your instance. A subscription is required to use Column Level Encryption Enterprise.
