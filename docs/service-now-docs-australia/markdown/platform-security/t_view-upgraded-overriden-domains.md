# View upgraded processes or records in the global domain

You can track and review base system records or processes in the global domain that were overridden across one or multiple domains prior to an upgrade and were subsequently updated during a platform or app upgrade.

## Before you begin

Role required: domain\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **ALL &gt; Domain Admin &gt; Upgraded Overridden Processes**.

2.  Review the information in the dashboard's **Summary** tab.

    **Note:** You can sort the dashboard by either admin reviewed or non-reviewed records with the **Reviewed** drop-down menu.

    |Overridden Records by Table Name|A graphical list of all overridden records, sorted by table name.|
    |Overridden Record Count|The total number of overridden records.|
    |Overridden Records List|Shows information for all overridden records.|

3.  Select the **Upgraded Overridden Domain Records** tab to view the Summary information in more detail:

    **Note:** The information for this dashboard view is compiled from the **Overridden Record Count** \(`upgraded_overridden_process`\) table. In addition, the columns you select for view in this table will be the columns that display in this dashboard. You can view this table by selecting the number displayed in the **Overridden Record Count** metric display on the Summary view of the dashboard.

    |Change Type|Whether the record was changed or updated.|
    |Reviewed|Whether the override record has been reviewed by an admin.|
    |Release Version|Indicates the version or release name where the record was updated.|

    |Updated By|The account that last updated the record.|
