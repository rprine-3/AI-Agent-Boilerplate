# Uploading a certificate to an instance

Add a certificate to the instance from the Certificates module.

## Upload a certificate to an instance

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When a certificate is updated on the ADFS server, you must also upload an updated certificate to the instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Certificates**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Name**|Specify a unique name for the certificate.|
    |**Expiration notification**|\[Optional\] Select whether you want to send a notification when the certificate is about to expire.|
    |**Active**|Select whether the instance should use this certificate for secure communications and signing requests.|
    |**Short Description**|\[Optional\] Enter a text description of the certificate such as the requester or server name.|
    |**Format**|Select the certificate format. The instance supports the PEM and DER formats.|
    |**Type**|Select the certificate container. The instance recognizes certificates from trust stores, Java keystore, and PKCS\#12 keystores.|
    |**PEM Certificate**|Enter the base-64 encoded PEM-formatted text containing the DER certificate. The instance decodes the certificate to populate the **Valid from**, **Expires**, **Expires in days**, **Issuer**, and **Subject** fields.|

4.  Select **Submit**.

    During the upload, the module extracts and displays the certificate's read-only properties in these fields:

    -   Valid from date
    -   Expiration date
    -   Issuer
    -   Subject of the certificate
5.  Select **Validate Stores/Certificates** to check if the certificate is correct.

    If the instance encounters any errors with the certificate or keystore, it displays an error message.

By uploading the service provider's trusted server certificate, the instance ensures it is connecting to a valid and secure service.
