# Field Encryption Enterprise examples

These examples walk you through the encryption of fields and attachments using customer-supplied keys.

**Parent Topic:**[Using Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/using-column-level-encryption.md)

## Field Encryption Enterprise walkthrough

This walkthrough shows you how to encrypt a field in your instance using Field Encryption Enterprise with the Key Management Framework \(KMF\). It also shows you how to use your own key.

### Before you begin

**Note:** This procedure only applies to Field Encryption Enterprise functionality. See [Activate Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/activate-platform-encryption.md) for more information on obtaining Field Encryption Enterprise.

Role required: security\_admin  and sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager  or sn\_kmf.admin

**Note:** security\_admin is a privileged role, for details on using privileged roles, see [Elevate to a privileged role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_ElevateToAPrivilegedRole.md)

### About this task

This walkthrough starts with an instance where you have already created and uploaded your personal cryptographic key. You could use the ServiceNow key, but this example uses a customer-supplied key.

After the key has been stored in a cryptographic module, you can start configuring fields in your instance. For example, configure salary or social security number fields that have limited access from certain users. In the Encrypted Field Configuration, specify which authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

This task demonstrates two scenarios. One example encrypts the **Short Description** field in an incident for users who aren't authorized to view the sensitive data.

The following field types can be encrypted with Field Encryption Enterprise:

-   Date
-   Date/Time
-   Email
-   HTML
-   Journal
-   Journal Input
-   Phone Number \(E164\)
-   String
-   String \(Full UTF-8\)
-   Translated
-   Translated Field
-   Translated HTML
-   Translated Text
-   URL

**Note:** Attachments aren't considered a field type but can be encrypted separately and are only visible to users who are granted access, or is visible to all users that aren't restricted from viewing the data. See [Attachment encryption walkthrough](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/attachment-encryption-walkthrough.md) for more information.

The following walkthrough demonstrates the **Short Description** field as an example. For more information about supported field types, see [Field Encryption Enterprise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/now-platform-encryption.md).

### Procedure

1.  Create a cryptographic module for column\_level\_encryption.

    See [Create cryptographic module for Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-PE-cryptographic-module.md) [Create a cryptographic module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/create-cryptographic-module.md) for more information.

2.  Select **View module details** for the module you created.

3.  Select **Encrypted Fields** to set up the Encrypted Field Configurations \(EFC\).

4.  Select **Configure**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Table|Table that stores the sensitive information. For this example, select **Incident \[incident\]**.|
    |Type|**Column** is required to use your personal key.|
    |Column|Column, or specific information, that represents the sensitive date to be encrypted. For this example, select **short\_description**.|
    |Active|Option to mark **Active** to use the field configuration.|
    |Encrypt by default|Enabled by default when creating an EFC from the Modules page. This encrypts records without matching row conditions using the selected Field Encryption Module. To create a configuration without this option, use the Configurations page.|
    |Algorithm Equality Preserving|The option is automatically selected.|
    |Method|The **Single Module** option is used to apply the policies for one module. **Multiple Modules** is used to apply the policies across multiple modules.|

    \[Omitted image "fee-efc.png"\] Alt text: Shows a completed Encrypted Field Configuration.

6.  Select **Save**.

    Establish a Module Access Policy \(MAP\) to assign access to the cryptographic module. See [Create a module access policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/create-module-access-policy.md) for additional information.

7.  Select **Access Policies** to set up the MAP.

8.  Select **Configure**.

9.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Policy name|Name for the policy, such, as `short description`.|
    |Type|Type of access designation for the crypto policy. Use **Role** to grant access to the encrypted field to only those users that have the assigned role.|
    |Target Role|The role that has access to the encrypted field. For this example, select **Admin**.|
    |Active|Option to activate the Module Access Policy.|
    |Result|The **Track**option enables the access to the field for the selected role. \(To restrict access to that field for the selected role, select **Reject** or**Strict Reject**.\)|
    |Impersonation|Option to enable module access via impersonation.|

    \[Omitted image "fe-map.png"\] Alt text: Shows the completed module access policy form.

10. Select **Save**.

11. As a user with the sn\_kmf.admin role, navigate to **All** &gt; **Incidents** &gt; **Create New**.

    \[Omitted image "seeshortdescriptionasadmin.png"\] Alt text: Shows the visible Short description data.

    You can now view the Short description field based on the module access policy configuration.

    **Note:** The sn\_kmf.admin role was granted access to the encrypted Short description field by setting the module access policy to **Track**. Notice the lock icon \(\[Omitted image "lock-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lock icon.\) under the field name indicating that the field is an encrypted field.

    You can now access the **Incidents** module as an end user to test the encrypted field configuration.

12. Log in as a user who has access to the table but doesn't have access to the configured encryption module.

    When you access the incident number, the data in the Short description will not be visible.


### Result

You have successfully used your symmetric key to control access to a specific field using Field Encryption Enterprise.

## Attachment encryption walkthrough

This walkthrough shows you how to encrypt an attachment in your instance using Field Encryption Enterprise with the Key Management Framework \(KMF\). It also shows you how to use your own key.

### Before you begin

**Note:** This procedure only applies to Field Encryption Enterprise functionality. See [Activate Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/activate-platform-encryption.md) for more information on obtaining Field Encryption Enterprise.

Role required: sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager

### About this task

This walkthrough starts with an instance where you have already created and uploaded your customer-supplied cryptographic key. You could use the key, but this example uses a customer-supplied key.

Upload confidential attachments in your instance and limit access from certain users. Use Encrypted Field Configuration to specify which authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

We show you how to encrypt attachments to only be visible to users who are granted access, or be visible to all users that are not restricted from viewing the data. In this example, we restrict a certain role from being able to access an attachment in the **Incidents** module.

**Note:** Although you can use multiple modules with Field Encryption Enterprise, attachment encryption must use single modules.

### Procedure

1.  Make sure that Field Encryption Enterprise is enabled.

2.  Create a cryptographic module.

    See [Create cryptographic module for Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-PE-cryptographic-module.md) for more information.

3.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Field Encryption** &gt; **Field Encryption Experience**.
