# Activate parallel jobs for Data Discovery

Use parallel jobs to reduce your Data Discovery job execution time.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  By default Data Discovery runs jobs using a single thread. Multiple threads may be activated for Data Discovery full scans.
2.  In the navigation filter enter `sys_properties.list`.

3.  Create the property `com.glide.data_discovery.max_concurrent_item_workers`

4.  Verify the **Type** is `integer`.

5.  **Important:** It is recommended to start with a small number of workers per node\(2 or 3\).

    Enter the number of parallel job workers in the **Value** field up to 5.
