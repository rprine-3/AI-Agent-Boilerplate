# Installed with domain separation

Several platform components are added or modified with domain separation.

## Roles

|domain\_admin|Can create, edit, and delete domains.|

## Additions to \[sys\_domain\] fields

The sys\_domain field is added to the following tables:

|Tables|
|------|
|sys\_attachment|
|sys\_user\_has\_role|
|sys\_group\_has\_role|
|sys\_email|
|sys\_user\_group|
|core\_company|
|cmn\_location|
|cmn\_department|
|sys\_gauge|
|sys\_report|
|kb\_feedback|
|sysapproval\_approver|
|sys\_user\_grmember|

## Field for the Task Table

MSP Extensions add a task\_for field to the Task table. This reference field refers to the User table.

## Options for the Group Type

MSP Extensions add several new default options to the type field of the Group table. Add to or update these types as needed to support your domains.

|Tables|
