# Attribute Mapping references

The attribute mappings enables you to use the attributes as a single source of resource to the ServiceNow table fields.

## Attribute

The attribute for which mapping needs to be defined. For example, **userName**.

\[Omitted image "attribute-username.png"\] Alt text: Attribute - userName

## Sub-Attribute

Select the sub-attribute, if any, for which a mapping needs to be defined.

For example, if there is a complex type attribute like **name.familyName**, then the attribute is **name** and the sub-attribute is **familyName**.

For simple attributes like user name, the **Sub-Attribute** value would be **None**.

\[Omitted image "attribute-name.png"\] Alt text: Attribute Name and Sub-Attribute Family Name

## Filter Condition

A multi-valued attribute can have additional information that can be specified by using a Filter Condition. The choices for the filter condition are populated using the schemas defined by the SCIM Provider.

For example, the **phoneNumbers** attribute has multiple types like work, mobile, home, and so on.

You can specify a Filter Condition from a set of possible values. For example, the **phoneNumber** attribute can have the Filter Condition as **type eq "mobile"**.

\[Omitted image "attribute-phonenumber-mobile.png"\] Alt text: Attribute Phone Number with Filter Condition Mobile

The **phoneNumber** attribute can instead have a Filter Condition as **type eq "work"**.

\[Omitted image "attribute-phonenumber-work.png"\] Alt text: Attribute Phone Number with Filter Condition Work

## Database Field Name

If the direct attribute mapping option is chosen, then this attribute needs to be defined. The **Database Field Name** field represents the ServiceNow field name that is mapped with the SCIM Attribute.

For example, the **username** SCIM Attribute can be mapped to a user as the **Database Table Name** field, and to the user ID field as the **Database Field Name** field.

\[Omitted image "attribute-databasename.png"\] Alt text: Database Field Name

You can also dot-walk using the **Database Field Name**. For example, the **department** SCIM Attribute can be mapped to the **Department Name** field.

\[Omitted image "attribute-dot-mapping.png"\] Alt text: Attribute - Dot walk

Here the Database Table is **User** and the Database field Name is **Department Name**.

\[Omitted image "attribute-departmentname.png"\] Alt text: Attribute - Department Name

## Default Value

The default value is passed to the SCIM Provider if direct attribute mapping of that field returns null. The default value can also be used to return a hard-coded value.

In the case of a hard-coded value, the database table name and field name should be **None**.

For example, the primary sub-attribute value of work email can be hard coded as **true**.

\[Omitted image "attribute-default-value.png"\] Alt text: Attribute Default Value

## Script

The script is used to fetch the attribute value. The return type of the script should be always a string, or a JSON converted as a string. The output of the script should be in the proper format as expected by the provider for that attribute.

The following is a sample script for a multi-valued attribute.

\[Omitted image "attribute-script.png"\] Alt text: Attribute Script

The output of the script should have a stringified JSON Array.

The following is a sample Script of a simple-valued Attribute.

\[Omitted image "attribute-employeenumberscript.png"\] Alt text: Attribute Employee Number - Run script

The output of the script should be a string.
