# Provisioning user using Basic Authentication

Configuring SCIM automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to ServiceNow by using the providers' provisioning service with Basic Authentication.

## Before you begin

Role required: scim\_admin

**Warning:** Grant this role carefully. The scim\_admin role is equivalent to giving the user the admin role, where the scmin\_admin can add or update Personally Identifiable Information \(PII\).

You must activate the SCIM plugin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **REST API Access Policies** to check the details on the REST API Access Policies.

2.  In the API Access Policy page, click the **SCIM API Policy** record.

3.  Verify the **SCIM API Basic Auth** record is available in the Authentication Profiles sections.

4.  Select **Basic Auth** as the Type.

5.  Create the required configurations at the provider's end.

6.  Test the connection to ensure that the provider can connect to ServiceNow.

    **Note:** If the connection fails, ensure that your ServiceNow account has admin permissions and try again.
