</table>The SCIM protocol is an application-level HTTP-based protocol based on the HTTP \([RFC7230](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230)\) standard. Use this API for provisioning and managing identity data, such as users and groups. Use the API on the web and in cross-domain environments, such as enterprise-to-cloud service providers or inter-cloud scenarios.

To access this API, you must activate the SCIM v2 - ServiceNow® Cross-domain Identity Management \(com.snc.integration.scim2\) plugin. To know more about the SCIM API, see [System for Cross-domain Identity Management \(SCIM\) API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scim-api.md).
