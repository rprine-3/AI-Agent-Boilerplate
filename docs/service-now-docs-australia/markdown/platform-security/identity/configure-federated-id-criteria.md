2.  The **Federated ID Criteria** page displays the record with the following details:

    -   Type Name: **User**
    -   Table Name: **User \[sys\_user\]**
    -   ID Fields: **user\_name \(User ID\), email** \(default\). Any fields listed below **Selected** are fields used for Federated ID generation.
    -   Status: **Completed** \(Federated ID generation status\). Available Status: **Ready**, **Running**, **Completed**, **Error**.
    **Note:**

    -   User ID is required for generating Federated IDs.
