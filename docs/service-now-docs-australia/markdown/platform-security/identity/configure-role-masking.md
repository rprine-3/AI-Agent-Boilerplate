# Configure role masking for an AI agent

Restrict the roles that an AI agent uses at runtime by creating an Agent Access Role Configuration record that limits the agent to a defined set of roles.

## Before you begin

Role required: `sn_aia.admin`

Before you configure role masking for an AI agent, verify the AI agent you want to restrict already exists.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **sys\_agent\_access\_configuration\_list.do** table.

    The Agent Access Role Configurations page opens.

2.  Select **New**.

    The **Agent Access Role Configuration - New Record** form opens.

3.  On the form, fill the fields:

<table id="table_xxz_1jl_pjc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Specify a name that for the configuration. Example: `Action Designer role mask`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Scope of the application.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Specify a description for the configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Agent Table

</td><td>

Select the table that holds the agent record you want to restrict.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Action

</td><td>

Select **Limit To Roles**. This action restricts the AI agent to the roles you add to the configuration. The agent can't use roles outside the selected roles.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Agent

</td><td>

Look up and select the specific AI agent the configuration applies to.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Role List

</td><td>

Add the roles to limit using the **Agent access roles** list. Each role added through this lookup is stored as an individual record in the Configuration table.**Note:**

-   Previously you could use role list to add the roles. Now, you have to use the Agent access role table to add roles.
-   Existing records with the `role_list` column continues to operate as expected. All new role configurations is implement through the `sys_agent_access_role_mapping` table.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Agent access role

</td><td>

Select the role using the **Insert a new row..**. Each row you add creates one record in the Agent access roles table, linking the AI agent to that role.

</td></tr></tbody>

4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The platform saves the each role masking entry in the Agent Access Role Configurations page. The next time the AI agent runs, it uses the roles that are mapped to an agent.
