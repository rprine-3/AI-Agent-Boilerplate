</table>## Supported schemas

SCIM customization adds the following supported schemas.

|Schemas|Description|Prefix|Example|
|-------|-----------|------|-------|
|**urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User**|Includes core attributes for the resources.|none|name.middleName|
|**urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:servicenow:2.0:User**|Includes attributes that are related to ServiceNow.|servicenow|servicenow.manager.value|
|**urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:servicenow:custom:2.0:User**|Includes custom attributes that are not mapped as part of the core extension or  the ServiceNow extension schema.|custom|custom.socialId|

## Unsupported schema

**urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User**: Includes attributes commonly used in representing users that belong to or act on behalf of a business or an enterprise.

**Note:** Enterprise schema is a valid schema but its attributes are mapped to any table. Because database persistence is not supported, there will be no error displayed if an enterprise schema is included in the request body.
