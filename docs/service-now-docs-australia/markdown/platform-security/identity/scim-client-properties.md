## Tables

The SCIM Client adds the following tables.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|SCIM Provider \(sys\_scim\_provider\)|Stores data for each SCIM provider, such as the name, REST message resource definitions, and so on.|
|SCIM Provider Resource Mapping \(sys\_scim\_provider\_resource\_mapping\)|Stores the primary table information for each provider and resource name.|
|SCIM Attribute Mapping \(sys\_scim\_attribute\_mapping\)|Stores the source details where each SCIM attribute value should come from, such as the table field, script, and so on.|
|SCIM Client Log \(sys\_scim\_client\_logs\)|Stores the statuses of each call triggered to SCIM Provider.|

## Scriptable API

The SCIM2Client API calls the System for Cross-domain Identity Management \(SCIM\) Provider \(server role\) to create, update, or delete data in a service provider \(SP\). The scriptable API of the SCIM Client should be used in the scripts that are running in the system context or by a system admin user.

For example, you can use the script while running the integration hub workflow as a system user, while running the scheduled jobs, and so on.

The following are some of the use cases for using the scriptable APIs:

-   As an admin, provision identity information from background scripts, business rules, script include calls, workflows, and so on.
-   As an admin, run a scheduled job or an on-demand job for identity provisioning.
-   Run a workflow or sub-workflow with the Script step using the provision scriptable API call.
-   Add the provision script directly in a business rule or script include. The script can be triggered by non-admin users. This use-case works in the following situations:
    -   The user has access to the token, meaning that the user has the role to generate the token from the REST template.
    -   The user has access to retrieve the SCIM attribute values from the mapped tables.

To know more about the scriptable API, see [SCIM2Client API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/SCIM2ClientAPI.md).

## SCIM Client Logs

The SCIM Client Logs display the provisioning status about the SCIM APIs. To view the provisioning status, navigate to **All** &gt; **SCIM** &gt; **SCIM Client Logs**.
