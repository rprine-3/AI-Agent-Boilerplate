# Configure advanced algorithms for Field Encryption Enterprise

Create a cryptographic specification to define the algorithm for a cryptographic module. Customize the encryption specifications with advanced options that are available for Field Encryption Enterprise.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Field Encryption** &gt; **Field Encryption Experience** tab, click **New**.

2.  Select **View module details** from the **Field Encryption overview** to open the module record you want to configure.

3.  Select **Manage Specification Settings** in the **Cryptographic Specification** section.\[Omitted image "fe-manage-spec-settings.png"\] Alt text: Manage Specification Settings button.

4.  Select **Back** to navigate to the **Algorithm Definition** tab.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields, selecting **Next** through each tab.

<table id="table_ff2_jwq_fqb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Crypto module

</td><td>

Name of the selected cryptographic module populates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Crypto purpose

</td><td>

The value is **Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption** for Field Encryption Enterprise.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Algorithm

</td><td>

The value is **AES** for Field Encryption Enterprise.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Operation mode

</td><td>

The value is **CBC** for Field Encryption Enterprise.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Size

</td><td>

Possible values are **256** and **128**.

**Note:** 256-bit size is most secure for encryption and is used for Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption for Field Encryption Enterprise.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Equality preserving

</td><td>

Option to enable deterministic encryption.

 **Note:** Selecting this option means that the encrypted value of a field should be the same when the field value remains the same.

 Option to enable **Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption** with **AES** in **Cipher Block Chaining \(CBC\)** mode.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Integrity

</td><td>

Option to provide Integrity in GCM operation and does not apply for Field Encryption Enterprise functionality.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Click **Submit**.

    The following example shows AES 256 CBC encryption. When Field Encryption Enterprise is active and the parent module is column\_level\_encryption, only Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption AES 256 CBC applies as the crypto purpose. See [Cryptographic specification overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/cryptographic-purpose.md) for details.

## What to do next

Perform one of the following operations:

-   Select an entry in the Key Lifecycle table to define key lifecycle behavior. See [Configure key lifecycle states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/configure-key-lifecycle-states.md) for details to complete the lifecycle definition for the key.
-   Select **Next** to create a cryptographic key. See one of the following tasks for key generation:
    -   [Generate a ServiceNow cryptographic key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/generate_sn_key.md).
    -   [Configure properties for customer-supplied keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/customer-supplied-keys.md).
    -   [Import the wrapping / unwrapping key pair](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platform-encryption/import-key-webservice-1.md).
