# Cryptographic specifications for Field Encryption

Use cryptographic specifications to define the purpose, algorithm, key length, mode, and origin of your encryption key.

## Before you begin

Role required: security\_admin and sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager or sn\_kmf.admin

## About this task

This procedure shows how to configure generated keys. A data encryption key \(known as a Module Key\) is automatically populated once you have configured the Crypto Specifications.

For customer-supplied key configuration, see [Configure Customer-supplied keys for Field Encryption Enterprise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/fe-config-customer-supplied-keys.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Field Encryption** &gt; **Field Encryption Experience**.

2.  Select **View module details** from the **Field Encryption modules** overview to open the module record you want to configure.

    **Note:** The names displayed in the list are appended with the scope, for example, `global.[your Field Encryption Module name]`.

3.  In the **Cryptographic Specifications** section, select **Manage Specification Settings**.

    \[Omitted image "crypto-specs-tab.png"\] Alt text: Displays the Key alias section of the Crypto Specifications tab.

4.  In the Crypto Specifications form, fill out the fields as needed.

    **Note:** The fields are divided into sections. Select the **Next** or **Back** buttons to navigate between sections.

Algorithm Definition

</td><td>

Crypto module

</td><td>

Displays the name of the selected cryptographic module.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Crypto purpose

</td><td>

The purpose of the selected algorithm, key, length, and mode. For Field Encryption, this field is read only and has a value of **Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Algorithm

</td><td>

Select a type of algorithm used to accomplish the cryptographic purpose. The options available are filtered to align to the selected cryptographic purpose.

Order

</td><td>

Order in which to process the key lifecycle state for the crypto specification. Lower values execute before higher values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Relative duration

</td><td>

Number of years, months, or days the key is valid.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Relative duration type

</td><td>

Duration type of the lifecycle. Select from **Years**, **Months**, or **Days**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Relative operation

</td><td>

Choose **Before** or **After**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Relative to

</td><td>

Select a field that the duration is relative to.-   Activation date
-   Compromise date
-   Deactivation date
-   Destruction date
-   Expiration date
-   Generation date
-   Last renewal date
-   Last rotated date
-   Revocation date
**Note:** This field works together with the value selected in the **Relative operation** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Select if the value for the key lifecycle is relative or absolute.-   **Relative**

Enter a value that depends on other data entries in the system, such as key generation, activation, and deactivation.

-   **Absolute**

Enter an exact value, such as a date.

Key Origin

</td><td>

Crypto module

</td><td>

Displays the Name of the selected cryptographic module.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Origin

</td><td>

Whether the key originated from or is supplied by the customer.-   For starter, select **Servicenow**
-   For Enterprise, select **Servicenow** or **Customer Supplied**


</td></tr><tr><td>

Key alias

</td><td>

Name of the cryptographic module with the scope appended to the front of the name.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Crypto purpose

</td><td>

Displays the purpose of the selected algorithm, key, length, and mode. For Field Encryption, this field is read only and has a value of **Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Algorithm

Generate Key

</td><td>

Select this link to generate your data encryption key if you're using a generated key, and not a customer supplied key.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Auto generate key

</td><td>

If you don’t select the **Generate key** link, a data encryption key is automatically generated during the first time data must be encrypted using the cryptographic module.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Crypto purpose

</td><td>

Displays the purpose of the selected algorithm, key, length, and mode. For Field Encryption, this field is read only and has a value of **Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption**.

Displays the value that was selected during the **Key Origin** section.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Algorithm

</td><td>

Displays the algorithm used to accomplish the crypto purpose.

</table>5.  Select **Go To Crypto Module** to return to your Module record.

    In the Module record, there’s now an entry in the **Module Keys** related list. The **Key alias** field in the **Crypto Specifications** related list is now empty, since the key alias has moved to the new module key.
