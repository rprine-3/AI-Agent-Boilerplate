# Global queue v.2

The global queue concept provides a single virtual view of tasks that reside in multiple instances. The concept creates a custom application to provide a fulfiller view of work that resides in multiple instances without having to replicate tasks or data.

## Overview

\[Omitted image "global-queue.png"\] Alt text: Global queue

Service Providers with agents working on tasks from multiple systems tend to integrate the data back to a central instance, or a “swivel chair” between instances. While this method might be appropriate in some cases, it can be expensive and time-consuming to build and maintain. This method also opens the provider up to potential auditing and data requirement considerations such as General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) in all of the instances where the data now lives.

Global queue v.2 is an alternative: With this method, agents can see data assigned to them from a single instance without sovereign data persisting on the instance they are logged into. For example, in cases where clients have data residency requirements, but allow access by agents from other countries, the provider could use a “follow-the-sun” Help Desk using global queue v.2.
