# Create a basic secret group

Create a basic secret group to group any secrets, regardless of their criteria.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Basic secret groups can contain any secret you add to them, regardless of their table, scope, or application. After creating it, you manually add secrets to the group. To create a group specifically for all secrets that share a common attribute such as those, create a secret group with criteria using the instructions in [Create a secret group with criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/sm-create-criteria-group.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Secrets Management** &gt; **Secret Groups**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  For the **What type of Secret Group would you like to create?** option, select **Basic Secret Group**.

4.  In the **Secret Group** form, fill in the fields.
