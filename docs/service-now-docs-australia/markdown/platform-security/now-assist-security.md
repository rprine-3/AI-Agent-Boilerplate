# Agentic AI security and governance

Now Assist AI agents operate securely within the boundaries you define. Layered controls govern who can invoke each agent, what data it can access, how interactions are monitored, and how your organization retains oversight.

Deploying AI agents introduces security considerations that go beyond standard platform hardening. Agents act autonomously, invoke tools, access data, and make decisions on behalf of users. This requires controls at every layer: who can invoke an agent, what it can access once running, how its actions are logged, and what catches harmful or unintended behavior at runtime.

Now Assist is built on the ServiceNow AI Platform security model. AI agents are subject to the same ACL enforcement, role-based access controls, and domain separation that govern all platform activity. The controls in these sections extend that foundation with capabilities specific to agentic AI. These include identity classification for AI users, role masking to enforce least-privilege during tool execution, and runtime guardrails through AI Guardian. Readiness assessment tools help verify your instance is prepared before agents go to production.
