# Create anonymization job

Configure a data privacy job on your production instance to use anonymized data on your non-production instance for user and data class jobs.

## Before you begin

The data privacy job supports two de-identification use cases:

-   Sensitive data of specific sys\_users
-   Sensitive data of particular data class.

Role required: data\_privacy\_processor and admin

## Procedure

1.  Elevate to the **data\_privacy\_processor** role.

    For details on role elevation, see [Elevate to a privileged role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_ElevateToAPrivilegedRole.md).

2.  Navigate to **System Security** &gt; **Data Privacy** &gt; **Anonymization**.

3.  In an Anonymization policy, select **Schedule job** for the policy to be used in the job.

    A policy must be in a published state in order to schedule an anonymization job.

    **Warning:** Anonymization jobs are highly destructive and can only be reversed on rollback. Double check all information, such as records and table processed, before scheduling a job.

4.  In the form, fill in the fields.

</table>    **Important:** All tables must have a correct sys\_dictionary entry before scheduling and during its job.

5.  Add conditions to specify which data should be anonymized. This does not apply to cloning anonymization policies.

    **Note:** For recurring jobs, tables with defined conditions will run a full scan each time the job executes.

    Select the table fields you want to apply a condition to, a boolean operator for the field, and the condition value. You can add multiple conditions with the **Or** and **And** buttons, or delete the condition entirely by selecting the delete icon.

6.  Select **Schedule job** on the form to place the anonymization in the job queue.

    The job runs between the times selected in the **Start time** and **End time** fields. If the job has not completed during the start and end time window, the job will continue at the next time window start.

    A job can only be executed once, even if **Dry Run** is selected. To run a job again based on the same policy, select **Schedule job** and complete the form using the same field values.

    **Warning:** Anonymization jobs on encrypted columns will you to decrypt and re-encrypt any encrypted columns targeted by the job. To prevent this, select **No Action** as the policy technique.

    The job is listed in the **Jobs** pane.\[Omitted image "jobs-pane.png"\] Alt text: Shows the jobs listed on the Jobs pane.
