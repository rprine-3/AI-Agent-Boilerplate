# Roll back a data privacy job

Roll back a data privacy job on your non-production instance that uses anonymized data from your production instance to a state prior to de-identification of a data class or user job.

## Before you begin

Role required: data\_privacy\_admin or data\_privacy\_processor, and admin

## Procedure

1.  Elevate to the **data\_privacy\_processor** or **data\_privacy\_admin** role.

    For details on role elevation, see [Elevate to a privileged role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_ElevateToAPrivilegedRole.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Data Privacy** &gt; **Data Privacy Job**.

    **Note:** In advance, a data privacy policy configuration that supports rollback must be created. [Create a data privacy policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/data-privacy-classic/config-dp-policy.md).

3.  Create a data privacy job and select a Privacy Configuration that supports Rollback.

    See [Configure a data privacy job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/data-privacy-classic/config-data-privacy-job.md).

4.  Schedule the job for data anonymization.

    -   After the job has run, the data will be anonymized for the selected configuration.
    -   A message displays in the job informing of the expiration time. Within the expiry period you have the ability to roll back the job.\[Omitted image "dp-rollback-expiry-message.png"\] Alt text: Data privacy job rollback expiration time message.
