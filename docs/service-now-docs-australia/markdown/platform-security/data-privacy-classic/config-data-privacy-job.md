    After saving the record, the **Schedule Job** and **Delete Job** buttons appear.

    The job runs between the times selected in the **Time window start** and **Time window end** fields. If the job has not completed during the start and end time window, the job will continue at the next time window start.

    **Note:** A job can only be executed once, even if **Dry Run** is selected. To run the same job again, create a data privacy job using the same field values.

7.  Choose one of the following functions:

    -   **Cancel Job**: Cancels the data privacy job.
    -   **Pause**: Pauses job and rollback recording, if rollback has been selected. A warning message will display after a three-day expiry period for rollback contexts. See [Roll back a data privacy job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/data-privacy-classic/rollback-data-privacy-job.md) for details.
    -   **Resume**: Restarts a paused job. Rollback is not supported for resumed jobs if paused. Cancel the job and create a data privacy job. The recording uses an unexpired rollback context.
