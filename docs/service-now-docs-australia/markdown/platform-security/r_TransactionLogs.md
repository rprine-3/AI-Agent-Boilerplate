# Transaction logs

The transaction log records browser activity for an instance. To aid in debugging of system issues, you can filter transaction logs by application scope, limiting transactions that appear to only those transactions originating in specific scopes.

**Note:** Background and scheduler transactions are logged only when their execution time exceeds 1000ms. For a complete list of logged transactions, see [KB0778299](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0778299).

Access the transaction logs by navigating to **All** &gt; **System Logs** &gt; **Transactions**. The transaction log provides the following information for all activities.
