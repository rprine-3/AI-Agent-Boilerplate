# Disable outbound SSLv2/SSLv3 connections

Use the **glide.outbound.sslv3.disabled** property to force the MID Server to use TLS when making outbound connections, such as REST and SOAP requests. Normally, outbound connections from an instance are forced to use TLS instead of SSL.

The **glide.outbound.sslv3.disabled** system property controls the desired transport encryption protocol. If **glide.outbound.sslv3.disabled** is not set to the recommended value of **true**, then outbound MID server connections such as REST and SOAP requests will use SSL as the transport protocol. SSL was proven to be insecure in 2014.

Ensure that the **glide.outbound.sslv3.disabled** system property exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and is set to the value **true**. If the property does not appear in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, add a new record.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 6.5
-   CVSS rating: Medium
-   Security risk details: SSLv3 has been proven insecure since 2014 due to vulnerabilities like POODLE, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception. Allowing SSLv3 undermines transport encryption and exposes sensitive data in transit, violating modern security standards.
