# Block access for delegated developers

This configuration affects access for delegated developers that are updating user roles through script. When the configuration is compliant, the developer will not be able to update or insert records into the sys\_user\_has\_role table without also having the user\_admin role.

This property determines whether a delegated developer can give assign roles to users through scripts. If **com.glide.sys.security.delegateddev.block\_grant\_roles** is not set to the recommended value of **true**, then a delegated developer could assign roles to any user. This could lead to unapproved privilege escalation.

Ensure that the property **com.glide.sys.security.delegateddev.block\_grant\_roles** is set to **true**.

Functional impact

</td><td>

When a user with the delegated\_developer role is attempting to modify a record in the User Roles \[sys\_user\_has\_role\] table, this property enables additional security checks against the operation. The additional security checks validate that the user has been granted the user\_admin role if they're trying to create or update the User Roles \[sys\_user\_has\_role\] table. If they do not have the user\_admin role, the access will be denied. When the property is false, these additional checks are not validated.
