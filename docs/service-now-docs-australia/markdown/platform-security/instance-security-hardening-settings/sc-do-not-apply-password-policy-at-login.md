# Do not apply password policy at login \[Updated in Security Center 1.5 and removed in 2.0\]

Manage how password complexity is handled in your instance.

By setting the property **glide.apply.password\_policy.on\_login** to false there will be no password complexity enforcement at login time. Setting the property to true will enforce password complexity and lead to organization policy compliance issues.

As per ASVS 4.03 v2.1.9 recommendations:

"Verify that there are no password composition rules limiting the type of characters permitted. There should be no requirement for upper or lower case or numbers or special characters. \(C6\)"

Instead of password complexity enforcement, ASVS recommendations are to enforce a minimum length of 12 characters for password length.

Refer to [OWASP ASVS v4.0 Authentication](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x11-V2-Authentication.md).
