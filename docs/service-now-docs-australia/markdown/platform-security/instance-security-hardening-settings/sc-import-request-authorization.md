# Require authorization for import requests

Use the **glide.basicauth.required.importprocessor** property to designate if incoming import requests should require basic authentication.

The **glide.basicauth.required.importprocessor** system property performs this authentication while importing data sources into the instance tables/pages.

It restricts any guest users who are currently accessing this data. If **glide.basicauth.required.importprocessor** isn't set to the recommended value of **true**, then unauthenticated users could access import processor. Additional access controls, such as ACLs, are still enforced, but this value allows a guest user import request to be processed and not summarily denied.

Ensure that the property **glide.basicauth.required.importprocessor** exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and is set to **true**.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 5.3
-   CVSS rating: Medium
-   Security risk details: This property may allow unauthenticated users to initiate import requests via the import processor, potentially bypassing initial authentication checks and increasing the risk of unauthorized data manipulation despite enforced ACLs.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces a combination of authentication methods, in the form of basic authentication and system level access control.-   It performs this authentication while importing data sources into the instance tables/pages.
-   It restricts any guest users who are currently accessing this data. If applicable, you may need to create a new account for users who need access to this content, with necessary access control permissions.
