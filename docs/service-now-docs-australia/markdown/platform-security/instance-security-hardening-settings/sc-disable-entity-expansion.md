# Disable Entity Expansion within the XMLDocument2 Streaming Parser

If customizations do not require entity expansion, use the **glide.stax.allow\_entity\_resolution** property to completely disable external entity expansion. The XML completes parsing but doesn't include any internal or external entities.

If the **glide.stax.allow\_entity\_resolution** is not set to the recommended value of **false**, then this property allow XML entities to be expanded during parsing by the streaming parser \(XMLDocument2\).

Ensure that the property **glide.stax.allow\_entity\_resolution** exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and is set to **false**. If the property does not appear in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table the default value is **true**.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
