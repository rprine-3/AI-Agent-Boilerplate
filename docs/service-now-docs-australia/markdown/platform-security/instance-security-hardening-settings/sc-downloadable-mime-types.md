# Define restricted downloadable MIME types \[Updated in Security Center 1.3, 1.5, and 2.0\]

Use the **glide.ui.attachment.force\_download\_all\_mime\_types** property to download MIME types and not to render inline in the browser.

If **glide.ui.attachment.download\_mime\_types** does include dangerous MIME types such as text/html, image/svg ,image/svg+xml,application/xml, then dangerous files could be rendered inline in the browser, which could lead to Cross Site Scripting attacks \(XSS\). This property is the list of comma-separated attachment mime types, which won’t render inline in the browser. For example, including text/html forces HTML files to be downloaded to the client as attachments rather than viewed inline in the browser. Maintaining this list properly prevents cross-site scripting attacks.

If the **glide.ui.attachment.download\_mime\_types** system property doesn't include dangerous MIME types such as "text/html, image/svg,image/svg+xml,application/xml", then dangerous files could be rendered inline in the browser. This can lead to Cross Site Scripting \(XSS\) attacks. This check is only relevant when **glide.ui.attachment.force\_download\_all\_mime\_types** is set to **false**.

This property is a list of comma-separated attachment MIME types, which don’t render inline in the browser. For example, including `text/html` forces HTML files to be downloaded to the client as attachments rather than viewed inline in the browser.

If **glide.ui.attachment.force\_download\_all\_mime\_types** is set to **false**, verify that the **glide.ui.attachment.download\_mime\_types** system property includes the dangerous MIME types `text/html,image/svg,image/svg+xml,application/xml`.
