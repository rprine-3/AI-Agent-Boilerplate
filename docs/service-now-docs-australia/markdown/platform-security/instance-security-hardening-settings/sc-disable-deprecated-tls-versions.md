# Disable deprecated TLS versions

Avoid loss or leakage of sensitive data by disabling deprecated TLS versions.

Confirm that your instance only negotiates for communication via Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) versions 1.2 when communicating with other servers to help prevent data transfer over weaker TLS 1 and TLS 1.1 protocol versions.

Set the **com.glide.communications.disable.deprecated.tls** to **true** to use only TLS versions 1.2 and up.
