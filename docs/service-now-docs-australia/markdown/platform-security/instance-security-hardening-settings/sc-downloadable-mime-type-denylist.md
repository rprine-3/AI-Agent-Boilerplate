# Restrict downloadable MIME types

The **glide.ui.attachment.download\_mime\_types** property will force the specified list of dangerous file types to be downloaded to the client and not viewed inline in the browser.

If the **glide.ui.attachment.force\_download\_all\_mime\_types** system property is set to **true**, then the **glide.ui.attachment.download\_mime\_types** property is overridden so that all MIME types will be downloaded rather than rendered by the browser. For example, downloading text/html forces an HTML file to be downloaded to the client as a file rather than viewed inline in the browser, preventing a XSS attack.

Ensure that the property **glide.ui.attachment.force\_download\_all\_mime\_types** is set to **true**. If the property does not exist in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, the default value is **false**.

**Note:** The security\_admin role is required to edit the property.

Security risk

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces performance of validation checks before performing an action when you click an attachment in a application. There is no potential impact, but the user experience is altered.
