# Activate role-based multi-factor authentication \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.authenticate.multifactor** property to enforce role-based multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) for all users assigned to specific roles.

Enforce multi-factor authentication based on the roles assigned to the user. If a user has been assigned "admin", "security\_admin" or "user\_admin" roles in the multi-factor roles list, MFA will be enforced.

-   Set this property to **true** to enforce role-based multi-factor authentication for all users assigned to specific roles.
-   Set this property to **false** to disable role-based multi-factor authentication for all users assigned to specific roles.
