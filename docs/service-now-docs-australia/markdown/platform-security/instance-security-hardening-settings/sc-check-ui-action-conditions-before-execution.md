# Check UI action conditions before execution

Use the **glide.security.strict.actions** property to enable checking of UI actions conditions in forms and lists before they execute. When you set this property to true, it adds an extra layer of validation on the table UI actions before they are executed.

If the **glide.security.strict.actions** system property isn't set to the recommended value of **true**, then there is no validation on the table UI before execution. Setting this property to secure value adds an extra layer of security validation.

Ensure that the property **glide.security.strict.actions** is set to **true**.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 3.3
-   CVSS rating: Low
-   Security risk details: Users may perform operations they may not be authorized for, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation, privilege escalation, and bypassing of access controls designed to protect sensitive records.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation only adds an extra layer of validation to check for UI actions on the target table/page on the instance. As long as the access controls are set appropriately on the customer instance, there should not be an impact here.
