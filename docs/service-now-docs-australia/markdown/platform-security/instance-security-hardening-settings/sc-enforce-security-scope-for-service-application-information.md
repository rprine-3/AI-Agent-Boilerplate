# Enforce Security Scope for Service Application Information \[New in Security Center 2.0\]

Use the **glide.enforce\_security\_scope.sn\_svc\_appl** property to ensure that the data in master scope tables is secured.

When the **glide.enforce\_security\_scope.sn\_svc\_appl\_info** property is set to true, access to resources within the scope is determined solely by the access control lists \(ACLs\) from the Service Application Information plugin \(sn\_svc\_appl\_info\). This ensures the security of data in master scope tables by restricting access permissions to those defined within the sn\_svc\_appl\_info scope.

If set to the insecure value of false, ACLs from all scopes are considered when granting access to data in master scope tables such as sys\_attachment. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information by users who do not have permissions for the Service Application Information data.
