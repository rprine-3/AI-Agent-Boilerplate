# Enable relay state in SAML requests to prevent replay attacks

Reduce the risk of replay attacks by enabling relay state in SAML requests to help prevent replay attacks.

Protect against SAML replay attacks using the **glide.authenticate.sso.saml2.enable\_relay\_state\_with\_id** system property. When this property is set to **true**, the relay state parameter contains the sys\_id of a record in the MultiSSO Request Parameters \[multisso\_request\_parameter\] table, which the relay state URL redirects to.

Set the system property **glide.authenticate.sso.saml2.enable\_relay\_state\_with\_id** to **true**. This helps prevent attackers who have gained access to a SAML request from accessing your instance by resubmitting a valid request.
