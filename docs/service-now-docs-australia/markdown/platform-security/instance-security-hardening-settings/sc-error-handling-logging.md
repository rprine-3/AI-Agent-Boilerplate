# Error handling and logging

The error handling and logging category addresses the quality and verbosity of logged information exposed to stakeholders.

This includes ensuring logs and error messages do not collect sensitive information, correctly protect data according to classification and have an appropriate lifetime. Additionally, this category relates to appropriate error handling and not revealing sensitive errors to end users, such as verbose stack traces for unhandled exceptions with security implications.
