# Disable unauthenticated published reports

Deactivate this property to prevent the user from publishing or accessing reports. This property disables the published reports feature in reporting.

If the **glide.report.published\_reports.enabled** system property is not set to the recommended value of **false**, then reports stored on the instance can be made visible without authentication.

Ensure that the **glide.report.published\_reports.enabled** system property exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and is set to the value **false**. If the property does not appear in the sys\_properties table, add a new record.
