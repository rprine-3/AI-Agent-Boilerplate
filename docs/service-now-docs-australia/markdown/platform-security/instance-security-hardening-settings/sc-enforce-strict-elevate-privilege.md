# Enforce strict elevate privilege

Use the **glide.security.strict\_elevate\_privilege** property to control whether roles marked as privileged must be manually elevated for the user to be granted the role's capabilities.

When the **glide.security.strict\_elevate\_privilege** system property is set to **true**, roles marked as privileged must always be manually elevated by an admin user upon new session creation in order for the user to be granted the role's capabilities. When **false**, roles marked as privileged are automatically elevated upon an admin user new session, and do not need to be manually elevated \(with exception of security\_admin\). Setting this property to secure value adds an extra layer of security validation to role elevation by privileged user.

Ensure that **glide.security.strict\_elevate\_privilege** is set to **true** as it allows a user with admin to manually elevate to a role they want.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 6.7
-   CVSS score: Medium
-   Security risk details: This risks potential privilege misuse or accidental execution of high-impact actions. Requiring manual elevation adds a deliberate security checkpoint that helps prevent unauthorized or unintended access to sensitive capabilities.
