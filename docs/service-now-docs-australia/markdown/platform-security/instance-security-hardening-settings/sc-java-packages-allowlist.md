# Restrict allowed Java packages \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Configuring these properties protect from dangerous APIs being exposed to the scripting engine.

Configure the system tables and install the recommended plugin accordingly.

If the **sys\_whitelist\_member** and **sys\_whitelist\_package** table are not empty values, then dangerous APIs may be exposed to the scripting engine. Entries correspond to the Java namespace that have not been approved by ServiceNow security teams.

Install the Packages call removal tool. See [Packages call removal tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-packages-call-removal-tool.md) for details.

Contact Customer Service and Support to edit these tables.
