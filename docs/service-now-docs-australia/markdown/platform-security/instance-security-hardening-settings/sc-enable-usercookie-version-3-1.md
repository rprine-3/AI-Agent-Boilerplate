# Enable UserCookie version 3.1

Manage the version of UserCookie that is enabled on your instance to secure the storage of the secret key in the source code.

UserCookie v3 is generated only when property **glide.ui.secure.cookies.use\_kmf is disabled** is disabled. UserCookie v3 is not secure due to storing secret key for HMAC in source code and identical for all customers. By setting the property **glide.ui.secure.cookies.use\_kmf** to **true**, UserCookie v3.1 is used and secret key is stored in security storage such as KMF.
