# Disable AJAXEvaluate

Use the **glide.script.allow.ajaxevaluate** to protect the system API from vulnerabilities of Client script execution through AJAX calls.

The AjaxEvaluator processor executes these scripts in sandbox however there are several additional properties which can allow the scope of activities in the sandbox to expand or be turned off entirely. In a worst case scenario a user can easily execute scripts as an admin privilege.

Ensure that the **glide.script.allow.ajaxevaluate** system property is set to **false**.

Elevation to the security\_admin role is required to edit the property.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
