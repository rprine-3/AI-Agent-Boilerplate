# Enforce ACL on HR Core Data \[New in Security Center 2.0\]

Learn how to configure the **glide.enforce\_security\_scope.sn\_hr\_core** property so that the Human Resources Scoped App: Core \(com.sn\_hr\_core\) plugin does not expose sensitive data to access control lists \(ACLs\) from all other scopes.

The **glide.enforce\_security\_scope.sn\_hr\_core** property restricts the access control lists \(ACLs\) of several global data tables like sys\_attachment and sys\_email to only consider the sn\_hr\_core scope. If this property is not set to the recommended value of true, then data from the Human Resources Scoped App: Core plugin will be exposed to ACLs from all other scopes. For instance, this could result in the IT administrator gaining access to human resources data.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
