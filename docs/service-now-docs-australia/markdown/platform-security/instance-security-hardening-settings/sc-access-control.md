# Access control

The access control category audits the process of protecting resources from unauthorized access through granting and denying requests based on a permission model. This includes ensuring an entity accessing a resource holds valid credentials to do so, creating and protecting a well-defined set of roles or permissions and ensuring role or permission controls are protected from replay and tampering.

Access controls determine whether access to a particular resource should be granted or denied. It only allows access to resources to those users permitted to use them.
