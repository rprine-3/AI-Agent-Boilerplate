# Disable inbound emails for locked out users

Use the **glide.pop3.process\_locked\_out** property to control inbound email actions for locked out, active users.

The **glide.pop3.process\_locked\_out** system property controls inbound email actions for locked out users. If **glide.pop3.process\_locked\_out** is set to **true**, there may be an information disclosure as inbound emails would be received by users with locked accounts.

Ensure that the property **glide.pop3.process\_locked\_out** is set to **false**.

**Note:** Consider the security implications of allowing users from untrusted domains, and why they were locked out, before allowing emails from them to trigger inbound email actions.
