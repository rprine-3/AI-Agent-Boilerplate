# Disallow target cloning \[New in Security Center 1.3\]

Configure the **glide.db.clone.allow\_clone\_target** property to prevent your instance from being used as a clone target.

Protect your instance from being used as a clone target by setting the **glide.db.clone.allow\_clone\_target** system property to **false**. A system clone copies everything in a database from a source instance to the target instance. This is a security risk because the instance database on the target instance is overwritten in the cloning process, leading to data loss and lack of data integrity.

Set the **glide.db.clone.allow\_clone\_target** system property to **false** on production instances to disallow your instance from being selected as a clone target.
