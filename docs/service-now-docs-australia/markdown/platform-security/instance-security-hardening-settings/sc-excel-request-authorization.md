# Require authorization for excel requests

Use the **glide.basicauth.required.excel** property to designate if incoming Excel requests should require basic authentication.

If the **glide.basicauth.required.excel** system property is not set to the recommended value of **true**, then this will disable Basic Authentication for Excel format export processor. This also happens when combined with a wrong role within the guest\_user related property \(For example a high privileged user such as Admin\).

Ensure that the property **glide.basicauth.required.excel** exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and is set to **true**.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces a combination of authentication methods, in the form of basic authentication and system level access control. -   It performs this authentication while retrieving data from tables/pages in the form of Excel data on the instance.
-   It restricts any guest users who are currently accessing this data. If applicable, you may need to create a new account for users who need access to this content, with necessary access control permissions.
