# Enable a deny-list password validation check

Manage the deny-list passwords in the Excluded Password table.

Use the **glide.enable.blacklist\_password** property to monitor deny-list passwords. When the property is set to `true`, the user's password is checked against a specific list of deny-listed passwords. This denial prevents users from using a password from a set of breached passwords. You can maintain the list by inserting passwords into the Excluded Password \[blacklisted\_password\] table. ServiceNow provides a small, medium, or large password list that can be inserted to the Excluded Password table through the UI page found at **All** &gt; **Password Policy** &gt; **Exclusion List Management**. ServiceNow installs the small list of 5,000 passwords to new instances.

Ensure that the **glide.enable.blacklist\_password** system property is set to `true` and that the Excluded Password \[blacklisted\_password\] table contains a minimum of 5,000 records.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 5.9
-   CVSS score: Medium
-   Security risk details: Attackers often target commonly used or previously exposed passwords. This can lead to account compromise through credential stuffing or brute-force attacks. Enforcing deny-listed password checks strengthens authentication security and reduces exposure to credential-based attacks.
