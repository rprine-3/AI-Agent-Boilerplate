# Escape HTML in list views \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 1.5\]

Use the **glide.ui.escape\_html\_list\_field** property to force HTML escapes for HTML fields in a list view.

Set **glide.ui.escape\_html\_list\_field** to **true** to prevent HTML from being rendered in HTML fields in list view. Leaving HTML sanitization inactive platform wide \(via system property\) or by field \(via a schema attribute\), may lead to XSS style attacks. XSS attacks may allow a low privileged user to hijack the session of a high privileged user or interfere in standard web application behaviors, including redirects or defacement.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It’s non-revertible.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces HTML encoding to occur on the UI at the HTML parser level and thus renders back encoded results to the user. It can have a functionality impact based on the instance user interaction with the resulted data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(High\) Input validation must occur on the application to defend against cross-site scripting attacks. These attacks enable foreign scripts to execute on user sessions in the logged in browser's context. Attackers can use it to steal session information and sensitive data.
