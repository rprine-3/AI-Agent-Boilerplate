# Enforce certificate trust \[Updated in Security Center 1.3, removed in 2.0, added in 7.0\]

Use system properties to ensure that certificate expiration and trust are checked for certificates received from outbound HTTPS call endpoints when host verification is not performed.

When **com.glide.communications.trustmanager\_trust\_all** is set to **true**, then certificate expiration and trust are not checked for the certificate received from an outbound HTTPS call endpoint when host verification is not performed.

Verify that the **com.glide.communications.trustmanager\_trust\_all** system property is set to the recommended value of **false**. This ensures that your instance only trusts certificates that it can verify against the JVM certificate store. Self-signed and enterprise-signed certificates are not trusted. This property only applies when **com.glide.communications.httpclient.verify\_hostname** is set to **false**.

**Note:** The values for these properties are  and cannot be altered once changed \(they are non-revertible\). For security purposes, do not change this property value. If you have further questions, contact Customer Service and Support.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces strict validation on certificate CA \(certificate authority\) field. If a trusted entity \(CA\) issued the certificate, the instance accepts it for further use.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(Medium\) For confidentiality and integrity reasons, application should validate the certificate's CA before using the certificate for any transactional operations.
