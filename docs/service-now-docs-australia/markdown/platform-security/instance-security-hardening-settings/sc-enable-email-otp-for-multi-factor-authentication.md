# Enable email OTP for multi-factor authentication

Manage how two-factor authentication is applied on your instance.

The property **glide.authenticate.multifactor.email.otp.enabled** controls whether a token for the second authentication factor can be sent via email. Email is considered a weak MFA factor which an attacker is more likely to gain access into for defeating MFA.

If the property is false, the user doesn't see email OTP option on the MFA validation screen.

If the property is true:

1.  The email factor is shown in cases where the email factor policy is inactive and no other 2fa registered.
2.  The email factor is shown if the email factor policy is active and evaluated to true.
3.  The email factor is not shown if the email factor policy is active and evaluated to false.
