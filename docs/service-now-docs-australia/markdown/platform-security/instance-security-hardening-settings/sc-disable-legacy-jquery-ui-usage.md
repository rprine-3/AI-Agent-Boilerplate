# Disable legacy JQuery UI usage

Avoid the introduction of unpatched vulnerabilities in the library by disabling legacy JQuery UI usage.

Prevent the use of older prepatched JQuery UI versions, which introduce unpatched vulnerabilities in the library. Using old versions can potentially lead to security risks arising from attacks on vulnerabilities discovered in outdated JQuery UI library versions.

Confirm that the **glide.jquery\_ui.legacy** system property is set to **false** to prevent older prepatched JQuery UI versions from being used. This system property is a failsafe in case organizations depend on the non-patched versions to run their custom implementations.
