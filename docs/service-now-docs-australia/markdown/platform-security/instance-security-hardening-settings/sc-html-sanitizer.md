# Enable HTML Sanitizer \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.html.sanitize\_all\_fields** property to enable the HTMLSanitizer script include, which sanitizes HTML input based on exclusion listed and inclusion listed attributes configured in a script.

The field types available with dictionary/fields include HTML and Translated HTML. These HTML input fields enable users to write HTML formatted input, for example:

`<h1>Test</h1>`, using the most basic HTML tags such as `<img>`, `<a href …>`, and `<iframe>`.

It can open a door for a malicious attacker to inject malicious vector with HTML tags such as:

`[<IMG SRC=" &#14; JavaScript:alert('XSS');">][<IMG onmouseover="alert('xss')">],[a href="" onclick=alert(/xss/)]`.

\(High\) User input should be securely treated when the data is being stored and processed on the application.This reduces client-side cross-site scripting attacks by output encoding the data.

This property sanitizes all HTML fields in the system. If you must enable HTML sanitization on individual fields, see [Enable sanitization on individual fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_EnSanitizIndFlds.md).

 You can also configure the inclusion list or exclusion list to sanitize HTML tags and attributes as per your organizations policy.
