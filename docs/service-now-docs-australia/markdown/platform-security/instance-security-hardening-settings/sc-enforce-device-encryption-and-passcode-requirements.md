# Enforce device encryption and passcode requirements \[New in Security Center 1.3\]

The **glide.sg.device\_encryption\_enabled** property enforces the Federal Information Processing Standard \(FIPS 140-2\) Encryption. Mobile device encryption and passcode ensure that an unauthorized user cannot access the content of a device even if the device is physically obtained.

When the **glide.sg.device\_encryption\_enabled** system property is set to **true**, the ServiceNow mobile app checks that device encryption is enabled and that device passcode is enabled. If encryption or passcode is not enabled, the user will not be allowed to log into the instance on mobile. This property enforces FIPS 140-2 Encryption. Mobile device encryption and passcode are important security features for ensuring an unauthorized user cannot access the content of the device even if the device is physically obtained.

Set the **glide.sg.device\_encryption\_enabled** system property to **true**.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 4.2
-   CVSS score: Medium
-   Security risk details: This creates a risk that sensitive data stored or accessed through the mobile app could be exposed if the device is lost, stolen, or compromised. Without encryption and passcode enforcement, unauthorized users can gain physical access to confidential information, undermining compliance with FIPS 140-2 and weakening overall data protection.

Functional impact

</td><td>

When this property is set to true, the mobile app will verify if device encryption is enabled. If encryption is not enabled, users will not be allowed to log into the current instance on mobile.

 Users are logged out and see the following warning message, suggesting that they set a device pin or encrypt the device and to try to login again.

 ```
You were logged out
You need a passcode in order to use this instance on this device. Go to your device's settings to set one up
