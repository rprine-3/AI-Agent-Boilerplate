# Ensure An Instance is Allowed to Connect to Only Trusted IP Addresses

Use a system property to define a list of IP ranges that are appended to the outbound IP allow list.

Use the **glide.custom.ip.outbound.authenticate.allow** system property to define a list of IP ranges that are appended to the outbound IP allow list of an instance. The property value contains a comma separated range of IP addresses in IPv4 or IPv6 format. IP ranges are specified using a hyphen \(10.0.10.14-10.0.10.19\), using CIDR notation \(10.0.10.0/24\), or consist of a single IP address \(10.0.10.5\). The instance is allowed to connect to the IP ranges in this property, unless listed in the IP deny list.

**Note:** IP ranges in this property are appended to the outbound IP allow list regardless of the value of the **glide.ip.authenticate.strict** property. The IP Address Access Controls \[ip\_access\] table provides an equivalent option to add to both the inbound/outbound allow/deny IP lists of an instance. Refer to the Steps to Configure section in [IP range based authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/authentication/c_IPRangeBasedAuthentication.md).

Ensure that the **glide.custom.ip.outbound.authenticate.allow** system property value is either an empty, or a comma-separated list containing only trusted IP ranges that your want to allow your instance to access.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 4.3
-   CVSS score: Medium
-   Security risk details: If IP ranges are added to the property, it increases the risk of that an instance may connect to unauthorized or non-essential external services that should otherwise be blocked. This can weaken network-level security. In cases where additional IP ranges are necessary, be careful to include a minimal set of only trusted IPs.

Functional impact

There should be no functional impact. It can only be used to increase your instance's access.
