# Disable GlideRecord Scope Fencing Legacy Behavior

The **glide.record.legacy\_cross\_scope\_access\_policy\_in\_script** property disables scope fencing allowing scoped apps to access global script interfaces. It was created as a patch to GlideRecord's cross scope access.

GlideRecord provided cross scope create/update access to tables that were not configured with that level of access. In order to prevent customers from having applications broken when this scoped access behavior was patched, the property **glide.record.legacy\_cross\_scope\_access\_policy\_in\_script** was created. When set to **true**, cross scope access falls back onto legacy behavior \(insecure\). This property disables scope fencing, allowing scoped apps to access global script interfaces.

Set the **glide.record.legacy\_cross\_scope\_access\_policy\_in\_script** system property to **false**. When not present in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, the default value is **true**.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 5.0
-   CVSS rating: Medium
-   Security risk details: It is best security practice to have scope fencing restrictions in place. Scoping ensures applications can only access resources with explicit access or within their scope, following the principle of least privilege. Disabling this feature could lead to confidentiality, availability, and integrity impacts.
