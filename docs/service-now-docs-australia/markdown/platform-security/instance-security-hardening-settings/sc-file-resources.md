# File and resources

The file and resources category ensures applications handle untrusted file data securely and store untrusted data from untrusted sources with limited permissions in an appropriate location.

This includes controls such as avoiding denial of service through large or unexpected file types, validating file type and preventing against path traversal.

-   **[Disallow infected file download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-disallow-infected-files-download.md)**  
Control whether users can download non-scanned attachments if the antivirus service is down or unreachable.
-   **[Enable email spam scoring and filtering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-email-spam-scoring-and-filtering.md)**  
Install the Email Filter \(**com.glide.email\_filter**\) plugin to install email filtering within the instance. This filtering identifies existing headers, which enables you to decide what to do with the email based on the associated header. Alternatively, set **com.glide.email\_filter** to false.
-   **[Enable antivirus scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-enable-antivirus-scan.md)**  
The **com.glide.snap.enable\_scan** property activates the antivirus scan functionality.

Use the **glide.ui.strict\_customer\_uploaded\_static\_content** property to enable restrictions on the file types that can be downloaded when they have been uploaded using the Upload File functionality.

The **glide.platform\_ml\_di.max\_attachment\_size\_graphql** property controls the maximum allowed size limit for returning attachments in GraphQL endpoints of training or prediction flows.
-   **[Limit attachment size in training and prediction flows \[New in Security Center 1.3 and updated in 1.5\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-limit-attachment-size-in-tr.md)**

Configure the **glide.http.response.get\_body.limit.enabled** and **glide.http.response.get\_body.limit** properties to protect your instance against OutOfMemoryExceptions.
-   **[Limit maximum number of attachments in email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-limit-maximum-number-of-attachments-in-email.md)**

-   **[Maximum allowed attachment size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-max-allowed-attachment-size.md)**  
Configure the **com.glide.attachment.max\_size** property to control the maximum size \(in megabytes\) permitted for an uploaded attachment.
-   **[Validate file mime type in AttachmentCreator soap web service \[New in Security Center 1.3 and updated in 1.5\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-validate-file-mime-type-in-attachmentcreator.md)**  
The **glide.attachment.enforce\_security\_validation** property determines whether Multipurpose internet Mail Extensions \(MIME\) files undergo validation.
-   **[Validate MIME Type of Attachments from Inbound Emails](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-validate-mime-type-of-attachments-from-inbound-emails.md)**
