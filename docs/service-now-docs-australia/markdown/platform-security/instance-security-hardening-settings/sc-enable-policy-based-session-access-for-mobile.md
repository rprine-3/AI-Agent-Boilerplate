# Enable policy based session access for mobile

Use the The Zero Trust- Policy Based Session Access plugin to control if users authenticating through a mobile app will have their roles reduced.

The **Zero Trust - Policy Based Session Access** plugin allows security admins to reduce user access in a session based on IP, Location, Identity provider attributes and user attributes using adaptive authentication policies. When this property is set to **true**, then users logging in via mobile device will have their roles restricted as configured by the plugin policies.

Set the Glide Property **glide.authenticate.session\_access.mobile.enabled** to **true**.
