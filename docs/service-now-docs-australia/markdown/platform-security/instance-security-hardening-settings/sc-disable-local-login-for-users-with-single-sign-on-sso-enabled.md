# Disable local login for users with Single Sign-On \(SSO\) enabled

Update user records to disable local login for users with Single Sign-On \(SSO\) enabled.

Users configured to use SSO authentication may be able to access the instance, or parts of the instance, with local credentials stored in the user\_password field of their User \[sys\_user\] record. This access applies to both interactive and non-interactive access for users who aren't locked out. Help prevent SSO-configured users from using local credentials to reduce the chance that valid local login credentials are stolen and used by malicious users.

Review Now Support Knowledge Base article [KB1649420](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1649420) for instructions on identifying and addressing accounts with local login still enabled on an instance with SSO enabled.
