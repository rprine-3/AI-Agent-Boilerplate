# Escape JavaScript \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.html.escape\_script** property to force escape from JavaScript \(`<script></script>`\) tags in HTML fields during list views.

The glide property **glide.html.escape\_script** helps sanitize HTML fields. If **glide.html.escape\_script**is not set to the recommended value of true, then inputs will not be sanitized for HTML fields \(output encoding\) from a backend Java context by removing embedded JavaScript. Javascript in HTML fields can lead to stored and reflected XSS. The ability to have XSS can lead to easily attained privilege escalation to higher roles such as admin where more lateral movement can be taken.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces JavaScript escaping to occur on the UI and renders encoded results to the user. It can have an impact on functionality, based on the instance user interaction with the resulting data

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(High\) Input validation must occur in the application to defend against cross-site scripting attacks. These attacks enable foreign scripts to execute on user session in the logged in browser's context. Attackers can use it to steal session information and sensitive data.
