# Exclude Sensitive Tables and Fields from Data Generation \[New in Security Center 7.0\]

Use system properties to exclude tables and fields from Data Generation, which is used to generate fake data sets based on existing data. Tables and fields that are added to these exclusion lists can't be used for Data Generation feature.

Tables included in the **glide.data.generation.excluded.tables** system property are excluded from Data Generation in addition to metadata tables.

Fields included in a comma separated list for **glide.data.generation.excluded.fields.&lt;TABLE-NAME&gt;** are excluded from Data Generation in addition to any of these fields, if applicable:

-   number
-   roles
-   sys\_class\_name
-   sys\_created\_by
-   sys\_id
-   sys\_mod\_count
-   sys\_tags
-   sys\_updated\_by

Review the list of tables included in the property **glide.data.generation.excluded.tables**. Add any tables which should be excluded from Data Generation to the comma separated list of tables. In addition, metadata tables will be ignored for data generation.

Review the list of fields for each table by looking at properties with the format: `glide.data.generation.excluded.fields.<TABLE-NAME>`. Add any sensitive fields for the specified table as a comma-separated list of values.
