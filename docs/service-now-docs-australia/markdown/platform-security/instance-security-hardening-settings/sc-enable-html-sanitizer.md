# Enable HTML Sanitizer within Virtual Agent

Use the **com.glide.cs.html.sanitizer.enabled** property to enable HTMLSanitizerService.

The **com.glide.cs.html.sanitizer.enabled** system property controls the whether the HtmlSanitizerService is enabled. If **com.glide.cs.html.sanitizer.enabled** is not set to **true**, then a Stored Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\) attack is possible in the VA web client.

Ensure that the property **com.glide.cs.html.sanitizer.enabled** is set to **true**.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
