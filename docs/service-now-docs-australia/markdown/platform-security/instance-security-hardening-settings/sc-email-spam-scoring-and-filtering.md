# Enable email spam scoring and filtering

Install the Email Filter \(**com.glide.email\_filter**\) plugin to install email filtering within the instance. This filtering identifies existing headers, which enables you to decide what to do with the email based on the associated header. Alternatively, set **com.glide.email\_filter** to false.

The Email Filter \(**com.glide.email\_filter**\) plugin installs email filtering within the instance. This filter identifies existing headers, which enables the administrator to decide what to do with the email based on the associated header. The plugin adds a header to each message, which can be used for filtering within the instance. This feature is very helpful for filtering out spam.

**Note:** Please make sure prerequisite property **glide.email.read.active** is set to **true**, as this control only applies when inbound email is enabled.

Ensure that the plugin **com.glide.email\_filter** is activated when the property **glide.email.read.active** is set to **true**.

Email is never filtered, blocked, or quarantined from the instance as part of spam scoring. It is only scored and then sent on to the instance. All filtering is done within the instance with the Email Filters plugin.
