# Disable legacy JQuery behavior

The **glide.jquery.legacy** is used to prevent older prepatched JQuery versions from being used which will introduce unpatched vulnerabilities in the library.

If **glide.jquery.legacy** is not set to the recommended value of **false**, then older prepatched JQuery versions are used which introduce unpatched vulnerabilities in the library. When **false**, integrates the JQuery 1.12.3 and 2.2.3 security patches. The system property is a fail-safe in case any organizations depend on the non-patched versions of angularJS to run their custom implementations.

Ensure the property **glide.jquery.legacy** is set to **false**.
