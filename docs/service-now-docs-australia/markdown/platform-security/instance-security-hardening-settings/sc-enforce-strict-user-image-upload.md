# Enforce Strict User Image Upload

Use the **glide.security.strict.user\_image\_upload** property to enable Access Control for the upload/update of a profile picture when performed on a user record.

If the **glide.security.strict.user\_image\_upload** system property isn't set to the recommended value of **true**, then ACLs aren't enforced on image uploads to the Photo field. When the property is set to **true**, the table ACLs are enforced when uploading photos, only allowing authorized users to upload an image.

Ensure that the property **glide.security.strict.user\_image\_upload** is set to **true**.
