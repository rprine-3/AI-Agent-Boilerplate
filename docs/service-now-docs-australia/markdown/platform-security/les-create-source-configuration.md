-   **[Create source type and multi topics in the LES source table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/les-multi-topics-v2.md)**  
Consume logs for each source type by creating multiple topics per source type. You can now leverage the option of customized selection of specific topics for different log sources during the debugging process, without impacting the other log tables.
