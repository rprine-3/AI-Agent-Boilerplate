# Configuring a Guardrail Service Provider

AI Guardian supports default guardrails and third-party or custom guardrail service providers to extend AI content monitoring with your organization's AI governance policies.

## Guardrail Service Provider overview

AI Guardian includes default guardrails to detect offensive content, block prompt injection attacks, and filter sensitive topics. In addition to these guardrails, AI Guardian supports third-party guardrail service providers. You can also create your own custom guardian using the Bring Your Own Guardrail \(BYOG\) feature to monitor and detect malicious content.

Custom guardian evaluates prompts and responses in real time, just like the default guardrails. You can set each custom guardrail to log events, block content, or both based on your specific security or content policies.

## Supported guardrail service providers

AI Guardian supports the following guardrail service provider types:

-   **ServiceNow Guardrail**

    The default provider built into the platform. No additional configuration is required.

-   **Third-party providers**

    Supported cloud AI safety services that you can integrate with AI Guardian. Supported providers include Microsoft Content Safety, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Model Armor.

-   **Custom guardrail**

    A guardrail you create using the Bring Your Own Guardrail \(BYOG\) feature to apply your organization's specific compliance, security, or content policies.


## Custom guardrails for AI Guardian

The Bring Your Own Guardrail \(BYOG\) feature lets you create and connect a custom guardrail in AI Guardian. A custom guardrail connects to an external endpoint that you control, allowing you to apply policies specific to your organization. It evaluate prompts and responses in real time, the same as default guardrails. You can configure each custom guardrail to log events, block content, or both.

Setting up a custom guardrail involves three steps:

1.  Create a connection and credential alias for the custom guardian and complete its setup. The alias supports Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0, and API Key credential types.

    For more information, see [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/connection-alias.md).

2.  Create a custom guardian in the Generative AI Custom Guardian Transformer \[sys\_generative\_ai\_custom\_guardian\_transformer\_list.do\] table.

    For more information, see [Create a custom guardian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-custom-guardian.md).

3.  Select your preferred guardrail service providers to monitor content.
