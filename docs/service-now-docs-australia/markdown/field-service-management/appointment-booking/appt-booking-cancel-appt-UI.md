# Cancel an appointment as a customer

Cancel a service appointment from either the Customer or the Consumer Service Portal.

## Before you begin

Role required:

## About this task

An appointment cannot be canceled if the current time is within the cancellation time window specified in the service configuration. If within this cancellation time window, the **Cancel** button does not appear in the Appointment field on the work order.

**Note:** Canceling an appointment also cancels the associated work order and work order tasks.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the Customer or Consumer Service Portal.

2.  In the portal header, click **Support** &gt; **Appointments** to display the Appointment Listing page.

3.  Click **Upcoming** to view a list of upcoming appointments.

4.  Select the appointment to reschedule.

    This opens the work order for the selected appointment.

5.  Below the **Appointment** field, click **Cancel**.

    The system displays a warning that the appointment and the associated work order will be canceled.

6.  Click **Continue** to cancel the work order.

    The appointment and work order are canceled. The **Appointment** field no longer appears on the work order form and the customer should receive a confirmation email regarding the cancellation.

    Information about the canceled appointment is noted in the **Activities** field on the work order. This information includes the original appointment window, an appointment cancellation message, and the user who made the change.
