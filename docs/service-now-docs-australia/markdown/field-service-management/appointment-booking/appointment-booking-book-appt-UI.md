# Book an appointment as a customer

Book an appointment for a service from either the Customer or the Consumer Service Portal.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_user

## About this task

Booking an appointment creates a work order for the selected service. After the appointment is confirmed and the work order is scheduled, the customer receives a confirmation email with the appointment details.

**Note:** Appointment booking for work order tasks is not supported through the Customer or Consumer Service Portal. You can only reschedule existing appointments for work order tasks.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the Customer or Consumer Service Portal.

2.  Click **Requests** &gt; **Request Something** in the portal header.

3.  From the Categories, select **Services**.

4.  Select a service that requires an appointment from the services list.

5.  If necessary, enter a detailed description.

6.  Click the calendar icon in the **Appointment** field to open the Select Appointment pop-up window.

    This window displays available appointments by day or by week.

7.  Use the left and right arrows or the calendar icon to display a different day or week.

    Available appointment time slots for the selected day or week are displayed. Unavailable dates are grayed out and not selectable. If you do not see any available appointments, select a different day.

8.  Click the desired time slot and then click **Select**.

    **Note:** Based on the configuration set for the logged in user's time format, the appointment booking window will display either a 12-hr or a 24-hr clock.

    The **Appointment** field on the record producer displays the selected appointment window day and time.

9.  Click **Submit** in the record producer.

    The appointment request is submitted and the work order created for the appointment is displayed. The appointment details appear on the work order page in the Appointment widget.

    Information about the scheduled appointment is noted in the **Activities** field on the work order. This information includes the appointment day and time and the time zone for the selected location.

    When the work order is assigned and accepted by a technician, the customer receives a confirmation email and SMS.
