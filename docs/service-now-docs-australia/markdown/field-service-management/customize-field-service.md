# Advanced configurations for Field Service Management

Customizations are the best way to get the most out of Field Service management. You can tailor your instance to give your organization the functionality to work exactly the way that is best for you.

Advanced configurations, especially ones that involve JSON, JavaScript, or UI Builder, should only be completed by professional developers. These Advanced configurations change the way your instance functions, and if done incorrectly can lead to service interruptions and potential down time.

Always test your advanced configurations on a non-production instance before completing them in a live environment. It’s important to take the utmost care when interacting with code directly. Make sure you understand what you’re doing before you try and accomplish it.

There are multiple ways that you can configure you Field Service Management instance, those include:

-   UI Builder: Dispatcher Workspace, and other Field Service Management applications are built with UI Builder. UI Builder gives you the flexibility to change any of the UI elements in Dispatcher Workspace to fit you needs. For more information on UI Builder, see [Customize UI Builder pages using components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/work-components.md).
-   Script includes: Script includes are used to store JavaScript that runs on the server. Script includes have a name, description, and, script. They also specify whether they are active or not, and whether they can be called from a client script. View existing or create a new script include using the Script Include form. For more information on script includes, see [Script includes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).
