# Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management components

Several types of components are installed with the Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management feature, including tables, business rules, scheduled jobs, and script includes.

Install the Field Service Contractor Management plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_contractor\_management\) to take the external groups into account while reserving, defining, and assigning the work capacity. For more information, see [Activate Field Service Contractor Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/activate-contractor-management-plugin.md).

Activation of Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management adds the Capacity Management menu to the application navigator and the following modules:

-   **Capacity Reservations**: Reserve a capacity percentage of a group or agents availability to meet specific demands. For example, 60% for Break-Fix Work types and 40% for Install work types.
-   **Capacity Definitions**: Allocate the correct amount of work to internal or external work groups based on defined hours, task count, or agent work schedules. You can define capacity for a day, week, month, or year.
-   **Capacity Assignments**: Assign the capacity and capacity reservations to internal work groups and external groups of contractor companies.
-   **Capacity Usages**: View the record of capacity used by different groups and agents.

**Note:** You must select **using dynamic scheduling** in the **Assignment method for tasks** configuration option to enable your application to distribute work based on the capacity management rules.
