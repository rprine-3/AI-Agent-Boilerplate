# Map case fields with work order table

Define the fields you want to map between the case and the target work order table fields that you have already configured. This configuration automatically copies the values of mapped fields from the case to the work order when creating a work order from the case.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Case Work Order Mapping**.

2.  Click **New**.

-   If there are multiple matching table maps with different orders, the system uses the map with the highest order.
