|sn\_shift\_planning\_agent\_time\_work|Stores the agent's time worked, such as clock-in and clock-out times. If an agent logs in early or logs out late, then the shift start and shift end times are stored in place of the clock-in and clock-out times.|
|sn\_shift\_planning\_agent\_time\_attendance|Stores the clock-in and clock-out times of agents. Data is retrieved when an agent logs in, logs out, or changes the Presence state.|

<table id="table_ywt_4t1_gnb"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.number\_of\_days\_to\_cache

</td><td>

Number of days to cache agent schedules.-   **Type:** Integer
-   **Default value:** 5

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.enable\_schedule\_adherence

</td><td>

Calculates and displays schedule adherence information for your agents.-   **Type:** Boolean
-   **Default value:** True

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.early\_clockin\_threshold

</td><td>

Threshold settings indicate how many minutes early or late an agent can clock-in or clock-out from the scheduled time without being considered non-adherent. This is the acceptable duration of time flexibility for an agent to start work before the scheduled start time. -   **Type:** Integer
-   **Default value:** 60 min

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.adherence\_threshold

</td><td>

Sets the percentage for a threshold in adherence. The agents who do not qualify as above the defined threshold value \(70%\) are considered non-adherent agents. -   **Type:** Integer
-   **Default value:** 70%

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.conformance\_lower\_threshold

</td><td>

Set the lower threshold percentage for flexibility in conformance. The agents who do not qualify for the defined lower and upper conformance threshold values \(80-120\) are considered non-conformant agents. -   **Type:** Integer
-   **Default value:** 80%

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.conformance\_upper\_threshold

</td><td>

Sets the upper threshold percentage for flexibility in conformance. The agents who do not qualify for the defined lower and upper conformance threshold values \(80-120\) are considered non-conformant agents.-   **Type:** Integer
-   **Default value:** 120%

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.auto\_clockout\_threshold

</td><td>

Threshold time for the system to wait and generate automatic clock-out events when agents forget to clock-out. For example, if the threshold is set to 60 minutes and an agent's planned work shift is 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. but the agent fails to clock out at 5 p.m., the system waits for 60 minutes and then generates an automatic clock-out event. -   **Type:** Integer
-   **Default value:** 60 min

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_fsm\_disp\_wrkspc.agent\_shift\_schdlng\_event\_color

</td><td>

Enables the default colors configured for each event type to display the same event spans with same color in Dispatcher Workspace.**Note:** You must select a dynamic value to display the selected color of workforce optimization events in Dispatcher Workspace.

 -   **Type:** String
-   **Default value:** static

|--------------|-----------|
|Notify User Clock In|Counts the clock-in events whenever there is a change in agent's Presence state.|

Shift Planning - Delete All Agent Schedules Cache

</td><td>

Deletes cache from the sn\_shift\_planning\_agent\_availability table.-   Runs automatically everyday at 2:30 a.m.
-   Run this job on demand when you import data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Clock-out event generation \(For scenarios where the clock-out event does not get triggered\)

</td><td>

Generates clock-out events every 4 hours if agents haven't clocked out. **Note:**

For example, say an agent's work shift times are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the **sn\_shift\_planning.auto\_clockout\_threshold** property value is set to 60 minutes. If the agent clocks in and fails to clock out, the scheduled job waits till 6 p.m. \(5 p.m.+60 minutes\) and if there is no clock out till 6 p.m., the system generates a clock-out event with the agent's shift end time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Populate Agent Time Worked Summary

</td><td>

Runs daily to calculate the time worked, adherence, and conformance based on an agent's planned and actual work shift times for the previous day. The values are stored in the \[sn\_shift\_planning\_time\_worked\_summary\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Update Wrapper End Time for Actual Work Events

</td><td>

Runs daily to make sure the actual work wrapper end-time is equal to last clock-out time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[Schedule Adherence\] Daily Data Collection

</td><td>

Runs the job daily and collects data for all teams indicators.

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[Schedule Adherence\] Historic Data Collection

</td><td>

Runs the job and collects historic data for all teams indicators.

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[Schedule Adherence\] Weekly Data Collection

</td><td>

Runs the job weekly and collects data for all indicators in Manager Workspace.
