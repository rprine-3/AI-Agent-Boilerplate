# Activate Field Service Marketplace

You can activate the Field Service Marketplace plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_marketplace\) for Field Service Management if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data if they aren’t already installed.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following items are installed with Field Service Marketplace:

-   Tables
-   Roles
-   System properties
-   Business rules
-   Script includes

For more information, see [Field Service Marketplace components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/contractor-marketplace-cmpnts.md).

**Note:** To utilize automation in Field Service Marketplace, the Dynamic Scheduling plugin must be installed and the **Use task filters for determining contractor tasks** property must be enabled.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Field Service Marketplace plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_marketplace\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
