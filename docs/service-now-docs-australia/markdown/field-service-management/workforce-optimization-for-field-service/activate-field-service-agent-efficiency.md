# Activate Field Service Agent Efficiency

You can activate the Field Service Agent Efficiency plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_agent\_efficiency\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. When you purchase a subscription, certain plugins are activated automatically. If a paid plugin isn't activated automatically, you can manually activate it from the All Applications list in your instance.

**Note:**

Before purchasing a subscription, you can evaluate the feature on a non-production instance without charge by requesting it from the Now Support Service Catalog.

Role required: admin

-   Tables

For more information, see [Field Service Agent Efficiency components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-agent-efficiency-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Field Service Agent Efficiency plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_agent\_efficiency\) using the filter criteria and search bar.
