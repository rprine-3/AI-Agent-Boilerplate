# Configure an agent's profile

Configure shifts, skills, schedules, and schedule attributes for agents in your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Ensure you have created a user and added the user to the appropriate user group applicable for agents.

## About this task

Configuring an agent appropriately is essential for scheduling and assigning tasks to agents. An accurately configured profile ensures the right responsibilities to each agent based on their skills, permissions, and availability.

Field Service Management capabilities like Route Optimization, Territory Planning, Dynamic Scheduling, or Intelligent Task Recommendations consider an agent’s scheduling attributes \(Resource Schedule Attributes table\) from the agent's profile for the given day to optimize capacity and task assignment.

**Note:** An agent can access and use Field Service Management capabilities based on the roles and permissions configured for the agent.

2.  Select an agent name.

    The agent profile preview appears.

3.  In the **Skills** related list, either add new skills or edit existing skills for the agent.
