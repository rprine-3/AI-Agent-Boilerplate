# Activate Field Service Crew Operations

You can activate the Field Service Crew Operations plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_crew\_scheduling\) for Field Service Management if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

Field Service Crew Operations requires the Field Service Management \[com.snc.work\_management\] plugin. For more information about activating Field Service Management, see [Activate Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ActivateFieldServiceManagement.md). Ensure that these plugins are activated before you install Field Service Crew Operations.

Role required: admin.

## About this task

The following items are installed with Field Service Crew Operations:

-   Roles
-   Tables
-   Business rules

For more information, see [Field Service Crew Operations components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/crew-scheduling-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Field Service Crew Operations plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_crew\_scheduling\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, click **Load demo data**.

    Demo data comprises sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

4.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).


## Result

The Field Service Crew Operations plugin when activated successfully adds the **sn\_fsm\_crew.work.management.allow.undersized.crew.taskassignment** property to the Field Service Management system properties. For more information, see [Properties installed with Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/r_PropInstallWFieldServMgmnt.md).
