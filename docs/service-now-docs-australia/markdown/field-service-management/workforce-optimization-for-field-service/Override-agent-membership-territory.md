# Modify the resource membership of agents or crews associated with a territory

Modify the territory membership of agents or crews to make them available to work in a territory for a certain period, set their priority when assigning tasks, or mark them as inactive.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_tp.fsm\_territory\_planner

## About this task

All agent and crew resources in the assignment group associated with a territory are available to work in that territory by default. You can modify their membership by making them inactive to avoid assigning tasks to them or set their territory membership type to either primary or secondary. Resources with a primary membership are prioritized over resources with a secondary membership when assigning tasks.

**Note:**

-   You can customize agent membership even if the agents don't belong to the assignment group, but crew membership can be customized only for crews that belong to the assignment group associated with the territory.

-   You must activate Field Service Crew Operations plugin to view and customize crew membership. For more information, see [Activate Field Service Crew Operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/activate-fsm-crew-scheduling.md).
