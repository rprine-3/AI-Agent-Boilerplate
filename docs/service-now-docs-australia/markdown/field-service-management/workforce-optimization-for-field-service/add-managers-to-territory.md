# Add managers to a territory

Add managers and provide access to a territory to manage a territory or manage resources of an assigned territory.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_tp.territory\_planner

## About this task

You can add different types of managers to a territory:

-   Primary manager: The primary manager is the permanent managers for a dedicated territory.
-   Secondary manager: The secondary manager can improve and manage territory when primary manager is not available.
-   Territory manager: The territory manager can access and manage all territories.
-   Resource manager: The resource manager has restricted access only to manage resources and create child territories in the assigned territory.

To understand the difference between the manager types and their access rights, see [Managing territories and agents from Territory Planning console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-manager-workforce/using-territory-planning-console.md) and [Field Service Territory Planning components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/territory-planning-components-fsm.md).
