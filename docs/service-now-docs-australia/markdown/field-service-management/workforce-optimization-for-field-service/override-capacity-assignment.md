# Create a capacity assignment override

Override the default capacity assignment rules to accommodate changes in the plan within a capacity definition. This allows you to update existing capacity assignments for different time intervals, capacity reservation rules, and recurring patterns without creating a new capacity definition.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_tp.fsm\_territory\_manager, wm\_manager, sn\_fsm\_capacity\_mg.wm\_capacity\_write, sn\_fsm\_tp.fsm\_territory\_planner, wm\_admin, wm\_contractor\_manager\_int

## About this task

Consider the following points:

-   The highest ranked override record is considered when there is conflict in the date range.
-   Overrides must not conflict with existing recurrence plans for the same capacity definition.
-   Overrides must adhere to the base recurrence plan of the capacity assignment. For example: if the base recurrence plan is "Monday to Friday," an override for "Saturday" will trigger a validation error.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Capacity Management** &gt; **Capacity Assignments**.

2.  Open the capacity definition.

    1.  Select a capacity definition from the list.

    2.  Open the capacity assignment of a group by clicking the **Effective from** date link for a capacity definition group.

        For example, click the **Effective from** date link in the row of **NorCal Technicians** group.

3.  In the Capacity Assignment Overrides related list, click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill the fields.

Select any existing recurrence plan. Recurrence plans can be customized for specific territories, groups, or tasks. This plan defines how often a capacity assignment repeats. It helps create a regular schedule for task allocation. For example:-   Assign tasks every weekday \(Monday to Friday\)
-   Allocate installation type tasks every weekend \(Saturday and Sunday\)
-   Set up capacity for the first Monday of every month
