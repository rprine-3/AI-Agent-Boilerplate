# Add agents to a territory

Add agents directly to a territory without adding them to the assignment groups. Enables agents to start working on tasks right away.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_tp.territory\_resource\_manager, sn\_fsm\_tp.territory\_edit\_resource\_allocation

## About this task

-   You can add agents to the territory even though its assignment group isn’t added to the territory.
-   Agents can work in a territory for the specified duration.
-   You can define multiple memberships for the same agent if they aren’t overlapping with the same start and end dates.

2.  From the territories list, open the territory for which you want to assign agents.
