# Setting up Teams Workforce Optimization for Field Service

Organize your teams into assignment groups and create reports for those groups so that you can gain visibility into the team's performance.

You can define a set of key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) to analyze the performance of all groups within your team. Drill into the metrics for a group, an agent, or a work order task within the team all from a central location.

As an administrator, you can configure KPIs as well as child KPIs. The child KPIs appear when you drill-down into top level KPIs. For example, Closed Work Order Tasks KPI has P1 Tasks, P2 Tasks as child KPIs.
