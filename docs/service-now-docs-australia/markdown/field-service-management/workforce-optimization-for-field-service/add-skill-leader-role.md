# Configure the leader role to identify crew leaders

Identify a crew leader if one isn’t specified by the dispatcher by adding skills to the leader role.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin

## About this task

All crews must have a leader. Dispatchers can assign a leader to a crew or use the resource requirements to designate a skill the crew leader must have in order to be assigned as the crew leader.

If the dispatcher doesn’t assign the leader to a crew or indicate a required leader skill in the resource requirements, the skills included in the leader role are used to determine the crew leader. The skills are matched with the skills of the available agents.

For more information on adding resource requirements to a task, see [Add resource requirements for a work order task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-manager-workforce/add-resource-requirement-wot.md).
