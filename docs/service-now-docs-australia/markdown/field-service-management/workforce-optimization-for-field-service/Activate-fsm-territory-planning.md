# Activate Field Service Territory Planning

You can activate the Field Service Territory Planning plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_territory\_planning\) for Field Service Management if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

Field Service Territory Planning requires the installation of Dispatcher Workspace plugin \(com.snc.uib.fsm\_dispatcher\_workspace\) to access the Territory Planning console.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Activation of Field Service Territory Planning activates Field Service Management \(com.snc.work\_management\) and Territory Planning \(com.snc.territory\_planning\) plugins if they are not already active.

The following items are installed with Field Service Territory Planning:

-   Roles
-   Tables
-   Script includes
-   Business rules
-   Properties
-   Query rules

For more information, see [Field Service Territory Planning components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/territory-planning-components-fsm.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Field Service Territory Planning plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_territory\_planning\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).


## Result

The Field Service Territory Planning plugin when activated successfully adds the default territory model, Field\_Service\_Territories to the Field Service configurations, inside the Add-ons tab.

**Note:** You must activate the **Field\_Service\_Territories** model after setting up your territories to schedule work order tasks based on territories.
