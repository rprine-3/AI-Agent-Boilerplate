# Activate intraday optimization

Activate Intraday optimization by activating the Field Service Management Scheduling Automations plugin \(com.snc.sn\_app\_fsm\_scheduling\_flows\) for Field Service Management. After the plugin is installed, navigate to flow designer to activate the relevant flows to trigger Intraday optimization to run throughout the day as scheduling conditions change.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications****All**.

2.  Search for the Field Service Scheduling Automations plugin \(com.snc.sn\_app\_fsm\_scheduling\_flows\) by its name or ID.

3.  Select **Install**.

4.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Designer**.

5.  Duplicate the required flows.

    1.  Select the Agent time off created Field Service Management Scheduling Automations flow.

    2.  Copy the flow by selecting the More actions icon \(\[Omitted image "more\_actions.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\) in the top right and selecting **Copy flow**.

    3.  Enter a name for the copied flow or retain the default name, which appends the word "Copy" to the name of the flow.

    6.  Select **Activate**.

    7.  Repeat these steps for the following event trigger flows: High priority work order task dispatched, Work order task canceled, and Work order task progressed.

        Optimization doesn’t consider priority unless the "Maximize assignment of higher priority tasks" constraint exists on the policy for the qualifier that triggered the event. For more information on adding constraints, see [Add constraints to a policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/add-constraint-schedule-optimization-policy.md).

    8.  Repeat the steps to active the event trigger flow, Agent WFO time off.

        **Note:** Ensure the Shift Scheduling for Field Service plugin is activated to use the Agent WFO time off flow.

    3.  Enter a name for the copied flow or retain the default name, which appends the word "Copy" to the name of the flow.

    4.  In the **Application** field, select **Schedule Optimization**.

    5.  Select **Copy**.

        A copy of the flow opens with the information you entered.
