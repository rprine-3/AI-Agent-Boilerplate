# Create quick crews in Dispatcher Workspace

Create planned or ad hoc crews faster and more efficiently using a single interface in Dispatcher Workspace. The single interface helps dispatchers view the agent schedule and availability while creating crews and adding crew members.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_dispatcher and wm\_crew\_moderator

## About this task

When creating a crew, you can simultaneously view the availability of agents and crews without losing the context of a calendar in Dispatcher Workspace.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service Management** &gt; **Dispatching** &gt; **Dispatcher Workspace**.

2.  Select **Dispatcher Workspace**.

3.  Create a regular crew or an ad hoc \(task-specific\) crew.

    -   To create a crew, select the Crew icon \(\[Omitted image "crew-new.png"\] Alt text: Crew icon.\) in the right panel of Dispatcher Workspace.
    -   To create ad hoc \(task-specific\) crew for a work order task that is in pending dispatch state, select the More actions icon \(\[Omitted image "OverflowIcon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon.\) in the task card and then select **Create Crew**.
