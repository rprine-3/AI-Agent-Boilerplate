# Activate Schedule Optimization

Activate the Schedule Optimization plugin \(com.snc\_schedule\_optimization\) for Field Service Management with the administrator role.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

-   Schedule Optimization requires a separate subscription from the rest of the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. When you purchase a subscription, certain plugins are activated automatically. If a plugin doesn't appear in the instance, submit a request via the Now Support Service Catalog.

-   Schedule Optimization requires the following plugins. Ensure that these plugins are activated before you install Schedule Optimization.
    -   **Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\)**

        Provides various capabilities and solution types for training the system to predict, recommend, and drive data outcomes.

    -   **Field Service Management \(com.snc.work\_management\)**

        Adds a number of plugins related to agent scheduling and work order task management.

    -   **Map Integrations for Field Service \(com.snc.app\_fsm\_map\_integr\)**

        Performs intelligent travel time estimates to allocate work order tasks to agents, taking into account both the agent's location and the task's location.
