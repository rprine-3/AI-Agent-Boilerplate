# Working on scheduled tasks in Dispatcher Workspace

Learn about different ways to view tasks in the Scheduled state​.

## Before you begin

-   **A Work order task is moved to the Scheduled state only when all the following conditions are met:**
    -   The Use scheduled state property is enabled​
    -   The Assigned to field isn’t empty​
    -   The Assigned to or Expected start field changes, and the Expected start value is beyond the threshold \(12 hours by default\) from the current time​
-   **Exceptions for the Scheduled state flow**
    -   Contractor tasks won’t be in the Scheduled state.
    -   When an agent time-off event is created and overlaps with the work order task, the task is moved to Pending dispatch. Similarly, for crew tasks, when the leader has a time-off event overlapping with the task time, the task is moved to Pending dispatch.​
    -   If all child work order tasks of the work order are in the Scheduled state, the work order is moved to Scheduled automatically.
    -   When dynamic scheduling is enabled, auto-assign isn’t available for scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks are considered for reassignment or unassignment​.
    -   Scheduled tasks appear as blocked time when intelligent task recommendation considers technician availability.​
