# Configuring Auto Assignment scheduling

The auto assignment feature can be enabled for requests or tasks, depending on the Service Management \(SM\) application's configuration settings.

## Configuration overview

When auto assignment is enabled and a task is qualified or marked as **Ready for Work**, an appropriate agent is automatically assigned to the task and it is moved to the **Assigned** state. If the task cannot be auto-assigned, a user with the dispatcher role must adjust the values in the request or task form and then save the record.

-   If the **Requests are assigned via auto-assignment** option is enabled, requests are automatically assigned.
-   If the **Tasks are assigned via auto-assignment** option is enabled, the tasks in a request are automatically assigned.

## Auto assignment criteria

The system uses the following criteria to assign agents automatically.

Description

Geolocation

</td><td>

You can configure whether an agent's home location should be considered when auto-assigning a task.To calculate the estimate time it takes for an agent to get to the task location, consider the following:

 -   If the **Use Google Maps API for travel time estimates** geolocation property is enabled, then you can select Google Maps API or straight-line estimates in the properties for calculating estimated travel time and distance.
-   If the **Use Google Maps API for travel time estimates** is not enabled, then the system uses the value in the Estimated Travel Duration field in the work order task to determine task assignment for the agent.
-   For more information, see [Components installed with Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/r_InstalledWithFSM.md).

 **Note:** Set up the following configurations:

-   Enable **Use agent or task scheduling** to calculate the estimated time to arrive.
-   Enable **Auto-selection of agents will consider location of agents** to configure the agent’s home location.

For more information about enabling the configurations, see [Global domain configurations.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ConfigureFieldService.md)

Skills

</td><td>

You can configure whether an agent's skills should be considered when auto-assigning a task.If you are assigning tasks to agents based on [mandatory skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/configure-mandatory-skills-feature.md) requirements, you cannot auto-assign tasks if the agent does not have the mandatory skills required to perform the task.

 **Note:** The work.management.use.mandatory.skills [system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/r_InstalledWithFSM.md) must be enabled to configure the agent's skills.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Availability

</td><td>

Auto-assignment considers an agent's existing schedule when auto-assigning additional tasks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task windows

</td><td>

Auto-assignment attempts to schedule within configured task windows. If a window cannot be scheduled for any available agents, auto-assignment fails.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task dependencies

</td><td>

Auto-assignment considers any predecessor \(upstream\) task dependencies when auto-assigning a task.Auto-assignment supports **Finish to start** advanced dependency with no minimum or maximum lag time, when Field Service Task Dependency \(com.snc.fsm\_task\_dependency\) plugin is activated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Agent schedules

</td><td>

Auto-assignment considers agents schedules from Workforce Optimization for Field Service application to auto-assign a task only if the **Enable Shift Scheduling for FSM to Determine Availability** property is enabled. For more information, see [Global domain configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ConfigureFieldService.md).

</table>## Auto assignment of a request and a task

Automatically assign a task to a dispatch group when the **Requests are assigned using auto-assignment** option is set in the SM application's configuration.

### Before you begin

Role required: wm\_qualifier, wm\_initiator

### Procedure

1.  In any SM application, do one of the following:

    -   Open a request in the **Awaiting Qualification** state, or one that has been qualified automatically, and then open a task in the **Draft** state.
    -   Open a task in the **Ready for Work** state.
2.  Select an **Assignment group**.

3.  If the **Tasks are assigned via auto-assignment** and **Auto-selection of agents will consider location of agents** configuration options are set, enter a location.

    Auto-dispatch will fail unless the task contains a valid location.

4.  If the **Tasks are assigned via auto-assignment** option is enabled, create a schedule for this task in the **Planned** section, or let the system determine the times.

    By default, ServiceNow enters the current date and time in the **Window start** field. If you do not create a schedule or a fixed window, ServiceNow uses the **start** value to look for an agent who has that time slot open.

    For instructions, see [Creating Work Order Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/t_CreateAWorkOrderTask.md).

5.  Click **Qualified** or **Ready for Work**.

    The view returns to the previous page, and a success message appears. The system assigns an agent to the task, enters the agent's assignment group in the task record, and moves the state to **Assigned**.

    If auto-assignment fails, the message indicates either that no agent was available or that the task did not specify a location. The system moves tasks that fail auto-assignment to the **Remain in the Pending Dispatch** state.

6.  To auto-assign a task that failed previously, enter any missing information or change the schedule, and save the record.
