# Create service configuration rules for a service configuration

Configure appointment booking rules for a service configuration, for example, Point-of-Sale-Installation, to enable varying duration of appointments for this service.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_admin

## About this task

Service Configuration Rules determine which advanced configuration is applied to a specific service use case. Using advanced configuration, you can define location-specific or day-specific appointment windows and slot settings. These advanced configurations are applied when the defined conditions are met.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment Booking Configuration**.

2.  Select the desired configuration.

    -   To create appointment booking service configuration rules for work orders, select **Field Service Order Configuration**
    -   To create appointment booking service configuration rules for work order tasks, select **Field Service Task Configuration**
3.  In the Appointment Booking Service Configuration related list, select a service configuration to which you want to add rules.

4.  Select either **Enable advanced configurations** or **Use appointment schedule** check box if not already selected.

5.  In the Service Configuration Rules related list, click **New**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ydv_ywx_rtb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the service configuration rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service configuration

</td><td>

The name of the service for which you are configuring rules. This field is automatically set to the name of the service configuration, for example, Point-of-Sale Installation.**Note:** The Point-of-Sale-Installation is available only for **Field Service Order Configuration**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task Table

</td><td>

The table where appointment booking rules are created for the selected service configuration. This field is automatically populated with the Work Order \[wm\_order\] or Work Order Task \[wm\_task\] table, based on the selected application configuration, to configure service rules.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task Conditions

</td><td>

Apply conditions to help determine the best matched appointment slot for a service provided to the customer. When the conditions are met, this service configuration rule is applied, and the default configuration is overridden by the advanced configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Lead time

</td><td>

Number of hours or days from the current time after which an appointment can be booked based on this service configuration rule. Define the lead time in hours or days. The default is four hours.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ignore lead time on reschedule

</td><td>

This option skips the calculation of lead time mentioned beforehand when rescheduling an appointment.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reschedule/Cancel by time

</td><td>

The number of hours or days prior to an appointment start time that are required for an appointment to be canceled or rescheduled. The default is 4 hours.**Note:** The **Cancel** button is not available within this number of hours.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Dedicated appointments per slot

</td><td>

An option to make it mandatory to include a certain number of appointments in each slot.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Holiday Schedule

</td><td>

The holiday schedule to use when this rule is applied to determine availability. Appointment booking evaluates the holiday schedule when determining the number of available appointments and excludes any day in the schedule that is set to **Exclude**. Click the lookup icon and select a schedule from the Schedules list. **Note:** Holiday schedules are useful when the assignment method for tasks is set to **manually**, which does not consider agent schedules.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to set the application service configuration rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order in which the service configuration rule must be executed. A rule with a lesser order is executed first.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max bookable days in future

</td><td>

The maximum number of days into the future, starting from the current day for which an appointment can be booked for this service. The default is 14 days.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Appointments per window

</td><td>

Number of available appointments for each configured appointment time slot. This number determines the number of available appointments that are displayed on the **Select Appointment** window. Enter a number in this field if the assignment method for tasks is set to manually. If assignment method is set to either using auto-assignment or using dynamic scheduling, this setting does not apply, unless a location is not provided. Then the configuration defaults to the number of appointments per window.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>7.  Click **Submit**.
