# Add constraints to a policy

Add constraints to Schedule Optimization policies to define the mandatory conditions technicians must meet to be considered for a task.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin

## About this task

Constraints are mandatory conditions embedded in policies that determine whether an assignment group can be considered for a task. If an assignment group does not meet a constraint, it is excluded from consideration. For example, if the Enable Mandatory Skills constraint is active, only assignment groups with agents who have the required skills are considered for task assignments. For a list of constraints, see [Objectives and constraints used with Schedule Optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/hard-soft-constraints.md).
