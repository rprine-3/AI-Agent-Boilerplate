# Create an Appointment schedule

An appointment schedule represents available slots as defined by its appointment window and service mapping configurations. Appointment schedules can be overridden for specific dates or slots to allow custom availability or capacity.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_admin

Ensure that the Advanced Appointment Booking plugin is active. For more information, see [Activate Advanced Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/activate-adv-appt-booking.md).

Ensure you have already created an **Appointment Window** and a **Service configuration mapping**. To create an appointment window and service configuration mapping see [Create an Appointment window configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-window-config.md) and [Create an Appointment service configuration mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-svc-config-mapping.md).

## About this task

An appointment schedule defines available time slots based on its configuration. With appointment schedules, you can configure advanced capabilities like a combination of appointment slots of different durations for a specific day, or adjust the number of appointments for a particular slot, or define a holiday schedule for a specific day.

For example, for a specific day, you can configure one slot of 3 hours duration, two slots of 2 hours duration and 4 slots for 1 hour duration.

For a service if demand is greater between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, Appointment Schedule lets you set more bookable appointments during that time, and fewer for other time slots.

You can also create an appointment schedule override to customize availability for specific dates or time slots. For more information on overrides, see [Create an Appointment Schedule Override](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-sched-override.md).

You can optionally define work and travel durations in a schedule. When **Use durations from the schedule** is enabled, these durations are used to calculate appointment availability and will override the default work and travel durations set in the service configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment schedule**.

2.  Click **New**.
