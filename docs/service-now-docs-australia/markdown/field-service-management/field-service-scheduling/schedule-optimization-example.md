# Example- Schedule Optimization

This example shows three different ways admins can configure the optimization engine to schedule tasks.

Admins can configure Schedule Optimization to run overnight in batches to schedule a larger number of tasks or throughout the day at selected intervals based on events. Admins can also enable dispatchers to initiate Schedule Optimization from Dispatcher Workspace by configuring on-demand optimization.

In this example, the organization is ensuring that agents complete as many tasks as they can during their shift without spending a lot of time traveling between tasks. A policy is configured to maximize assignments and minimize travel time. On-demand optimization is enabled for the dispatchers who are assigned to this group of agents.
