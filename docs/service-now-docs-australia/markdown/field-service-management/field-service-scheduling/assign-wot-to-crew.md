# Assign work order tasks to crews on Dispatcher Workspace

Assign crews to a work order task that requires a crew of agents in Dispatcher Workspace.

## Before you begin

If you’re scheduling a task across multiple schedule entries or days, a work schedule must have been assigned to the crew. For more information, see [Create a work schedule for agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-manager-workforce/create-agent-work-schedule.md).

**Note:** If the crew schedule hasn’t been defined and you’re auto-assigning a task, the default schedule is used.

If you want to assign work order tasks to crews in the territories that best match their location, you must enable the following options:

-   The Field Service territory model, **Field\_Service\_Territories**. For more information, see [Enable the Field Service territory model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/enable-territory-model.md).
-   The **Territory** option in Dispatcher Workspace must be enabled to view the territory information in the task card and the agent card. For more information, see [Enable Dispatcher Workspace settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/dispatcher-wrkspc-settings.md).

## About this task

You can assign tasks that are in the Pending Dispatch state. When assigning and dispatching work order tasks to crews, consider the following aspects:

-   Task completion factors: Time required for task completion and task deadlines \(window start and end dates\).
-   Crew assignment considerations: Crew assignment is based on their schedule and availability, ensuring they possess the necessary skill sets and required parts, with availability aligned to configured skill sets. The length of time required to complete a task
-   Agent skills: Aligns specific skills needed for the task with those possessed by crew members.
-   Task requirements: Matches crew capabilities with task demands.

If the Territory Planning plugin is active and Territory Model is enabled, additional factors include:

-   Territorial alignment: Ensures that the crew is located within the territory of the task.
-   Territory Membership: Agent eligibility for task assignment is determined by their membership in the associated territory.

Task assignment methods:

1.  Manual Assignment: The dispatcher selects the best crew for the task, verifying their effective dates align with the task window start and end dates. The dispatcher also checks agent availability within the crew based on their territory membership dates.
2.  Dynamic Assignment: Dynamic Scheduling automatically assigns tasks to crews based on factors like territory alignment, crew availability, agent skills, and task requirements. If a suitable crew exists, it’s assigned the task. Otherwise, a new crew is created. When the dynamically created crew is assigned for a work order task within a territory, the crew membership is updated and appears in the Crew Membership related list of the territory.

When scheduling tasks for multiple days:

-   View the crew schedule for a selected time period in the calendar, such as day, work day, week, two weeks, or four weeks. The calendar also displays the assigned task window spanned across multiple days or weeks.
-   View the recommended crews for the task using the **Auto Assign Rules** option.
