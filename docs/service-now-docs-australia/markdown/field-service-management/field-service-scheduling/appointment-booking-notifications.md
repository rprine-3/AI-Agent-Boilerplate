# Customize Appointment Booking email and SMS notifications

Customize email and SMS notifications for appointments. These notifications help users stay informed and engaged throughout the appointment scheduling process—providing clear confirmations, reminders, cancellations, and rescheduling notices.

An email and SMS notification for an appointment includes task information, such as the task number and description, as well as the appointment time. It can also include a link that enables the user to reschedule or cancel the appointment.

System administrators can configure both email and SMS notifications using the following appointment booking email templates.

-   appointment.confirmed
-   appointment.cancel
-   appointment.reschedule

These templates come included with the appointment booking plugin. You can customize them to meet specific requirements. For more information, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

**Note:** Ensure to install Customer Experience plugin to configure SMS. For more information, see [Activate Field Service Management Customer Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/Configuring-cust-exp.md).

Appointment booking email and SMS notifications are active for all services using the appointment booking feature. The following email notifications are included with the appointment booking feature:

|Email notification type|Description|
|-----------------------|-----------|
