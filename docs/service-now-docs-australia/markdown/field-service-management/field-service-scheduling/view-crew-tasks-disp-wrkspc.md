# View crew tasks on Dispatcher Workspace

As a dispatcher, you can view the tasks that require crew and are assigned to a crew.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_dispatcher

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Dispatching** &gt; **Dispatcher Workspace**.

2.  Click**Dispatcher Workspace**.

3.  Select a date from the calendar to view the crew task that is assigned to the agents who are available on the selected day.

4.  Click **Ok**.

    The task is displayed on the calendar next to the crew members and additional assignees included for the crew task. The assigned work order task displays the crew avatar.

5.  In the Agent panel, search for the crew to which the crew task is assigned.


## Result

-   The task is displayed on the calendar next to the crew.
-   The Assigned Crew field in the work order task contains the crew's name. If the crew leader does not accept in a specific time period, the work order task is rejected. The dispatcher can reassign the task to other available agents.
-   If a task is assigned to a crew, the system updates the estimated travel duration based on the crew's start location or previous start location. The updated value is based on the Manual Assignment property setting used for calculating estimated travel time and distance.
-   A warning message appears if the assigned task is outside the acceptable radius between the task location and the crew's location.
