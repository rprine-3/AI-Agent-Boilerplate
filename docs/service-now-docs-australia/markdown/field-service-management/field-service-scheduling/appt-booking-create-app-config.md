# Create or modify an application configuration for Appointment Booking

Set up an application configuration to manage appointment booking settings across all services within your application. You can either create a new configuration or modify an existing one provided by Field Service Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_admin

## About this task

Field Service Management provides default application-level configurations:

-   **Field Service Order Configuration** \(for work orders\)
-   **Field Service Task Configuration** \(for work order tasks\)

For example, if you create application configuration for the table Work Order \[wm\_order\], these appointment booking configurations are applied to all the work orders. You can modify these default configurations or use them as templates to create new configurations.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment Booking Configuration**.

2.  Perform one of the following actions:

    -   Select **New** to create a new configuration.

    -   Click the name of an existing configuration to modify it.

3.  In the Appointment Booking Configuration form, fill in or modify the following fields as needed.

<table id="table_vst_5nf_2r"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

The name of the application configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task Table

</td><td>

The settings are applied and appointments are created for the tasks in the selected table. The Work Order \[wm\_order\] table is the default table for the Field Service Order Configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Availability Method

</td><td>

Use one of the methods to determine appointment availability at the application-level. You can choose the availability method depending on the Field Service Management configuration setting in the **Assignment method for tasks** field of [Global domain configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ConfigureFieldService.md). The available methods are:-   **Number of appointments per slot**: Sets a fixed number of available appointments per time slot. Recommended if task assignment is manual.
-   **Scripted**: Dynamically calculates availability of technicians using customized scripts. Recommended if auto-assignment or dynamic scheduling is used. This is the default setting.
-   **Based on capacity**: Calculates availability based on the capacity defined in the capacity management settings. For more information, see [Create a capacity assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/assign-work-based-on-the-defined-capacity-.md)

This option is available when the Task Table is selected as work\_order and Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management plugin is installed.

For more information on appointment availability methods, see [Learn about appointment availability settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/appt-booking-task-assignment.md).

Auto acceptance

</td><td>

Automatically accepts tasks assigned through appointment booking, overriding the manual accept/reject requirement of the task-driven process lifecycle. If the Field Service Management configuration setting for **Process lifecycle** is set to **task-driven**, an agent must accept or reject an assigned task. Enable the **Auto acceptance** check box to override this configuration setting for appointment booking.

The available options are:-   Day: Displays the available appointments for the day.
