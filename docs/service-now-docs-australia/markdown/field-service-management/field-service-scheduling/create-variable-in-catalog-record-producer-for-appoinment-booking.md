# Configure variables in a record producer for appointment booking

Create specific variables in a Service Catalog record producer to capture essential details such as location and contact information when users book appointments.

## Before you begin

-   Clearly prompt users to specify accurate details like location and contact, ensuring efficient scheduling.
-   Ensure appointment details are precise and complete, reducing errors or rescheduling.
-   Simplify the booking process by guiding users with clearly defined variables and questions.

2.  Click the desired record producer.

3.  In the **Variable** related list, click **New**.
