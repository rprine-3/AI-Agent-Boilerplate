## About this task

When bundling tasks, note the following restrictions:

-   Tasks must be in the Pending Dispatch state to be added to a bundle.
-   Bundles can't be added to another bundle.
-   You can't add work order tasks that have dependencies, need a crew, or have a fixed access window to a bundle.
-   Vendor tasks can't be added to a bundle.
-   You can't create a sibling of a bundle that is in a bundle or create a sibling of a task that is in a bundle.
-   Tasks can't be schedule locked.
-   All subtasks must belong to the same assignment group. If territory management is enabled, they must also be in the same territory.
