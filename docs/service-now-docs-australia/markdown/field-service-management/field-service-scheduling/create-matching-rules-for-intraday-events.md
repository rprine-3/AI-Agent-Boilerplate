# Create matching rules for intraday events

Create matching rules to specify which tasks and technicians to include in prioritized intraday optimization runs.

## Before you begin

[Set up prioritized intraday optimization with matching rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/set-up-prioritized-intraday-optimization-with-matching-rules.md)

Role required: wm\_admin

## About this task

Create matching rules within a specific intraday optimization configuration. Matching rules execute in order based on the **Execution Order** field, with lower numbers processing first.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Schedule Optimization** &gt; **Intraday Optimization** &gt; **Configurations**.

2.  Select the configuration where you want to add the matching rule.

3.  In the **Matching Rules** tab, select **New**.

    A new window opens with the Matching Rules form.

4.  Complete the form.

<table id="table_om2_rvx_g3c"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Execution Order

</td><td>

Order in which the rule processes:Rules with lower numbers process first. All rules execute from the lowest to the highest order numbers, regardless of order in the list.

For example, matching rule with order 100 includes technicians with specific skills who are available within a defined time frame.

When technicians match the criteria, they’re included in optimization. When no technicians meet the criteria, the second rule \(order 200\) runs with broader criteria.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Select the check box to enable the rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table with the records that the matching rule applies to. Select **Intraday Event** or an extension of that table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Conditions

</td><td>

Conditions in which the matching rule applies. Define conditions that classify which types of events the rule executes for.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Matching

</td><td>

Indicates the option to match the rules. Select **Selection Criteria** to use the supported dimensions for radius and skills. Other options require custom configuration.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  If you selected **Selection Criteria** in the **Matching** field, add one or more matching dimensions in the **Matching Criteria** related list.

    Available matching dimensions:

    -   **Affected task\(s\)**: identifies tasks directly affected by the prioritized event
    -   **Affected technician\(s\)**: identifies technicians directly affected by the prioritized event
    -   **Retrieve task\(s\) based on skills**: identifies tasks whose required skills match the criteria
    -   **Retrieve task\(s\) within radius**: identifies tasks located within the defined radius of the intraday event
    -   **Retrieve technician\(s\) based on skills**: identifies technicians whose skills match those required by the intraday event
    -   **Retrieve technician\(s\) within radius**: identifies technicians located within the defined radius of the intraday event
7.  **Note:** If you have custom event types and flows for intraday optimization, migrate them to the Intraday Event Type table. Update your flows to populate the event type field with table references instead of drop-down values.

    Choose which event types use matching rules.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Schedule Optimization** &gt; **Intraday Optimization** &gt; **Event Types**.

    2.  For each event type you want to optimize with matching rules, set the **Prioritized** field to **True**.


## Result

The matching rule is added to the configuration and executes when the specified conditions are met during prioritized intraday optimization.
