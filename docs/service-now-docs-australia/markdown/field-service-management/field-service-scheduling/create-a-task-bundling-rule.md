# Create a task bundling rule

Create a task bundling rule to bundle tasks dynamically according to the selected parameters with Field Service Task Bundling.

## Before you begin

To add rules to any policy other than the default policy, create a policy first. For more information, see [Create a task bundling policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-a-task-bundling-policy.md).

[Enable the Field Service territory model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/enable-territory-model.md) plugin when bundling tasks by territory.

Role required: wm\_admin

</table>4.  In the Grouping Conditions section, use the condition builder to create task filters that define the tasks that this rule targets.

5.  Toggle **Advanced** to replace the condition builder with a **Script** field.

    Toggling **Advanced** replaces the condition builder with the following template:

    ```
    /**
     * This scripted rule should return an array of sys_ids of tasks joined using comma for each group that should be bundled
     * @param {String} taskType table name that contains the taskIds
     * @param {String} taskIds comma-separated task sys_ids representing a group of tasks
     * @returns {String[]} list of comma-separated task sys_ids shown as below:
     * [
     *	'sys_id_1,sys_id_2,sys_id_3',
     *	'sys_id_4',
     *	'sys_id_5,sys_id_6,sys_id_7,sys_id_8'
     * ]
     */
    (function executeRule(taskType, taskIds) {
    	// your code goes here
    })(taskType, taskIds);
    ```

6.  Select **Preview Tasks** to preview all tasks that are affected by your rule.

7.  Select **Submit**.
