# Create or modify service configuration for Appointment Booking

Service-level appointment booking enables customers to easily schedule specific services like installation, AC repair, or configuring printers, by customizing appointment availability, lead times, notifications, and booking rules.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_admin

Verify you have an active application configuration \(**Field Service Order Configuration or Field Service Task Configuration**\) set up. You can create multiple service-level configuration within an application-level configuration.

## About this task

To use the appointment booking feature, administrators must create a configuration for each service that is available to customers. In the service configuration, administrators can select a schedule from the **Schedules** list and set it as **Excluded** to exclude it from appointment availability.

**Note:**

Appointment Booking determines work and travel duration for appointment booking using the following hierarchy.

1.  **Appointment schedule override**: This takes the highest priority.

    The appointment schedule override lets you define work and travel duration for a specific territory, specific days, or specific date ranges.

2.  **Appointment schedule**: If no schedule override exists, the system uses the duration defined in Appointment schedule at a territory level.
3.  **Work order task**: If the **Use task duration** option is enabled and no appointment schedule defined, Appointment Booking uses the durations from the work order task.
4.  **Appointment service configuration**: If none of the above are defined, Appointment Booking uses the work duration and travel duration configured in the appointment service configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment Booking Configuration**.

2.  Select the desired configuration.

    -   To configure appointment booking service for work orders, select **Field Service Order Configuration**
    -   To configure appointment booking service for work order tasks, select **Field Service Task Configuration**
3.  In the Appointment Booking Service Configuration related list, click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the following fields as needed.

Use appointment schedule

</td><td>

Option to configure schedule based on appointment window and service mapping configurations.When enabled, you can configure additional features like overlapping appointment window, allowing overbooking of slots. For more information, see [Create an Appointment schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-sched.md)

**Note:**

-   When **Use appointment schedule** is selected, the default service configuration is overridden and the appointments are configured based on the **Appointment Schedule** settings.
-   The Advanced Appointment Booking plugin is required to use appointment schedules. For more information, see [Activate Advanced Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/activate-adv-appt-booking.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable advanced configuration

</td><td>

Option to configure different appointment schedule for specific days. Advanced appointment booking configurations settings and service configuration rules will be considered for calculating the appointment slots.You can choose to either enable **Use appointment schedule** or **Enabled advanced configuration** for a service configuration. Both the settings can't be enabled together.

For more information, see [Create appointment booking advanced configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/appintment-booking-day-level-config.md) and [Create service configuration rules for a service configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-booking-service-config-rules.md).

</td><td>

Sends notifications to customers.-   FALSE \(default\): Notifications are sent to the customer whenever an appointment is scheduled, rescheduled, or canceled.
-   TRUE: No notifications are sent.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Availability Method

</td><td>

Use one of the methods to determine appointment availability for the service. You can choose the availability method depending on the Field Service Management configuration setting in the **Assignment method for tasks** field of [Global domain configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ConfigureFieldService.md). **Note:** The availability method setting for the service overrides the availability method setting in the application configuration unless **Appointment configuration method** is selected.

The available methods are:-   **Number of appointments per slot**: Sets a fixed number of available appointments per time slot. Recommended if task assignment is manual.
-   **Scripted**: Dynamically calculates availability based on Field Service Management settings. Recommended if auto-assignment or dynamic scheduling is used. This is the default setting.
-   **Based on capacity**: Calculates availability based on the capacity defined in the capacity management settings. For more information, see [Create a capacity assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/assign-work-based-on-the-defined-capacity-.md)

This option is available when the Task Table is selected as work\_order and Field Service Capacity and Reservations Management plugin is installed.

-   **Appointment configuration method**: This is the default option. It calculates availability based on the availability method setting in the appointment booking application configuration.
For more information on appointment availability methods, see [Learn about appointment availability settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/appt-booking-task-assignment.md).
