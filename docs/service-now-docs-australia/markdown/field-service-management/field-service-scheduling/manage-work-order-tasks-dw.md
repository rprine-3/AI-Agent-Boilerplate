# Manage work order tasks

Track and monitor the real-time state of work order tasks. You can auto-assign tasks, record time, request more information, and cancel the work order task.

## Assign work order tasks to agents

Assign a work order task to a field service agent from Dispatcher Workspace.

### Before you begin

Role required: wm\_dispatcher

If the time required to complete the task needs multiple schedule entries or days, select the **Assign across the schedule entries** option in the work order task form.

If the task is assigned to an agent in the territory that best matches its location, then you must enable the following options:

-   The Field Service territory model, **Field\_Service\_Territories**. For more information, see [Enable the Field Service territory model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/enable-territory-model.md).
-   **Territory** option in Dispatcher Workspace to view the territory information in the task card and the agent card. For more information, see [Enable Dispatcher Workspace settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/dispatcher-wrkspc-settings.md).

If the task assignment method must respect the workforce optimized shift schedules then you must enable the **Enable Shift Scheduling for FSM to Determine Availability** configuration to activate the Workforce Optimization for Field Service data model. For more information, see [Activate Workforce Optimization for Field Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/activate-wfo-fsm.md).

**Note:** If the **Enable Shift Scheduling for FSM to Determine Availability** configuration is enabled, the Dispatcher Workspace calendar displays the schedules and events created in Workforce Optimization for Field Service application.

### About this task

You can assign work order tasks that are in pending to dispatch either manually or automatically in the Dispatcher Workspace.

-   To assign work order tasks automatically, you must enable dynamic scheduling. The auto-assign capability automatically matches a task to a nearby agent who has the necessary skills and a schedule that can accommodate the task. For more information, see [Setting up dynamic scheduling in Dispatcher Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/dispatcher-ws-dy-scheduling.md).
-   To assign work order tasks manually, consider the following aspects:
    -   The length of time required to complete a task
    -   The window of time in which a task must be completed
    -   The schedule and availability of agents with the necessary skill sets
    -   The availability of agents with required skill sets if configured
    -   The availability of required parts
    -   The impact on other tasks
    -   The agent task route map

If an agent is part of more than one assignment group or territory, then dispatchers see the agent on more than one line on the calendar in Dispatcher Workspace. To change the agent’s schedule, the dispatcher must change the line that corresponds with the assignment group or territory they manage.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Dispatching** &gt; **Dispatcher Workspace**.

2.  Select **Dispatcher Workspace**.

    **Note:** You can sort, filter, and also match the work order tasks based on the calendar dates before assigning field service agents. For more information, see [Search work order tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/search-work-order-tasks.md) and [Search for appropriate Field Service agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/search-agents-tasks.md).

3.  Assign the work order task to agents.

### Result

The task is assigned to an agent. The following then happens:

-   The task is displayed on the calendar next to the agent's name. The work order task color appears in the color as defined for assigned tasks.
-   The **Assigned to** field in the work order task contains the agent's name.
-   If a task is assigned to an agent, the system updates the estimated travel duration based on the agent's home location. The updated value is based on the **Manual Assignment** property setting used for calculating estimated travel time and distance.

There can be issues with the task assignment, such as the following:

-   If the assigned task is outside the acceptable radius between the task location and the agent's location, a warning message appears.
-   If the agent doesn’t accept in a specific time period, the work order task is automatically rejected. The dispatcher can reassign the task to other available agents.

## Assign work order tasks to agents using Intelligent Task Recommendation

As a dispatcher, you can recommend the best available tasks to fill gaps in an agent's schedule.

### Before you begin

Role required: wm\_dispatcher

The Field Service Intelligent Task Recommendation plugin must be activated. For more information, see [Activate Intelligent Task Recommendation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/activate-intelligent-task-recommendation.md).

### About this task

Intelligent Task Recommendations identifies and recommends the best available tasks for agents based on the following.

-   Start and end time of the task.
-   Excludes the work order tasks that are schedule locked.
-   Agent's territory and task's territory if Field Service Territory Planning plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_territory\_planning\) is enabled.
-   Considers the agent's start and end locations from the **Resource Schedule Attributes** table for the given day.
-   Integrates agent's schedule and events from the Workforce Optimization for Field Service application when the **Enable Shift Scheduling for FSM to Determine Availability** configuration is enabled. For more information, see [Global domain configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ConfigureFieldService.md) and [Activate Workforce Optimization for Field Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/activate-wfo-fsm.md).
-   Considers technician-demand channel association when **Enable Shift Scheduling for FSM to Determine Availability**, **Enable/disable association of territory resources with demand channels**, and territory model is enabled.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Dispatching** &gt; **Dispatcher Workspace**.

2.  Select **Dispatcher Workspace**.

3.  In the calendar, select a date to view an agent's schedule for that day.

4.  Select the white space that indicates the gap in the agent's calendar.

    The Recommended tasks dialog box displays the maximum five best available tasks for the agent. The tasks are arranged in descending order based on their recommendation score.

5.  From the Recommended tasks list, select the task that you want to assign to the agent.

6.  Select **Assign**.


### Result

The recommended task is assigned to the agent. The agent receives a push notification that the work order task has been assigned.
