# Example - configure dynamic scheduling to ignore excluded technicians

Add dynamic scheduling task filters to ensure that work order tasks are not assigned to agents who are excluded from the customer account.

## Before you begin

Ensure that dynamic scheduling is selected as assignment method for tasks.

Role required: wm\_dispatcher, wm\_manager, wm\_admin

## About this task

Dispatchers or managers can override exclusions at any time by manually assigning work order tasks to excluded technicians. A warning message appears that the work order task has been assigned to an excluded agent.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Dynamic Scheduling Administration** &gt; **Configuration**.

2.  Select **Work OrderTask Dynamic Scheduling Config**.

3.  On the **Task Filters** tab, add the **Ignore Excluded Technician** criterion to the task filters.

    For information on adding criteria to a task filter, see [Create a task filter for dynamic scheduling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-dynamic-scheduling-config.md)

4.  Select **Update**.

    The dynamic scheduling matching criteria screens out the excluded agents from a particular account when the work order tasks are assigned using any of the following methods:
