# Create an Appointment service configuration mapping

An appointment service configuration mapping contains the service configuration, service configuration rule, and territory for use in an appointment schedule.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_admin

Ensure that the Advanced Appointment Booking plugin is active. For more information, see [Activate Advanced Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/activate-adv-appt-booking.md).

Ensure you have already created a **Service Configuration**. For more information see, [Create or modify service configuration for Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/appt-booking-create-service-config.md).

## About this task

Through service configuration mapping, you can define the number of appointment slots, appointment window duration, and have flexible holiday schedules for a service or demand channels within a territory. You can configure multiple service configuration mappings for a service in a territory based on your organizational requirements.

For example, consider the service Point-of-Sale Installation. You can configure different holiday schedules and appointment slots for San Jose and San Francisco territories through service configuration mapping.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment service mapping**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

4.  <table id="table_nc3_s2r_zfc"><thead><tr><th>

## What to do next

Both a service configuration mapping and an appointment window configuration are required to create an Appointment schedule. For more information on appointment window configurations, see [Create an Appointment window configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-window-config.md).

If a service configuration mapping already exists, see [Create an Appointment schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-sched.md).
