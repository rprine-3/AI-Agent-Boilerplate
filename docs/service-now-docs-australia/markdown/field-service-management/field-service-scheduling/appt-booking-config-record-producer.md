Enable the appointment booking variable set to display the appointment selection widget on the record producer.

## About this task

A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that creates task-based records, such as appointment records, from the service catalog. Appointment booking supports both work order and task extended tables. You can use record producers to create the required task records before creating any appointment record. For more information, see [Record Producer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_RecordProducer.md).

The variable set **sn\_appointment\_variable\_set** adds Calendar component to the catalog and record producer.

3.  In the **Variable Sets** related list, click **Edit**.
