# Temporarily add agents to Dispatcher Workspace

You can add agents to Dispatcher Workspace. Adding agents makes it easy to quickly assign tasks to an agent who is part of the assignment groups or territories that you manage.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_dispatcher

## About this task

By default, dispatchers can only temporarily add agents that are part of assignment groups or territories they manage. Administrators can configure the add agents feature to enable dispatchers to add any agent, even those outside of the assignment groups or territories they manage. For more information see [Configure settings for Dispatcher Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configure-workspce-settings.md).

If an agent is added who is part of an assignment group or territory that you manage, then you can interact with them as any you do any agent in Dispatcher Workspace. If your administrator has enabled the ability to add any agent, even those outside assignment groups or territories you manage, then you can add the agent and see their schedule, but you can't assign them tasks.

**Note:** Adding agents doesn't apply to contractors, equipment, or crews.

Auto refresh, sorting, and go to assignment window work the same way for added agents as they do with regular agents.

If you use hide off shift agents with agents added, then the off shift agents still show in the added agents section. If you search for an agent with added agents, then the added agents section doesn’t show in the search results. After the search is cleared, the added agents section reappears.

There’s no impact to Schedule Optimization or route optimization when you temporarily add agents.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Field Service** &gt; **Dispatching** &gt; **Dispatcher Workspace**.

    **Note:**

    The agent shows at the top of the calendar in Dispatcher Workspace.
