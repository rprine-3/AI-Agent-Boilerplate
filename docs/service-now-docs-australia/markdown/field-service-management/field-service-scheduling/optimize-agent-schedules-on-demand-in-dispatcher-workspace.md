# Run optimization for your groups or territories from Dispatcher Workspace

Reassign tasks and maximize productivity by running Schedule Optimization on demand when scheduling conditions change.

## Before you begin

Schedule Optimization must be activated. For more information, see [Activate Schedule Optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/schedule-optimization-engine-plugin.md).

Intraday optimization must be configured. For more information, see [Configure intraday optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/configure-intraday-optimization.md).

Role required: schedule\_optimization\_user

## About this task

Schedule Optimization can be configured to run the optimization engine in batches overnight or at selected intervals throughout the day. This procedure describes how dispatchers can run optimization on demand from Dispatcher Workspace.

For more information on running the optimization engine automatically, see [Configuring Schedule Optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/schedule-optimization-engine.md).

Schedule Optimization considers the agent's start and end locations from the **Resource Schedule Attributes** table for the given day.

Schedule Optimization doesn’t detect changes you make to agents or tasks during an optimization run. The system considers changes to agents and tasks during the next optimization run. While an on-demand run is in progress, all scheduled runs are paused. The pause will remain in effect until the end of the day, and the scheduled runs will resume the next day.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Dispatching****&gt;Dispatcher Workspace**.

2.  Select **Dispatcher workspace**.

3.  Select **Optimization summary** in the contextual side panel.

4.  Select the pencil icon to edit the policy you want to use to run optimization.

5.  Select **Run optimization**.

6.  Select **Pause scheduled runs** to schedule tasks manually.

    **Note:** Schedule Optimization data doesn’t auto-refresh. Enable auto-refresh in the settings.
