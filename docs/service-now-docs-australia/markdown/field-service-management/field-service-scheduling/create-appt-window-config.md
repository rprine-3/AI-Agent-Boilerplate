# Create an Appointment window configuration

An Appointment window configuration defines the daily schedule for appointments, including start and end times, slot duration, breaks, and slot repetition intervals.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the Advanced Appointment Booking plugin is active. For more information, see [Activate Advanced Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/activate-adv-appt-booking.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment window configuration**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

4.  |Field|Description|

## What to do next

Both an appointment window configuration and a service configuration mapping are required to create an Appointment schedule. For more information on service configuration mappings, see [Create an Appointment service configuration mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-svc-config-mapping.md).

If a service configuration mapping already exists, see [Create an Appointment schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-sched.md).
