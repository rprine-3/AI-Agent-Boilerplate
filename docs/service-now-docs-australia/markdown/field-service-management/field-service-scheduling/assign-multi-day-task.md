# Assign multi-day tasks to agents

Assign a work order task that requires multiple schedules or days to complete the job to a field service agent. This capability avoids having to create more than one task for the same job.

## Before you begin

If you are scheduling a task across multiple schedule entries or days, a work schedule must have been assigned to the agent. For more information, see [Create a work schedule for agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-manager-workforce/create-agent-work-schedule.md).

**Note:** If the agent schedule has not been defined and you are auto-assigning a task, the system uses the default schedule.

Role required: wm\_admin
