# Activate Field Service Multi-Day Task Scheduling

Install the Field Service Multi-Day Task Scheduling application to enable scheduling of work order tasks across multiple days. You can activate the Field Service Multi-Day Task Scheduling plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_multiday\_tasks\) for Field Service if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

-   Field Service Multi-Day Task Scheduling requires you to install the Field Service Management plugin. For more information about activating Field Service Management, see [Activate Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ActivateFieldServiceManagement.md).

Role required: admin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Field Service Multi-Day Task Scheduling plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_multiday\_tasks\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).


## Result

The Field Service Multi-Day Task Scheduling plugin when activated successfully adds the following attributes:

-   The **Assign across the schedule entries** option is added to the work order task form.
-   The **sn\_fsm\_multiday.minDurationForFirstWorkSchedule** property is added to the Field Service Dynamic Scheduling Properties page. For more information about enabling a dynamic scheduling property, see [Properties installed with Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/r_PropInstallWFieldServMgmnt.md).
-   The **sn\_fsm\_disp\_wrkspc.dispatcher\_workspace.enableTwoAndFourWeeks** property is added to the Field Service Dispatcher Workspace set of properties. For more information about enabling a Workspace Settings property, see [Configure settings for Dispatcher Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configure-workspce-settings.md).
