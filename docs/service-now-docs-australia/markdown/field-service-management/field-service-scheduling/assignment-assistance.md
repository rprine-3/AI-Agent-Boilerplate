    |Skills|Sorts agents based on the number of required skills that each agent has. Agents with more skills are at the top.|
    |Parts|Sorts agents based on how many required parts each agent has. Agents with the most parts to complete the task are at the top.|
    |Earliest start time|Sorts agents based on how quickly they can start the work order task.|
    |Earliest end time|Sorts agents based on how quickly they can complete the work order task.|
