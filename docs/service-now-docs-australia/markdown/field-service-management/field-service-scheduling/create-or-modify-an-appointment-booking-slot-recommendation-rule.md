## About this task

Appointment Booking uses appointment slot recommendation rules to categorize the available slots for a service into recommended slots and available slots. Slot recommendation rules let you control how the appointment booking slots should be categorized.

An appointment slot is designated as a recommended slot if it meets the conditions defined in the rule.

By defining the rules, you can ensure that the appointment slots are well utilized based on your organization’s specific needs. Multiple rules can be created and applied in a sequence, based on execution order, to give you maximum flexibility and precision.

When seismic appointment booking Calender is activated, it uses these recommendation rules to display the recommended slots for a service.
