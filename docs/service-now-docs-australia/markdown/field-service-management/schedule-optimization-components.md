# Schedule Optimization components

Components installed with Schedule Optimization include tables, roles, constraints, objectives, and properties.

## Tables

Field Service Schedule Optimization adds the tables listed in the following table.

<table id="table_gbn_dgk_21c"><thead><tr><th>

Table

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Optimization Scope snc\_schedule\_optim\_optimization\_scope

</td><td>

Defines the qualifiers \(groups or territories\), tasks, and policies to be used during optimization.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Optimization Batch snc\_schedule\_optim\_batch

</td><td>

Defines the optimization schedule for one, or more scopes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Optimization Feature snc\_schedule\_optim\_optimization\_constraints

</td><td>

Defines the objectives and constraints to be used in optimization policies.-   Objective = soft target, optimizer tries to build a schedule that honors these goals
-   Constraint = hard rule, optimizer must build a schedule that honors these restrictions

 **Note:** This table is read only

</td></tr><tr><td>

Policies snc\_schedule\_optim\_policy

</td><td>

Container record for objectives and constraints that are used for optimization.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Policy Configurations snc\_schedule\_optim\_policy\_configuration

</td><td>

Related list table used to add objectives and constraints to a policy and to associate weights with objectives.-   Optimizer prioritizes adhering to the objectives with the highest weight.
-   Lower weight objectives are considered but might have less impact on the schedule

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scheduling Attribute Configuration snc\_schedule\_optim\_sched\_attr\_config

</td><td>

Defines global and qualifier-level settings for intraday optimization, including policy and travel estimate providers.-   "If Global is set to false, groups or territories can be added to a configuration to override optimization settings for a particular qualifier.
-   If Global is set to true, the settings apply to all other groups that don’t have an override.
-   A Global record also includes additional settings that cannot be overwritten at the qualifier level, such as the intraday processing window and flow.
-   Determines the travel estimate vendor for batch optimization.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Group Scheduling Attributes snc\_schedule\_optim\_group\_m2m\_sched\_attr\_config

</td><td>

Links a group to a scheduling attribute configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Territory Scheduling Attributes snc\_schedule\_optim\_territory\_m2m\_sched\_attr\_config

</td><td>

Links a territory to a scheduling attribute configuration.**Note:** This table is installed only if the FSM Territory plugin is active

</td></tr><tr><td>

Optimization Job Distribution snc\_schedule\_optim\_job\_distribution

</td><td>

Stores the distribution of Schedule Optimization jobs when qualifiers are split across multiple parallel jobs. Records are created based on qualifiers linked to batches and are automatically updated or inserted when batch qualifiers or scopes change.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Roles

Field Service Schedule Optimization adds the following roles.

<table id="table_zpq_bgk_21c"><thead><tr><th>

Role

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

schedule\_optimization\_user

</td><td>

User role for accessing the Schedule Optimization application. This role allows users to trigger on-demand schedule optimization executions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

schedule\_optimization\_planner

</td><td>

Planner role for the Schedule Optimization application. This role allows administrators to perform administration configurations for the Schedule Optimization application and perform schedule planning activities.Contains assignment\_rule\_admin role.

</table>-   **[Tables installed with FSM for Schedule Optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/tables-installed-with-fsm-for-schedule-optimization.md)**  
The following tables are installed with the Field Service Management plugin, but are only used by Schedule Optimization.
-   **[Objectives and constraints used with Schedule Optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/hard-soft-constraints.md)**  
Objectives and constraints are optimization features that determine how tasks are assigned to technicians in Schedule Optimization.
-   **[Schedule Optimization properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/schedule-optimization-properties.md)**  
You can set parameters that control how optimization runs.
-   **[Schedule Optimization integration user access requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/schedule-optimization-integration-user-access-requirements.md)**  
Describes the access requirements for the shared integration user account used by Schedule Optimization.
