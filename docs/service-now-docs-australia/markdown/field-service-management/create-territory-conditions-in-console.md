# Enable identification of relevant territories for a work order or work order task

Enable identification of the most relevant territories for work orders or work order tasks by setting matching rules and conditions.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_tp.fsm\_territory\_planner

## About this task

The Field Service Territory Planning configuration enables filtering of the most eligible territories for a work order or work order task. This configuration is stored in a matching rule that is based on the **Selection criteria** matching type.

The default configuration uses the **Field Service Territory Planning: Get eligible territories for Work Orders** and **Field Service Territory Planning: Get eligible territories for Work Order Tasks** matching rules, which use the following matching criteria:

-   Match Territory from Task Location
-   Filter based on Territory condition

You can also use matching rules for auto assignment if you create an assignment rule.

Create conditions to be able to filter and identify the most relevant territory for work orders or work order tasks.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Territory Planning** &gt; **Territory Planning Console**.

2.  In the Territories panel, select a territory from the Browse All list.

3.  Select the **Actions** icon \(\[Omitted image "more\_actions.png"\] Alt text: Actions icon.\) on the territory card and select **View Details**.

4.  Select **More** and then select **Territory Conditions**.

5.  Select **New**.

    4.  Select **Set**.

8.  Select **Save**.
