# Field Service Safety dashboard

Review the status of agents, tasks, and assets using the Field Service Management Covid19 map. Monitor the compliance reports of agents through the Field Service Safety dashboard.

**Important:** Starting with the Xanadu release, the Field Service Safety dashboard is removed from the Emergency Exposure Management app. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Users with the wm\_manager role can use the Field Service Safety dashboard to monitor whether agents are compliant with the safety protocols of possible exposure to an infectious disease while performing tasks. The Covid19 map displays the impact of COVID-19 on the locations that are covered by the agents, tasks, and assets of an individual Field Service manager.

To see the FSM Covid19 map on your Field Service Safety dashboard, install the free COVID-19 Global Health Data Set application.

## COVID-19 Global Health Data Set

You can use the COVID-19 Global Health Data Set application to see the Field Service Management Covid19 map on your Field Service Safety dashboard. The application appears as an application in the instance navigation menu. It displays global COVID-19 information on request in the Field Service Safety dashboard. The **COVID-19 Data Feed - pre-sync** and **COVID-19 Data Feed - sync central instance, Daily Data Collection** scheduled jobs run every night to refresh the data.

## Using the Field Service Safety dashboard

Navigate to **Field Service** &gt; **Safety Dashboard**.
