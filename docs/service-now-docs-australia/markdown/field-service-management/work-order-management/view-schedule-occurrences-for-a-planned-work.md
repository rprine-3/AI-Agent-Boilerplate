# View schedule occurrences for a planned work

A Schedule occurrence represents a single instance when a work order is expected to be created. Schedule occurrences are automatically created when a schedule is created or updated.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_planned\_wm.planned\_work\_admin

You must have configured a work schedule and attached a template to it. For more information see, [Configure a work schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/configure-work-plan.md).

## About this task

A schedule occurrence in Planned Work Management is a particular event within a repeating maintenance schedule. Each schedule occurrence is an automatically created record, representing one planned maintenance event as part of an ongoing schedule. It serves as a link between the maintenance plan and the work order that will be carried out. Schedule occurrences also helps in auditing the previous work orders for the maintenance plan.

For duration-based schedules \(**Trigger** in the work schedule is **Duration**\), the schedule occurrences are created immediately when a work schedule is configured.

For meter-based schedules \(**Trigger** in the work schedule is **Meter**\), the schedule occurrences are created only when the meter threshold is reached.

Schedule occurrences are numbered sequentially based on the creation order. Upon configuring the schedule, schedule occurrences with **Pending** state are created for the next immediate maintenance work required. Once the work orders for these schedule occurrences are created, the state is updated to **Scheduled** and new schedule occurrences for the next maintenance is generated.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Planned Work Management** &gt; **Plans**.

2.  Open a plan from the list of work plans.

3.  In the **Planned Work Schedules** related list, select the schedule for which you want to view the associated schedule occurrences.
