# Configuring Playbooks for Field Service Management

Playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for your field service teams to complete tasks. Use the playbooks feature to create processes to manage the life cycle of field service tasks.

A playbook breaks a workflow into multiple stages. Each stage includes the following:

-   A list of activities or steps that the agent must perform.
-   Status indicators that display the current state of each activity or step.
-   Check boxes and counters that indicate where an agent is in the workflow.

Playbooks are created using the [Process Automation Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md) platform feature.

## Playbooks for the ServiceNow Agent

Playbooks for the ServiceNow Agent application include stages for completing a work order task. Playbooks can be viewed under a selected work order task on the **My work** page. Tasks that have an active playbook associated with it display a **View Playbooks** button.

Playbooks are organized in stages to provide a guided experience. They direct you to new or existing features of the mobile application and maintain a checklist of completed stages on that work order task. Stages can be marked complete or skipped at your discretion. The stages progress as follows:

1.  Troubleshoot
2.  Parts
3.  Record time
4.  Log incidentals
5.  Verify work completion
6.  Close work order task
