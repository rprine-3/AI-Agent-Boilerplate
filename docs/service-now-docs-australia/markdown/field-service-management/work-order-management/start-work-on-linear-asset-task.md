# Start work on a linear asset task

Examine the linear asset specified in the work order task to pinpoint or select segments or areas in need of attention or maintenance, and generate a corresponding work order.

## Before you begin

Ensure the following setup:

-   The work order task is either in the **Work In Progress** or **Accepted** state.
-   Enable location tracking from your mobile device to record your location in the geo history table. For more information, see [Using location tracking for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-location.md).

Role required: wm\_agent

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the ServiceNow Agent application.

2.  Tap **My Work**.

3.  In the **My Tasks** section, display all the work order tasks by selecting **See All**.

4.  Select and open the desired work order task.

5.  View the linear asset segments to be inspected by tapping the **Related** tab and going to the **Assets** section.

    Each segment displays the asset name and a sequential number along with the start and location details.

6.  On the segment that you want to start inspecting, tap **Start Work**.

7.  Open the asset page and review the asset details by tapping the selected segment.

8.  View the linear asset segment on the map by tapping the Google Maps launcher icon \(\[Omitted image "mab-icon-launch-weblink-sol.png"\] Alt text: Google Maps launcher icon\) in the Start location field.

    The map launches and the linear asset location is displayed. The linear segment is highlighted in dark blue color for better identification.

    For more information, see [Complete a questionnaire for work order task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/complete-questionnaire-mobile-app.md).

10. If you identify an issue for a linear asset when inspecting a segment, create a new work order.

    1.  Tap **Create Work Order**.

    2.  Provide additional information related to the identified issue by uploading an attachment such as photo, image, or document in the **Add attachment** field.
