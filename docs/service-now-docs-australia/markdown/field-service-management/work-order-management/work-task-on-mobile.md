# Start work on a work order task

You can record both the time you begin traveling to the work site and the time you start the work.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_agent or wm\_dispatcher

## About this task

Administrators can configure the **wm\_notification.upcoming.task.reminder.minutes.before** system property to set the number of minutes before which a task reminder is sent. By default, you receive a notification 45 minutes before the work start time.

Administrators can enable push notifications in Studio. For information on setting up push notifications, see [Mobile push notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-push-notifications.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open the ServiceNow Agent application.

2.  Tap **My Work**.

3.  In the **My Tasks** section, click **See All**.

4.  Select the work order task you want to get started with.

    You can only start work on tasks that are in the **Accepted** state.

## Result

The following fields are updated in the work order task:

-   The work order task's state changes to **Work In Progress** to reflect that the task is actively being worked on.
-   The **Actual work start** field is automatically updated with the current system time, marking the beginning of the task.
-   The **Actual travel duration** field is automatically calculated by the system. It measures the time difference between the **Actual travel start** and **Actual onsite arrival** timestamps, unless manually set.
-   The **Actual onsite arrival** time is automatically populated as **Actual work start** date time when check-in is skipped.
-   The generated time card for the task's travel duration is stored under the **Time Worked** related list. This provides a record of the time spent traveling to the task location.
-   If the system properties `work.management.allow.auto.timecard` and `work.management.allow.travel.task.timecard` are enabled, time cards are automatically created. These time cards capture the duration of your work on the task, including the task's travel time.
