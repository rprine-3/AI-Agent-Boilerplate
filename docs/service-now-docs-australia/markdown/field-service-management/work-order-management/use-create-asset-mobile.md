# Track an asset for a work order task from a mobile device

Track the status of an asset that you used to execute a work order task or an asset that you removed or replaced by using the ServiceNow Agent application on a mobile device. You can track the status of these assets as you're doing the task from a task location.

## Before you begin

The work order task must be in the **Accepted** or **Work in Progress** state before you can do this procedure.

Role required: wm\_agent

## About this task

When you record the asset usage, the following actions occur:

-   The Use Part screen displays the assets in the Reserved Part and Available Part list in your inventory and shows the state as **In Stock** and the substate as **Reserved** and **Available**.
-   The Remove Part list displays the assets for all the companies and locations for the work order or work order tasks that you’re working on where the state of the part is **In Stock** and the substate is **Defective**.

## Procedure

1.  Open the ServiceNow Agent application.

2.  Tap **My Work**.

3.  In the My Tasks section, tap **See All**.

4.  Select the work order task that you want to track the assets for.

    The **Asset** field of the work order task inherits the asset details from its parent work order. If you add an asset to a work order, all its work order tasks are updated with the same asset details.

5.  View the parts used, the parts removed, and the part requirements for a work task by tapping **Parts**.

6.  Record information about the usage of an asset, the removal of an asset, or the replacement of an asset by tapping one of the following options.

    |Option|Details|
    |------|-------|
    |**Use Part**|Record the usage of an asset.|
    |**Remove Part**|Record the removal of an asset.|
    |**Swap Part**|Record the replacement of an asset.|

7.  Record the information about the usage or removal of an asset by tapping one of the following options.
