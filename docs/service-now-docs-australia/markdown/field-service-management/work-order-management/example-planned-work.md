# Work plan example

You can create a work plan to define a maintenance schedule for multiple assets based on their installation date.

The following image illustrates the maintenance plan for two assets installed on different dates.

\[Omitted image "planned-work-example.png"\] Alt text: Calendar view of a fifteen-year maintenance plan for installing multiple assets. Maintenance is planned every two years on the same date.

For example, A hospital has two MRI machines installed on different dates and hence follows a different life cycle. Create a flexible work plan for 15 years to provide the maintenance service to these assets at the following intervals based on their installation date:

-   Perform the first two warranty maintenance at the interval of 365 days from the date of installation.
-   After the first two warranty maintenance are over, perform maintenance every two years for the next eight years.
-   After ten years, perform maintenance every year.
