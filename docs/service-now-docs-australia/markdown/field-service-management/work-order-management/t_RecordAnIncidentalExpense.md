# Record an incidental expense

Record incidental expenses associated with your business travel through the Field Service application to execute work order tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, wm\_agent.

## About this task

Log incidentals to manage your expenses such as car rental cost, mileage, and vendor costs that you spend to execute your work order task at any point during the task life cycle. You can attach a receipt for a logged incidental.

For example, field service administrators might create an incidental in the Pending state before an agent begins work, based on an anticipated expense. Agents might create incidentals in the Incurred state as expenses arise during work.

Role required: wm\_admin or wm\_agent.

2.  Open a work order task for which you want to log incidentals.
