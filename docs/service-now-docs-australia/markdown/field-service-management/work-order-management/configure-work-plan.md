# Configure a work schedule

After creating a work plan, it’s important to define specific criteria to determine when the plan should be executed. This includes defining the start date and end date for the plan's execution. To create a flexible work schedule for the plan, you can configure multiple work schedules for it and assign them accordingly.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_planned\_wm.planned\_work\_admin and model\_manager

Create a work plan before configuring a work schedule for the plan.

## About this task

You can create a single schedule or multiple schedules for a work plan. For example, a flexible work schedule can be created for multiple assets that belong to the same work plan based on their installation date.

**Note:** Plan carefully when defining multiple work schedules for the same plan. For example, you set up one schedule to replace a printer cartridge every three months. You set up another schedule to replace the cartridge after every 10,000 pages is printed. This conflict could cause the cartridge to be replaced twice in the same week. Ensure that your schedules don’t conflict with one another.

You can also create planned work schedules through the Planned Work Management Workspace. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Planned Work Management** &gt; **Workspace**, and then select the **List** icon \(\[Omitted image "ListIcon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Planned Work Management** &gt; **Work Plans**.

2.  Open the work plan that you want to associate with a work schedule.

3.  In the **Planned Work Schedules** related list, select New.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Trigger

</td><td>

Timing condition that triggers the execution of the plan. -   **Duration:** work to be performed based on time. Depending on your selection, additional fields appear to define the duration.

-   **Condition:** Maintenance to be performed when a certain condition is met. The **Filter Condition** field appears.
-   **Script:** Apply advanced criteria for running a maintenance plan. The **Script** field appears.
-   **Duration or Meter:** Maintenance to be performed based on both time and count, whichever comes first. You must specify the duration and meter details.

With the Duration or Meter trigger selected, the **Next run time** and **Next run value** fields are populated in the Planned Work Records related list on the Work Plan form.

Select either Fixed or Floating to specify a particular day and month in a year to run the schedule. This field appears only when the **Trigger type** field is set to **Annually**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Note:**

    -   Configure the extension point sn\_fsm\_planned\_wm.PWMScheduleStartExtensionPoint to calculate the start date for the work schedule.
    -   For calculated work schedules, schedule occurrences are not automatically updated if changes are made to the extension point implementation after the schedule occurrence has been created.

</table>5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The schedule is created for a work plan. The Schedule Occurrences related list is added to the schedule to track the occurrence of maintenance cycles for the schedule.

The schedule occurrences are created automatically for duration-based schedules. However, if a different trigger option is selected for a schedule, the occurrence is created only when the specified condition or meter value is met. The creations of schedule occurrences depend on the effective end date. If no effective end date is specified, the application generates the next occurrence of the schedule.
