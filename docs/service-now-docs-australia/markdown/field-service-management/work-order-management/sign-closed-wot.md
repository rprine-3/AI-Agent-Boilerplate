# Sign on closed work order on the Contractor Portal

Customers can digitally sign and confirm work orders that are closed with the **Closed Complete** or **Closed Incomplete** state.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_ext\_agent and wm\_ext\_manager

You must enable the **Signature Capture**, **PDF Order Summary**, and **Use Document Template to generate PDF Summary** configuration options.

## About this task

When a work order is closed, you are notified with a link to the work order. Open the work order to request a signature from the customer.

**Note:** The work order closes only when all its related work order tasks are closed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service Contractor Portal** &gt; **Homepage**.

2.  Click **My Lists** &gt; **My Tasks** &gt; **All Tasks**.

3.  Open a work order task from the list that is in the Closed Complete or Closed Incomplete state.

4.  Click the Work Order Details related list in the **Work Order Task** form.

5.  Click the **Preview and Sign** button.

    The **Preview and Sign** option is available only if you have enabled the **Use Document Template to generate PDF Summary** configuration. Otherwise, the **Sign and Confirm** option is available, which enables you to capture the customer signature without showing any work order details.

6.  From the Work Order form, review the details.

7.  Sign the closed work order.

    -   To enter your name, click **Type signature**.
    -   To sign your name, click **Draw signature**.
8.  Click **Accept and Confirm**.


## Result

The signed PDF summary is generated and attached to the Work Order form.
