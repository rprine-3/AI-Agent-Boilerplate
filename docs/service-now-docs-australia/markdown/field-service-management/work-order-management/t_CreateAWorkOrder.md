# Create a work order

When off-site work is requested, create a work order to provide information for the agents who fulfill the request. You can create an entirely new work order, or you can create a work order from these other record types: problem, incident, change, or project task. You can also create a work order from another existing work order.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_initiator, wm\_initiator\_qualifier, or admin

Ensure to install the following plugins

-   Customer Service with Field Service Management \(com.snc.csm\_fsm\_integration\) to create case-related work orders from the Customer Service and Consumer Service Portals.
-   Customer Service Install Base Management \(com.snc.install\_base\) to create work orders against install base items, identify assets, configuration items \(CI\), or affected install base items.
-   Use roles such as wm\_location\_agent, wm\_location\_assignment.manager to restrict work order and task access based on the provider's service organization when the Work Management and Service Organization plugins are installed.

## About this task

-   In the work order, specify the nature of the work required and identify the configuration items \(CI\) affected.
-   To create work orders for common tasks such as the onboarding of new employees, you can use work order model templates to create all the necessary records automatically.
-   Restrict access to work orders and tasks so that users can only view and manage those assigned to their own service organization, ensuring sensitive information is securely managed within the appropriate organization.

## Procedure

1.  Create the work order.

2.  Enter a **Short description**.

Optionally, you can click the search knowledge icon \(\[Omitted image "SearchKnowledgeIcon.png"\] Alt text: Search knowledge icon.\) to view articles in the knowledge base relating to this product model, plan, or CI.

2.  Right-click the form title bar and select **Create Work Order**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    The work order is created in the **Draft** stage.

    If you created the work order from another record, the short description of the original record is copied as the short description of the work order. Some of the work order fields are auto-filled with information from the original record. For details, see [Prepare work orders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/preparing-work-orders.md).

## Result

The work order is created and awaits for qualification to create a work order task.

**Note:** You must enable the **Apply Work Order template in draft status** option and **wm\_task\_initiator** role to create tasks for the work order based on the applied template, without qualifying the work order when it is in the draft state. For more information about these configurations, see [Global domain configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ConfigureFieldService.md) and [Roles installed with Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/r_UserRoleInstallWFieldSrvMgmnt.md).

## What to do next

After you complete the Work Order form, move it to the next state that is [configured for Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/t_ConfigureFieldService.md). In the next state, other users with appropriate roles for the state will process the work order.
