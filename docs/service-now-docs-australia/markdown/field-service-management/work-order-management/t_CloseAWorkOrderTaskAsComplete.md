# Close a work order task as complete

Only agents can close work order tasks assigned to them.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_agent

## About this task

If the caller's problem was fixed or resolved, use the **Close Complete** option.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Agent** &gt; **Assigned to me**.

2.  Open a work order task.

3.  Add information to the **Work notes** field.

    The notes should include a description of the work done and any other helpful information.

4.  Enter a date and time earlier than the current date and time in the **Actual Work End** field.

    You cannot add a date and time later than the current date and time.
