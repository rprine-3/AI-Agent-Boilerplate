# Picking up parts

You can view a summarized list of transfer orders for all the assets that are waiting to be picked up physically.

## Pick up parts for your part requests

Pick up parts that you requested from peer agents that are ready for pickup and then close the transfer order line.

### Before you begin

The Field Service Advanced Parts Sourcing plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_advanced\_parts\_sourcing\) must be activated. For more information, see [Additional plugins for Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/field-service-additional-plugins.md).

## Pick up a part to complete tasks

When you are at a task site and need a missing part to complete your job, you can pick up the part by transferring it from an available stockroom.
