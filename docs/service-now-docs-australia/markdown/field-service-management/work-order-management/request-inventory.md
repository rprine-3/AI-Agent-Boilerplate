# Request inventory

Request inventory when your stock gets low or you need a part for a particular work order.

You can request parts from a peer's stockroom or warehouse. If you request parts from your peer agents, a mobile notification is sent to the peer agent from whom you requested the parts. Your peer agent can either accept or reject your request based on the part availability in their stockroom. If you request parts from warehouse, the transfer orders are automatically generated.

You can request inventory in two ways:

-   **Create part requirement**: Select and request a single part with or without the context of work order task.
-   **Create part request**: Select and request multiple parts from a single or multiple stockrooms directly or based out of existing part requirements.

### Result

-   If you have requested parts for a specific work order task, the Part Requirements and Transfer Orders related lists are updated automatically in the work order task form.

-   If the Field Service Advanced Parts Sourcing \[com.snc.fsm\_advanced\_parts\_sourcing\] plugin is activated and **Create part requests for part requirement sourcing** and **Use part request approvals** properties are enabled, you can view the following records.
