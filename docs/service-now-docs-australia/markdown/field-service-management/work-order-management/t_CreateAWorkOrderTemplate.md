# Create a work order template

Field Service Management uses the work order template as a source of information for populating fields in a work order.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin or model\_manager

## About this task

The work order template pre populates work orders with repeatable information. You can add fields, such as the Assignment group, during the template creation process. This enables you to create templates that work for both work orders and tasks, ensuring that consistent information is included across all related records.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following:

    -   **All** &gt; **Product Catalog** &gt; **Templates** &gt; **Work Order Templates**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Catalog &amp; Knowledge** &gt; **Work Order Templates**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Template Management** &gt; **Work Order Templates**.
2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Request information|
    |Name|\[Required\] Unique and descriptive name for this template.|
    |Short description|\[Required\] Content that is copied into the **Short description** field of a work order when this work order template is used. The exception to this is a work order created from an incident, problem, or change request, which always uses the short description of the source task, even when a template is applied.|
    |Description|More in-depth description of the purpose of the template.|
    |Checklist template|Select a checklist template to add a checklist to the work orders created from this work order template. For information on checklists, see [Checklists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_Checklists.md).|
    |Workflow|The workflow for work orders created from this template.|
    |Qualification group|The qualification group for work orders created from this template.|

4.  If desired, add a field to the Request Information section of the template:

    1.  Select **Edit fields** and select the field from the choice list.

    2.  Add a value to the field.

    3.  Select the gear icon next to the field and enable the **Show** option if you want this field to be displayed when this template is selected from the Field Service Catalog.

        If desired, enable the **Mandatory** option to make this a mandatory field.

5.  Select **Add Task** to add one or more tasks.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For fields in the Task Information section of the form, you can select **Copy Task Template** and add the information from a task template if desired.
