# Associate task plan template to a work schedule

Map a single or multiple task plan templates to a planned work schedule. Add conditions to identify the relevant templates for the planned work records.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_planned\_wm.planned\_work\_admin

## About this task

If you set the template type of a work plan to Task plan template, you can link its planned work schedules with task plan templates. For more information, see [Create a work plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/create-work-plan.md).

When the conditions specified in the Planned Work Schedule Task Template are met, tasks, cases, or incidents are created based on the defined task plan templates.

For example, to meet the monthly audit requirement of inspecting multiple stores of the same organization simultaneously, you need to create individual planned work schedules for each audit. Link each schedule to a different task plan template. Include relevant conditions in each planned work schedule template to ensure the correct template is applied when generating tasks specific to each audit.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Planned Work Management** &gt; **Plans**.

2.  Open a plan from the list of work plans.

3.  In the Planned Work Schedules related list, select a schedule to which you want to associate a task plan template.
