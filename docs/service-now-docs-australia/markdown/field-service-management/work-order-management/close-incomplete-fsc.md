5.  Tap **Close Incomplete**.

6.  Provide the reason in the **Closure Notes**.

    The Closure Notes information is copied to the **Activity Stream tab** in a work order task form.

7.  Automatically create a work order task to follow up on any pending work from the current work order task by enabling the **Create a Follow-up Task** option.

    The new work order task will be assigned to your group.

8.  Tap **Submit**.

    Confirmation messages are displayed depending on whether you enabled the **Create a Follow-up Task** option.

    -   If you have not enabled the option, the confirmation message `Task closed successfully` is displayed.
    -   If you have enabled the option, the message `You have 2 messages` is displayed. Tapping **View** on the message displays the success confirmation message and a message providing the number of the follow-on task that was created.

## Result

The task is closed. If you created a follow-up work order task, you can access it by navigating to **My work** &gt; **My group tasks**.
