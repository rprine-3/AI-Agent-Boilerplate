# Track the removal of an asset from a task location

Track the status of an asset that you removed in a work order. You can track the status as you're doing the task from the task location.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_agent

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Agent** &gt; **Assigned to me**.

2.  Open a work order task.

3.  In the Asset Usages related list, display the Asset Usage form by selecting **Remove Asset**.

    \[Omitted image "remove-asset.png"\] Alt text: remove asset button

    The **Service order task** field displays the task number of the work order, and that the status of the asset is set to **Removed**.

4.  In the **Model** field, select a model.

    The **Quantity** and **Asset** fields are enabled or inactive depending on what you selected in the **Model** field.

5.  In the **Quantity** and **Asset** fields, enter the information about your consumable and non-consumable assets:

    -   If the model is consumable, enter the quantity that was removed in the **Quantity** field.
    -   If the model is non-consumable, select the asset that is listed in the **Asset** field.
6.  In the **Drop off stockroom** field, select the drop-off location where you want to drop-off the asset.

    To learn more about the drop-off list, see [Using drop off lists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/c_UseDropOffLists.md).

7.  In the **Removed part status** field, select the status of the part that you want to remove.

    If the part is faulty, select **Defective**. If it's not faulty, select **Available**.

8.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The removed asset is added to the Asset Usages related list with a status of **Removed**.
