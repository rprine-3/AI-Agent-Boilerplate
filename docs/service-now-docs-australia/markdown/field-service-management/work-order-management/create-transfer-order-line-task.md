# Move an asset through the transfer process

Use transfer order line tasks to move assets through the shipment or drop-off transfer process.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_agent, wm\_qualifier, wm\_dispatcher, wm\_admin, or qualifier combination role

## About this task

Transfer order line tasks are created to move transfer order lines from one stage to the other. A transfer order line initially has one transfer order line task for completing the fulfillment. When you fulfill a asset requirement and close the task, the system automatically creates two transfer order line tasks: one to prepare for shipment and another one to drop off the asset.

Closing a transfer order line completes the task, moves the transfer order line task to the next stage, and creates the next task in the process until you close all tasks required for completing the transfer order line. For more information on the stages of transfer, see [Transfer order flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/transfer-order-flows.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Sourcing** &gt; **Sourcing Transfer Orders**.

2.  Select a transfer order to transfer the asset.

3.  From the **Transfer Order Line** related list, select a transfer order line.

4.  From the **Transfer Order Line Tasks** related list, select a transfer order line task that is ready for fulfillment.

    Eligible tasks have the short description text "Ready for fulfillment" and the state Open.

5.  Click **Close Task** to complete fulfillment and start the asset transfer process.

    The transfer order line task that was ready for fulfillment moves to the Closed Complete state.

    The system automatically creates two new transfer order line tasks:

    -   The short description text for the transfer order line task to prepare for shipment is "Prepare for shipment" and the state is Open.
    -   The short description text for the transfer order line task for drop off is "Receive" and the state is Open.
6.  Drop off or prepare for shipment.
