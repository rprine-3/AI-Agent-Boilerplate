## About this task

You can create a part requirement to request a part with or without the context of work order task.

    -   If you have the wm\_admin role, navigate to **Field Service** &gt; **Work Order** &gt; **All Work Orders**.
    -   If you have the wm\_agent role, navigate to **Field Service** &gt; **Agent** &gt; **Assigned to Me**.
    -   If you have the wm\_dispatcher role, navigate to **Field Service** &gt; **Dispatching** &gt; **Dispatch Queue** &gt; **.**
    -   If you have the wm\_qualifier role, navigate to **Field Service** &gt; **Work Order** &gt; **Awaiting Qualification** &gt; **.**.
2.  Open a work order.

3.  Open a work order task that is in the **Awaiting Qualification**, **Qualified**, **Assigned**, or **Work in Progress** state.

4.  Do one of the following.

<table><tbody><tr><td id="d48702e188">

**Click __Source__.**

</td><td>

All tasks and part requirements are listed on the left. Point to any task or part requirement icon to obtain more information. Right-click a work order task and select **Create Part Requirement**. This method is useful if you are sourcing multiple parts for a work order task.

    |Number|Auto-generated number for the part requirement.|
    |Work order task|Number assigned to the work order task.|
    |Model|Description of the part [model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/c_Models.md) needed to complete the work order task.|
    |Required by date|Date by which all parts should be delivered. The date is filled in automatically based on the task's expected travel start time. If necessary, change the date manually.|
    |Required quantity|Total quantity necessary to complete the part requirement. This field becomes read-only when the full number of required parts has been sourced.|
    |Reserved quantity|Total quantity that has been [sourced](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/t_SourceAPartAndAssignAnAgent.md) already.|
    |Sourced|Indicator for whether the required quantity for this part requirement has been reserved and transfer requested from one stockroom to another.|
    |Delivered|Indicator for whether the transfer order lines under this part requirement have been delivered or not.|

6.  Click **Submit**.

    If the part is out of stock, a message appears at the top of the form naming the part.

7.  If someone other than the qualifier will source the part requirement, [create transfer order lines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/create-transfer-order.md), move the part from a stockroom to an agent, and click **Qualified**.

    **Note:** Part requirement record numbers start with an **SOPR** prefix and the records are stored in the \[sm\_part\_requirement\] table in the Service Order Management application. Part requirements created in prior releases start with an **WOPR** prefix.
