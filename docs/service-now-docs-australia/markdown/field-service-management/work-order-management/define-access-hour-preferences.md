In the script, identify the attribute using the structure `workOrderTask.<attributeName> or workOrder.<attributeName>`. For example, you could determine the access hours of a task based on its priority. If the priority is 1, the script would return access hours 24x7 and if the priority is greater than 1, the script would return access hours 8-5 weekdays.

 This field appears only when Script is selected in the Type field.

The access hours are set to auto-populate in the work order task based on the customer preference at various levels.
