# Activate Field Service Questionnaire

You can activate the Field Service - Questionnaire plugin \(com.snc.wm\_questionnaire\) for Field Service if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

-   Ensure that the following plugins are activated before you install Field Service com.snc.wm\_questionnaire.
    -   **Required ServiceNow plugins**
        -   **Customer Service \(com.sn\_customerservice\)**
        -   **Customer Service Management Demo Data \(com.snc.customerservice.demo\)**
        -   **Field Service Management**

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Field Service Questionnaire plugin \(com.snc.wm\_questionnaire\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).


## Result

The Field Service Questionnaire plugin when activated successfully adds the Questionnaire module to the Field Service menu \(**Field Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Questionnaire**\).

## What to do next

Configure the form layout and add the **Assigned to** field to ensure that a questionnaire does not get created without an assigned agent.
