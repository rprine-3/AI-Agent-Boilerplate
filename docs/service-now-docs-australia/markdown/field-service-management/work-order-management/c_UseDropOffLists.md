# Using drop off lists

Agents use drop off lists to return items that are in their personal stockroom.

An item may need to be returned because it is defective or not needed to complete a work order task. Agents can create a drop off list of items to send the items to a different stockroom using a transfer order. Agents also have the option to physically drop items off at a stockroom and note the drop off in the Field Service Management application.

An asset must meet the following criteria to be added to an agent's drop off list:

-   Located in the agent's personal stockroom
-   **Drop Off** check box selected on the transfer order record
-   One of the following:
    -   Substate is **Defective**
    -   Asset was not used and the work order task is in **Closed Complete** state
