2.  Click **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields on the Work Order Template form, as appropriate.

    |Request information|
    |Name|\[Required\] Unique and descriptive name for this template.|
    |Short description|\[Required\] Content that is copied into the **Short description** field of a work order when this work order template is used. The exception to this is a work order created from an incident, problem, or change request, which always uses the short description of the source task, even when a template is applied.|
    |Description|More in-depth description of the purpose of the template.|
    |Checklist template|Select a checklist template to add a checklist to the work orders created from this work order template. For information on checklists, see [Checklists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_Checklists.md).|
