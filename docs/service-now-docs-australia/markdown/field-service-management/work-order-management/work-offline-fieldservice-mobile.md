# Working offline on ServiceNow Agent

When you are at a task site that doesn't have an internet connection, you can work on field service tasks, record time, track asset usage, create part requirements, and complete work orders and tasks using the ServiceNow Agent application.

## Run ServiceNow Agent in offline mode

Download field service data to the application cache and enable mobile offline mode to execute field service tasks at locations with no internet connection. Synchronize the data when your mobile device is online again.

### Before you begin

Role required: wm\_agent or wm\_dispatcher

### About this task

You can view a list of all actions taken when your device was offline and the time stamp for each action in the offline mode outbox. Generates flat data of agent schedules that are used in the mobile application for scheduled downloads of offline payloads. The administrator can also choose to download the cache automatically in the background by setting up the [system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/mobile-experience-for-field-service-management-glide-family/configure-field-service-mobile.md). This helps to at least give you one download of data at the beginning of the shift.

### Procedure

1.  Open ServiceNow Agent application.

2.  Log in to your Field Service application instance.

3.  Do the following: Tap the menu icon and select **Offline**.

    -   Tap **More**.
    -   Tap **Settings**.
    -   Tap **Offline**.
4.  To automatically download the scheduled cache in background, tap the **Enable** button.

    For more information, see [Scheduled offline caching](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/scheduled-offline-caching.md).

    Scheduled offline caching automatically downloads your cache according to your work schedule. Scheduled caching works in the background, so you can continue to use the application while the download completes. You can also enable **Wi-Fi only** to download cache when you are connected to Wi-Fi. This provides seamless synchronization when the device turns online.

5.  Do one of the following to download data and go offline.

<table id="choicetable_yld_hym_wfb"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d49614e209">

**Take the app offline when the data is downloaded.**

</td><td>

1.  Tap the **Offline Mode** button.
2.  Tap **Download cache &amp; go offline**.
 The app takes a few minutes to download the data and then takes the app offline. You can click **cancel** if you do not want to download data and go offline.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d49614e249">

    -   To stay online, tap **OK**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Update or clear cache on the mobile application.

    If you take your app online and then offline again, you can download the updated data to the app cache. You can clear the cache after you take the app online.

    -   To update the app cache, tap **Update cache**. The app reloads the data to the cache. Refer to the previous step to take the app offline.
    -   To clear the cache, tap **Clear cache**.
7.  Synchronize updated records.

You can close work order SLAs in offline mode. The Field Service mobile application records the device timestamp when the SLA was closed. After you connect your device online and synchronize the data, the SLA admin can repair the SLA to display the actual time the SLA was closed.

## Repair an SLA after closing a work order on ServiceNow Agent

Repair an SLA to capture the device timestamp that was recorded when an SLA was closed on the ServiceNow Agent application in offline mode.

### Before you begin

Role required: sla\_admin or admin

### About this task

Agents and dispatchers can close work-order SLAs when their mobile application is offline. The mobile application records the device timestamp when the SLA was closed. When the mobile application is online again and the data is synchronized, you can repair the SLA and capture that device timestamp. That reflects the actual time when the SLA was closed.

### Procedure

1.  In your desktop instance, navigate to **Field Service** &gt; **SLAs Updated Offline**.

2.  Perform one of the following actions:

    -   Select an SLA to repair.
    -   If you have more than one SLA to repair, select those SLAs.
3.  Click **Repair**.
