# Create planned work records

Create a list of planned work records based on the number of configured work schedules, matching records, or the number of templates mapped to the schedule.

## Before you begin

You must assign a schedule to the work plan. For more information, see [Configure a work schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/configure-work-plan.md).

Role required: sn\_fsm\_planned\_wm.planned\_work\_admin and model\_manager

## About this task

The planned work records are used by the Planned Maintenance Nightly Run schedule job to create work orders. For more information, see [Run a scheduled job to execute a planned work schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/run-schedule-job-planned-work.md).

Apply a work plan to the matching records and schedules to create planned work records. If multiple schedules are defined for a work plan, they all take effect on the matching records while creating planned work records. This same functionality exists for the work schedules that are used to apply the specific schedule to the matching records in the associated work plan.

You can also create planned work records through the Planned Work Management Workspace. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Planned Work Management** &gt; **Workspace**, and then select the List icon \(\[Omitted image "ListIcon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\).
