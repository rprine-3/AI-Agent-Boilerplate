# Task windows

A task window is the time period, bordered by start and end times, in which a task is performed.

Task windows can be flexible or fixed, and are used by the route optimization and auto-dispatch features when determining the daily schedule of staff members. A flexible window has start and end times that the application attempts to respect when dispatching or routing a task automatically. The system can reschedule a flexible task window if necessary, to make it fit into the schedule of a staff member. A fixed task window cannot be rescheduled. If the auto-router that optimizes task routes or the auto-dispatcher cannot schedule the task for the fixed window time period, that task is not scheduled at all. The time interval configured for a window cannot be less than the time required to perform the task.
