# Manage work orders

Work orders are requests for off-site work. Users with the appropriate roles create the work orders and provide the necessary information needed for the work order tasks. Then other users qualify those work orders and create the tasks necessary to complete the work order.

## Creating work orders

If you have the wm\_initiator or wm\_initiator\_qualifier role, you can create work orders. You can create entirely new work orders, or you can create a work order from another record.

Work orders can be created from these other record types: case, incident, change, problem, or project task. They can also be created from another existing work order. For each record, you can create only one work order.

-   **Work orders created from another existing work order**

    If the scope of an existing work order changes during the execution phase, you can create another work order from it. Analyze whether the scope change can be managed by adding additional tasks instead of creating another work order.

    When you create a work order from an existing work order, the following information is copied from the original work order:

    -   Work order record reference \(in the **Initiated from** field\)
    -   Affected CI
    -   Caller
    -   Location
    -   Priority
    -   Short description
    -   Description
    Because some information is copied from the original record, an existing work order can be used as a template to create new work orders.

-   **Work orders created from an incident, problem, change, or project task record**

    If an incident, problem, change record, or project task must be assigned to an off-site agent and tracked, you can create a work order from it. Some information from the original record is copied automatically into the new work order.

</table>    Work orders can be filtered based on different attributes, such as qualification group, location, initiated from, priority, state, and so on. This help to create a group of similar work orders.
