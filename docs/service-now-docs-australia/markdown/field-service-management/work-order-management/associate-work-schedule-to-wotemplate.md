# Associate work order template to a work schedule

Map a single or multiple work order templates to a planned work schedule. Add conditions to identify the relevant templates for the planned work records.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_planned\_wm.planned\_work\_admin and model\_manager

## About this task

For example, to fulfill the maintenance requirement of two MRI machines from different brands, at the same time. You must create a schedule for these machines and then map it to different work order templates. Add conditions so that the schedule can identify the appropriate template to generate work orders that are specific to each MRI machine.

**Note:** When grouping of work orders is enabled for a work plan, you can add conditions only on the fields that are selected as criteria for grouping of work orders. For more information, see [Add grouping criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/work-order-management/add-grouping-criteria.md).
