# Activate Resource Scheduling

You can activate the Resource Scheduling plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_resource\_scheduling\) for Field Service Management if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

Field Service Resource Scheduling requires the Field Service Crew Operations \(com.snc.fsm\_crew\_scheduling\) plugin. For more information about activating Field Service Crew Operations, see [Activate Field Service Crew Operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/activate-fsm-crew-scheduling.md). Ensure that these plugins are activated before you install Field Service Resource Scheduling.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Field Service Resource Scheduling plugin \(com.snc.fsm\_resource\_scheduling\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, click **Load demo data**.

    Demo data comprises sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

4.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
