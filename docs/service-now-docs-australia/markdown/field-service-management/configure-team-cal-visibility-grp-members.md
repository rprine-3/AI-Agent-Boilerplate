    If you don't see the **Type** field, click the gear icon to configure the form and add this field.

3.  Add the group type.

    |To|Do This|

    |**Make all members in the group visible to other members in the group.**|Select **schedule\_visible\_internally**.|
    |**Make all members in the group visible to all groups.**|Select **schedule\_visible\_externally**.|

    The "sn\_shift\_planning.agent" role is required for an agent's schedule to be visible in the Team calendar in Workforce.
