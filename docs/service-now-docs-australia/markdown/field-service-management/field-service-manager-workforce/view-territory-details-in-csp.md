# View territory information in contextual side panel

The contextual side panel offers valuable insights and easy access to territory information, helping you make well-informed decisions and efficiently manage your territories.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_fsm\_tp.fsm\_territory\_planner, sn\_fsm\_tp.fsm\_territory\_manager, sn\_fsm\_tp.fsm\_territory\_read

## About this task

The contextual side panel provides comprehensive details about territories, markers, shapes, and heatmaps. Administrators can configure the displayed fields to show precisely the information needed. For more information, see [Configure territory fields to appear in Territory Planning console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configure-fields-to-appear-in-contextual-side-panel.md).

In the contextual side panel:

-   Clicking on a map marker icon representing a single data item displays the specific details of that data item.
-   Clicking on a co-located marker icon representing multiple data items, lists all the associated data items in the contextual side panel. To view specific details for each record, select the individual items.
-   Use the condition builder to further filter the data items. For example, add a condition to display only active work order tasks.

Territory Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) offer valuable insights into the performance of territories. The contextual side panel displays the KPIs for the territory. When your administrator activates the Performance Analytics - Content Pack - Field Service Management plugin. The KPIs configured in the `TerritoryIndicators (sn_fsm_tp.TerritoryIndicators)` extension point appear in the contextual side panel.
