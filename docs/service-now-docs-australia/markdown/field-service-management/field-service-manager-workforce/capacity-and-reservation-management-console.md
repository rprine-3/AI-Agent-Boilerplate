# Using the Capacity Console

The Capacity Console is a tool designed for monitoring, managing, and optimizing resource capacities across territories and demand channels.

It provides an intuitive, visual representation of capacity utilization, empowering capacity planners to make data-driven decisions and improve operational efficiency.

**Note:** To use Capacity Console, you must activate the following:

-   Field Service Advanced Capacity and Reservations management \(com.snc.fsm\_advanced\_capacity\_management\) plugin. For more information, see [Activate Field Service Advanced Capacity and Reservations management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/capacity-console-plugin.md).
-   Field Service territory model. For more information, see [Enable the Field Service territory model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/enable-territory-model.md).

-   **Comprehensive capacity view**

    The Capacity Console offers a detailed and visual overview of capacity utilization. Key views include:

    -   Territory view:
        -   Displays resource capacity data for specific territories, with impacted demand channels listed underneath. For more information, see [Create a Field Service territory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/create-territories-territory-planning-console.md).
        -   Provides insights into planned, allocated, and forecasted capacities.
    -   Demand channel view:
        -   Highlights demand channels at the top, with impacted territories listed underneath. For more information, see [Create a demand channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/create-a-demand-channel.md).
        -   Offers visibility into demand channels and their associated capacities.
-   **Customizing the Capacity Console**

    Tailor the Capacity Console to align with your organization’s needs.

    -   Set thresholds: Define thresholds for capacity utilization quickly to identify areas needing attention. The following are the example thresholds. However, you can customize them as your business terminology and needs.

        -   Underutilized: Below capacity limits.
        -   Optimalutilized: Efficiently using resources.
        -   Overutilized: Exceeding capacity limits.
        **Note:** You can also customize color codes and legend labels to match your business terminology and clear categorization.

    -   Save filter preferences: Save your chosen filter settings for quick and easy access in future sessions.
    -   Customize calendar capacity data parameters: Update the calendar to prioritize specific metrics:
        -   Replace existing metrics by customizing the fields shown on events \(for example, "Used Capacity" with "Unused Capacity"\). You can also customize the summary operator used in the event \(for example, replace "+" with "-", "\*", or "/"\).
        -   Add new fields using the **Application Field Set**: Capacity Console events fields. For more information, see [Activate Field Service Advanced Capacity and Reservations management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-field-service/capacity-console-plugin.md).
-   **Refining data with the filters**

    Customizable filters at the top of the console enable for tailored data views.

    -   Default Filters: Preselected filters display the most relevant data for quick insights.
    -   Custom Preferences: Adjust and save filters to suit specific business needs.
        -   Territory filter: Focus on specific territories to understand their capacity and demand.
        -   Demand channel filter: Refine data by additional parameters like demand channels.
        -   Group By filter: Group data by demand channel or territory.
        -   Unit filter: View capacity in terms of hours or tasks \(for example, focusing on underperforming territories for a given week\).
        -   Advanced filter: Use thresholds to analyze data. Example, selecting **UnderUtilized** displays capacities below 25%.
-   **Calendar features**

    The calendar in the Capacity Console provides flexible options to view and analyze data over time:

    -   Flexible Date Ranges: Adjust calendar settings to view data for specific timeframes, enabling better planning and trend analysis.
    -   Default Views:
        -   Week view
        -   Two-Week view
    -   Manual refresh required: Actions that impact calendar data, such as changes made in the Capacity Console or platform, require a manual refresh to display the latest data.

## Use cases

The following are a few use cases for the Capacity Console

-   Resource allocation: Identify underutilized territories using filters and reassign agents from low-demand territories to nearby high-demand territories.
-   Demand analysis: Use the Two-Week View to forecast future demand and make proactive resource adjustments to meet anticipated needs.
-   Advanced filtering: Focus on overutilized territories to resolve bottlenecks and Analyze optimally used territories to maintain efficiency.
-   Demand channel insights: Analyze capacity and demand metrics from a demand channel perspective and provide tailored data views for specific customer needs.

## Visual overview of the Capacity Console

The following snapshot illustrates the Capacity Console, showcasing:

-   Territories \(for example, Aurora and Chicago\).
-   Demand channels \(for example, Copper Install and Copper Repair\).
-   Weekly capacity metrics, including demand, allocated capacity, and unused capacity.
