# Create an on-call shift plan in Workforce Optimization for Field Service

Schedule shifts for your team so that you can make sure that you are covering all work assignments and breaks. You can also specify the days of the week that you might need to override scheduled shifts.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Click the Schedule \(\[Omitted image "schedule-new.png"\] Alt text: Schedule icon.\) icon.

3.  Click the **Shifts** tab.

4.  In the contextual side panel, click the Show Shifts Plans \(\[Omitted image "show-schedule-new.png"\] Alt text: Show Shift Plans icon.\) icon to display the schedules.

5.  Click the Create Work shift plans or On-call shifts \(\[Omitted image "add.png"\] Alt text: Add Shift Plan icon.\) icon.

6.  Create the on-call shift.

    1.  Click **On-call shift**.

    2.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the shift.

    3.  From the **Group** field, select a group that you want to assign for the shift.

    4.  Select the time window for the shift by entering values in the **Start time** and **End time** fields, and selecting the time zone in the **Time zone** field.

    5.  Select the days of the week for which you want to apply the shift.

    6.  In the **Rotation start date** field, click the calendar icon, select the on-call rotation start date for the shift and click **OK**.

    7.  Click **Save**.

7.  Create the on-call rotation.

    1.  Select the shift that you created.

    2.  Click **Create Rotation**.

    3.  From the **Agents** field, select the names of the agents you would like to be part of the shift from the list of all agents that belong to the group that the on-call shift is being created for.

    4.  From the **Rotate interval** field, select whether you want the rotation to be daily or weekly.

    5.  Click **Save**.

    **Note:** The **Escalation Type** field is auto-populated with the **Rotate through rosters** field value if multiple rosters have been created for the rotation. Otherwise, it is populated with **Rotate through members** field value.

8.  Click **Publish** to make the shift active and publish it on the schedule.

    To make an active on-call shift inactive and remove it from the schedule, you can click **Unpublish**.

9.  View all on-call shifts that have been published on the schedule in the agent and team calendar.

    When you add new agents to the on-call rotation, it might take some time to refresh the data on the team calendar.
