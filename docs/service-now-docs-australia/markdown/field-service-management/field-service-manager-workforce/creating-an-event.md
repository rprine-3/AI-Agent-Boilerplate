# Create a personal event

Enable agents and managers to efficiently schedule events, including time off and appointments, through Workforce. Additionally, managers have the capability to organize meetings and schedule time off and training.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_agent, wm\_manager

## About this task

Agents can only create personal events for themselves, while managers can create events for anyone they manage. Events created by an agent can only be edited or deleted by that agent. Managers cannot modify or delete events created by agents. However, when a manager creates an event for an agent, the manager can edit or delete that event.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workforce**.

    -   Managers, navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Manager** &gt; **Workforce**.
    -   Agents, navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Agent** &gt; **Workforce**.
    -   If Workforce Optimization is installed and activated, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace** &gt; **Workforce**.
2.  Click the **Event Management** icon in the right side panel.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

4.  Click **Save.**

    **Note:**

    When an event is created in Workforce, its data is stored in the **`cmn_schedule`** table, and the associated time spans are stored in the **`cmn_schedule_span`** table.

    -   **`cmn_schedule`** contains the overall schedule record for the event.
    -   **`cmn_schedule_span`** stores the individual time segments that define the event’s duration.
    To verify that an event has been successfully created, check for its record in the **`cmn_schedule`** table and confirm that the corresponding spans exist in **`cmn_schedule_span`**.
