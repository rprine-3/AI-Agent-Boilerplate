Analyze planned vs. actual scheduling for your team members

</td><td>

1.  Click the **Team Calendar** tab.
2.  Select the date.
3.  View the **Time Worked** summary by clicking on the bar representing the agent's actual time worked.
 **Note:** The clock-in and clock-out timings are the actual work timings of your agents. The events are generated based on the agent's login, logout actions, and presence state. If an agent forgets to clock out, the system automatically generates the clock-out event after 60 minutes by default. However, your administrator can change it using **Default threshold time for clock-out event generation \(in Minutes\)** system property.

Example: A clock-in event gets generated when an agent logs in or changes the presence status to **Available**. Similarly, a clock-out event gets generated when an agent logs out of the system or changes the presence status to either Offline or Break. If an agent fails to clock-out past 60 minutes of the shift end time, the system automatically generates the clock-out event.

</table>    The following team calendar snapshot illustrates how to measure how well your team members are adhering to their work schedules. The blue bar indicates the planned work shift time and next to that is the actual worked time. The default representations are purple for clock-in time, green for agent's available duration, red for the clock-out time, and grey for agent's non-available time.
