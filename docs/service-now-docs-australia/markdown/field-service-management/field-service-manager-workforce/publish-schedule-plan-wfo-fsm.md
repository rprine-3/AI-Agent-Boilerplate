# Publish a schedule plan for visibility into team coverage

Generate a preview of your schedule plan and publish it so that your agents can see their shifts and schedules ahead of time. You can unpublish a schedule to make changes and then publish it again.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.admin

## About this task

You can make a copy of a schedule and update it to create a new schedule. Updates could include modifying the schedule start and end dates as well as adding or removing shifts or agents.

When you make a copy of the schedule, the following updates are automatically made to the schedule copy:

-   The start date is set to the current date and the end date to 30 days from the current date.
-   The schedule state changes to Draft. You can make the necessary changes to the shift and click **Save**.
-   The schedule only displays agents in the assignment group of the current logged in user.

You can also unpublish a schedule make updates, and then publish it again.

-   If the start date is the either the current date or had occurred in the past, the schedule state remains as Published and the end date changes to tomorrow.
-   If the start date is in the future, the scheduler changes the schedule state and agent schedules to Draft.

**Note:** If you no longer need a schedule in Draft state, you can click **Delete** to delete it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Click the Schedule icon \(\[Omitted image "schedule-new.png"\] Alt text: Schedule icon.\).

3.  Generate a schedule preview.

    1.  Click the **Team Calendar** tab.
    2.  Click the Show Schedules icon \(\[Omitted image "show-schedule-new.png"\] Alt text: Show Schedules icon.\) in the contextual side panel.
    The team calendar refreshes and generates the preview when you save a work shift.

4.  Publish a schedule.

    1.  Select a schedule and edit it if necessary.
    2.  Edit the schedule if necessary and click **Save**.
    3.  Click **Save**.
    4.  Click **Publish**.

## Result

All the schedules that are in Draft state move to the Published state. You can view the published schedule in the team calendar.
