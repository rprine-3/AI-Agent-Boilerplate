# View territory and demand channel summary in the contextual side panel

The Capacity Console provides a comprehensive summary of territories and demand channels, enabling capacity planners and managers to make informed decisions about resource allocation and management.

## Before you begin

## About this task

When you select an event in the calendar or a specific data row, the contextual side panel \(CSP\) automatically appears on the right side of the screen. This panel provides a dynamic, context-specific interface, displaying relevant information and actionable options tailored to the selected event or capacity data row. It streamlines workflows by offering quick access to key details and actions without requiring navigation to other screens.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSM/FSM configurable workspace** &gt; **Capacity console**.

2.  View territory or demand channel summary.

## Result

The contextual side panel opens to display summaries tailored to the selected context, providing key information and enabling actionable insights for users. Depending on the selection, the CSP may display:

-   Territory summary: Provides detailed information about the selected territory, including metrics such as the number of assigned agents, capacity assignment type, or available hours in the specified period based on the capacity definition type of that capacity assignment. This summary supports capacity planners in making informed decisions.
-   Demand channel summary: Displays an overview of demand channel details, including reservation and calculated capacity value for the selected period.

## What to do next

You can change the capacity value and reservation in the contextual side panel.
