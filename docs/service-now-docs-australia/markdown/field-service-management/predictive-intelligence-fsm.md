# Predictive Intelligence for defining work order solutions

Use your instance records to build solutions to Field Service Management issues.

## Solution definitions

Solution definitions are available as templates on instances where both Predictive Intelligence and Field Service Management are active. For more information about solution definitions and their types, see [Predictive Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/predictive-intelligence.md).
