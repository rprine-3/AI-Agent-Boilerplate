# Setting up Field Service in CSM Agent Workspace

Activate Field Service in CSM Agent Workspace and set up roles for performing the tasks.

**Important:** Starting with the Vancouver release, Legacy FSM Agent Workspace is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. The Field Service Management Configurable Workspace \[com.snc.uib.fsm\_agent\_workspace\] provides the latest experience for this functionality. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Activating Agent Workspace

Activate the following plugins:

-   Customer Service with Field Service Management plugin \[com.snc.csm\_fsm\_integration\] to enable account, contact, partner, partner contact, consumer information from Customer Service to Field Service Management.
-   Field Service Management plugin \(com.snc.work\_management\) to provide support for scheduling and managing on-location work tasks.
-   FSM Agent Workspace plugin \(com.snc.agent\_workspace.fsm\) is activated when you enable the Field Service Management plugin \(com.snc.work\_management\) or the Customer Service with Field Service Management plugin \[com.snc.csm\_fsm\_integration\].
