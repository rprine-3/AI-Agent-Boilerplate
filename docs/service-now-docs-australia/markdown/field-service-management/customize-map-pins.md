# Change the assigned graphics of map pins on the map in Dispatcher Workspace

Customize map pins so your dispatch map shows unique graphics relevant to dispatcher work.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin

## About this task

You can change map pins related to agents, and task states. You can’t change pins that indicate task priority.

New icon pin graphics should be sized at 54x54 pixels in PNG or SVG format.

For a list of map pins that show on the dispatch map, see [Map iconography in Dispatcher Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/r_DispatcherView.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator, search for `Images` and select **System UI** &gt; **Images**.

2.  In the **Name** search field, type `*sn_fsm_disp_wrkspc`.

3.  Select the name of the pin that you want to update.

    If you think you might want to use the existing graphic later and it is not already stored on your system, right-click the graphic and save it.

4.  Select **here** if you see a message about editing the Global application.

5.  In the **Image** field, select **\[Update\]**.

6.  Select **Choose File** and find the graphic you want.

7.  Select **Open**.


## Result

The new graphic replaces the previous map pin graphic.
