## About this task

By default, each work order task state is represented with a specific color. You can change colors for existing work order task states or define a color for a new state. The assigned work order state colors appear in the task card and calendar of Dispatcher Workspace.

You can display events in their selected default color on Dispatcher Workspace calendar by configuring the **sn\_fsm\_disp\_wrkspc.agent\_shift\_schdlng\_event\_color** property. Different events can be created in the Workforce Optimization for Field Service application, such as agent's break, time-off, and more.
