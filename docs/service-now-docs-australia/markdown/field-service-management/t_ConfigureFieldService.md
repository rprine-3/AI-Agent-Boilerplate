# Global domain configurations

Administrators in the global domain can select configuration settings that determine how Field Service Management handles daily operations.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin

## About this task

Administrators in the global domain can set Field Service Management configurations to:

-   Include or exclude portions of the request process. For example, you can require a work order to be approved before continuing to the next stage.
-   Automatically assign tasks using a custom-defined workflow, or leave it up to dispatchers to manually assign tasks from the work order task form.
-   Track agent travel time.

The Field Service Configuration screen contains many configuration options. An option is enabled when the switch appears green and is toggled to the right. All configuration options listed in the **Dependency** must be enabled in order for the option to be displayed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Configuration**.

    **Note:** Administrators in domains lower than the global domain can view the Field Service Configuration screen, but cannot modify the settings.

    The options on the Field Service Configuration screen are arranged in a multiple-tabbed layout, as follows:

    -   The **Business Process** tab contains options for setting up the request life cycle, creating catalogs and requests, and configuring notifications.
    -   The **Assignment** tab contains options for setting up manual and auto-assignment.
    -   The **Add-ons** tab contains options for enabling the knowledge base, managed documents, and task activities.
2.  Fill in the fields on the **Business Process** tab.

    The field **Agent must accept or reject the assigned task** applies to both internal and external Field Service agents.

Process life cycle

</td><td>

By default, the process life cycle is set to task-driven which supports workflows on work order tasks for Dispatcher Workspace, FSM Mobile, and Schedule Optimization.

 Starting with the Xanadu release, the request driven process life cycle is no longer supported. Only users with the maint role have the option to change the Process life cycle to **request driven \(subtasks are optional\)**. Request driven doesn't require tasks to fulfill requests. When the process life cycle is request driven, requests can be directly assigned to users in an assignment group. Users can still add tasks to requests. However, closing all tasks does not automatically close the request.

**Note:** If the **Enable state flows** option is not selected, the process life cycle becomes **request-driven** and this field is not displayed.
