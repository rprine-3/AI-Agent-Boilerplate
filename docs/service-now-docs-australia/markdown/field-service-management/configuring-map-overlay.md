# Configuring a map overlay

Configure a map overlay to view its corresponding data items in the territory map.

Map overlays allow you to view data items in the context of a territory map. By setting up overlays, you can visualize data points as markers, shapes, or heatmaps on the map, providing valuable insights into spatial distribution.

## Types of Map Overlays

Supports three types of map overlay data items:

1.  Marker Layer: Represents individual data items with distinct markers on the map. Marker layers are useful for pinpointing specific assets, locations, or points of interest.
2.  Shape Layer: Allows the creation of custom shapes like polygons or lines on the map, which is valuable for defining boundaries or illustrating routes.
3.  Heatmap: Provides a visual representation of data density or intensity, helping identify areas with higher concentrations.

## Create a marker layer overlay for agents

To create a marker layer overlay specifically for agents, do the following:

1.  Add a map overlay data item for assets by linking the Agents database table.
2.  Set up map marker icons to visually identify single and multiple agents on the map.
3.  Create an info window field set to configure the fields displayed in the contextual side panel when clicking a map marker.
4.  Create an overlay definition for agents by linking the data item, map marker icons, and info window field set.
5.  Link the agents group and the agents overlay definition in the group usage table.

The following snapshot displays data related to multiple layers and heatmap in the Territory Planning console. \[Omitted image "tp-console-csp.jpg"\] Alt text: Territory Planning console displaying layers information such as agents, assets, and crews and a heatmap for work order tasks.

## Viewing and filtering data

-   Use the snapshot or map view to gain insights into relevant territory information, including agents, crews, and work order tasks across territories.
-   Utilize data filter options to narrow down the displayed information based on viewport or territories.
    -   Viewport: In this view, individual markers representing each agent are prominently shown, providing a comprehensive understanding of their spatial distribution.
    -   Territory: Alternatively, the territory-based data view allows you to filter and display agents specifically associated with selected territories, providing a focused analysis of agent distribution within those areas.

## Multiple overlay selection

You can manage and control multiple map overlays. Toggle between overlays to tailor your display and optimize your mapping workflow.

## Configuration overview

The steps for configuring a map overlay are:

-   [Create a marker layer overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md)

    Create a marker layer overlay to specify the data items associated with the markers on a map. You can set up markers for assets, locations, or points of interest.

-   [Create a shape layer overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md)

    Create a shape layer to create custom shapes, such as polygons or lines, on a map. This type of overlay is useful for defining boundaries, illustrating routes, or highlighting specific geographic areas of interest.

-   [Create a heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md)

    Create a heatmap to provide a visual representation of data density or intensity on a map using colors. A heatmap can help you identify areas with higher concentrations of data, highlight hotspots, and find patterns in data distribution.

-   [Create map marker icons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md)

    Create custom map marker icons for the marker type overlay to identify selected data item as either a single entity or multiple entities at the same location in the territory.

-   [Create info window field set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md)

    Create Info window field set to retrieve the field data from the database and display on a card when a marker is clicked on a map.

-   [Create a map overlay definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md)

    Create a map overlay definition to link data items, info windows, and marker icons for clear visual representation on the map. This allows users to easily view and filter map data.

-   [Link overlay group and overlay definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md)

    Establish a link between the overlay group and overlay definition in the group usage table to ensure the overlay definition is displayed in the Territory Planning console.

This is useful for emphasizing specific data points or when adding a large amount of data at a single location for faster rendering.For example, you can have the priority field in the work order task to showcase the weight of a particular location.

**Note:** This field appears only for the heatmap and only when the **Advanced** field isn’t selected.

</table>4.  Change the color gradient of the visualization using the Heatmap Gradient \(sn\_cmn\_mo.HeatmapGradient\) extension point.

    For more information, see [Extension points in Field Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/extension-points-field-service.md).

5.  Change the opacity level and the radius that influence the data point in the heatmap.

    For more information, see [Field Service Territory Planning console properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/territory-planning-components-fsm.md).

6.  Create a map overlay definition, link the overlay definition and data item.

For more information, see [Link overlay group and overlay definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md).

8.  Select **Submit**.

    The heatmap is created.


### Result

The following example shows how agents as markers and a heatmap for work order tasks. Agents are marked on the map, and the heatmap shows task intensity. It helps you easily see agent locations and the density of work order tasks.

By using this combined approach, you can assess the spatial distribution of agents and gain insights into the workload based on the intensity of work order tasks. Select the map marker or heatmap to view the details in the right contextual side panel.

    |Highlighted Icon|Select an icon to be displayed as a highlighted marker when the user clicks on it.|

4.  Select **Submit**.

    The map marker icon is created.


### What to do next

Once the map marker icons are created, you can link them to the overlay definition to identify the data items as single entities, multiple entities, or a combination at the same location on the map. For more information, see [Create a map overlay definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/configuring-map-overlay.md).
