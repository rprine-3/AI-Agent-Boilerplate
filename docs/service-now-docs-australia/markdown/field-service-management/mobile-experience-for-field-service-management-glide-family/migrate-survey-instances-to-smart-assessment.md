# Migrate survey instances to Smart Assessment

When you migrate a survey-based questionnaire to Smart Assessment, migrate all the associated instances of a survey to Smart Assessment and re-trigger them.

## About this task

Migrate survey instances for questionnaires to Smart Assessment by manually running the job **Migrate survey instances to smart assessments**.

This job migrates all instances of a survey to Smart Assessment and re-triggers the instances.

Smart Assessment uses the Smart Assessment Engine to migrate survey instances to Smart Assessment. For more information, see [Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-asmnt-engine-landing-page.md).

**Note:**

-   Survey instances in **Work in progress** state can't be migrated.
