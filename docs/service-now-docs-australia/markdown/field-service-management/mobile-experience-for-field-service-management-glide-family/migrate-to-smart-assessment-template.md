# Migrate a survey-based questionnaire to Smart Assessment

Migrate survey-based work order questionnaires and templates to Smart Assessment templates.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin

## About this task

Administrators can migrate the existing survey-based questionnaires and templates to Smart Assessment. The migration can be started from a survey-based work order questionnaire record. A new smart assessment questionnaire and template is automatically created after the migration is complete.

Smart Assessment uses the Smart Assessment Engine to migrate survey-based templates to Smart Assessment templates. For more information, see [Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-asmnt-engine-landing-page.md).

**Note:**

-   Smart Assessment templates don't support Boolean, Template, Percentage, Imagescale, Ranking, Rating, Duration, Custom, and Scale data types. Update these data types in work order questionnaires to the closest supported data types before initiating the migration process.
-   Conditional dependencies of a questionnaire are not migrated.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Questionnaire**.

2.  Open the questionnaire to migrate.

3.  Select **Migrate**.

    Migration initiation confirmation displays.

    **Note:** Users with the wm\_admin and survey\_owner roles can save and publish questions, and migrate surveys to smart assessments. However, to save and publish questions from surveys where you are not the owner, or migrate surveys created by others to a smart assessment, you must replace the survey\_creator role by the survey\_admin role. The **Migrate** option is only displayed to users with the survey\_owner or survey\_admin role.

4.  Select the assessment template migration record to view the status of the migration.


## Result

The questionnaire is migrated and a Smart Assessment questionnaire and template is created.

## What to do next

To view, update, or publish the Smart Assessment template, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Assessment Workspace**.
