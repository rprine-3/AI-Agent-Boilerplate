# Combined RPA Hub release notes for upgrades from Zurich to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for RPA Hub from Zurich to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family RPA Hub release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Zurich to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading RPA Hub to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

-   **Upgrade information**

Upgrade any of these currently installed Microsoft Software Installers \(MSIs\) by downloading the RPA applications:

    -   RPA Desktop Design Studio
    -   Attended Robot
    -   Unattended Robot
    -   Unattended Robot Login Agent
For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=download-installer-rpa&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

The following upgrade information is applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Zurich.

Based on the number of records in the application file table, you may experience a delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or earlier releases to Zurich.

Before upgrading RPA Hub to Zurich, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

After you upgrade to Zurich, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from the bot process to the bot process configuration. If you upgrade to Zurich without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah and beyond release \[KB1223629\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
