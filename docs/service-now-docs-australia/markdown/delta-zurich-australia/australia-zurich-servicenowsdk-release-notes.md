-   **Upgrade information**

To upgrade to the latest version of the ServiceNow SDK globally or within an application, see [Upgrade the ServiceNow SDK](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=upgrade-servicenow-sdk&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

ServiceNow SDK version 4.0 supports integration with ServiceNow instances beginning with the Washington DC release.

On Windows systems, after upgrading to ServiceNow SDK version 4.3 or later, existing stored credentials aren’t supported due to the deprecation of Keytar. Users on Windows systems must add their user credentials again using the `now-sdk auth --add` command to authenticate with instances. For more information, see [Authenticate](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=authenticate-instance-now-sdk&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

**Note:** For more information about minor releases of the ServiceNow SDK, see the [ServiceNow SDK repository](https://github.com/ServiceNow/sdk/releases) on GitHub.
