-   **[Payment card application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=payment-card-application&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Store the details of physical payment cards across the entire card life cycle, from issuance to servicing. You can also store tokenized values for sensitive data, such as the primary account number \(PAN\).

-   **[Deny-Unless ACL](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acl-denial-behavior&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Deny-Unless access control lists \(ACLs\) on FSO tables for non-authenticated users, such as users with public roles. With this minimum-security setting, only your authenticated users can read, write, delete, or create actions on these tables. For more information about the Deny-Unless ACLs, see the [Deny-Unless ACL](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acl-denial-behavior&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) topic in the ServiceNow® Platform Security documentation.

-   **[Case type selector](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=csm-case-type-select-modals&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Filter service definitions using the case type selector in FSO with the predefined CSM implementation. For upgraded instances, existing agent criteria and customer condition data is automatically migrated from the deprecated FSO tables to the CSM tables during upgrade. No manual migration is required.

To configure agent criteria or customer conditions for the case type selector, use the following CSM tables:

    -   `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria`: for agent criteria
    -   `sn_csm_case_types_service_customer_criteria`: for customer conditions

-   The FSO tables `sn_bom_m2m_service_definition_user_criteria` and `sn_bom_m2m_service_definition_customer_condition` are deprecated. If you're on an upgraded instance, you can continue to reference these tables, but they're no longer maintained. Use `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria` and `sn_csm_case_types_service_customer_criteria` instead. For more information, see [Banking tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=fso-core-banking-tables&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).
-   The **Show in Interceptor** field \(`show_in_interceptor`\) on the `sn_bom_service_definition` table is deprecated. Use agent criteria in the `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria` table to control which service definitions appear in the case type selector.

User criteria mappings control the visibility of new service definitions. To hide a service definition, map it to the **No User** user criteria. To make it visible, map it to the **Users with sn\_bom.service\_definition\_read** user criteria. Both user criteria records are predefined in Financial Services Operations Core.

For more information, see [Components installed with case types](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-definitions-components&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).
