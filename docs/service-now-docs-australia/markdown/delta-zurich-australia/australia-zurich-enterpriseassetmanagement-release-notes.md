-   **Upgrade information**

Starting with Zurich release, a new menu, Asset put away, has been added to the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar. When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar was customized and takes the necessary action.

    -   If the navigation bar wasn’t customized before the upgrade, a new Asset put away icon \(\[Omitted image "image.asset-putaway-icon-ma"\] Alt text: Asset put away icon\) is included in the navigation bar
    -   If the navigation bar was customized before the upgrade, two navigation bars appear: Customized old IT Asset Management and IT Asset Management. The new icon appears in the IT Asset Management navigation bar.

</td><td>

-   **[Organize your assets into hierarchical asset groups to manage your complex asset ecosystems](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=asset-groups-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Organize assets into logical groups and subgroups to represent their dependencies and operational relationships. Use a dependency map to visualize the entire structure of the asset hierarchy, making it easy to see all the subgroups and assets within each asset group.

-   **[Inspect the condition of enterprise assets to determine their health and ensure reliability](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=asset-conditions-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define condition attributes for enterprise models and assets and associate these attributes with templates to identify any potential issues throughout the asset life cycle. Enable scoring in the templates to calculate asset condition scores to determine whether an asset passes or fails the evaluation. Schedule asset condition evaluations via maintenance plans or work orders. View comprehensive reports on the asset condition outcomes on dashboards across your organization.

-   **[Optimize your operations with asset performance reports](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=eam-asset-dboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track the past performance of assets and get notified about trends, threshold breaches, or anomalies based on their location, model category, model, or classification. This tracking helps improve asset availability according to ISO standards.

-   **[Monitor supply and demand of assets in a stockroom with detailed inventory reports](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-stockroom-inventory-reports&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track and manage stockrooms efficiently by evaluating the inventory reports in the Inventory view of the Enterprise Asset Workspace. These reports help you:

    -   Find replacement options or spare part availability for assets that are in use, being repaired, or in maintenance
    -   Quickly identify shortages and align current demand in your stockroom with both current and incoming supply
    -   Analyze the supply to meet open demand across all stockrooms or locations
-   **[Achieve faster diagnostics and enhanced maintenance efficiency with standardized failure and resolution codes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=failure-resolution-codes-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable technicians to record predefined failure reasons and resolution steps with configurable codes. You can create, update, and import these codes through spreadsheets in the Admin center of the Enterprise Asset Workspace. In the Repair flow, these codes help technicians record the reason for the specific issue with the asset and the appropriate solution for repairing it.

-   **[Manage OT hardware models and assets in the OT Asset Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ot-asset-ws-otam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable OT asset managers to view and fulfill requests for OT hardware assets in the OT Asset Workspace. The reports and dashboards in the OT Asset workspace include OT hardware models, assets, and requests. The following OT Asset Management workflows and features now provide support for OT hardware assets and models, in addition to the workflows and features that continue to support them from the Yokohama release:

    -   Bulk import
    -   Asset reclamation
    -   Advanced Shipment Notification \(ASN\)
    -   Asset audits
    -   Total Cost of Ownership \(TCO\)
    -   Lease contract
    -   Risk
    -   Resale
    -   Loaner
    -   Move
    -   Recall
    -   Stock rule
-   **[Remediate unsuccessful enterprise asset calibrations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=remediate-unsuccessful-enterprise-asset-calibration&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Remediate failed calibration events by initiating new work orders and corresponding work order tasks for those events. When you select the option to remediate a failed calibration event, you can choose an appropriate work order template to generate a new work order with at least one work order task. The work order and work order task are auto-populated with the asset that you want to calibrate, the location of that asset, the original work order, and all mandatory fields. In addition, the original and new calibration events and their corresponding tasks are linked together through the **Parent** field for full traceability.

-   **[Measure calibration tolerance conformance by using additional value types](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-calibration-attributes-enterprise-model&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the following additional value types to compare your calibration measurements against the corresponding tolerances that you define:

    -   Range
    -   Less than
    -   Greater than
In addition, use the True/False value type to assess the qualitative elements of your calibrations.

-   **[Manage unique identifiers for enterprise assets using CI identification rules](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-asset-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define required and unique fields on asset records by creating identification rules on associated CI classes in the Identification and Reconciliation engine \(IRE\). When you create an asset whose model category is linked to a CI class with an identification rule, you should provide details for at least one of the fields, such as Asset tag, Serial number, and MAC address, that uniquely identify the asset.

-   **[Drop off and receive assets at a stockroom by using the ServiceNow Mobile Agent application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-dropoff-mobile-agent&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Return the assets that you have in your personal stockroom to a different stockroom by creating a Drop off task using the ServiceNow® Mobile Agent application. The asset manager of the destination stockroom receives the assets that you dropped off through a Receive task. The asset manager then verifies the received assets and closes the Drop off task using the Mobile Agent application.

**Note:** Starting with the Xanadu release, you could create Drop off and Receive tasks in the Enterprise Asset Workspace. However, now you can also use the Mobile Agent application for the same purpose.

-   **[Receive shipment assets at a stockroom through the streamlined and unified receiving process](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stockroom-receiving-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Receive assets from any workﬂow directly at the stockroom using the unified receiving functionality in the following workspaces:

    -   Enterprise Asset Workspace
    -   OT Asset Workspace
    -   Medical Asset Workspace
    -   Facility Asset Workspace
This standardized receiving process reduces the time spent on receiving assets. By requiring each asset to be assigned a unique identiﬁer when received at the stockroom, the quality of asset data also improves.

You can receive assets in bulk by using a template. Additionally, you can view the results and validation comments in the staging table. During this process, the system handles existing assets, creates new ones as needed, and performs comprehensive validations.

-   **[Track asset movement from the receiving bay to an aisle-space in the stockroom](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-inventory-by-putting-away-asset-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Move assets from the receiving bay to their designated aisle and space and improve asset tracking and inventory management by using the Asset put away feature. This task can be performed via the Enterprise Asset Workspace or ServiceNow Agent application.

-   **[Define, schedule, and track complex asset-centric work tasks through work order plans](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-work-order-plans&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Manage complex asset-centric work tasks with unified work order plans that can be applied across assets, asset groups, or locations. The work order plans offer the following benefits:

    -   Save work order plans as reusable templates for use across assets.
    -   Organize sequential operations—shutdowns, safety inspections, calibrations, asset conditions, and restarts—using the structured playbook.
    -   Assign, schedule, and track work order tasks for technicians within the playbook.
    -   Enable technicians to receive assigned work order tasks and update task status through the ServiceNow Mobile Agent application.
-   **[Manage multimedia production equipment models and assets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-model-eam&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create, track, and manage multimedia production equipment models and assets in the Enterprise Asset Workspace. Get a comprehensive view of these models and assets so that you can manage them effectively throughout their life cycles.

-   **[Replace broad admin checks with granular admin roles and ACL updates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-eam&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Manage admin access precisely with granular admin roles. Instead of giving full admin privileges to the users, you can assign specific roles based on the tasks they perform.

-   **[Enhanced and unified enterprise asset inventory auditing experience](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=audit-eam-assetinventory&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Streamline and improve your inventory auditing experience with the enhanced and unified enterprise asset inventory process:

    -   Initiate a single audit that covers both hardware and enterprise assets assigned to a specific location or stockroom, eliminating the need to switch between multiple workspaces.
    -   Include consumable assets in the inventory audit to avoid asset shrinkage and ensure that inventory data remains accurate.
    -   The ServiceNow Agent app features selectable audit results, enabling you to view a real-time list of all scanned assets.
    -   When new assets are identified during the single scan audit, essential information is collected in real time through the ServiceNow Agent app to initiate asset creation.
    -   Scanned asset locations are automatically updated to reflect their precise aisle, space, or sub location during the audit, supporting the accuracy and quality of inventory records.
-   **[Stockroom audit support for Field Service Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stockroom-audit-access-eam&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) **

Audit personal stockroom assets as an FSM field agent using the ServiceNow Agent mobile application. Access is controlled through new granular audit roles.
