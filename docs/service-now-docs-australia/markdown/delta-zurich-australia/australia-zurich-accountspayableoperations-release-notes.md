Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Convert invoice type](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=convert-invoice-case&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable your accounts payable specialist to manually change the invoice type, which results in improved accuracy and compliance. For example, changing a non-purchase order \(PO\) invoice to a PO invoice type.

-   **[Using Playbook in Accounts Payable Operations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=how-to-use-playbook&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Process your invoices more efficiently, adhere to compliance, and provide financial accuracy across processes by using new exceptions such as the Missing tax code invoice and currency mismatch between invoices and purchase orders.

-   **[IT Asset Management purchase order invoice processing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=apo-integration-with-itam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Confirm that ITAM receipts are available and the received quantity is updated in the purchase orders through the integration between the IT Asset Management and Accounts Payable Operations applications.

-   **[Set APO properties](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=set-apo-properties&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The recommend invoice owner AI agent auto-suggests and fills in the appropriate business owner based on historical patterns. This process sets up auto-confirmation from suppliers, resulting in shorter invoice processing cycles.


 -   **[Universal Request in Accounts Payable Operations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=universal-request-in-apo&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Employees and suppliers can raise general case requests and track case activity updates from their respective portals by using the ServiceNowUniversal Request \(UR\) application. Universal requests eliminate confusion about which department to contact for assistance.


 -   **[Distribution set in Accounts Payable Operations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=distribution-sets-in-apo&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Apply predefined distribution sets to split invoice amounts across multiple cost centers or GL accounts without having to do manual entry for each invoice line in PO invoices and non-PO invoices. This process helps distribute costs to multiple cost centers automatically, reducing manual work for Accounts Payable specialists.

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Tax engine integration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tax-engine-integration&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The tax engine integration framework validates supplier-provided tax against system tax at invoice line level, and supports regional and global tax requirements. This integration triggers automatic tax validation, handles exceptions for tax variance and missing data, enables manual re validation and rolling up of system tax.

-   **[Email parser agent for APO](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=email-parser-agent-for-apo&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The email parser agent is an AI agent that automatically processes incoming emails \(Level 1 support cases and tasks\) from suppliers and invoice owners. The email parser agent identifies actionable requests, classifies them, and creates invoice cases.


 -   **[Invoice rejection modes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=invoice-rejection-modes&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

APO supports configurable rejection modes for invoice exception handling. Administrators can configure rejection mode behavior per exception type to align with organizational policies and audit requirements.
