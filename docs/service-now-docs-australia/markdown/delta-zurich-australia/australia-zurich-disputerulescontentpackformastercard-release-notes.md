A new Mastercard data field `programRegistrationId` has been added to the Financial Transaction table to support chargeback ineligibility rule evaluation for RC 4853 Cardholder Disputes sub-categories. The field is sourced from the Mastercard clearing API.

    -   `transit_clearing_amount_sum` — the sum of local transaction amounts for matching transit clearing transactions, used to evaluate UK domestic contactless transit split-clearing ineligibility conditions.
    -   `cpd_minus_declined_transit_auth_date_time` — the number of days between a declined transit authorization and the chargeback protection date \(CPD\), used to assess TFRR/FRIL eligibility windows.
