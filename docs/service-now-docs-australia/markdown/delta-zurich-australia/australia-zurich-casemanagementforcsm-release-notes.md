-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key sharing-task-plan-template\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sharing-task-plan-template&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Sharing task plan templates ensures that only authorized users can access, edit, or share templates based on their role and location, preventing misuse and maintaining operational integrity. Sharing task plant template features include:

    -   Access control: Users can now provide access to task plan templates at various levels, including user, group, and service organization.
    -   Ownership Management: The Owner or an Admin can change the ownership of a Template by updating the Owner field.
    -   Global template: Task plan templates can be marked as global, making them visible to all users with read access.
    -   Form and List Layouts: Admins can view and edit form and list layouts for sharing, displaying all relevant fields.
    -   Notifications: In-app notifications are sent when access is granted, Selecting the notification opens the shared template directly.
-   **[Task plan template configurations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=task_plan_template_configurations&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Admins can create configurations for task plan templates that pre-fill information when creating a new task plan template.

    -   Customer Service All Case Viewer \[sn\_customerservice.all\_cases\_viewer\]

    -   Case Playbook for Onboarding Viewer \[sn\_onboarding.viewer\]

Case Type consistency improvements: This update ensures case type consistency when creating and managing major cases and their related child cases, improving accuracy and reducing manual correction.

    -   Create major cases automatically upon approval, and major cases now inherit the same case type as the originating case.
    -   Promote the proposed case directly to a major case I-if no account or consumer or partner exists on the originating major case.
    -   Use the major case's case type and inherit the fields defined in \(sn\_customerservice.case\_fields\_to\_sync\) property or defined through extension point for child cases.
-   **[Task plan templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=task-plan-templates&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Add flexible task dependency management to task plan templates, and support for attachments.

    -   Schedule offsets can be defined when creating dependencies, allowing tasks to start within a specified time period \(minutes, hours, days, or weeks\).
    -   Configure and manage task dependencies directly from task dependency list and view layouts.
    -   Built‑in validations prevent circular dependencies, ensuring task plans remain accurate and reliable.
    -   Ability to attach documents to tasks or cases.
    -   Select **Apply Template** for any published task plan templates to automatically add all document references from the original template items to the newly created tasks, ensuring seamless access for task owners to all required documents.
-   **[Case type selector for creating cases](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-case-of-specific-case-type&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The case type selector is now activated by default when creating cases of these types:

    -   Interaction
    -   Account
    -   Contact
    -   Consumer
    -   Sold product
    -   Install base item
    -   Related lists: child case, case task
    -   List view
    -   Case task list view
