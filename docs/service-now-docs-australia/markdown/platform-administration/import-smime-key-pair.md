# Import an S/MIME key pair

Import an S/MIME key pair consisting of the private key and certificate to sign outbound emails or decrypt emails.

## Before you begin

Role required: email\_account\_admin and sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager

Upload the private-public key pair corresponding to the instance email account.

You must have the key alias.

**Note:** When you create a PKCS12 file, ensure that it's created with a key alias.

Make sure the file format is PKCS \#12.
