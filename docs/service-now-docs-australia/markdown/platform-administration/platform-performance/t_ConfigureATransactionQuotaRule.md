# Configure a transaction quota rule

Transaction quota rules allow you to define a quota policy for different types of transactions.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Transaction quota rules allow you to specify the following conditions.

-   The conditions under which the policy applies.
-   The order in which transaction quotas apply.
-   The maximum duration of a transaction before the quota manager cancels it.

Before setting transaction quotas, navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Active Transactions** to review the normal transaction activities for your instance. You can [view and terminate long-running transactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/t_ViewAndKillAnActiveTransaction.md) if necessary. Over time, you can determine the normal transaction load for your instance and set your quotas to match these norms.

**Warning:** Setting transaction quotas too low can severely impact your users and prevent normal instance operations. Test your transaction quotas rigorously before implementing them in production.

## Procedure

1.  If necessary, activate the Transaction Quotas plugin.

    To verify whether the Transaction Quotas plugin is already active, navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Application Manager** and search for Transaction Quotas in Application Manager. If the plugin is included in the **Installed** tab, it is already activated.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Quota Rules**.

3.  Click **New**.

4.  On the Transaction Quota Rule form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Transaction quota rule form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/transaction-quota-rule-form.md).

5.  Set a condition to specify when the transaction quota should take effect.

    The transaction quota rule condition builder displays conditions that are only applicable to transactions. For a description of the condition builder options, see [Transaction quota rule condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/transaction-quota-condition-builder.md).

6.  Select **Submit**.
