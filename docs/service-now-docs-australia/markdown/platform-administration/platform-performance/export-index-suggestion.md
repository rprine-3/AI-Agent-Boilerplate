# Export a slow-query index suggestion to a non-production instance

You can export an index suggestion from a production instance to a non-production instance for creation, evaluation, and testing before implementing the index on your production instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

This task involves exporting an index suggestion as an .xml file from your production instance and importing it to a non-production instance. You can then create the index and evaluate its performance on the non-production instance.

## Procedure

1.  In your production instance, navigate to the index suggestion to be exported:

    1.  Navigate to **System Diagnostics** &gt; **Index Suggestions** &gt; **Index Suggestions &gt; To review**.

    2.  In the Index Suggestions table, select the table associated with the index suggestion you want to open from the **Table Name** column.

2.  In the Index Suggestions form, click **Export**.

    The index suggestion is downloaded as an .xml file with the file name `sys_index_suggestion_<alphanumeric identifier>.xml`. The file name has a unique alphanumeric string to differentiate it from other index suggestions.

3.  In your non-production instance, navigate to **System Diagnostics** &gt; **Index Suggestions** &gt; **Index Suggestions &gt; To review**.

4.  In the Index Suggestions table under Related Links, click **Import Suggestions**.

5.  In the Import XML form, choose the index suggestion file that you exported and click **Upload**.

    After the import, the imported index suggestion appears in the Index Suggestions table on your non-production instance.

6.  To continue the index evaluation process on your non-production instance, you can [schedule the index suggestion for creation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/create-index-slowquery.md) and [test index performance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/test-index-performance.md).
