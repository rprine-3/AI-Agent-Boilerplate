# Canceled-transaction logging to a table

The system logs canceled transactions to a table in addition to the transaction log.

Transactions canceled manually or by a quota rule are logged to the Transaction Cancellation Log \[syslog\_cancellation\] table. The Transaction Cancellation Log is an extra debugging feature, and doesn't contain information on all cancellations.

**Note:** There are safeguards in place to help prevent infinite loops and issues related to synchronicity. Because of this, it's not always possible to log a cancellation to a database table.

You can find the Transaction Cancellation Log by selecting **System Logs** &gt; **System Log** &gt; **Transaction Cancellations**.

You can turn off canceled-transaction logging to a table by changing a property.
