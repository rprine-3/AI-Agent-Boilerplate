# Configuring the ServiceNow AI Platform to optimize performance

Configure browser settings, transaction and application quotas, and operational toggles options to optimize performance. Optimizing ServiceNow AI Platform performance supports a smooth a responsive user experience.

## Configuration overview

Most configuration for platform performance optimization is completed by instance administrators in each instance of the ServiceNow AI Platform. Any user can verify browser configuration to optimize performance.

-   [Set transaction quotas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/c_TransactionQuotas.md)

    Instance administrators set transaction quotas to help prevent poorly performing queries and scripts from consuming system resources. After determining normal parameters for transactions, you can create a transaction quota rule that defines when a long-running transaction should be canceled.

-   [Set application quotas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/c_ApplicationQuotas.md)

    Instance administrators can set application quotas in addition to global transaction quotas. Application quota rules limit the number of events or jobs that can run within an application's scope during a specified amount of time, helping optimize bandwidth use.

-   [Set operational toggles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/operational-toggles.md)

    Instance administrators can control how much bandwidth an application uses in the instance by mapping system run levels to operational toggles.

-   [Verify browser settings for performance optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/c_Compression.md)

    Verify that your browser supports data compression to support optimal performance. Any user can verify that their browser's settings.
