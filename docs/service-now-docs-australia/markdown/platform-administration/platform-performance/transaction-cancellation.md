# Transaction cancellation

You can cancel transactions that take longer than expected to load. Canceling long-running transactions can help prevent excessive resource consumption.

Causes of slow-loading transactions include the following scenarios.

-   Sorting a large number of records by an unindexed string field.
-   Grouping a large table on a field that has predominantly distinct values.
-   Exporting all rows from a large table.
-   Testing a poorly scripted business rule that has an infinite JavaScript loop.

## Transaction cancel timer

**Note:** You can’t cancel an import with these controls.

During a long-running transaction, a timer and a cancellation option appear in an alert banner.

To cancel the transaction, select the **Cancel** button. The alert message displays when a transaction cancellation is in progress and when the cancellation is completed.

If a slow transaction completes successfully, the timer indicates how long it took for the transaction to complete.

## Canceled transaction logs

Canceled transactions appear in the transaction log with **CANCELLED** appended to the URL. Transactions canceled by a user are logged differently from transactions canceled by transaction quotas. For more information about canceled transaction logging, see [Canceled-transaction logging to a table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/c_CanTranLogTbl.md). For more information about transaction quotas, see [Transaction quotas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-performance/c_TransactionQuotas.md).
