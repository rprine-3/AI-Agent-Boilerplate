# Advanced email properties

Use advanced email properties to fine-tune the way your instance sends or receives email.

Add these properties to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table before they can be used to overwrite the defaults.

-   **__com.glide.email.max\_read__**

    Specifies the maximum number of emails a POP3 reader should process concurrently.

    -   Type: integer
    -   Default value: 20
-   **__com.snc.on\_call\_rotation.reminders.showtz__**

    Specifies whether to show a user's time zone.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: false
-   **__glide.cms.use\_email\_override\_url__**

    Forces the system to use the **glide.email.override.url** property, rather than the **glide.servlet.uri** property, when a notification has a link to a CMS page in an instance.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: false
    -   Location: System Property \[sys\_properties\] table
-   **__glide.email\_address\_filter.max\_domains__**

    Sets the maximum number of domains that can be associated with a single email address filter.

    -   Type: integer
    -   Default value: 100
-   **__glide.email\_address\_filter.max\_exceptions__**

    Sets the maximum number of exceptions that can be associated with a single email address filter.

    -   Type: integer
    -   Default value: 1000
-   **__glide.email.allow\_duplicate\_message\_ids__**

    Allows storing of emails with duplicate message IDs and adds error message "Duplicate message-id encountered, prevented loop."

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: false
-   **__glide.email.append.timezone__**

    Appends the user time zone to all date and time values in outbound email messages \(for example, 2018-07-02 04:01:14 PST\). The time zone does not show if the system property **glide.sys.time\_format** does not have a "z" value. For more information on configuring the time zone in email notifications, see [Time zone for email notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_SpecifyingTheTimeZone.md).

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default: false
-   **__glide.email.email\_client.check\_attachment\_availability__**

    Enables a system scan of each file that a user attaches to an email draft in the email client. If a file is found to be infected with a virus, the user can't send the email with the attached file. The user must remove the attachment to send the email.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: true
-   **__glide.email.email\_with\_no\_target\_visible\_to\_all__**

    Email that is missing a target record or whose target record is the email are made visible to any user regardless of their roles. By turning this property to false, the user is restricted unless they sent in the record or have an admin role.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Value: true
-   **__glide.email.inbound.calendar\_behavior__**

    Specifies how the system stores calendar data, such as an invitation or an invitation response. Enter one of these options \(not case sensitive\):

    -   Type: string
    -   Default value: Attach
-   **__glide.email.inbound.check\_attachment\_availability__**

    Prevents users from downloading and using virus-infected files that are attached to inbound emails.

    The system detects infected files in an email by checking the ServiceNow virus header. If there are multiple email attachments, the system scans the files via [Antivirus Scanning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/antivirus-protection.md). All attachments that are found to be infected are made unavailable for use.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: true
-   **__glide.email.inbound.convert\_html\_inline\_attachment\_references__**

    Specifies whether to convert inbound email HTML so email images appear in the email HTML body preview. The system displays broken cid \(content ID\) links in place of images received when this property is disabled. The format in which the system displays an email image depends on the property setting at the time the email is received, not the current property setting.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: true

    -   Default value: 524288
-   **__glide.email.inbound.max\_total\_attachment\_size\_bytes__**

    Sets the maximum total attachment size in bytes allowed per inbound email.

    -   Type: integer
    -   Default value: 18874368
    -   Location: System Property \[sys\_properties\] table

    -   User account \(guest or any other account used to run the inbound email action\) is inactive.
    -   The user account \(guest or any other account used to run the inbound email action\) is locked out and the glide.pop3.process\_locked\_out property is set to false.
    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: true
-   **__glide.email.mail\_to__**

    Specifies the email address for sending notifications that use the $\{mailto:\} variable.

    -   Type: string
    -   Default value: SMTP email address that is active by default
-   **__glide.email.name\_split__**

    Specifies the delimiter used between first and last names in an email address. For example, a delimiter of "." \(period\) in the email address john.smith@company.com tells the system to look for a user record for John Smith.

    -   Type: string
    -   Default value: period \(.\)
-   **__glide.email.notification.save\_when\_no\_recipients__**

    Controls whether a notification-generated `sys_mail` record is saved even if there are no recipients. Used along with other notification recipient logging properties, this property enables investigating problems with notifications.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: false
-   **__glide.email.outbound.check\_attachment\_availability__**

    Prevents users from sending emails that contain virus-infected files.

    If an outbound email contains an attachment that was previously marked as infected via [Antivirus Scanning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/antivirus-protection.md), then the system doesn't send the email. An event is created to indicate that the email attachment is not available for use.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: true
-   **__glide.email.outbound.header.auto\_submitted__**

    -   Type: integer
    -   Default value: 18874368
    -   Location: System Property \[sys\_properties\] table
-   **__glide.email.override.url__**

    Sets the URL to use in emailed links in place of the instance URL. The URL should end with nav\_to.do. An example value is `https://servicenow.customerdomain.com/production.nav_to.do`. This property is suitable for customers who use custom redirect URLs for their instances.

    -   Type: string
    -   Default value: instance URL
-   **__glide.email.remove\_illegal\_address\_quotes__**

    Removes invalid quotation marks from an inbound email address, thus allowing the inbound email address to be accepted as valid. For example, when you set the property to true, the address "john.doe@example.com" is changed to john.doe@example.com.

    -   Type: true \| false
    -   Default value: true
-   **__glide.notification.recipient.exclude\_logging__**

    Enables or disables logging all reasons a recipient was excluded. If set to true, the subsequent properties dealing with the exclusion of logging are enabled. If false, the properties are disabled. This property cannot suppress log messages generated by the **glide.email.test.user** property.

    Set to a value greater than 24 \(hours\) and increase it in intervals to not send a large number of emails at one time. Depending on how big the backlog of emails is and how spaced out they are created in time, you might want to start with a value of 36 \(1.5 days worth\), let those go out, then set the value again to maybe 48 \(two days\), and keep increasing the value until all of the older emails are sent.
