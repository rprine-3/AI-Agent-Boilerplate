# Accessing email object variables

</table>**Note:** The instance follows [RFC 2822](http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2822) \(Internet Message Format\), which requires multiple email addresses in a group to be separated by commas, not semicolons. The instance can set the values of the *email.to*, *email.direct*, and *email.copied* variables only if emails addressed to groups follow the expected RFC format.

## Inbound email.recipient variables

The recipients variables \(*email.recipients*, *email.recipients-array*\) allow processing of inbound email based on the email recipients. For example, you can create a script to process email based on the array values:

```
var rarray  = email.recipients_array ; for ( var i  = 0 ; i  < rarray.length ; i ++ ) { var recipient  = rarray [i ] ; // do something with it } 
```

## The sys\_email variable

This variable lets you access the received sys\_email record that triggered the inbound email action. It can be used to reference fields on the email record, such as **uid**, **sys\_id**, **content\_type**, and so on.
