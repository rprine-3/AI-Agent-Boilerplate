# Specify field for attached Knowledge article links

Specify which field to add a note to when you attach a Knowledge article to a record.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When you attach a Knowledge article to a record, by default a link to the Knowledge article is added to the **Additional comments \(Customer visible\)** field. You can specify the field for this link based on the table. For example, a Problem record doesn't have the **Additional comments \(Customer visible\)** field on the form, so the **Attach** action is configured to add the note to the **Work notes** field.

You can specify the field either globally or locally. The local field for a table overrides the global default field value.

To specify the global field, navigate to **Knowledge** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties** &gt; **Other Knowledge Properties** and specify the name of the field in the **glide.knowman.attach.fields** property.

You can specify the local field using the following procedure.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Contextual Search** &gt; **Table Configuration**.

2.  Open the table configuration that you want to change attachment fields for.

3.  Select the Search Action Configurations related list.

4.  For each search action that you want to change the default field for, perform the following steps:

    1.  Open the search action.

    2.  Select the **Use custom field for attach note** option, if not already selected.

    3.  In the **Attach note field**, enter the name of the field that you want to copy the article information into, such as `comments` or `work_notes`.

        If field is not present on the form, Agent Assist will fallback on `comments` or `description` field depending on what is available.

    4.  Select **Update**.

    **Note:**

    -   If you don't want to add a note to any field, leave the **Attach note field** blank.
    -   If the field you have specified in the **Attach note field** isn't found on the form, then the note isn't added to any field.

## What to do next

Clear the system cache to make sure the changed field specification applies. You can clear the system cache by appending `cache.do` to the instance URL. For example, `https://<instance name>.service-now.com/cache.do`.

**Warning:**

Clearing the system cache can affect overall performance and degrade system response times. Don't run cache flushes during business hours, and don't trigger cache flushes automatically.
