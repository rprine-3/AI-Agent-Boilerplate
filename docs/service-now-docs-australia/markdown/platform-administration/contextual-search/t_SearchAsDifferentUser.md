# Enable viewing of search results for the current and another selected user

Enable the search as functionality when you want the ability to view search results common to the current user and another user that you specify.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

For example, an HR administrator may have some confidential information. A user might have partial access to the information. The Search as functionality applies security access to display results that are common to both the logged in or current user and the user referenced in the **Search as field**. The search result for the other user may have fewer entries than what that current user can actually view.

**Note:** No search result is displayed for **Predictive Intelligence Similarity** additional resources. Record producers only support searching for the current user.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Contextual Search** &gt; **Table Configuration**.

2.  Edit a table configuration record.

3.  In the Search as section, fill in the fields.
