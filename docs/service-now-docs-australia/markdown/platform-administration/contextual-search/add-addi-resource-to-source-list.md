# Add additional resources to the source selector of a form

Add additional resources when you want the user to search beyond Knowledge and Service Catalog search resources. For example, add additional resources for **Open Incidents**, **Resolved Incidents**, or **Similar Open Incidents**.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Additional resources are pre-defined. An additional resource is either a searchable source table with query conditions or a reference to a Predictive Intelligence Similarity solution definition.

**Note:** You can only view the Predictive Intelligence resources if you are licensed for Predictive Intelligence and have activated [Predictive Intelligence for Contextual Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/machine-learning-solutions-for-search/predictive-intelligence-for-cxs.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Contextual Search** &gt; **Search Contexts**.

2.  Open the search context record for which you want to see the additional resources.

3.  In the Additional Resource Configurations related list, select **Edit**.

4.  Filter the additional resources displayed in the **Collection** field by defining filter conditions and selecting **Run filter**.

    As an example, you can display only additional resources with the Predictive Intelligence Similarity type.

5.  From the **Collection** field, move the required additional resources to the **Additional Resource Configurations List** field.

    For example, if you want to move additional resources whose type is **Predictive Intelligence Similarity**, then move **Similar Incidents**, **Similar Knowledge Articles**, **Similar Open Change Requests**, **Similar Open Incidents**, **Similar Open Problems**, and **Similar Resolved Incidents** from the **Collection** field to the **Additional Resource Configurations List** field.

    The additional resources appear under **Additional Resource Configurations**.
