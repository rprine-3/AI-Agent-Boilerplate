# Specify fields for the Cxs\_popup view

Edit the Cxs\_popup view to specify the fields to be shown for addition resources in the preview window of a task record. The preview helps you with the summary of the record.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

If a Cxs\_popup view isn't defined for the additional resource table, the sys\_popup view is used. If the sys\_popup view is also not defined, the default view is considered.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Incident** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the incident record whose view you want to change to Cxs\_popup.

3.  Select the additional actions icon \(\[Omitted image "additional-actions.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions icon\) and in the **View** option, select **Cxs\_popup**.

    \[Omitted image "cxs-popup-view.png"\] Alt text: Incident form in Cxs\_popup view.

    The view of the incident record changes to Cxs\_popup view.

4.  Select the additional actions icon \(\[Omitted image "additional-actions.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions icon\), and in the **Configure** option, select **Form Layout**.

5.  From the **Available** list of fields, select the fields that you want to be available in the Cxs\_popup view and move them under **Selected**.

6.  Select **Save**.
