# View the upgrade history of a ServiceNow Store application

View the upgrade history of an application that you purchased and installed from the ServiceNow Store.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_appclient.app\_client\_company\_installer \(can only install applications that match the instance company\), sn\_appclient.app\_client\_user, unified\_plugin\_read\_only

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the application using the filter criteria and search bar.

3.  Select the menu icon \( \[Omitted image "menu-icon.png"\] Alt text: Menu icon \) on the application tile, and then select **View upgrade history**.

    **Note:** When customers upgrade to this new version of your application, the Deletes in your author\_elective\_update folder will be written as Skips in the Upgrade History entry for this application upgrade. Your users can browse the Skip list, and apply the changes on a case-by-case basis. Your customers have the option of setting com.glide.apps.include\_my\_deletes to false, which will skip writing Skip records as well.
