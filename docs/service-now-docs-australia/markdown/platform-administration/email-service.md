# Email service

The Email Service API provides endpoint to install the Email API on the instance.

By default, Email Service only allows admin users to access the [Email API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/email-api.md). Administrators can [grant access to the Email API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/grant-access-to-email-api.md) by:

1.  Adding an access control for creating records in the Email \[sys\_email\] table linked to the email\_api\_send role.
2.  Assigning the email\_api\_send role to the non-admin user.
3.  Verifying the non-admin user has read access to the notification target table. For example, an email notification for an incident, requires read access to the Incident table.

Non-admin users with the email\_api\_send role can access the Email API from the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/use-REST-API-Explorer.md).
