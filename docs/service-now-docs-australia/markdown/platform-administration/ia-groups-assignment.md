# Groups assignment

Organize users and assign roles using groups.

Select the **Configure with ServiceNow Otto** button to start the ServiceNow Otto agent, which enhances group assignment by using AI‑powered search to identify similar existing groups, helping prevent duplicate creation and improving accuracy. You can provide multiple inputs in a single interaction, and the agent interprets the required details without prompting for each field individually. It also supports additional fields such as Manager and Parent during group creation, expanding flexibility in defining group structure. Overall, the experience reduces the number of steps and confirmations needed, allowing you to assign roles and configure groups more efficiently.

**Note:** You can either use the pills available in the ServiceNow Otto chat agent or can enter your own prompt with the required conditions.

When you provide an incorrect group name, the agent indicates that the group is not found, suggests similar existing groups, and gives you the option to select one or create a new group with the name you provided.

**Note:** All the fields except the Name field are optional during the creation of a group.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name|Name of the group|
|Description|Detail description of the group|
|Active|State of the group if its active or not|
|Manager|Name of the assigned manager of the group|
|Parent|Name of the parent group|
|Updated|Date when the group information was last updated|

**Note:** Once the changes are done successfully, you can verify it by opening the group.

Select **Add a group** if you want to add a group to configure. You can also export the list of groups into an excel sheet or an available file type by selecting **Export**.
