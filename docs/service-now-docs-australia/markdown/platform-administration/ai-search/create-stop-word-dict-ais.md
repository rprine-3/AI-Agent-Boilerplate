## About this task

To make a stop word dictionary affect search behavior, you must link it to a search profile, either at creation time or afterward. You can only link one stop word dictionary per language to a given search profile.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **Search Experience** &gt; **Search Profiles**.

2.  Open the search profile that you want to link the new stop word dictionary to.

3.  In the Stop Words related list, select **Create and Link**.

4.  On the Dictionary form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Dictionary form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/dictionary-form-ais.md).

5.  To save the new stop word dictionary and link it to the specified search profile, select **Submit.**


## Result

The new stop word dictionary appears in the Stop Words related list.
