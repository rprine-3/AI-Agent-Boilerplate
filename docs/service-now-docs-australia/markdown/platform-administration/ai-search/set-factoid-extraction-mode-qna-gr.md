# Set the factoid extraction mode for Q&amp;A Genius Results

Specify how you want factoid extraction to display and highlight answers for Q&amp;A Genius Results.

## Before you begin

Role required: ais\_admin

## About this task

As a search administrator, you can specify the factoid extraction mode for Q&amp;A Genius Results by setting the value of the **glide.ais.genius\_result.qna\_mode** system property. This system property does not exist in the base system, so you may have to add it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table's list view.

    1.  Select **All**.

    2.  In the **Filter** field, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    3.  Press Enter.

2.  Search for a system property record with name **glide.ais.genius\_result.qna\_mode**.

    -   If a system property record with this name exists, open the record by selecting it.
    -   If no system property record with this name exists, select **New**, then enter `glide.ais.genius_result.qna_mode` in the System Property form's **Name** field.
3.  In the System Property form's **Value** field, enter one of the following values:

    -   **none** if you want to disable factoid extraction and highlighting for Q&amp;A Genius Results.
    -   **sentence** if you want Q&amp;A Genius Result answer cards to display only the sentence containing the factoid \(and to highlight the factoid\).
    -   **snippet** if you want Q&amp;A Genius Result answer cards to display the full extracted text snippet containing the factoid \(and to highlight the factoid\).
    For details on these system property values, see the [System properties for factoid extraction in Q&amp;A Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/sys-props-factoid-extract-qna-gr.md) section.

4.  Save the modified System Property record by selecting **Submit** or **Update**.
