# Factoid extraction for Q&amp;A Genius Results

Factoid extraction uses the machine reading comprehension \(MRC\) model to find the exact span of text within a longer extracted snippet that represents the answer to your question.

## Enabling factoid extraction

To enable factoid extraction for Q&amp;A Genius Results, set the **glide.ais.genius\_result.qna\_mode** system property to **sentence** or **snippet**.

To learn about the effects of this system property's values, see the [System properties for factoid extraction in Q&amp;A Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/sys-props-factoid-extract-qna-gr.md) section.

## Examples of factoid extraction
