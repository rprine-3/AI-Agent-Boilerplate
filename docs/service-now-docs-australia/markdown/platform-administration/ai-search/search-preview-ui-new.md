# Search Preview UI for AI Search

The Search Preview UI enables you to test AI Search queries using settings from a selected search application configurationor search profile. Administrator tools help you review search query performance data and feedback, debug queries, and override default query settings for testing purposes.

**Note:** The new Search Preview UI feature is included with AI Search. It replaces the legacy Search Preview UI that's included with Advanced AI Search Management Tools. The new version provides additional functionality when compared with the legacy version, and offers a revised and cleaner interface.

Access the new Search Preview UI by navigating to **AI Search** &gt; **Preview** &gt; **Search Preview \(New\)**.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform® roles

-   The ais\_admin role is required to view and use the Search Preview UI.
-   The impersonator role is required for some AI Search administrator tools.
-   The ais\_high\_security\_admin role is required to bypass search source and content security filtering. For details on this procedure, see [Diagnose search result access issues using the Search Preview UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/diagnose-srch-result-access-ais.md).

1. Preview types list

</td><td>

Select the type of preview you want to view.-   **Full visual view**: preview search query results using the search profile and display settings defined for the search application configuration record selected in the **Search Application** list.
-   **Text view**: preview search query results using a search profile selected in the **Search Profile** list. When previewing in text view, features from search application configurations, such as auto-complete suggestions, aren't available.

</td></tr><tr><td>

2. Search mode list

</td><td>

Select the search mode you want to use for your search query.-   **Keyword search**: Use the legacy keyword search mode to find the best matches for your search query terms.
-   **Hybrid search**: Use the hybrid search mode, blending keyword search and semantic vector search to find the best combination of search precision and contextual relevance for your search query.

**Note:** Hybrid search applies to any indexed source that's included in the semantic index. By default, the following indexed sources ship with preconfigured semantic indexing and work with hybrid search:

    -   Knowledge Table indexed source \[kb\_knowledge table\]
    -   Catalog Item Table indexed source \[sc\_cat\_item table\]
    -   Skills indexed source \[sys\_gen\_ai\_skill table\]
    -   All External Content Connectors indexed sources \[connector-specific tables\]
You can manually configure additional indexed sources to be included in the semantic index, extending hybrid search to those sources as well. For details on this procedure, see [Configure semantic indexing settings for an indexed source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/configure-semantic-indexing-ais.md).
