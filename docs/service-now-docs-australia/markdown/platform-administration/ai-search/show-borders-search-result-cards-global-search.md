## About this task

By default, AI Search displays no borders between search result cards on the global search results page.

    UI Builder opens in a new browser tab.

2.  In the list of available experiences, open the **Unified Navigation App** record.

    UI Builder reloads and displays settings for the Search Results \(search Default\) page.

4.  In the Content pane, select the **Body \(Grid\)** &gt; **Search Result Wrapper 1** component.

    Properties, styles, and events for the selected component appear in the configuration panel.

5.  If a `Different application scope` informational message appears, select **Edit in original scope**.

    The system displays an informational message indicating that you are editing in the application scope.
