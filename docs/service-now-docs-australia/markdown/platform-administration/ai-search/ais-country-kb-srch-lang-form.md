# AI Search Country To Search Language form

The AI Search Country To Search Language form enables you to define a knowledge article search language for a country.

For details on defining knowledge article search languages for a country, see [Assign Knowledge article search languages by country](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/assign-kb-srch-langs-country-ais.md).

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Country|Reference to the country from the Country \[core\_country\] table that you want to define an additional knowledge article search language for.|
|Search language|Reference to a language from the Language \[sys\_language\] table that you want AI Search to use for knowledge article searches by users in the selected country.|

**Note:** You can define multiple AI Search Country To Search Language records for the same country, as long as each one has a different knowledge article search language. If you attempt to create multiple records with the same country and the same knowledge article search language, the system displays a warning message and the record insert operation fails.
