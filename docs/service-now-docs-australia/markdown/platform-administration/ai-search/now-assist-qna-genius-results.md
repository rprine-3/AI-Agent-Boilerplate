# Knowledge base articles Genius Results

Knowledge base articles Genius Results use the LLM to generate concise, actionable answers from knowledge article results in Service Portal, Virtual Agent, Employee Center, and global searches.

**Important:** Starting with the Now Assist in AI Search 11 release, the Knowledge base articles Genius Results feature is in maintenance mode. This feature will remain available but will not be updated or supported. Similar and improved functionality is available in the newer Summary Genius Results feature. For more details on this feature, see [Summary Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/now-assist-multi-content-qna-genius-results.md).

## Knowledge base articles Genius Results overview

Knowledge base articles Genius Results send the most relevant knowledge articles from your search to the LLM, which generates answer snippets from the articles' HTML fields.

Each Knowledge base articles Genius Result answer card displays up to three generated answer snippets. For reference, the answer card also includes a link you can select to view the source knowledge articles.

The Knowledge base articles Genius Result answer card contains a snippet that summarizes a knowledge article. Select the answer card's **View article** action link to view the full knowledge article.

**Note:** Because the Knowledge base articles Genius Result answer is automatically generated, it's a good idea to review it for accuracy. You can provide feedback on the answer by selecting the thumbs-up icon \[Omitted image "genius-result-feedback-positive.png"\] Alt text: if the generated answer is accurate, or the thumbs-down icon \[Omitted image "genius-result-feedback-negative.png"\] Alt text: if it's not. Your feedback helps ServiceNow improve future versions of this Genius Result configuration.

Knowledge base articles Genius Results use semantic vector search and legacy keyword search to find knowledge articles that best match the meaning and intent of your search query. For more details on semantic vector search, see [Semantic vector search in AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/semantic-search-ais.md).

The Knowledge base articles Genius Result configuration replaces the original Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration from the base system. The base system's configuration extracts answers from knowledge articles using internal routines instead of using the LLM. To learn more about the base system's Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration, see [Knowledge base articles Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/genius-result-q-a-ais.md).

## Enabling Knowledge base articles Genius Results

You can enable Knowledge base articles Genius Results in your AI Search portals and mobile applications using the ServiceNow® Otto for AI Search Setup module. For details on this procedure, see [Enable ServiceNow Otto for AI Search Genius Results in AI Search portals and mobile applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/enable-now-assist-gr-ais-apps.md).

To use Knowledge base articles Genius Results in global search, you can enable the configuration in the AI Search for Next Experience application. For details on this procedure, see [Enabling Knowledge base articles Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/enabling-now-assist-qa-grs.md).

**Note:** When you activate Knowledge base articles Genius Results in a search application, they're available to all users who search using that application.

## Limitations

By default, Knowledge base articles Genius Results only support English-language searches. Administrators can enable support for other languages by activating Dynamic Translation. To learn more about how content and answers are translated, see [Dynamic Translation for Knowledge base articles Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/dynamic-translation-na-gr.md). For more details on Dynamic Translation, see [Dynamic Translation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/dynamic-translation-overview.md).

Knowledge articles that are boosted or promoted by result improvement rules are more likely to appear as Knowledge base articles Genius Results, but aren't guaranteed to appear.

**Note:** The Knowledge search property settings don't affect Knowledge base articles Genius Results. For more information on these settings, see [Knowledge search properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_KnowledgeProperties.md).

If you have the External Content Connectors ServiceNow® Store application installed, Knowledge base articles Genius Results exclude search results retrieved from external content source systems when generating answers.

## Answer snippet creation for Knowledge base articles Genius Results

AI Search uses the LLM to create each Knowledge base articles answer snippet from a knowledge article record's HTML fields. Each answer card can include up to three snippets. These snippets may all be generated from the same source article or from different source articles.

LLM automatically determines which elements of a knowledge article's text to include in an answer snippet. You can't configure the criteria for this behavior.

The LLM summarizes and abstracts content from the knowledge articles' text fields. Answer snippets displayed on Knowledge base articles Genius Result answer cards may not exist word for word in the source records.

Both AI Search content retrieval and the LLM are continually improving, so Knowledge base articles results for specific queries may vary over time. Because results from the LLM are non-deterministic, you should expect a higher answer variability compared to the base system's Q&amp;A Genius Results.
