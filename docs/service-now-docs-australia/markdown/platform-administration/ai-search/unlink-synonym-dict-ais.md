# Unlink a synonym dictionary from a search profile

Remove a synonym dictionary from a search profile.

## Before you begin

Role required: ais\_admin

## About this task

Unlinking a synonym dictionary from a search profile doesn't delete the dictionary. To delete a synonym dictionary, you must first unlink it from all search profiles. For steps to delete a synonym dictionary, see [Delete a synonym dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/delete-synonym-dict-ais.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **Search Experience** &gt; **Search Profiles**.

2.  Open the search profile that you want to unlink the synonym dictionary from.

3.  In the Synonyms related list, select the option for the synonym dictionary that you want to unlink from the search profile.

4.  Select **Unlink Selected**.


## Result

The selected synonym dictionary disappears from the search profile's Synonyms related list.

## What to do next

To make the change in synonym dictionary linking take effect, publish the search profile. For more information on publishing a search profile, see [Publish an AI Search search profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/publish-search-profile-ais.md).
