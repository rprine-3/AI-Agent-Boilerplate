# Sort Option form

The Sort Option form enables you to create a search result sort option in the search application configuration for an AI Search application.

For details on creating or editing search result sort options, see [Search result sort options in AI Search application configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/sort-options-srch-app-cfg-ais.md).

Label displayed for the search result sort option in the search application's sort menu.

Sort Field

</td><td>

Name of a source table field or common index field that the sort option uses to sort search results. The sort field can be a date, number, or string field.

**Note:** If you specify a sort field of an unsupported type, an error message appears when you attempt to save the sort option.

 Supports the following formats:

-   **Qualified `[indexed_source_table_name].[field_name]` entry**

Sort search results on their values from the specified table's field.

For example, enter `kb_knowledge.author` to sort search results by their Author field values.

**Note:** The parent search application configuration's linked search profile must include a search source derived from the specified indexed source table. If this condition isn't met, an error message appears when you attempt to save the sort option.

-   **Unqualified common index field name**

Sort search results on their values from the specified common AI Search index field.

For example, enter `title` to sort search results based on their titles, or `language` to sort search results based on their language.


 The `[indexed_source_table_name]` qualifier must be the name of a table specified in an indexed source. Don't specify indexed source child table names for this qualifier.

 Special cases include:

-   **Sorting on parent table fields**

If you specify an indexed source parent table's field in a sort option, AI Search includes values from the same field on child tables from the indexed source.

For example, suppose you create an indexed source for custom table Parent \[u\_parent\] which is extended by custom table Child \[u\_child\], and then specify `u_parent.author` as the field for a sort option. When a user applies the sort option, AI Search uses both `u_parent.author` and `u_child.author` field values to sort the search result list.

-   **Sorting on child table fields**

You can specify a field that's unique to an indexed source's child table as a sort option field.

Continuing the previous example, if your Child \[u\_child\] table includes an **Editor** field that's not present on the Parent \[u\_parent\] table, you can define `u_parent.editor` as a sort option field to sort search result s using this field's values.

**Note:** Be sure to specify the parent table's name as the qualifier, not the child table's name.
