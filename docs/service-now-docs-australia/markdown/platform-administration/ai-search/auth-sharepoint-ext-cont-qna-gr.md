# Sign in to Microsoft SharePoint Online to authorize External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results

Obtain an OAuth 2.0 token from Microsoft SharePoint Online so that External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results can find documents and generate answers when you search.

## Before you begin

Only perform this task if your search results page displays this informational message: `To view results generated from SharePoint, you need to be signed in.`

Role required: none

## About this task

External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results use an OAuth 2.0 token to access your Microsoft SharePoint Online instance and search for relevant documents. The OAuth 2.0 token is specific to your Microsoft SharePoint Online user account, so your search only returns documents that you can access.

Perform this task to generate a valid OAuth 2.0 token in Microsoft SharePoint Online and authorize External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results for your searches.

**Note:** How often you need to sign in depends on your Microsoft SharePoint Online instance's settings. Ask your Microsoft SharePoint Online administrator about the OAuth 2.0 token's lifespan.

## Procedure

1.  Select the **Sign in** link in the informational message on your search results page.

2.  When prompted, enter your Microsoft SharePoint Online credentials to authenticate with Microsoft.

    **Note:** This login step submits your credentials directly to Microsoft. If you're unable to authenticate, ask your Microsoft SharePoint Online administrator for assistance.

3.  After you're authenticated, repeat your previous search.

    **Note:** External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results respect your Microsoft SharePoint Online user profile security settings. If you're not seeing an expected Genius Result answer, it's a good idea to check with your Microsoft SharePoint Online administrator to make sure you have access to the appropriate source documents.
