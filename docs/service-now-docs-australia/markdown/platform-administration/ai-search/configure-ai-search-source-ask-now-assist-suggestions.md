# Configure AI Search as the source for Ask ServiceNow Otto suggestions

Enable term highlighting in enhanced chat's Ask ServiceNow Otto suggestions by configuring AI Search as the source for those suggestions.

## Before you begin

You must have at least Now Assist in AI Search 15 installed.

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, Ask ServiceNow Otto suggestions are generated using a prefix-based GlideAggregate query against the Utterance Suggestion \[sys\_suggested\_utterance\] table.

Admins can configure the system to use AI Search as the source for Ask ServiceNow Otto suggestions in enhanced chat. Making this change activates suggestion term highlighting in Ask ServiceNow Otto and provides improvements such as wildcard searching and lemmatization for suggestions.
