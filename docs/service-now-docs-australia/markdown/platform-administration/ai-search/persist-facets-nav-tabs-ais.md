# Clear facet filters when selecting a new source facet bucket

Specify whether AI Search applications should preserve existing facet filters when you select a new source facet bucket.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, AI Search preserves your facet filter selections when you select a new source facet bucket. As an example, suppose that you narrow your search results by selecting the Email field value from the **KB Category** facet displayed on the **All** source facet bucket. If you then select the **Knowledge** source facet bucket, the **KB Category** facet retains your Email selection and still filters your search results accordingly.

Administrators can override this default behavior by setting the value of the **glide.ais.facets.cross\_tab\_persistence** system property. When this system property value is set to **false**, selecting a new source facet bucket removes all facet filters. In the preceding example, selecting the **Knowledge** source facet bucket would remove your **KB Category** facet filter.

This option is global and applies to all AI Search applications on your instance.

**Note:** If an existing facet filter cannot be applied to search results from a selected source facet bucket, AI Search ignores the facet filter. This behavior only occurs in search applications where you've disabled search result counts for facets. For more details on search result counts for facets, see [Show search result counts for facets on the results page for a search application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/display-result-counts-ais.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table's list view.

    1.  Select **All**.

    2.  In the **Filter** field, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    3.  Press Enter.

2.  Open the record for the **glide.ais.facets.cross\_tab\_persistence** system property.

3.  Enter the system property value according to the behavior that you want:

    -   To preserve existing facet filters when a new source facet bucket is selected, set the system property value to **true**.
    -   To remove all facet filters when a new source facet bucket is selected, set the system property value to **false**.
    The default property value is **true**.

4.  Select **Update**.


## Result

All AI Search applications preserve or discard existing facet filters when a new source facet bucket is selected.
