# ServiceNow Otto for AI Search

The ServiceNow Otto for AI Search application combines the power of search with a large language model \(LLM\) to provide actionable AI-generated or AI-selected answers in user searches. By constraining the context passed to the LLM, ServiceNow Otto for AI Search can increase the likelihood that LLM responses are grounded in indexed content.

## ServiceNow Otto for AI Search overview

In Service Portal, Virtual Agent, Employee Center, and global searches, ServiceNow Otto for AI Search includes the following AI Genius Result configurations:

-   **[Summary Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/now-assist-multi-content-qna-genius-results.md)**

    Summary Genius Results use your chosen LLM to generate actionable Genius Result answers synthesized from a variety of content sources. Answers can include content from knowledge articles, Service Catalog items, Knowledge Graph schema nodes, enhanced chat searches and conversations, and external content documents and attachments.

-   **[Knowledge base articles Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/now-assist-qna-genius-results.md)**

    Knowledge base articles Genius Results use the LLM to generate actionable Genius Result answers from the most relevant knowledge article results.

-   **[External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/external-content-qna.md)**

    External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results generate actionable Q&amp;A Genius Result answers from documents in your Microsoft SharePoint Online instance.

-   **[Actions Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/now-assist-catalog-ordering-gr.md)**

    Actions Genius Results use the Now LLM Service to select, filter, and display the most relevant Catalog Item and Virtual Agent topic results as answers.


If a search is broad or unclear, ServiceNow Otto for AI Search may ask follow‑up questions before answering. This disambiguation step helps clarify what the user is looking for and is configurable. For configuration details, see .

AI Genius Result answers enhance search results with actionable answer cards. Each answer card includes links to its source records or external documents.

</table>**Important:**

-   Not all model providers are available for customers with in-country SKUs, and some AI products/features are currently unavailable for in-country customers. For more information, see the [KB1584492](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1584492) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Be sure to check for model provider availability updates in future releases.
-   Some AI products/features are currently unavailable for customers in the FedRAMP, NSC DOD IL5, or Australia IRAP-Protected data centers, self-hosted customers, or in other restricted environments. For more information, see the [KB0743854](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0743854) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Be sure to check for availability updates in future releases.
-   Some AI products/features are currently available only for customers in some regions. Be sure to check for availability updates in future releases.
-   Some AI products and skills are not available in Regulated Markets. For more information, see [KB2593939: Regulated Markets AI Products/Skills Not Available](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e8d7cc82475aba90b7832920326d4362). Be sure to check for availability updates in future releases.

## Language support

ServiceNow Otto for AI Search natively supports searches, content, and answers in English. Additional languages are supported through Dynamic Translation. For details on translation functionality and supported languages, see [Dynamic Translation for Knowledge base articles Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/dynamic-translation-na-gr.md).

## Domain support

By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use AI in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, AI only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)

## AI limitations

This application uses artificial intelligence \(AI\) and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study that generate predictions based on patterns in data. As a result, this application may not always produce accurate, complete, or appropriate information. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this application has been fully trained or tested for your use case. To mitigate these issues, it is your responsibility to test and evaluate your use of this application for accuracy, harm, and appropriateness for your use case, employ human oversight of output, and refrain from relying solely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making purposes. This is especially important if you choose to deploy this application in areas with consequential impacts such as healthcare, finance, legal, employment, security, or infrastructure. You agree to abide by [ServiceNow’s AI Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.servicenow.com/ai-acceptable-use-policy.html), which may be updated by ServiceNow.

## Data processing

This application requires data to be transferred from ServiceNow customers' individual instances to a centralized ServiceNow environment, which may be located in a different data center region from the one where your instance is, and potentially to a third-party cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure. This data is handled per ServiceNow's internal policies and procedures, including our policies available through our [CORE Compliance Portal](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0564067).

## Data collection

ServiceNow collects and uses the inputs, outputs, and edits to outputs of this application to develop and improve ServiceNow technologies including ServiceNow models and AI products. Customers can opt out of future data collection at any time, as described in the [Now Assist Opt-Out page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/opt-out-of-data-sharing-for-now-assist.md).
