# External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results

External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results display concise, actionable AI-generated answers derived from documents in your Microsoft SharePoint Online instance.

**Important:** Starting with the Now Assist in AI Search 10 release, the External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results feature is being prepared for future deprecation. This feature is no longer installed on new instances and is removed from instances where it's not in use, but will continue to be supported on instances where it's in use. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results overview

The External Content Q&amp;A Genius Result configuration searches for documents relevant to your search using an Integration Hub subflow. If it finds sufficiently relevant documents, it sends them to the Now LLM Service, which generates answers from their content and metadata.

Each External Content Q&amp;A Genius Result answer card includes a generated answer. For reference, the answer card also includes a link you can select to download the source documents.

**Note:** Because the External Content Q&amp;A Genius Result answer is automatically generated, it's a good idea to review it for accuracy. You can provide feedback on the answer by selecting the thumbs-up icon \[Omitted image "genius-result-feedback-positive.png"\] Alt text: if the generated answer is accurate, or the thumbs-down icon \[Omitted image "genius-result-feedback-negative.png"\] Alt text: if it's not. Your feedback helps ServiceNow improve future versions of this Genius Result configuration.

When searching for relevant documents, the system uses your Microsoft SharePoint Online credentials and user profile, so your searches generate External Content Q&amp;A Genius Result answers from documents that you can access.

## Enabling External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results

To make External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results available for use in AI Search applications, administrators first need to perform the following steps:

1.  Verify that the ServiceNow IntegrationHub Enterprise Pack Installer \[com.glide.hub.integrations.enterprise\] plugin is installed on your instance. If this plugin isn't installed, you can request it. For details on requesting IntegrationHub plugins, see [Request an Integration Hub plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/request-integrationhub.md).
2.  Create and configure an OAuth application in the Microsoft Azure portal to verify and authorize connection requests from your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance. To learn about this procedure, see [Configure OAuth application in Microsoft Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-oauth-application-in-microsoft-azure.md).
3.  Add the AllSites.FullControl SharePoint delegated permission \(and grant admin consent\) to your new OAuth application in the Microsoft Azure portal. For details on this procedure, see [Configure SharePoint API permissions for your External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results OAuth 2.0 application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/grant-perms-azure-ext-cont-qna-grs.md).
4.  Define OAuth configuration settings for External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results. For full details on the required OAuth settings, see [Configure OAuth settings for External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/configure-oauth-ext-cont-qna-gr.md).

Next, search administrators need to enable External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results in one or more AI Search portals. To learn about this procedure, see [Enable ServiceNow Otto for AI Search Genius Results in AI Search portals and mobile applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/enable-now-assist-gr-ais-apps.md).

After all these steps are completed, AI Search portal users can authorize External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results for their searches by authenticating with Microsoft SharePoint Online. For details on this authentication procedure, see [Sign in to Microsoft SharePoint Online to authorize External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/auth-sharepoint-ext-cont-qna-gr.md).

**Note:** When you activate External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results in a search application, they're available to all users with Microsoft SharePoint Online credentials who search using that application.

## Limitations

By default, External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results only support English-language searches. Administrators can enable support for other languages by activating Dynamic Translation. To learn more about how content and answers are translated, see [Dynamic Translation for Knowledge base articles Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/dynamic-translation-na-gr.md). For more details on Dynamic Translation, see [Dynamic Translation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/dynamic-translation-overview.md).

External Content Q&amp;A Genius Results only generate answers from documents found in your Microsoft SharePoint Online instance. They don't generate answers from sites found in your instance.
