# Configure semantic indexing settings for an indexed source

Specify the semantic indexing configuration settings you want to apply when AI Search indexes records from your indexed sources.

## Before you begin

The AI Search Semantic Controller plugin \(com.glide.ais.semantic\_search\) must be active on your instance. This plugin is automatically activated when any [ServiceNow Otto® application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/platform-now-assist-landing.md) is installed on your instance.

Role required: ais\_admin

## About this task

As an AI Search admin, you can perform this task to choose the fields from and indexed source's table that you want the system to index for semantic vector search. You can also choose the embedding models and content chunking strategy to use for semantically indexed content from the source table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Index** &gt; **Indexed Sources**.

2.  Select the indexed source that you want to configure semantic indexing settings for.

    The selected indexed source opens in Indexed Source form view.

3.  In the Semantic Index Configuration related list, select **New**.

    **Note:** If you don't see the Semantic Index Configuration related list on the Indexed Source form, check with your administrator to make sure that your instance has at least one [ServiceNow Otto application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/platform-now-assist-landing.md) installed. Installing any ServiceNow Otto application activates the AI Search Semantic Controller plugin \(com.glide.ais.semantic\_search\), which is required for semantic index configuration.

4.  On the Semantic Index Configuration form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Semantic Index Configuration form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/semantic-index-configuration-form.md).

5.  Select **Submit**.

    If you're updating an existing semantic index configuration, select **Update** instead.

    The Semantic Index Configuration form reloads and displays your selected field values and the Semantic Index Fields related list.

6.  In the Semantic Index Fields related list, create a record for each field with content that you want to include in the semantic index for the specified indexed source.

    1.  Select **New**.

    2.  On the Semantic Index Field form, fill in the fields.

        For a description of the field values, see [Semantic Index Field form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/semantic-index-field-form.md).

    3.  Select **Submit**.

        The new semantic index field record appears in the Semantic Index Fields related list.


## What to do next

After changing the semantic index configuration settings for an indexed source, you must reindex content from that indexed source. For reindexing steps, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/index-single-source-ais.md).

**Note:** Indexing content for semantic vector search is typically slower than indexing for keyword search. Your indexed source may take more time to reindex once you have defined a semantic index configuration for it.
