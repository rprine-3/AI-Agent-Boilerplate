-   **Draft**: The rule is saved with unpublished changes.
-   **Published**: The rule is saved with all changes published.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Expand Synonyms For Query Conditions

</td><td>

Option for enabling synonym expansion for Query condition arguments. This field disappears if you select **Activate on all queries**. When expanding Query conditions, AI Search only considers active synonyms that are defined in the same search profile and that have a language matching the language of the result improvement rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Triggers

</td><td>

List of conditions that must be met for the result improvement rule to activate. This field disappears if you select **Activate on all queries**. Select one of the following fields as the subject for your condition:

-   **Keywords**: Operates on one or more keywords found in the user's search query. For example, a **\[Keywords\] \[are\] \[password\]** condition is satisfied by searches for `How do I change my password` or `password reset`.
-   **Query**: Operates on the user's full search query. As an example, a **\[Query\] \[is\] \[password reset\]** condition is satisfied by a search for `password reset`, but not by a search for `password reset steps`.
-   **User Context**: Operates on a user context element from the search user's ServiceNow AI Platform® session. The system displays the source table and field after the user context element name. As an example, a **\[User Context - Country \(sys\_user.country\)\] \[is\] \[Japan\]** condition is satisfied when the search user's User \[sys\_user\] record has **country** set to Japan.
