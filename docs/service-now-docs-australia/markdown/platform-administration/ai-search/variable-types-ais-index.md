# Variable types supported by AI Search indexing

AI Search can index searchable content and metadata from multiple variable types found on indexed source records.

## Variable types indexed from variables column

When indexing records from any source table, AI Search retrieves searchable content from supported variable types when they're present in a source record column that has name **variables** and type **Variables**.

Supported variable types include:

-   Email
-   Multi-line text
-   Single-line text
-   URL
-   Wide single-line text

## Service Catalog variable types indexed from Catalog Items

When indexing records from the Catalog Item \[sc\_cat\_item\] table and tables that extend it, AI Search can retrieve searchable content from these Service Catalog variable types:

-   [Multiple choice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/multiple-choice.md)
-   [Select box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/select-box.md)

Other variable types aren't supported for catalog variable indexing.

Catalog variable indexing is not active in the base system, but it's activated if you have the ServiceNow® Otto for AI Search application installed. To learn how to activate and configure catalog variable indexing, see [Activate indexing of catalog variable content on Catalog Item records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/activate-catalog-variable-indexing.md). For details on the ServiceNow Otto for AI Search application, see [ServiceNow Otto for AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/now-assist-ais.md).

For the full list of available Service Catalog variable types, see [Types of Service Catalog variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_VariableTypes.md).
