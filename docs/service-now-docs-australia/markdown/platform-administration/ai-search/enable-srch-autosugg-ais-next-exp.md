# Enable search-based auto-complete suggestions in AI Search for Next Experience

Run a scheduled job to make search-based auto-complete suggestions available in AI Search for Next Experience.

## Before you begin

The AI Search for Next Experience ServiceNow® Store application must be installed on your instance. For details on installing this application, see [Install AI Search for Next Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/install-ais-next-experience-app.md).

Only perform this task if you installed AI Search for Next Experience 3.x on a San Diego instance that you then upgraded to Tokyo or a later release.

Role required: admin

## About this task

If you install AI Search for Next Experience 3.x on a San Diego instance and then upgrade to Tokyo or a later release, the new search-based auto-complete suggestion types introduced in Tokyo aren't automatically enabled in the **\[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration** search application configuration used by global search.

To enable the new search-based auto-complete suggestion types in AI Search for Next Experience and remove the legacy suggestion types that they replace, administrators can run a scheduled job.

Running the scheduled job adds these auto-complete suggestion types to the **\[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration** search application configuration, making them available for global search:

-   Search-based Suggested Results Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration
-   User History Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration

The scheduled job removes these two legacy auto-complete suggestion types from the **\[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration** search application configuration, making them unavailable for global search:

-   Suggested Query Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration
-   Suggested Result Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration

To learn more about auto-complete suggestion types in AIS applications, see [Auto-complete suggestions in AI Search applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/auto-complete-ais.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Open the **Enable search-based suggestions** scheduled job record.

3.  Select **Execute Now**.


## Result

The scheduled job adds these auto-complete suggestion types to the **\[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration** search application configuration:

-   Search-based Suggested Results Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration
-   User History Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration

The scheduled job removes these auto-complete suggestion types from the **\[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration** search application configuration:

-   Suggested Query Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration
-   Suggested Result Reader Group for \[AIS\] Next Experience Search Configuration

Global search uses the updated set of auto-complete suggestion types.
