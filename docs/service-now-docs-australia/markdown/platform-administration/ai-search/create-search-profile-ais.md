## What to do next

To make content searchable using your new search profile, link one or more search sources to it.

Your new search profile includes sample synonym and stop word dictionaries and a default typo handling dictionary. For more details on configuring and populating these dictionaries, see [Synonyms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/synonyms-ais.md), [Stop words](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/stop-words-ais.md), and [Typo handling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/typo-handling-ais.md).
