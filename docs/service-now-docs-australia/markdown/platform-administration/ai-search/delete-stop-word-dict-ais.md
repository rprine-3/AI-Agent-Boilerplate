# Delete a stop word dictionary

Remove a stop word dictionary that isn't linked from any search profile.

## Before you begin

Role required: ais\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **Search Query Settings** &gt; **Dictionaries**.

    The AI Search Dictionaries list appears with a **\[Type\] \[!=\] \[Spell Check\]** filter condition applied and records grouped by dictionary type.

2.  Expand the Stop Word record group if necessary and open the stop word dictionary that you want to delete.

3.  Select **Delete**.

    **Note:** If the stop word dictionary is still linked to any search profiles, deletion fails and an error message lists the linked profiles. Unlink the dictionary from these search profiles, then repeat the preceding steps. For details on unlinking a stop word dictionary from a search profile, see [Unlink a synonym dictionary from a search profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/unlink-synonym-dict-ais.md).


## Result

The selected stop word dictionary disappears from the AI Search Dictionaries list.
