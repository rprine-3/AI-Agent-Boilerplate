# Indexed source retention policies and filter conditions

To limit the set of records indexed from source tables, you can configure retention policies and filter conditions for your indexed sources. AI Search also uses these settings to automatically purge stale records from the index, optimizing search performance.

## Indexed source retention policies

Indexing large source tables, such as the Task \[task\] table and tables that extend it, can add significant numbers of records to the AI Search index. To limit the set of source table records indexed based on the time since they were last updated, select a retention policy for your indexed source.

AI Search only indexes source records updated within the time period defined for the retention policy. For example, if you select a two-year retention policy, AI Search excludes source records that were last updated more than two years ago.

When the time since a source record's last update exceeds the limit from the indexed source's retention policy, AI Search marks the corresponding indexed record as stale.

**Note:** Retention policies are required for indexed sources that index records from the Task \[task\] table or tables that extend it. They are optional for other indexed sources.

## Indexed source filter conditions

To limit the set of records indexed from a source table, define filter conditions for your indexed source. AI Search only indexes records that match all defined filter conditions.

Adding filter conditions can reduce the number of records indexed from a source table and reduce indexing frequency. As an example, if you exclude frequently updated open records based on their status, AI Search doesn't index data from those records, reducing your index size and the compute resources needed to index changes from the source table.

When a source record no longer satisfies the indexed source's filter conditions, AI Search marks the corresponding indexed record as stale.

**Note:** . Adding filter conditions doesn't reduce the number of AI Search indexing events generated for the indexed source. The system generates indexing events for every change to an indexed source table, unless the change is to a column that has a **no\_text\_index** field setting defined in the indexed source. The filter condition can reduce the number of records indexed for each event, however.

## Purging stale records

AI Search automatically purges stale records from the index daily. Users with the admin role can manually purge stale records. For details on this procedure, see [Purge stale records from the AI Search index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/purge-stale-records-ais-index.md).
