# Using the form designer

Administrators or users with the personalize\_form role can use the form design feature to quickly create new or change existing form views.

**Important:** Starting with the Australia release, form designer is being prepared for future deprecation. Try configuring your forms with Form Builder instead. Form Builder has all of the Form Designer and Form Layout options. It also has other robust features that help you configure each aspect of the form. For more information, see [Accessing Form Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/access-form-builder.md).

With form design, you can accomplish the same tasks that you can with form layout in a graphical tool called the form designer. You can also access field properties and add information from macros or previously scripted UI elements.

Form design is an alternative to configuring forms that combines several configuration options into one tool. It is available by default for new instances and requires Core UI . Administrators who upgrade from a previous version must activate the Form Designer \(com.glide.ui.ng.fd\) plugin to use the feature.

Access Form Designer by opening an existing form, selecting the Additional actions icon \(\[Omitted image "additional-actions.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions icon\), and then navigating to **Configure** &gt; **Form Design**.

-   **The page header**

    The page header displays the current table and view being designed. Each form is tied to a unique table and view combination. For example, there can only be one form for the incident table default view. Select a different view to modify different form layouts for a table.

-   **The field navigator**

    The field navigator allows you to manage fields on the form. It contains the following elements:

    -   **Filter**: Allows text search on the currently selected tab.
    -   **Fields**: Displays a list of existing fields you can add to the current form.
    -   **Field Types**: Displays a list of field types you can add to the current form. Adding a field type to the form layout creates fields in the selected table when the form layout is saved.

    Field properties are accessed by clicking the gear icon that appears when you point to a field in the form layout.

-   **Form layout**

    The form layout displays a separate cell for each field, section, annotation, UI element, and related list that is on the form. Each cell has an identifying label and a handle icon to aid in selecting and moving it. The location of the cell in the form layout represents its relative position on the form. Only fields visible on the form layout are displayed on a form.
