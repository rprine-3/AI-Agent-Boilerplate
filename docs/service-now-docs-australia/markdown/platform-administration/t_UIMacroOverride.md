# Override a formatter with macros

The system uses formatters to handle complex rendering of specific form elements.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_macro\_admin

## About this task

Examples of form elements rendered by formatters in the base platform are:

-   Activity formatter: Displays the list of activities, or history, on a task form.
-   Process flow formatter: Displays the different stages in a linear process flow across the top of a record.
-   Task parent breadcrumbs formatter: Provides breadcrumbs to show the parent or parents of the current task.
-   Approval summarizer formatter: Displays dynamic summary information about the element being approved.

A UI macro can override formatters provided in the base system.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System UI** &gt; **UI Macros**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter the same name as the formatter you want to override, but omit the .xml extension.

4.  Complete the remaining fields on the form.

5.  Click **Submit**.


## Example

This example shows the form that defines the existing approval summarizer formatter:

\[Omitted image "Formatter.png"\] Alt text: Approval summarizer formatter

Here is the form for the UI macro that overrides the approval summarizer formatter:

\[Omitted image "FormatterOverride.png"\] Alt text: Override the formatter
