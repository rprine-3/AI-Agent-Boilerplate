Indicates whether there is an event delegator enabled. The event delegator is responsible for delegating out events to queues that use the delegated event functionality. Clicking on the card will take you to the list of delegators. Number of delegators in green is positive.**Note:** This card shows up only if the **Queue** uses the delegator model. If this card shows up, the **Active Jobs** card doesn't show up. If no queue is selected, **Active Delegators**, **Active Processors**, and **Active Jobs** cards show up simultaneously.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active Processors

</td><td>

The number of active event processors in the event system. Click on the card to take you to the list of active processors \(if any\). Number in red indicates that the processor needs to be configured.**Note:** This card shows up only if the **Queue** uses the delegator model.
