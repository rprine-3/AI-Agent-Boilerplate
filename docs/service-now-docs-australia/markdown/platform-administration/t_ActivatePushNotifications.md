# Activate push notifications

Several plugins must be activated to use push notifications. If you have the Mobile UI \(com.glide.ui.m\) plugin active, push notification plugins are automatically activated.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Ensure the following plugins are active on your instance:

-   Push Notification: Provides the necessary components and REST APIs to send push notifications to mobile devices.
-   Notification System Push Addon: Adds support for push notifications to the existing notification system.
-   Push Feedback: Handles feedback from Apple on which devices are no longer valid so they do not keep receiving push notifications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  On the All Applications page, select **Request Plugin** to open the request form on Now Support.

3.  On Now Support, select the link to access the Now Support Service Portal Service Catalog.
