# Dynamic actions script for list context menus

The **Dynamic actions script** field, on the Context Menu form, defines a script. The script populates a list context menu with dynamic options, such as filters or views.

The following JavaScript variables are available to the dynamic actions script when it is executed.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|g\_tableName|Name of the current table.|
|g\_listId|ID of the list for which the context menu is built.|
|g\_itemName|Name defined in the UI context menu record.|
|g\_itemOrder|Order defined in the UI context menu record. Use this variable to pass the value of the **Order** field to the dynamic actions script.|
|g\_contextMenu.addAction\(item\_id, label, script\_string, order\)|Add options to the context menu and select the order in which they appear.|

The following example displays a list title menu item that controls the number of records per page in the list view.

```
g_contextMenu.addAction('50', g_itemName, 'showRowsPerPage("50");', g_itemOrder);
```

**Note:** The action script for this item must define the showRowsPerPage function so that when selecting this menu item, that function is called with an argument of 50.
