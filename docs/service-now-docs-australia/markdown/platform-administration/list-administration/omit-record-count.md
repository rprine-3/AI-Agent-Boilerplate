# Omit record count in a list

Speed up how fast lists load by removing the calculation of the total number of records in a list.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_admin

## About this task

Calculating the total number of records included in a list that's filtered from large tables can take a long time. Platform displays the total number of records in the list.

To load lists faster, you can remove the page calculation for all or only specified filtered lists. When you remove the calculation, the total record count is not displayed and the Last Page icon \(\[Omitted image "double-arrow-forward.jpg"\] Alt text: Forward arrows\) is grayed out.

\[Omitted image "no-pagination.jpg"\] Alt text: No pagination

## Procedure

1.  Open a list, for example navigate to **Incident** &gt; **All**.

2.  Right-click a header in the list and navigate to **Configure** &gt; **List Control**.

3.  Select **Remove pagination count**.

4.  To omit the record count only in specific view:

    1.  Select **Remove pagination count for specific views**.

    2.  Beside **Specific list of views prevented from getting full record count**, select the lock icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-lock.png"\] Alt text: Lock icon\).

    3.  Select the search icon \(\[Omitted image "magnifying-glass.png"\] Alt text: Search icon\) and select the view where platform omits the page count.

    4.  Repeat the previous step for as many views as necessary.

5.  Select **Update**.
