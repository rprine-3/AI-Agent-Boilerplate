## Example of configuring list controls

The following example shows how to configure a list of related incidents in a problem record to suit specific business needs.

### Before you begin

Role required: personalize\_control

### About this task

In this example, a related list label is configured to say `Child Incidents`, not just `Incidents`. The related list is also configured to remove the **New** button to prevent users from creating incidents from the Problem form.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to a problem record.

2.  Open the list context menu in the **Incidents** related list and select **Configure** &gt; **List Control**.

3.  On the List Control form, change the **Label** field to `Child Incidents`.

4.  Select the **Omit new button** check box.

5.  Select **Submit** to save your changes and return to the previous record, in this case, the problem record.

    In the problem record, the label for the embedded incident list has changed and the **New** button is no longer available.
