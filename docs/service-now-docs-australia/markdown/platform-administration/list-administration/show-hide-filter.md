# Show/hide filter controls

The Show/hide filter used in the list configuration, lists the fields to configure in the filter conditions.

The fields mentioned in the Show/hide filter are sorted in an alphabetical order.

**Note:** If the name of the fields start with an accented character, those fields are placed at the end of the list.

You can enable the **guide.ui.condition\_builder.sort\_labels\_by\_locale** sys property to sort the fields of the Show/hide filter as per the locale-based language. The sys property is set to **False**, by default. If you have a customized script that's based on alphabetical sorting of the fields, the locale-based language setting might break your script. So, you can enable the sys property only when you need the filter to be locale-based language.

**Note:** If the sys property is not enabled, the fields are sorted in an alphabetical order. The fields starting with an accented character are placed at the end of the list.
