# Run multiple data jobs

Running the data job/jobs is the fourth step in transforming a field. This topic explains how to run data jobs for multiple field transformations.

## Procedure

1.  Start the Transform application data job to apply the transform to all the appropriate records in the database.

2.  Navigate to **Field Normalization** &gt; **Data Jobs** &gt; **All**.

3.  Select the check boxes for the jobs you want to start.

    **Note:** These jobs must have the **Mode** set to **Active**.

4.  Select **Start** from the **Actions** menu.

    **Note:** The platform only runs data jobs from Active transformations. The Action menu indicates the number of Active data jobs that can run. For example, the menu might display Start \(3 of 4\).
