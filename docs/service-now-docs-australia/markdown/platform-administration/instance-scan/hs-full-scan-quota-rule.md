# Implement a scan timeout threshold

Set the execution time of a single scan by implementing **Transaction Quota Rules**. Setting of a quota rule prevents your instance from running a long scan.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Transaction Quota Rules**.

2.  To set a definite execution time, select **Scan timeout**.

3.  Enter the definite execution time in the **Maximum Duration \(seconds\)** field and select **Update**.

    **Note:** The minimum allowed timeout threshold is 5 seconds. If you set the timeout to anything less than 5 seconds, the system still considers it to be 5 seconds. By default, it has been set to 10,800 seconds.

    The scan fails if the execution time exceeds the set timeout. For more information on the type of scan you want to run, see [Configuring Instance Scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/instance-scan/hs-intro-scans.md) .
