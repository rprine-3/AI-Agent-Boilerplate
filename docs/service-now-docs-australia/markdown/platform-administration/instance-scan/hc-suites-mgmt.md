# Suites management

A suite is a collection of individual checks and suites that can be used for a scan. Suites can be created for specific business needs. All child suites are executed when a parent suite is used in a scan.

Navigate to **Instance Scan** &gt; **Suites**. Select one of the suites from the list. Select **Execute Suite Scan** to run a suite scan. See [Execute a suite scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/instance-scan/hc-execute-suite-scan.md) for more information.\[Omitted image "hc-suites.png"\] Alt text: Image showing a suite

**Note:** Some ServiceNow provided suites are protected suites and the checks in the suite are not modifiable. For example, if you have a suite from the app store, the suite is unmodifiable. You can't add a child suite to the unmodifiable suite. But you can add a parent suite because it doesn't affect the suite.
