Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

glide.scan.inactive\_records

</td><td>

-   Controls whether instance scan considers inactive records, where active=false
-   The default value is false. Instance Scan scans only the active records
-   When enabled, scans will include inactive records in the health check evaluation

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.scan.max\_parallel\_scans

</td><td>

-   Defines the maximum number of instance scans that can run concurrently
-   The default value is 5
-   Used by the scan queue system to limit parallel scan execution

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.scan.parallel\_scan\_enabled

</td><td>

-   Enables or disables the parallel scan feature
-   The default value is true
-   When enabled, it allows multiple scans to run simultaneously based on the max\_parallel\_scans limit

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.scan.queue.enabled

</td><td>

-   Enables or disables the instance scan queue system
-   The default value is true
-   When enabled, scan requests are queued and processed based on available capacity

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.scan.base\_system\_records

</td><td>

-   Controls whether instance scan checks out-of-box \(base system\) records
-   The default value is false. The Base system records are skipped

**Note:** The Base system records are determined by checking if they would be replaced during an upgrade using the CollisionAPI.

-   When enabled, scans will include records that would be replaced on upgrade \(non-customized ServiceNow delivered records\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.scan.sn\_non\_standard\_scopes\_list

</td><td>

-   Comma-separated list of ServiceNow scopes that shouldn't be treated as third-party scopes
-   The default value is ""
-   Used to exclude specific non-standard ServiceNow scopes from being classified as ISV/third-party applications during scan classification
