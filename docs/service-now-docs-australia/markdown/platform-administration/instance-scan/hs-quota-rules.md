# Timeout threshold

A timeout determines the execution threshold of a scan from running long scans. For example, any scan running longer than the set time period results in a failure.

If the scan or the check takes longer than the set time period set by the quota rule, an error message appears.

**Note:** By default the scans are limited to three hours and individual checks are limited to 10 minutes.

To learn how to configure these thresholds, see [Implement a scan timeout threshold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/instance-scan/hs-full-scan-quota-rule.md) and [Implement a check timeout threshold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/instance-scan/hs-health-check-quota-rule.md).
