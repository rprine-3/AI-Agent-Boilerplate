# Setting notification preferences in Core UI

You can set your own notification preferences, including personal subscriptions and channels for receiving them. All users can set these preferences through the **Notifications** tab of the System Settings window.

With the **Notifications** tab, you can:

-   Search for a specific notification in the list of your notifications.
-   Use a global switch to enable or disable all your notifications.
-   Enable or disable a particular channel for receiving notifications, as well as create, edit, or delete channels.
-   Control the notifications that you receive and apply conditions to restrict notification delivery.
-   Create personal notifications, which are subscriptions to notifications that are important to you.

## Comparison between notification preferences in Core UI and earlier interfaces

In new and upgraded instances that use the Core UI interface, the System Settings window is the central location for managing your notification preferences for Next Experience. The Notification Preference User Interface plugin \(com.glide.notification.preference.ui\) is activated by default.

In UI15 and earlier interfaces:

-   Users set notification preferences through the **Notification Preferences** link in the User form \(**Self service** &gt; **My Notification Preferences**\).
-   Admins created user devices and set notification preferences for users through the **Notification Preferences** link in the User form, accessed through the User Administration module \(**User Administration** &gt; **Users**\).

    **Note:**

    Admins can revert to the UI15 notification preferences interface by setting the **glide.notification.preference.UI.enabled** property to false.


## Manage your notification preferences in Core UI

**Note:**

To switch to the Core UI from Next Experience, set the property **glide.ui.polaris.core.notification\_preference.enabled** to true.

To access your notification preferences, click the gear icon \(\[Omitted image "IconUI16Gear.png"\] Alt text: gear icon\) in the banner frame, and in the System Settings window, click the **Notifications** tab. You can also access the System Settings by navigating to **Self Service** &gt; **My Notification Preferences**.
