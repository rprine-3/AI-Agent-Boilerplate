# Notification agent

Use the Notification agent to create and modify email notifications, templates, and layouts through conversation, reducing the need of navigating complex forms and scripts.

## Notification agent capabilities

The Notification agent is an agentic AI feature that simplifies the process of creating and modifying email notifications, template, and layouts using natural language prompts.

Describe your notification requirement, and the agent handles configuration, templates, layouts, and duplicate detection.

## End to end notification creation using the Notification agent

The following table shows how a platform administrator creates, applies email templates, tests, and activates a P1 incident notification using the agent chat interface.
