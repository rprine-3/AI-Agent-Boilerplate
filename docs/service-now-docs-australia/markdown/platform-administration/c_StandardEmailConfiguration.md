# Basic email setup

All production instances can send and receive email using ServiceNow - provided resources. The instance has an email address of instance@service-now.com.

## Network layout for standard email configuration

Below is an example of a basic email network with ServiceNow as the domain.

## Basic email services and features

-   Mail servers maintained by ServiceNow.
    -   Encrypt mail with opportunistic TLS \(Transport Layer Security\) if supported by your mail servers.

        If your internal mail servers send and receive messages via a TLS-encrypted channel, ServiceNow mail servers support that communication.

    -   Provide a dedicated mailbox for your instance.
-   Pre-configured email accounts to connect to ServiceNow mail servers.
    -   An SMTP account sends email to your primary Mail Exchange \(MX\) server from your instance email address of instance@service-now.com.
    -   A POP3 account receives email sent to your instance email address of instance@service-now.com.
-   High availability features from ServiceNow datacenters.
-   Spam detection for incoming email.

Administrators who want to use basic email services can do so by enabling the email properties for sending and receiving email.
