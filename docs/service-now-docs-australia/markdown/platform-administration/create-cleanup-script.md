# Create cleanup scripts

Use cleanup scripts to automate post-clone steps or to modify data after your clone.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Verify that custom scripts have proper error handling to avoid issues. Without proper error handling, failing customized scripts can help prevent subsequent scripts from executing.

**Note:** After your clone completes, you can monitor the execution status of each cleanup script on the target instance. See [Monitor cleanup script execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/monitor-cleanup-script-execution.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Clone Admin Console** &gt; **Clone Home**.

2.  Select **Configuration** from the secondary navigation.

3.  Select the **Cleanup scripts** tab.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  Enter a name for your script.

6.  Select the order number for your script.

7.  Check **Active** when your script is ready.

8.  Enter your script in the **Script** field, and select **Save**.


## Disable emails

To create a cleanup script to disable emails, do the following.

-   Select **New** on the cleanup scripts tab.
-   Add the name `Disable emails`.
-   Check **Active**.
-   In the script field, add

    ```
    gs.setProperty("glide.email.read.active", false);gs.setProperty("glide.email.smtp.active", false);
    ```

    .

-   Select **Update**.

## What to do next

After your clone completes, go to the target instance to monitor cleanup script execution and retry any failed scripts. See [Monitor cleanup script execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/monitor-cleanup-script-execution.md).
