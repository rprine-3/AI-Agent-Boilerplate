## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

The usage\_admin, sn\_sub\_man.admin, or admin role is required to view and edit Subscription Management.

## Accessing Creator Plus entitlements

Access details about Creator Plus entitlements by navigating to **Admin** &gt; **Subscription Management** &gt; **Subscriptions** &gt; **Now Assist creators**.

## Use cases

-   Compare the total number of Creator Plus entitlements that your company has purchased to the total number of Creator Plus entitlements allocated across all your instances.
-   Monitor the number of Creator Plus entitlements that are allocated to unique users across all your instances in the **Distinct allocated users** card.

    **Note:** Users allocated to a Creator Plus subscription on multiple instances are automatically de-duplicated in the total count. When a user is allocated to a Creator Plus subscription on more than one instance, that user counts toward the allocation total only once.

-   View Creator Plus allocations by instance in the **Allocated users** column in the **Instances** list.

    In some scenarios, data isn't displayed in the **Instances** list.

    -   Only instances on Washington DC Patch 2 and higher are listed in the **Instances** list.
    -   If data sharing is restricted on an instance, usage data for that instance is hidden. You can disable the restriction by updating the trust configuration on that instance. See [Share subscription data from another instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/share-subscription-data.md).
-   View Creator Plus product subscription details by selecting a product in the **Subscriptions** list. On the details page, allocate available Creator Plus subscriptions by adding one or more groups with the Creator role.
