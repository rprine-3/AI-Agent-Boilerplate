# Locating translatable UI strings

Locate individual untranslated strings to provide your own translation of customer-created and customer-edited strings, such as field names and messages.

The internationalization \(I18N\) language plugins contain only translations of the UI content that ServiceNow provides by default in your instance. If you have customized UI strings that you want to translate, you can identify and translate these strings manually. To perform these translations, you must first take the following actions:

-   Identify the strings that need to be translated.
-   Identify which translation tables contain the strings.

To identify strings that have not been translated into any language and their translation tables, see [List untranslated items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/t_ExportAnUntranslatedString.md).

If you know where a string appears in the UI and only have a small amount of material to translate, consider using the debug functionality to identify which strings are translatable and their translation tables. This functionality consists of prefixes that appear before all translatable strings and identify the translation table that the strings are in. For more information, see [Debug translations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/t_DisplayATranslationPrefix.md).
