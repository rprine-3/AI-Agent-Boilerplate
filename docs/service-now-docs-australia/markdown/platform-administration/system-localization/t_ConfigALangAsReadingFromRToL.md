# Configure a language as reading from right to left

Use the Text Direction field to configure a language that reads from right to left, such as Hebrew.

## About this task

Right-to-left language support is available only in the main user interface and on live feed. Other user interfaces and applications, such as the graphical Workflow Editor, reporting, CMS, chat, and the ServiceNow documentation sites, are not supported.

    For example, Hebrew is `he`.
