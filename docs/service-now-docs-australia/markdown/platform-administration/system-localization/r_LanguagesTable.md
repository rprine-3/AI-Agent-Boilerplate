# Languages table

The Languages \[sys\_language\] table contains a list of the languages for which translated text is available.

To enable translation to a new language, add a record to the Languages table. The main fields for this table are:

-   Name: Language name
-   ID: [BCP 47](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) code for the language
-   Text Direction: Direction of text in this language
-   Active: Indicator that shows whether the language has been activated \(true\) for this instance or not \(false\)
-   Fallback: Name of the language that the instance uses if a translation is not available
