# Export and edit translation records

Export translation records to translate to additional languages in your preferred translation environment and import the new or edited translation records through import sets.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Using the Localization Framework application is recommend for translating to an unsupported language or translating large amounts of custom UI string content in a supported language. For more information, see [Localization Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-framework/localization-framework-landing.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

In the following cases, translate strings in the UI outside of the ServiceNow AI Platform and import them through import sets:

-   You have a significant amount of customer-created UI components and you want to translate these components into other languages.
-   You want to modify translations that ServiceNow provides in internationalization plugins.
-   You want to translate an instance into a language that ServiceNow does not support with internationalization plugins. For more information, see [Translating to an unsupported language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/self-localize.md).

All translatable UI strings items are stored in translation table records. The only time you would translate UI directly in translation records is when you have a small amount of customer-created UI components and you know exactly where they are. For more information about translation tables, see [Translation tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/r_TranslationTables.md) and [Translating individual UI strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/c_TranslateIndFieldLabelsAndValues.md).

## Procedure

1.  If you are translating customer-created UI components, locate the translatable strings.

    For more information, [Locating translatable UI strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/c_TranslateNewCustomizations.md).

2.  Export the relevant translation table records into a format \(such as Excel\) that can be easily manipulated.

    For more information about exporting a list of records, see [Export data from a list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/export-list-data.md).

3.  Within the exported document, translate the following fields in each row, depending on the translation table:

    |Translation table|Fields to translate|
    |-----------------|-------------------|
    |Field Labels|Label, Plural, Hint|
    |Translated Name/Field|Label \(translate\)|
    |Message|Message|
    |Choices|Label|
    |Translated Text|Value|

4.  Within each row, change the "Language" column to the [BCP 47](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) code of the new language.

    In Translated Text and Message records, type the full name of the language instead of the BCP 47 code.

5.  Save your changes.


## What to do next

Import the translated document back into the instance as an import set.

## Import a translation from an Excel spreadsheet

The System Import Sets application contains import tables and corresponding transform maps to assist with importing translations from an Excel spreadsheet.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Import Sets** &gt; **Load Data**.

2.  Select **Use Existing** and the **Table name** that matches the type of data being imported, as follows.

    -   For choices, select the `[u_sys_choice]` table.
    -   For field labels, select the `[u_sys_documentation]` table.
    -   For translated names and fields, select the `[u_sys_translated]` table.
    -   For messages, select the `[u_sys_ui_message]` table.
    -   For translated text, select the `[u_sys_translated_text]` table.
3.  Select **Upload an Excel file**, and then click **Browse** to select the source Excel spreadsheet.

4.  If appropriate, specify the Work sheet and Header row number.

5.  Select **Go**.

    The translations are now available in the appropriate Import Set Table.

6.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Import Sets** &gt; **Table Name** and review the imported information to verify that the import was successful.

7.  To transform the imported data into the corresponding table, navigate to **All** &gt; **System Import Sets** &gt; **Run Transform**.

8.  Select the appropriate transform map, as follows.

    **Note:** Make sure you choose a transform map that has the **Run Business Rule** option selected. If the transform map does not have this option selected, any customized translations you have may be overwritten during the next upgrade.

    -   For choices, select the **Sys Choice Translation Map**.
    -   For field labels, select the **Sys Documentation Translation Map**.
    -   For translated names and fields, select the **Sys Translated Translation Map**.
    -   For messages, select the **Sys UI Message Translation Map**.
    -   For translated text, select the **Sys Translated Text Translation Map**.
9.  Select **Transform**.
