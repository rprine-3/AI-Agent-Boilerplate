# Set the default language for an instance

Change the language that appears by default for an instance.

## Before you begin

Activate the languages that your users need. For more information, see [Activate a language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/t_ActivateALanguage.md) for supported languages or [Translating to an unsupported language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/self-localize.md) for custom translations.

Role required: admin

## About this task

This property defines the language that users with a role see if a language is not specified in their user record. Users without a role see the default guest language, as described in [User specific language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/r_UserSpecificLanguage.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **System Localization**.

2.  In the **Default language for the system \(two character values\)** field, enter a two-character language code.

    You can set the default language to any language that is active on the instance. The following language codes and languages are examples of possible values.
