# Translate a field label

Field labels are the names that appear on forms and lists to describe the type of information the field contains.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following procedure works best for translating individual field labels, such as those added with a customization. To translate large numbers of field labels, use the procedure described in [Export and edit translation records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/t_TranslateTheInterface.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the field on the form.

2.  Right-click the field label and select **Configure Label**.

3.  In the Field Label form, replace the English text with the text of the target language in the Label, Plural, and Hint fields.

4.  Enter the [BCP 47](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) code of the target language.

5.  Right-click the header bar and select **Insert**.

    Selecting **Insert** creates a new record in the Field Label \[sys\_documentation\] table for this field label in the selected language. For more information about this table, see [Field Label table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/system-localization/r_FieldLabelTable.md).
