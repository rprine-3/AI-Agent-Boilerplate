# Preview predicted changes

Use the previewed changes table to view the list of total records that are predicted to change when the upgrade occurs.

## Preview skipped list prediction

The **Total record changes** also includes records that are predicted to be skipped due to various reasons. The most common reason is due to customization. The reason an upgrade skips customizations is to avoid overwriting your customizations. Upgrade Preview attempts to predict which records will be skipped when the actual upgrade occurs. It predicts skips due to customizations, and some of the other more complex scenarios as well. It is possible to use Upgrade Preview to address these predicted customization skips before the upgrade occurs, which can prevent that skip from happening.

Click **View preview details** link on the **Previewing version** card. The Upgrade Preview form appears along with the following related lists details.

-   Predicted Skip: The system won't change this record in order to preserve customizations.
-   Predicted Skip \(Manual Merge\): The system won't change this record because updating it requires manual intervention.
