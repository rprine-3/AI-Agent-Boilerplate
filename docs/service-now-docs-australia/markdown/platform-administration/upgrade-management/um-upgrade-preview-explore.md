# Explore Upgrade Preview in Upgrade Console

Leverage the Upgrade Preview module to conduct in-depth assessments of your ServiceNow instance prior to an upgrade. Explore how different release versions may affect your current configurations and fine-tune your upgrade plan accordingly.

The preview status info and link in the message displayed on top of the Upgrade Preview page states the current status of the ongoing preview process. Since you can get an accurate prediction on the new and existing applications and their skipped records, the preview execution time has increased considerably. Click on the link in the message to see the status of the preview process.

The Execution Tracker record shows up on clicking the progress link in the message. Click Show status related list to show the current status of the executed preview process.

**Note:** Depending on the eligibility of your instance, the list of available target versions for preview varies. Only versions that are allowed for a particular instance to be upgraded to, show up on the list. If your instance is not eligible to be upgraded to any version, the drop-down menu is empty.

The following cards show up with more information.
