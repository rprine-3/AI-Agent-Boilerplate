# Review skipped records using related lists

Use different related lists to resolve, track and review the skipped records in an upgrade.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Upgrade History using one of the following ways.

    |Option|Navigation|
    |------|----------|
    |Using left navigation|Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **Upgrade Management** &gt; **Upgrade History**.|
    |Using Admin tab option|Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Upgrade Management** &gt; **Upgrade History**.|

    A list of upgrades is displayed.

2.  Select an upgrade from the list.

    System Upgrades form is displayed.

3.  Select any of the following related lists to review the skipped records.

    -   **Skipped Changes to Review related list**

        Resolve the skipped update records by tracking and reviewing them in the Skipped Changes to Review related list. To prevent your customizations from being overwritten during system upgrades, the upgrade process skips \(does not apply the update to\) objects that have been customized. See [Resolve a skipped update and set a resolution status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/upgrade-management/um-resolve-skipped-update.md) for more information.

    -   **Skipped Changes Reviewed related list**

        View the list of the reviewed skipped records in the Skipped Changes Reviewed related list. When you select a skipped record to review and set a **Resolution Status** to a value other than Not Reviewed, the update record moves from Skipped Changes to Review related list to the Skipped Changes Reviewed related list.

    -   **Copies to Review related list**

        Copies to Review lists all the records that need to be reviewed.

    -   **Copies Reviewed related list**

        Copies Reviewed lists all the records that have been reviewed.

    -   **Customization Unchanged related list**

        Customizations Unchanged lists all records that were skipped \(due to a customization\), but there have been no changes from the last upgrade. See [Revert a customization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/upgrade-management/um-revert-customization.md) for more information.

    -   **Changes Applied related list**

        Changes Applied lists all changes that were applied in this upgrade.

    -   **Claim Outcomes to Review related list**

        During system upgrades, the Claim Status tab displays outcomes to review and resolve.

    -   **Upgrade Details related list**

        Upgrade Details lists all Upgrade Details records for this upgrade.

    **Note:** The Copies to Review and Copies Reviewed related lists are Platform specific related lists.
