# Skipped Records visual task board \(VTB\)

View the resolution status of any previous upgrade with skipped records using the visual task board \(VTB\) view. An upgrade history record is created for each upgrade that is run.

To view the history report navigate to Upgrade History using one of the following ways.

|Option|Navigation|
|------|----------|
|Using left navigation|Navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Center** &gt; **Upgrade Management** &gt; **Upgrade History**.|
|Using Admin tab option|Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Upgrade Management** &gt; **Upgrade History**.|

You can then select an upgrade from the list to view the upgrade history details. Click the **Skipped Record VTB** related link to view and manage the skipped records over VTB.

**Note:** The **Skipped Record VTB** related link shows up only when there are skipped records for the version upgrade.

|Field|Description|

|Reviewed|Tasks which have been reviewed|
|Merged|Tasks which have both the old and new changes|
|Retained|Tasks which have retained the updates from the latest upgrade|
|Reverted|Tasks which have reverted its changes to the base system|
