## Upgrade monitor with issue detected

If one or both of the triggers for upgrading the system \('Check distribution for possible upgrade' and 'Check database for possible upgrade'\) have been customized or are missing, the Upgrade Monitor displays a warning and provides a button for resolving the issues.

**Note:** If your instance is self-hosted \(not hosted by ServiceNow\) this message may not necessarily indicate a problem. If you have customized or disabled the upgrade job and want to keep that customization or disabled state, do not select the button to fix the upgrade issue.

\[Omitted image "uc-monitor-issue.png"\] Alt text: Image showing the error message "Detected an issue with one or more upgrade jobs. Your next upgrade might not run. Click here to fix the upgrade jobs."

To resolve the issues with the upgrade jobs, select the link in the message. This action reverts both upgrade triggers \('Check distribution for possible upgrade' and 'Check database for possible upgrade'\) to their base versions.

**Note:** 'Upgrade' job has been renamed to 'Check distribution for possible upgrade' starting Paris. 'Check Upgrade Script' job has been renamed to 'Check database for possible upgrade' starting Paris.
