# Request a translation for an email notification, template or layout

Request a translation to send an email in the recipient’s preferred language.

## Before you begin

An email notification must exist. For more information, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

You must activate the Glide Notification Translation \(com.glide.notification.translation\) plugin.

The [Localization Framework settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-framework/localization-settings.md) should be configured to request the translation for the artifact configurations and add languages.

Role required: admin

Notification recipients must be defined as active users in the User \[sys\_user\] table and have a valid email address defined for their primary channel \(device\) in the Notification Device \[cmn\_notif\_device\] table.
