# Register target instance \(legacy\)

A clone target record specifies the instance URL and credentials used for cloning.

## Before you begin

Role required: clone\_admin

If an error occurs while registering a target instance see [Troubleshooting for registering target instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/register-target-instance-troubleshooting.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Instance Clone** &gt; **Clone Targets**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Enter the URL for the receiving instance \(target\).

    The system validates the instance enables clone targets and that High Availability Cloning is active.

4.  Enter the basic authentication credentials for a user account with the admin role on the target instance.

    **Note:** To clone multiple targets from one source, you must raise separate clone requests for each target.

    The system validates the user credentials have `clone_admin and soap` access to the target instance.

5.  Select **Submit**.

    The system checks connectivity and validates the user credentials against the target instance.
