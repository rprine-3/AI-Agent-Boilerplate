## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

The usage\_admin, sn\_sub\_man.admin, or admin roles are required to view and edit Subscription Management.

## Accessing product subscription overview information

View subscription overview information on the **Overview** tab in Subscription Management by navigating to **Admin** &gt; **Subscription Management** or **All** &gt; **Subscription Management** &gt; **Subscription Management**.

## Accessing user-based subscription information

Allocation details and status for user-based subscriptions are hidden from the Subscription Management overview to help prevent inaccuracy when allocations are incomplete. Contact your account executive for complete user-based subscription allocation details.

## Use cases

View a summary of your instance-level entitlements in the **Instance entitlements** tab.

-   Identify when subscriptions are over-allocated and view insights into actions you can take to maximize subscription usage.
-   Determine whether any custom tables and custom applications on your instance aren't mapped to a valid product subscription. You must map custom tables and custom applications that you create to a product subscription.
-   View product subscription details by selecting the product name.
-   Identify which type of subscriptions you have by viewing the values in the **Type** column. The subscription type determines the properties and attributes of the product subscriptions that your company receives and whether to allocate subscriptions manually.

    -   Product subscription types include per-user, capacity, unrestricted user, unlimited, and display only.
    -   Per-user subscriptions are automatically allocated by role for administrators that haven't manually allocated per-user subscriptions before. If an administrator has manually allocated per-user subscriptions in the past, they can continue to make manual allocations.. Capacity, unrestricted user, and unlimited subscriptions are allocated on your instance automatically. Display-only subscriptions aren't measured on your instance.
    -   Product subscriptions provide entitlements for different applications and can include different add-ons.
    For more information, see [Types of subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/types-subscription-v2.md).

-   Determine whether your subscription allocations are in compliance by viewing the values in the **Status** column. Adjust allocations if subscriptions are over-allocated.
