# Working with Dynamic Schema

Extend Dynamic Schema capabilities by defining dynamic attributes and dynamic categories in a dynamic namespace.

After planning your metadata strategy, you can start building out your schema by creating dynamic attribute records in the dynamic namespace. Formally defining attributes provides several key benefits.

-   Ensure data integrity, optimize queries, and improve sorting by defining dynamic attributes with appropriate types. For example, you can define attributes as strings, integers, or dates to enforce type-specific behavior.
-   Organize dynamic attributes and enable inheritance by adding them to dynamic categories. For example, you can define dynamic attributes in a parent category, and automatically access them in child categories that inherit those attributes.
-   Define a fixed set of values for an attribute by creating a dynamic choice set. For example, you can control which values are available in an attribute, which categories or namespaces they appear in, and override the values in specific cases.
-   Reuse dynamic attributes across multiple dynamic attribute store fields. For example, you can define a dynamic attribute in a dynamic namespace, and then use that attribute in any store field that belongs to that namespace.

## Implementing Dynamic Schema

Implement Dynamic Schema using the following process.

1.  [Create a dynamic attribute store field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-dynamic-attribute-store-field.md)

    Get started by creating a dynamic attribute field for storing your dynamic attributes.

2.  [Create a dynamic attribute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/add-dynamic-attributes.md)

    Define one or more dynamic attributes in the dynamic namespace that's associated with the dynamic store field.

3.  [Create a dynamic category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-dynamic-category.md)

    Define one or more dynamic categories in the dynamic namespace.

4.  [Include dynamic attributes in a dynamic category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/add-dynamic-attributes-dynamic-category.md)

    Organize your dynamic attributes using the dynamic categories that you defined.

5.  [Create a dynamic choice set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-choice-set.md)

    Define a fixed set of choices for an attribute and create choice overrides as needed.

6.  [Add dynamic attributes to a record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/add-dynamic-attributes-record.md)

    Populate the dynamic attribute store field using the GlideRecord setValue\(\) method or by entering attributes and values as JSON.
