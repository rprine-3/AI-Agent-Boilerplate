# Create or modify email digest intervals

Admins can create or modify the email digest intervals \(length of time\) during which activity for a selected notification is accumulated in an email digest. Users select a digest interval when they enable an email digest in their notification preferences.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Before adding an email digest interval, review the base system digest intervals in the Digest Intervals \[sys\_email\_digest\_interval\] table. You can modify intervals, including the base system intervals, which are one day \(24 hours\), one hour, every four hours, and seven days \(weekly\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Digest Intervals**.

    |Action|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |To add an interval|Select **New**.|
    |To modify an interval|Select the interval to be changed.|

2.  Enter the new or changed interval information:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Interval name that describes the interval length of time, for example: Every 2 hours.|
    |Interval|Length of the interval, either number of **Days** or **Hours** \(hours, minutes, and seconds\). The minimum time length allowed is one hour, and the maximum time length allowed is seven days \(one week\).|

3.  If you created an interval, select **Submit**, or if you changed an interval, select **Update**.

    The system updates the Digest Intervals \[sys\_email\_digest\_interval\] table with the new or modified interval. The digest interval is listed as an option in the notification preferences \(From your user profile, navigate to **Preferences &gt; Notifications** when a user enables a digest for the notification.

4.  To delete an interval, select the interval to be deleted in the Digest Intervals \[sys\_email\_digest\_interval\] table and select **Delete**.

    **Note:** If the interval is in use, the system does not remove the interval.
