# Disable attachments on a table

You can prevent users from adding attachments to records on a specific table.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Open a record in the table.

2.  Right-click the form header and select **Configure** &gt; **Dictionary**.

3.  In the list of dictionary entries, select the first record in the list \(the record with no **Column name** entry\).

4.  Add `no_attachment` to the **Attributes** field, separated by commas from any existing attributes.

    See [Altering tables and fields using dictionary attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_DictionaryAttributes.md) for more information.
