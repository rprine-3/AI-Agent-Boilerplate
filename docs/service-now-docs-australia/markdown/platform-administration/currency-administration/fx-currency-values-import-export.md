# FX Currency values in import and export

In general, currency values crossing the boundaries of the platform represent whatever is returned by `getDisplayValue`. Usually this currency value is the default as entered by a user into an FX Currency field for a transaction.

## FX Currency import

If using the default `setDisplayValue()` import method, FX Currency works in manner similar to the standard currency field. It imports a value such as `USD;1,234.56` as `setDisplayValue(&quot;USD;1,234.56&quot;)`. It then parses the value as a three letter ISO currency code, followed by a semi-colon, followed by a number formatted in the locale of the user. This method should work for most use cases.

Defaults for other Currency Instance fields come from FX Currency field configuration you defined in **System Localization** &gt; **FX Currency Configuration.** To explicitly set these fields, you can use a custom import script that sets those fields to desired values, possibly using values from another import column.

There are various ways to import FX Currency data.

Export to XML

</td><td>

Shows an unload XML with unloads for all instance records.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Export to Excel/PDF

</td><td>

Uses the default method of exporting data that extracts data from fields using `getDisplayValue()`. For FX Currency fields, using this method returns a formatted currency string of the form $1,234.56. To access specific information inside an FX Currency field directly without any transformations, simply export that column using dot walking.
