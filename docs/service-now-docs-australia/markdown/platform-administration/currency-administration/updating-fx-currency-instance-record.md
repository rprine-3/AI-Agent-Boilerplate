</table>2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_uyx_ygm_4jb"><thead><tr><th>

**Field**

</th><th>

**Description**

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Amount

</td><td>

Currency amount that you entered into the FX Currency field, formatted according to the currency code in your user locale. The amount stores internally as a currency code and a numerical value of up to 12 digits in length. For example, `USD; 1234.56`. **Note:** The currency value has two parts: the currency amount and a currency code. The amount stores as a decimal value, for example, `1234.56`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Currency Code

</td><td>

Three-letter ISO code that identifies the currency that you select for the currency amount. For example, USD for the US Dollar, or EUR for the Euro.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Conversion Rate

</td><td>

Conversion rate used to calculate the reference currency value. It converts a session currency value, expressed in one currency, to another, and stores as a reference to a record in the Currency Conversion Rate \[fx\_conversion\_rate\] table. The conversation rate is based on the **Conversion Rate Table** and **Conversion Date Source** settings for the FX Currency field in the Rate tab of FX Currency Configuration. To learn more about these settings, see [Configuring FX Currency field behavior](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/currency-administration/configure-fx-currency-field-behavior.md).

 You change or select the conversion rate as needed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reference Amount

</td><td>

Calculated reference currency amount. The ServiceNow AI Platform converts the currency value entered into the **Amount** field into a common reference currency. It uses the settings in the **Reference Currency Source** and **Reference Currency** fields in **System Localization** &gt; **FX Currency Configuration** to do so. You can't change the calculated reference amount.

 **Note:** To learn more about reference currencies, see [Set the reference currency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/currency-administration/fx-currency-set-reference.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reference Currency Code

</td><td>

Three-letter ISO code that identifies the reference currency, for example, USD, to which the entered currency value converted. You can't change the reference currency code.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:** You can't edit the reference currency and value because they are calculated automatically.

3.  Select **Save**.
