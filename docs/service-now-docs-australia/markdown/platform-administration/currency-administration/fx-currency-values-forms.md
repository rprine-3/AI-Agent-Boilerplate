# Understanding FX Currency values in forms

In forms, the FX Currency field behaves like a dot walkable field in script. It consists of an entry field, and an accompanying list for selection of a currency code.

Specifically, FX Currency fields that appear on forms contain the following: \[Omitted image "currency2-field.png"\] Alt text: Fx currency field

-   An empty field for entry of a numeric currency value, formatted according to your assigned user locale. For example, in the US, it is formatted with two decimal places, for entry of cents.

    If this is a new record, the field is empty. If it is an existing record, the previous currency amount that you entered appears.

-   A selection list of active currencies from the Currency \[fx\_currency\] table. The default currency code is based on your user locale. You can select another currency for use during the entry session.

    For example, in the US, the default currency value, based on the user locale, is USD. You can select another currency code to use in the current entry session.

-   An edit icon \(\[Omitted image "currency-edit.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon\). Users with an assigned currency\_instance\_admin role can click it to edit currency detail in the accompanying Currency Instance \[fx\_currency2\_instance\] record.
