# Install or update all applications in a ServiceNow product

Install or update all applications that are part of a ServiceNow product from your ServiceNow instance at a time.

## Before you begin

**Note:**

Legacy Application Manager is being deprecated. Starting with Australia patch 1, Legacy Application Manager is no longer available and bookmarks will redirect to the new Application Manager experience.

A known issue affects the use of bookmarks to access the Legacy Application Manager before Australia patch 1. For details about possible issues with accessing the Legacy Application Manager, see the [Deprecated Classic App Manager URL usage causes issues on instances running ZP5 / YP10 and above \[KB2804238\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2804238) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

A new Application Manager experience is available. The new experience simplifies the process of managing your licensed applications by consolidating them in one convenient location, displaying all applications, plugins, installed applications, and available updates. For more information, see [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/application-manager.md).
