# Baseline email notifications

The baseline system provides several email notifications.

Some events listed in this table do not appear in a business rule and are fired by other conditions in the platform. Some events are hardcoded and are not user configurable.

**Note:** The below table list is not an exhaustive list. Products can create their own notifications.
