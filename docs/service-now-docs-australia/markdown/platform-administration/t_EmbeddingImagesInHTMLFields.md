# Embed images in the HTML editor

You can use the HTML field image picker to embed images into HTML fields, and to add images to the image library.

## Before you begin

Role required: the role necessary to update the record that contains the HTML field. For example, any user with a role can create a knowledge article and embed an image in it.

## About this task

**Note:** Administrators and users with the image\_admin role manage the image library at **System UI** &gt; **Images**. See [Storing images in the database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_StoringImagesInTheDatabase.md) .

## Procedure

1.  Open the form that contains the HTML field.

2.  Click the position where the image is to appear, or to modify an existing image, click the image.

3.  Click the insert/edit image icon \(\[Omitted image "TinyMCEV4Image.png"\] Alt text: Insert or edit image icon\) on the HTML editor toolbar.

4.  In the Insert/Modify image form, enter information in each field.

</table>    **Note:** To resize an embedded image, click the image. The sizing frame appears. Drag a sizing point until the image is the desired size. Corner points adjust the size proportionally. Depending on your browser, you may need to highlight the image before the sizing frame appears.

5.  To provide additional control over the appearance of an image, click **Advanced options**.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Layout**|Select the image **Alignment** \(default is **Baseline**\) and enter the **Border thickness**.|
    |**Spacing**|Enter the number of **Horizontal** and **Vertical** pixels around the image.|
    |**Size**|Enter the **Width** and **Height** of the image \(in pixels\).|

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  Paste an image into the HTML editor.

    To edit the image, save the entry then select the image. Click the insert/edit image icon and complete the form using the same tables for adding an image.

    Pasted images are saved in the system as attachments.
