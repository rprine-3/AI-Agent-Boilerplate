# Enable links to records

Adding the special **$\{URI\}** parameter to an outbound email body or template creates a link to a specific record.

When a user clicks the word **LINK**, the instance prompts the user to log in if not already logged in, and then redirects the user to the record specified in the URI.

\[Omitted image "EmailURI.png"\] Alt text:

The **$\{URI\}** parameter has an extension called the **$\{URI+\}** format to specify additional arguments in the email link, such as sysparm terms, in addition to the automatically created URI. For example \(whitespace added for improved readability\):

```
${URI+&sysparm_scriptlet=current.assigned_to=gs.getUserID()
&sysparm_scriptlet_condition=current.assigned_to.nil()
&sysparm_view=incident_active}
```

This example executes the JavaScript:

```
current.assigned_to=gs.getUserID()
```

The JavasScript is executed when the condition is satisfied:

```
current.assigned_to.nil()
```

Additionally, the script sets the view to incident\_active.
