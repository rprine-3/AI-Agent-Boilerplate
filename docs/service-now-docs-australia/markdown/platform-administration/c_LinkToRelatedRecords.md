# Link to related records

A notification can link to a related record by specifying a reference field in front of the**$\{URI\}** or **$\{URI\_REF\}** parameters.

Format the related record link as follows:

-   `${<reference field that contains the related record you want to display>.URI}`
-   `${<reference field that contains the related record you want to display>.URI_REF}`

For example:

<table id="table_z4t_qxp_rq"><thead><tr><th>

Related record to provide link to

</th><th>

Notification record table

</th><th>

Reference field

</th><th>

Samples

</td><td>

Approval \[sysapproval\_approver\]

</td><td>

Approval for \[sysapproval\]

</td><td>

-   $\{sysapproval.URI\}
-   $\{sysapproval.URI\_REF\}

</td></tr><tr><td>

Related problem record in an incident notification

</td><td>

Incident

</td><td>

Problem \[problem\_id\]

</td><td>

-   $\{problem\_id.URI\}
-   $\{problem\_id.URI\_REF\}

</td></tr></tbody>

```

Click here to view Related Problem: ${problem_id.URI_REF}
```
