# Create a dynamic namespace

Define categories and attributes once and reuse them across multiple tables and dynamic attribute store fields.

## Before you begin

Role required: dynamic\_schema\_writer

## About this task

All dynamic categories and dynamic attributes belong to a dynamic namespace that you can associate with one or more dynamic attribute store fields.

A dynamic namespace is automatically created when you create a dynamic attribute store field. However, you can also create a dynamic namespace manually, and then associate it with one or more store fields. You might create a dynamic namespace this way in the following scenarios:

-   You created a dynamic attribute store field for storing transient attributes, which automatically created an associated namespace, but now you want to associate the store field with a different namespace that contains a different set of dynamic categories and dynamic attributes.
-   You created multiple dynamic attribute store fields on one or more tables, and you want them all to share the dynamic categories and dynamic attributes that you defined in a new namespace.

Note that changing the namespace associated with a dynamic attribute store field doesn't modify any saved data in the store field, but can affect how the system interacts with that data.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Dynamic Schema** &gt; **Dynamic Namespaces**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Label|Label used for displaying the dynamic namespace.|
    |Name|Internal name for the dynamic namespace.|
    |Description|A brief summary of what the namespace contains.|
    |Active|Option to activate the dynamic namespace.|
