# Configure left padding of a system number in a table

You can configure the left padding of the system numbers on a table. For example, pad the **Number** field on an Incident, Problem, or Change Request.

## Before you begin

If you are configuring numbers on a custom table or a table that does not extend the task table, then, before performing the following procedure, you must prepare business rules and script includes. For more information, see [Prepare to left-pad number fields in custom tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_PrepToLeftPadNumFldsInCustmTbls.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the form, then right-click the **Number** field and select **Configure Dictionary**.

2.  Enter the following script in the **Default value** field and click **Update**.

    ```
    javascript:getNextObjNumberPadded();
    ```

3.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Number Maintenance**.

4.  Open the table record.

5.  Enter a value in the **Number of digits** field.

6.  Click **Update**.

    Number padding is applied to both existing and new records.
