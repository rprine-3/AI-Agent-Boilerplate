# Managing integration sessions

Manage access to an instance by configuring how long integration sessions last before expiring.

Similar to user sessions, you can secure your instance by configuring when to time out an integration session after a period of inactivity and a maximum active session time. By default, integration session time out after five minutes of inactivity.

## Configure a maximum active time for integration sessions

Secure your instance by enforcing a maximum time for sessions regardless of integration activity.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

By default, sessions expire only after a period of inactivity. Enforcing a maximum active session time ends sessions regardless of if an integration has been active recently. The active session timeout should be greater than the value configured for the inactive session timeout. For example, if sessions are configured to time out after 30 minutes of inactivity, the active session timeout should be greater than 30 minutes.

**Note:** Sharing a single service account across integrations and applications can prevent the system from enforcing maximum active session times. To resolve issues that keep sessions active, see the [Resolving Extended Session Duration and Performance Issues with Shared Service Accounts \[KB1770913\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1770913) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

### Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|`glide.active.session.timeout.invalidate.session`|
    |Description|`Specifies whether integration sessions can be invalidated by configuring a maximum active session time.`|
    |Type|**true \| false**|
    |Value|`true`|

4.  Select **Submit**.

5.  From the System Property \[sys\_properties\] list, open the **glide.integrations.active.session.life\_span** property.

6.  In the **Value** field, enter the number of minutes before integration sessions time out regardless of user activity.

    The value should be greater than the value of **glide.integration.session\_timeout** for inactive integration session timeout. By default, the inactive session timeout for integration sessions is five minutes.

7.  Select **Update**.


### Result

Integrations are logged out of the instance after the time specified and their credentials must be entered again to access the instance. This setting helps secure an instance using integrations, such as the REST API.
