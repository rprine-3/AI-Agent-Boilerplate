# Trello external content connector

The Trello external content connector retrieves boards that are accessible to all users in your Trello source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to update searchable content and metadata from your source system. Content crawls feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

**Note:** The Trello external content connector only retrieves searchable content and metadata from boards that can be accessed by all users in your Trello enterprise. It doesn't retrieve content and metadata from secure boards.
