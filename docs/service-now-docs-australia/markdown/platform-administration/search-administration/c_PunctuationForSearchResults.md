# Zing indexes punctuation as part of some words

Zing indexes some punctuation marks as part of some words to improve search results for common search terms.

<table id="table_vyb_g1w_1q"><thead><tr><th>

Punctuation

</th><th>

Search behavior

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Ampersands \[&amp;\]

</td><td>

Company names

</td><td>

Zing locates terms containing punctuation characters that are common in company names: ampersands \(&amp;\), plus signs \(+\), or hyphens \(-\). For example, a search for `H&R Block` locates exact matches to the search term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apostrophes \['\]

</td><td>

Proper names

</td><td>

Zing ignores trailing possessives and retains most others to find company names. For example, a search for `O'Reilly's` locates matches to O'Reilly and O'Reilly's.

</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">

Hyphens \[-\]

</td><td>

Company names

</td><td>

Zing locates terms containing punctuation characters that are common in company names: ampersands \(&amp;\), plus signs \(+\), or hyphens \(-\). For example, a search for `Coca-Cola` locates exact matches to the search term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Product numbers

</td><td>

Zing locates product numbers that follow a typical pattern. To meet this pattern, search terms must contain frequent numbers and only include underscores \(\_\), hyphens \(-\), or periods for punctuation. For example, a search for `PROD-10-987` locates exact matches to the search term.

Product numbers

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Record numbers

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">

Periods \[.\]

</td><td>

Acronyms

</td><td>

Zing locates acronyms whether they are separated by periods or not. For example, a search for `u.s.a.` locates matches to usa or u.s.a.. Note that wildcard searches may affect acronym handling.

 In another example, a search for `u.s.*` may yield better results than a search for `u.s*`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Host names

</td><td>

Zing locates sequences of letters and numbers separated only by periods. For example, a search for `en.myhost123.com` locates exact matches to the search term.

</td></tr><tr><td>

IP addresses

</td><td>

Zing locates numbers that follow a typical IPv4 address pattern. For example, a search for `10.0.0.1` locates exact matches to the search term.

</td></tr><tr><td>
