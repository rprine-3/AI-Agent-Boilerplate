# Configure SAP DMS for external content indexing

Create service instances and service keys in your SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\) global account to allow the SAP DMS external content connector to access your SAP DMS documents and repositories.

## Before you begin

You must be a global account administrator on the SAP BTP. Your global account must be authorized to access the SAP Document Management Service.

A SAP global account administrator must have created a subaccount in your SAP BTP global account, with these entitlements:

-   Document Management Service, Application Option
-   Document Management Service, Integration Option
-   Document Management Service, Repository Option
-   Cloud Foundry Environment
-   Authorization and Trust Management Service

If you don't already have a subaccount with these entitlements in your SAP BTP global account, perform the [Create a subaccount in the SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/create-subaccount-sap-btp.md) preliminary task before performing this task.

Role required: none

## About this task

The SAP DMS external content connector retrieves documents from repositories in your SAP DMS source system using the Document Management Service, Integration Option REST API.

To allow the connector to access your SAP DMS source system via this API, you must configure service instances and service keys in the SAP DMS Business Technology Platform \(BTP\). Your connector administrator can use settings copied from your new service keys to configure the SAP DMS external connector for proper connection to your source system.

## Procedure

1.  Create a service instance for the Document Management Service, Application Option in your subaccount.
