# Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector

The Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector retrieves assets from nodes in your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to update searchable content and metadata from your source system. Content crawls feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

## Limitations

The Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector only crawls assets. It doesn't crawl web page content or social content such as reviews, blog posts, or comments. All asset content retrieved by the connector is treated as public, meaning that it's searchable by all users with access to your configured AI Search experience.
