# Index the content from an indexed source for searchability

Enable AI Search to index the records from your source tables to make the content searchable.

## Before you begin

Role required: ais\_admin

## About this task

You can index the existing records in the source table and any child tables that you set up for indexing. If you add, change, or remove an indexed source attribute, or update indexed values for fields on referenced tables, you must reindex the content from an internal source. You can do it manually by following the steps given in the procedure again. For more information, see [Indexing content from AI Search indexed sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/indexing-content-ais.md).

You can also index the content from an indexed source for external documents. For more information, see [Indexing and searching external content in AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/external-content-ais.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search Admin** &gt; **AI Search Admin Home**.

2.  On the **Shared Configurations** tab, select **Indexed Sources** .

3.  Select the indexed source that you want to index.

    The selected indexed source opens in the Configuration form view.

4.  Select **Start index job**.

5.  Start indexing.

6.  To monitor the progress of the indexing task, refresh the AI Search Indexed Source History form page.

7.  Return to the list of indexed sources by selecting the back icon \[Omitted image "FormBackUI15.png"\] Alt text: Back icon..


## Result

AI Search indexes content from existing records in the indexed source. Indexing continues on a scheduled basis. You must repeat this task for the indexed sources if you want to reindex their content before the next scheduled indexing run.

## What to do next

Define search sources to make searchable content from the indexed source available in user search experiences.
