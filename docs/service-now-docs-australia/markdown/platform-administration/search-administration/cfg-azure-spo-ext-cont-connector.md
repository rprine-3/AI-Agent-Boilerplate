# Configure Microsoft SharePoint Online for external content indexing

Register an OAuth 2.0 application in the Microsoft Entra admin center to grant the Microsoft SharePoint Online external content connector access to your Microsoft SharePoint Online source system.

## Before you begin

You need the following credentials and permissions for your organization in the Microsoft Entra admin center:

-   Login credentials
-   Permission to register an application
-   Permission to add API permissions to an application
-   Permission to grant admin consent for an application's API permissions
-   Permission to upload certificates for an application

You must have created a public/private key pair for the Microsoft SharePoint Online external content connector and extracted the public key certificate in DER-encoded binary X.509 format. For details on creating the public/private key pair and extracting the public key certificate, see [Create a public/private key pair for the Microsoft SharePoint Online external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/gen-cert-spo-ext-cont-connector.md).

Role required: none

## About this task

The Microsoft SharePoint Online external content connector retrieves content from your Microsoft SharePoint Online source system using Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft SharePoint REST APIs.

To enable the connector to access your Microsoft SharePoint Online source system via these APIs, you must configure an OAuth 2.0 application in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Your connector administrator can use settings copied from this Microsoft Entra application to configure the Microsoft SharePoint Online external content connector for proper connection to your Microsoft SharePoint Online source system.

## Procedure

1.  Register a new application in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

    1.  Log in to the Microsoft Entra admin center at [https://entra.microsoft.com/](https://entra.microsoft.com/).

        **Note:** If your Microsoft SharePoint Online tenant is in the Microsoft 365 GCC or GCC High cloud or the Microsoft 365 DoD cloud, log in at [https://entra.microsoft.us/](https://entra.microsoft.us/) instead.

    2.  Select **Applications** &gt; **App registrations**.

    3.  On the App registrations page, select **New registration**.

        \[Omitted image "ms-entra-home-app-registrations.png"\] Alt text: App registrations page in Microsoft Entra admin center with New registration link.

## What to do next

If you granted Sites.Selected permission instead of Sites.FullControl.All permission in step [3.f](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/cfg-azure-spo-ext-cont-connector.md), configure SharePoint API permissions for the site collections you want the Microsoft SharePoint Online connector to be able to crawl. For details on this procedure, see [Configure site and site collection access for the Microsoft SharePoint Online external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-site-collection-access-spo-external-content-connector.md).

Provide the following items to your connector administrator:

-   The OAuth 2.0 application's tenant ID and client ID that you recorded in step [2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/cfg-azure-spo-ext-cont-connector.md).
-   The DER-encoded binary X.509 format public key certificate's SHA1 thumbprint hash in hexadecimal format that you recorded in step [5.e](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/cfg-azure-spo-ext-cont-connector.md).

Your connector administrator needs these items to configure a Microsoft SharePoint Online external content connector to retrieve searchable content and security principals from your Microsoft SharePoint Online instance.
