# Configure a Learning assignment custom report in Workday

Configure a custom report for Learning assignments in Workday. The Workday external content connector uses this custom report to make content and metadata from your Learning assignment data searchable.

## Before you begin

A Workday admin must have already an integration system user and an unconstrained integration system security group in your Workday tenant. For details on this preliminary task, see [Configure Workday security settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-workday-security-settings.md).

You need an account with the following privileges in your organization's Workday tenant:

-   Administrator privileges
-   **Custom Report Creation** domain access
-   Access to the **Learning Assignments by Learning Organization** report data source

Role required: none

## About this task

This task is optional. The Workday external content connector can retrieve Learning assignment data from your Workday source system using a custom report that you configure. If you don't want to retrieve Learning assignment data from Workday, you can skip this task.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your Workday tenant with your administrator credentials.

2.  For each of the calculated fields shown in the following Calculated fields table, perform these steps.

    1.  In the Workday search bar, search for the **Create Calculated Field** task and select it.

    2.  On the Create Calculated Field page, enter the Field Name shown in the entry for the calculated field in the following Calculated fields table.

    3.  Select the Business Object and Function values shown in the entry for the calculated field in the following Calculated fields table.

    4.  Select **OK**.

        Workday takes you to the Calculation tab for the new calculated field.

    5.  On the Calculation tab, enter the calculation setting field values shown in the entry for the calculated field in the following Calculated fields table.

    6.  Select **OK**.

        Workday saves your calculation settings for the new calculated field.

    7.  Select **Done**.

11. On the Advanced tab for your new custom report, select the **Enable As Web Service** option if it's not already selected, then select **OK**.

    Workday saves your configuration changes for your new custom report.

12. Transfer ownership of your new custom report to the integration system user created for the Workday external content connector.

    1.  From the View Custom Report page, navigate to **…** &gt; **Custom Report** &gt; **Transfer Ownership**.

    2.  On the Transfer Ownership of Custom Reports page, in the New Owner field, enter or select the **ISU SNOW ACL** integration system user account.

        **Important:** If you don't see this integration system user account in the system, check that a Workday admin has completed the [Configure Workday security settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-workday-security-settings.md) preliminary task.

    3.  Select **OK**.

13. Generate a sample report using your new custom report and copy its CSV URL.

    1.  On the View Custom Report page for your new custom report, navigate to **...** &gt; **Web Service** &gt; **View URLs**.

    2.  On the View URLs Web Service page, configure a sample report by filling in the fields.

        |Field|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |Worker|Select any member of your Workday organization.|
        |Learning Organizations for Learning Assignment|Select the supervisory organization for the chosen worker.|
        |Starting Last Functionally Updated|Select an arbitrary start date and time for the report.|
        |Ending Last Functionally Updated|Select an arbitrary end date and time for the report. The end date and time must occur after your specified start date and time.|

    3.  Select **OK**.

        Workday displays parameters and URLs for your sample report.

    4.  Long-press \(or right-click\) the **CSV** link and copy the CSV URL.

    5.  Paste the copied URL into a web browser or a text editor.

    The CSV URL has the format `https://<hostname>.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/<tenant-name>/<report-owner-user-name>/<report-name-alias>`. This URL may optionally be followed by a question mark and one or more URL parameters separated by ampersands. As an example, your CSV URL might be `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/Example/ISU_SNOW_ACL/Workday_connector_LA_report`.

14. Copy the base URL for your Workday tenant, your Workday tenant name, the custom report owner's user name, and the custom report name alias.

    1.  Copy the base URL for your Workday tenant from the pasted CSV URL and store it in a secure location.

        The base URL for your Workday tenant is the `https://<hostname>.workday.com` portion of the CSV URL \(everything before the third slash character\). As an example, if your CSV URL is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/Example/ISU_SNOW_ACL/Workday_connector_LA_report`, the base URL for your Workday tenant is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com`.

        **Important:** Your external content connector administrator needs this base URL when configuring the Workday external content connector.

    2.  Copy the tenant name for your Workday tenant from the pasted CSV URL and store it in a secure location.

        The tenant name for your Workday tenant is the `<tenant-name>` portion of the CSV URL \(everything between the sixth and seventh slash characters\). As an example, if your CSV URL is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/Example/ISU_SNOW_ACL/Workday_connector_LA_report`, your Workday tenant name is `Example`.

        **Important:** Your external content connector administrator needs this tenant name when configuring the Workday external content connector.

    3.  Copy the report owner's user name for your custom Learning assignment report from the pasted CSV URL and store it in a secure location.

        The report owner's user name for your custom Learning assignment report is the `<report-owner-user-name>` portion of the CSV URL \(everything between the seventh and eighth slash characters\). As an example, if your CSV URL is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/Example/ISU_SNOW_ACL/Workday_connector_LA_report`, your custom Learning assignment report owner's user name is `ISU_SNOW_ACL`.

        **Important:** Your external content connector administrator needs this Learning assignment report owner's user name when configuring the Workday external content connector.

    4.  Copy the Learning assignment report name alias for your custom report from the pasted CSV URL and store it in a secure location.

        The report name alias for your custom Learning assignment report is the `<report-name-alias>` portion of the CSV URL \(everything between the eighth slash character and the question mark or the end of the URL\). As an example, if your CSV URL is `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/Example/ISU_SNOW_ACL/Workday_connector_LA_report`, your custom Learning assignment report name alias is `Workday_connector_LA_report`.

        **Important:** Your external content connector administrator needs this Learning assignment report name alias when configuring the Workday external content connector.


## What to do next

Provide the following items to the connector administrator who creates your Workday external content connectors:

-   The base URL for your Workday tenant that you copied in step [14.a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-learning-assignment-report-workday.md).
-   The Workday tenant name that you copied in step [14.b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-learning-assignment-report-workday.md).
-   The custom Learning assignment report owner's user name that you copied in step [14.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-learning-assignment-report-workday.md).
-   The custom Learning assignment report's name alias that you copied in step [14.d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-learning-assignment-report-workday.md).

Your connector administrator needs these items to configure a Workday external content connector to retrieve searchable content and metadata from learning assignments in your Workday source system.
