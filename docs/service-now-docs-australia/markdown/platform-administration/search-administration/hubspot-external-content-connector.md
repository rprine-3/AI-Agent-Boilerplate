# HubSpot external content connector

The HubSpot external content connector retrieves tickets and notes from your HubSpot source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to retrieve updated content and access permissions from your source system, or user permission crawls to retrieve updated security principals from your source system. Both types of crawl feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

**Note:** The HubSpot API provides only limited information about document permissions. As a result, the external content connector may reindex a significant number of crawled documents when you add or remove HubSpot users or members of HubSpot groups. In extreme cases, adding a single user or updating membership for a single group can trigger an update of all crawled HubSpot documents in the AI Search index.
