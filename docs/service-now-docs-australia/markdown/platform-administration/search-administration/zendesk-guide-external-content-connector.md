# Zendesk Guide external content connector

The Zendesk Guide external content connector retrieves articles and attachments from knowledge bases in your Zendesk Guide source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to retrieve updated content and access permissions from your source system, or user permission crawls to retrieve updated security principals from your source system. Both types of crawl feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

Specify the article locales and attachment file types you want your Zendesk Guide external content connector to crawl when running content crawls. Define inclusion or exclusion filters for domains to restrict the set of users the crawl retrieves access permissions for when running user permission crawls.
