# Configure access to help articles in Workday

Create an article audience rule in Workday and specify it for your help articles to make them accessible by all your employees. The Workday external content connector uses the audience rule and article settings to make content and metadata from your help articles searchable.

## Before you begin

You need administrator privileges in your organization's Workday tenant.

Role required: none

## About this task

This task is optional. By default, the Workday external content connector retrieves searchable content and metadata from help articles that are accessible by all your organization's employees in Workday. To facilitate this retrieval, you need to create an article audience rule and then apply that rule to each article that you want to make searchable.

If you don't want the connector to retrieve searchable content and metadata from help articles in Workday, you can skip this task.
