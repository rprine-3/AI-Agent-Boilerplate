# Enable automatic stop words for a table

The system can identify and generate stop words when a search term exceeds an occurrence threshold.

## Before you begin

Enable text indexing for the table.

Role required: ts\_admin or admin

## About this task

By default, the TS Index Stats scheduled job identifies and creates stop words for tables with text indexes on a nightly basis. Automatically adding stop words improves your search results by removing search terms that return too many search results.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Text Indexes**.

2.  Open the text index entry for the table.

3.  Select the **Auto stop** check box.

4.  In **Auto threshold**, enter the maximum number of occurrences a search term can have in search results.

    When a search term generates more search results than the threshold, the system automatically creates a stop word for the search term.

    For example, to create stop words for the task table, see the blog post [Configuring auto stop words and regenerating text indexes](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=83bc6e25dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961963&view_source=searchResult) from a ServiceNow employee on the ServiceNow Community.

5.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The job identifies and creates stop words for the table with a **Stop mode** value of *Index but do not Query* and inserts a **Comment** to indicate that the stop word was generated automatically.
