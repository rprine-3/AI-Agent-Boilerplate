# Search Preview UI for AI Search

The Search Preview UI enables you to test AI Search queries using settings from a selected search profile. Administrator tools help you review search query performance data and feedback, debug queries, and override default query settings for testing purposes.

Access the Search Preview UI by navigating to **AI Search** &gt; **Preview** &gt; **Search Preview**.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform® roles

-   The ais\_admin role is required to view and use the Search Preview UI.
-   The impersonator role is required for some AI Search administrator tools.
-   The ais\_high\_security\_admin role is required to bypass search source and content security filtering. For details on this procedure, see [Diagnose search result access issues using the Search Preview UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/diagnose-srch-result-access-ais.md).
