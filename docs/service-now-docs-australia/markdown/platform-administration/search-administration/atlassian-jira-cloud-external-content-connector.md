# Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector

The Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector retrieves work items and attachments from projects in your Atlassian Jira Cloud source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to retrieve updated content and access permissions from your source system, or user permission crawls to retrieve updated security principals from your source system. Both types of crawl feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

-   **[Configure a connector user in Atlassian Jira Cloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-connector-user-jira-cloud.md)**  
Create a user and group in your Atlassian Jira Cloud tenant with access and permissions required by the Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector. The connector runs as this user when accessing data from your tenant.
