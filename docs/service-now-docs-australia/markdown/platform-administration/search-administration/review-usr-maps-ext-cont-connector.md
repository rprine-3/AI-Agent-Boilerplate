# Review user permissions for an external content connector

View user and group access permissions retrieved by an external content connector, and see how the connector maps those permissions to your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance's users.

## Before you begin

Role required: ais\_admin, plus ais\_high\_security\_admin to view full user permission details

## About this task

The User permissions list for an external content connector shows user and group access permissions retrieved from the connector's source system, along with details of how those permissions are mapped to your ServiceNow AI Platform instance's users. Review this information when you want to verify user and group permission mappings for your external content connector.

To view the user permissions list, you must elevate to the ais\_high\_security\_admin role. If you don't elevate or don't have this role, you can see the number of user permissions created for the external content connector, but can't see details of those user permissions.

**Note:** The following external content connectors don't retrieve user or group access permissions. You can't run user permission crawls for these connectors.

-   Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector
-   Amazon S3 external content connector
-   Cornerstone external content connector
-   ServiceNow® product documentation external content connector
-   Slack external content connector
-   Trello external content connector
-   Webcrawler external content connector

The Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector only retrieves permissions for Confluence Cloud users who have made their email addresses visible to all users. To allow user permission, each Confluence Cloud user must set their own email visibility to **Anyone** as explained in the [https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/configure-user-email-visibility/](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/configure-user-email-visibility/) Atlassian support resource.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **External Content Connectors** &gt; **External Content Admin Home**.

2.  In the Connectors pane, select the record for the external content connector whose user permissions you want to review.

3.  In the connector editor, select the **User permissions** tab.

    The User permissions page shows the total count of user permissions created by the external content connector.

4.  Elevate to the ais\_high\_security\_admin role:

    1.  Perform the appropriate action for your version of the UI:

</table>        A dialog box appears, displaying a checklist of your available privileged roles.

    2.  In the dialog box, select the **ais\_high\_security\_admin** option, then select **Update** \(in Next Experience UI\) or **OK**.

        The page reloads and an elevated role indicator appears next to your user name in the user menu. In Next Experience UI, this indicator displays the names of the active privileged roles. In Core UI, the indicator displays the elevated role icon \[Omitted image "icon-elevated-role-ui16.png"\] Alt text:.

        \[Omitted image "elevated-polaris-ui.png"\] Alt text: User menu showing elevated role indicator in Next Experience UI.

        **Note:** When the page reloads, any unsaved edits are lost.

5.  Review the entries in the User permissions list.

    Each entry shows a single ServiceNow AI Platform user along with the external user mapped to them and any external group memberships associated with that external user. You can sort and filter the list to locate entries of interest.
