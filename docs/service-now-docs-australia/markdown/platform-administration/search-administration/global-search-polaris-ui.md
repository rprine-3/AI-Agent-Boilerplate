6. Preview of matching records for table

</td><td>

Partial list of matching records for the specified table, with maximum count controlled by the preview limit. By default, the system displays up to 10 matching records per table, sorted from highest to lowest document score. The system displays a separate list for each table in the search source. By default, the system displays fields from the table's text\_search list view for each search result. If this view doesn't exist for the table, it instead displays fields from the default list view. For more details on the text\_search list view and the format of individual result listings, see [Text search views control format of global search results for tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/text-search-view-formats-results.md).

 Users with the admin role can override the preview results limit for a search application by modifying the application's record in the Workspace Global Search Configuration \[sys\_aw\_global\_search\_config\] table. For more details on this procedure, see [Set the preview limit for global or workspace search in Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/set-app-preview-limit-polaris-ui.md).

 Administrators can also modify the search results table list view by modifying the value of the **glide.ui.text\_search.view** system property. For details on changing this value, see [Set global text search properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/set-global-text-search-properties.md).

</table>## View and open search results using workspace applications in Next Experience Unified Navigation

Use the search context menu to view and open results for your current search in workspace applications.

### Before you begin

You must be using Next Experience UI.

### About this task

In addition to global search, you may have access to workspace search applications, such as CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace. If you have access to multiple search applications, the search field's drop-down search context menu displays all available search applications, with the current application preselected. To view and open search results in another application, select it from the search context menu.

Users with the administrator role can add workspace applications to the search context menu. For details on this procedure, see [Add a workspace application to the Unified Navigation search context menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/add-app-search-context-polaris-ui.md).

### Procedure

1.  Use the search field to perform a search and view search results.

2.  To open the search context menu, select the **Choose search context** icon \[Omitted image "polaris-ui-search-field-arrow-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the search field.

    **Note:** If the **Choose search context** icon isn't displayed in the search field, the current search applications is the only one available. You can't switch search applications.

    A drop-down menu of available search applications displays, with the current search applications preselected.

    \[Omitted image "pol-search-context.png"\] Alt text: Global search field displaying search context menu.
