# Search settings filter and group global search results by table

Global search filters and groups matching results by table. You can configure search sources \(in Next Experience UI\) or search groups to define tables and groups for global search.

The configuration settings for table-based filtering and grouping of global search results differ by UI, as described in the following sections.

## Search sources filter global search results by table in Next Experience UI

Global search in Next Experience UI displays search results broken out by search source. A search source is a collection of global search settings for a ServiceNow AI Platform® table.

A user must have read access to a table to see search results for it.

### Default global search sources for Next Experience UI

The base system includes these default search sources for global search in Next Experience UI.

When Next Experience UI is activated, the following search sources are defined for global search. These search sources appear in the Application Search Sources related list for the **Now Experience Search Configuration** record in the Search Application Configuration \[sys\_search\_context\_config\] table.

|Search source|Table searched|
|-------------|--------------|
|Tasks - Incidents|Incident \[incident\]|
|Tasks - Change Requests|Change Request \[change\_request\]|
|Tasks - Change Tasks|Change Task \[change\_task\]|
|Tasks - Problems|Problem \[problem\]|
|Tasks - Requests|Request \[sc\_request\]|
|Tasks - Catalog Tasks|Catalog Task \[sc\_task\]|
|People &amp; Places - Users|User \[sys\_user\]|
|Tasks - Requested Items|Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\]|
|People &amp; Places - Groups|Group \[sys\_user\_group\]|
|Knowledge &amp; Catalog - Knowledge|Knowledge \[kb\_knowledge\]|
|People &amp; Places - Companies|Company \[core\_company\]|
|Knowledge &amp; Catalog - Catalog Items|Catalog Item \[sc\_cat\_item\]|

**Note:** Search sources only affect filtering of global search results in Next Experience UI. In Core UI, global text search filters results based on settings defined in text search groups. For details on these settings, see [Search groups filter global text search results by table in Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md).

### Add a search source for Next Experience UI

Add a new search source to make a table searchable by global search or workspace search in Next Experience UI.

#### Before you begin

You must be using Next Experience UI.

**Note:** You can configure tables for global text search in Core UI by adding new text search groups. For more details, see [Add a search group for Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md).

The tables you want to include in the search group must have text indexing enabled. To enable text indexing for a table, see [Configure a table for indexing and searching](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-single-table-for-indexing.md).

Role required: search\_application\_admin or workspace\_admin

#### About this task

A search source defines a table that is searchable by global or workspace search in Next Experience UI. Define new search sources to add to the default set of tables configured for global search or your workspace search. For the list of global search sources included in the base system, see [Default global search sources for Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md).

#### Procedure

1.  Define the new search source in the Search Source \[sys\_search\_source\] table.

    1.  Select **All**.

    2.  In the **Filter** field, enter `sys_search_source.list`.

    3.  Press Enter.

    4.  Select **New**.

    5.  On the Search Source form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Name|Name to display for the search source in the global search results page.|
        |Table|Table to make searchable for global search.|
        |Conditions|Filter conditions that table records must satisfy to be searchable.|
        |Application|Application scope for the search source. This field is automatically set.|

    6.  Select **Submit**.

2.  Link the new search source to the record for the global or workspace search application in the Search Application Configurations \[m2m\_search\_context\_config\_search\_source\] table.

    1.  Select **All**.

    2.  In the **Filter** field, enter `m2m_search_context_config_search_source.list`.

    3.  Press Enter.

    4.  Select **New**.

    5.  Select the additional actions icon \[Omitted image "polaris-ui-form-context-menu-icon.png"\] Alt text:, then select **Configure** &gt; **Form Layout**.

    6.  Use the slushbucket to add the Search context config field to the selected field list, then select **Save**.

 To add the search source for a workspace application, select the record for that application. For example, to add a search source for Agent Workspace, select the **Agent Workspace Search Config** record.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    8.  Select **Submit**.

3.  Reorder search sources for the global or workspace search application.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **Search Experience** &gt; **Search Applications**.

    2.  Open the record for the search application.

        **Note:** For global search, open the **Now Experience Search Configuration** record. For a workspace application, open the record for that application, such as the **Agent Workspace Search Config** record for Agent Workspace.

    3.  In the Application Search Sources related list, edit the **Order** values for search source records to alter the display order for table filters on the application's search results page.


#### Result

The new search source appears in global or workspace search results.

## Search groups filter global text search results by table in Core UI

Global text search in Core UI displays search results broken out by search group. A search group is a collection of related searchable tables.

Within each search group, the system divides search results by table. A user must have read access to a table to see search results for it.

### Displaying search results by group

The system displays knowledge and service catalog search results within their respective search results pages. The system displays other results in list format.

For exact match searches, the system only returns records from the Task \(task\) and Knowledge \(kb\_knowledge\) tables.

**Note:** The system filters global search results to display only knowledge articles that are in the same language as the preferred language setting.

\[Omitted image "ExampleGlobalSearchResults.png"\] Alt text: Search results showing Tasks search group name and Incidents table name.

### Options for administrators

Administrators can customize these search group settings for all users:

-   Specifying which tables are part of the group.
-   Specifying whether the search group is available for use.
-   Specifying whether searches include results from this search group by default.
-   Creating new search groups.

Enabling a search group allows users to see records from the search group's tables. Disabling a search group hides records from the search group's tables.
