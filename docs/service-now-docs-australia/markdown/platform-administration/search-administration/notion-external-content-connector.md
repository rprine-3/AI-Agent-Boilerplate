# Notion external content connector

The Notion external content connector retrieves pages and files from your Notion source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Search administrators can run or schedule content crawls to retrieve updated content from your source system, or user permission crawls to retrieve updated security principals from your source system. Both types of crawl feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

**Important:** The Notion external content connector doesn't retrieve per-user permissions when running content crawls. All content indexed by the connector is searchable by all mapped users who have access to your configured AI Search experience.
