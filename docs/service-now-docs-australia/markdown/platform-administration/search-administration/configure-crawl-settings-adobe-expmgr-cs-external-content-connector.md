# Configure crawl settings for an Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector

Specify the nodes you want your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector to crawl. Define inclusion or exclusion filters to dictate the types of content the crawl retrieves and feeds to AI Search for indexing.

## Before you begin

A connector administrator must have already created the Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector that you want to configure crawl settings for. To learn about this procedure, see [Create an Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/create-ext-cont-connector-adobe-expmgr-cs.md).

Role required: sn\_ext\_conn.xcc\_admin

## About this task

This task is optional. By default, the Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector crawls all nodes located beneath the `/content/dam` node of its specified source system and sends assets with all supported file extensions to AI Search for indexing. Only perform this task if you want the connector to use any of the following non-default settings:

-   Inclusion or exclusion filters for the nodes to crawl when running content crawls
-   Inclusion or exclusion filters for the file extensions of assets to retrieve when running content crawls

Content is only retrieved from the source system if it passes all of your configured crawl setting filters. If any crawl setting filter excludes a content item, the external content connector doesn't retrieve it.

**Important:**

By default, each external content connector can index up to one million \(1,000,000\) content items from its source system. When a connector exceeds this limit, it continues to crawl the source system, but only sends content item deletions and updates to AI Search for indexing, ignoring new content items. The connector logs an error message for every 10,000 content items it crawls beyond the indexing limit.

When a connector's indexed content item count exceeds 800,000, a warning message appears in the connector's UI to indicate that it's approaching the indexing limit. If the connector reaches the indexing limit, an error message appears in its UI.

External content connectors that support user permissions crawls can handle permissions for up to five hundred thousand \(500,000\) users and their groups. If a connector retrieves users in excess of this limit, user and group permissions may not be correctly applied to the connector's retrieved content. As a result, the content may not be searchable.

If one of your connectors reaches the content indexing limit, you can update its crawl settings and file inclusion/exclusion filters to reduce the number of content items it retrieves. Alternatively, if you need a connector to index more than 1,000,000 content items, you can create a Customer Service and Support case at [https://support.servicenow.com/now](https://support.servicenow.com/now) to request a limit increase for the connector.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **External Content Connectors** &gt; **External Content Admin Home**.

2.  In the Connectors list, select the record for the Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector whose settings you want to modify.

3.  In the connector editor's Settings tab, select **Crawl settings**.

4.  Select one of the following **Nodes** options:

    -   To crawl all nodes that descend from the specified start node, select **Crawl all nodes**.
    -   To crawl only a specified set of nodes that descend from the specified start node, select **Include only these nodes**, then use the **Add node path to include** field and **Add** button to enter paths for nodes you want the connector to include when crawling.

        As an example, you might enter `/content/dam/en/documentation` to only retrieve searchable content from this descendant node.

    -   To crawl all but a specified set of nodes that descend from the specified start node, select **Exclude only these nodes**, then use the **Add node path to exclude** field and **Add** button to enter paths for nodes you want the connector to exclude when crawling.

        As an example, you might enter `/content/dam/en/engineering-ui-assets` to exclude searchable content from this descendant node.

5.  Select one of the following **Assets** options:

    -   To retrieve all assets with supported file extensions from the source system, select **Crawl all assets**.
    -   To retrieve only assets with specified file extensions from the source system, select **Include only these file extensions**, then use the **File extensions to include** field to enter asset file extensions you want the connector to include when crawling.

        As an example, you might enter `.pdf` to retrieve only assets with the Portable Document Format file type.

    -   To retrieve all assets except those with specified file extensions from the source system, select **Exclude only these file extensions**, then use the **File extensions to exclude** field to enter asset file extensions you want the connector to exclude when crawling.

        As an example, you might enter `.csv` to exclude assets with the Comma-Separated Values \(CSV\) file format.

    For details on the supported asset file extensions, see [Binary file extensions supported in External Content Connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/file-extensions-ext-cont-connector.md).

6.  If you want AI Search to automatically generate captions for content in attachments and files retrieved by the connector, select the **Multimodal captions** option.

    When you select this option, the Platform Multimodal Service automatically generates descriptive captions for images, tables, charts, and other visual elements found in retrieved attachments and files. You can discover these retrieved attachments and files by searching for terms from their generated captions.

    This option is only available when the Platform Multimodal Service plugin is activated on your instance.

    -   For details on activating the plugin, see [Activate the Platform Multimodal Service plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/activate-platform-multimodal-service-plugin.md).
    -   To learn how to select the VLM \(visual learning model\) provider and model used for the Platform Multimodal Service, see [Configure multimodal captioning for AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-multimodal-captioning-for-ai-search.md).
7.  Select **Save and validate**.


## Result

The Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector is updated with your modified crawl settings.

## What to do next

To retrieve content from your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service source system using your modified crawl settings, create and run a one-time content crawl for your Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service external content connector. To learn about creating and running one-time content crawls, see [Create a content crawl for an external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/create-content-crawl-external-content-connector.md).
