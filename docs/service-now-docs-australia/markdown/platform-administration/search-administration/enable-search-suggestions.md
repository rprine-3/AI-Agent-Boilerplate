Enable the Search Suggestions application to improve the Zing search user experience.

## Before you begin

## About this task

The Search Suggestions application is available on new instances by default. On upgraded instances, Search Suggestions is enabled for Now Mobile and disabled for Service Portal by default.

The following system properties enable and disable Search Suggestions:

-   **glide.search.suggestions.enabled**: Set to **true** \(default\) to enable Search Suggestions in Zing, or set to **false** to disable Search Suggestions in Zing.
-   **glide.service\_portal.search\_as\_you\_type\_behavior**: Select **Suggestions** or **Typeahead** functionality in the Service Portal.

On new instances, the first parameter is set to **true** and the second is set to **Suggestions**. In upgraded instances, the parameters are set to whatever was previously enabled.
