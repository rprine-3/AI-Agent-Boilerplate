# Asana external content connector

The Asana external content connector retrieves projects, tasks, and comments from your Asana source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to retrieve updated content and access permissions from your source system, or user permission crawls to retrieve updated security principals from your source system. Both types of crawl feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

-   **[Configure Asana for external content indexing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-asana-external-content-indexing.md)**  
Create and authorize an OAuth 2.0 application in the Asana developer console to allow the Asana external content connector to access your Asana source system.

-   **[Configure crawl settings for an Asana external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-crawl-settings-asana-external-content-connector.md)**  
Specify the projects you want your Asana external content connector to crawl. Define inclusion or exclusion filters to dictate the types of content the crawl retrieves and feeds to AI Search for indexing.
