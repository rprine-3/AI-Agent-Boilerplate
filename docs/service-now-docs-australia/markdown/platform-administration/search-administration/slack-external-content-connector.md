# Slack external content connector

The Slack external content connector retrieves attachments from public channels in your Slack source system and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

Connector administrators can run or schedule content crawls to update searchable content and metadata from your source system. Content crawls feed their data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.

## Slack connector limitations

The Slack external content connector doesn't retrieve text or metadata content from messages in your Slack source system's public channels. It only retrieves and indexes attachments from those public channels.

User access permissions aren't preserved for indexed attachments, so any user with access to your indexed Slack content can view any indexed attachment.

The connector doesn't retrieve content from your Slack source system's private channels.
