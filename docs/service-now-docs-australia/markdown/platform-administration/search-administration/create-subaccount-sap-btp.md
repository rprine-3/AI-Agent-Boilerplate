# Create a subaccount in the SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\)

Create a subaccount with required entitlements in your SAP global account using the SAP BT cockpit. You need this subaccount in order to configure SAP access for the SAP DMS external content connector.

## Before you begin

You must be a global account administrator on the SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\). Your global account must be authorized to access the SAP Document Management Service.

Role required: none

## About this task

This task is optional. To configure the SAP DMS external content connector, you need a subaccount in your SAP BTP global account, with these entitlements:

-   Document Management Service, Application Option
-   Document Management Service, Integration Option
-   Document Management Service, Repository Option
-   Cloud Foundry Environment
-   Authorization and Trust Management Service

If your SAP BTP global account already includes a subaccount with these entitlements, you can skip this task and go on to configure your SAP BTP global account to allow access by the connector. For details on this procedure, see [Configure SAP DMS for external content indexing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-sap-dms-external-content-indexing.md).
