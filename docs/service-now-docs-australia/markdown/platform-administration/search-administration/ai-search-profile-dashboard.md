# AI Search Profile dashboard

The AI Search Profile dashboard summarizes indexed record counts and search query traffic associated with a search profile defined in AI Search. Interactive filters enable users to choose a search profile and select the time frame for analysis of search query traffic.

To access the dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Analytics** &gt; **Search Profile Analytics**.

**Note:** If the dashboard displays a `Read operation on table '<name>' from scope 'Advanced AI Search Management Tools' was denied` informational message, ask your administrator to perform the steps described in [Create a cross-scope access privilege for the AI Search dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/ais-dashboards-cross-scope-access.md) for the listed table.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform® roles

To view or edit the dashboard, you must have the ais\_admin role.

You may need additional roles to view and select search profiles for some AI Search applications or portals. For example, the **ESC Portal Default Search Profile** for the ESC portal is only visible in the search profile list if you have Employee Center administrator \[sn\_hr\_sp.esc\_admin\] role.
