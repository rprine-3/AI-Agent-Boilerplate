## About this task

The Miro external content connector retrieves searchable text content and metadata from boards in your Miro source system using the Miro REST API.

To allow the connector to access your Miro source system via the Miro REST API, you must configure and authorize an OAuth 2.0 application in the Miro Developer Hub. Your connector administrator can use settings copied from the OAuth 2.0 application to configure the Miro external connector for proper connection to your source system.

## Procedure

1.  In the Miro Developer Hub, create a new application for the Miro external content connector.

    1.  Navigate to [https://developers.miro.com/](https://developers.miro.com/) and log in with your Company Admin credentials.

    2.  Navigate to **Your apps**, then select **Create a new app**.

        If you haven't created an app before, the app creation link may show **Create your first app** instead of **Create a new app**.

        The Profile settings screen appears and displays a Create new app modal window.

    3.  In the Create new app modal window, enter a name for your new app.

        As an example, you might enter `Miro external content connector`.

    4.  Select the Developer team for your new app.

    5.  Select the **Expire user authentication token** option.

    6.  Select **Create app**.

    The Profile settings page displays settings for your new app.

2.  Record the client settings for your new app.

    1.  In the App Credentials section of the app's settings screen, copy the client ID for your new app and record it in a secure location.

        **Important:** Your external content connector administrator needs this client ID when configuring the Miro external content connector.

    2.  Copy the client secret for your new app and record it in a secure location.

        **Important:** Your external content connector administrator needs this client secret when configuring the Miro external content connector.

3.  Configure the OAuth 2.0 redirect URI for your new application.

    1.  In the Redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 section of the app's settings screen, enter `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`, replacing `<instance-name>` with your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance hostname.

    2.  Select **Add**.

    The new redirect URI appears in the application's settings.

4.  Configure permissions for your new application.

    1.  In the Permissions section of the app's settings screen, select the options for the following permissions in the All plans listing:

        -   boards:read
        -   identity:read
        -   team:read
    2.  Select the options for the following permissions in the Enterprise plan only listing:

        -   organizations:read
        -   organizations:teams:read
        -   projects:read
    Your permissions changes are automatically saved as you make them.


## What to do next

Provide the following items to your connector administrator:

-   The OAuth 2.0 application client ID that you copied in step [2.a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-miro-external-content-indexing.md)
-   The OAuth 2.0 application client secret that you copied in step [2.b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configure-miro-external-content-indexing.md)

Your connector administrator needs these items to configure a Miro external content connector to retrieve searchable text content and metadata and security principals from your Miro source system.
