# Install External Content Connectors

Install the External Content Connectors applications from the ServiceNow® Store.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

Your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance must be cloud-hosted. The External Content Connectors applications aren't supported on on-premise \(self-hosted\) instances.

Role required: admin

## About this task

To make content from your external source systems accessible in AI Search, you must install the External Content Connectors Application Suite plugin from the ServiceNow Store.

When you install this plugin, it automatically installs plugins for the following applications:

-   External Content Connectors
-   External Content Connectors Admin
-   All available External Content Connectors connector applications except for the following, which you must install separately if you want them:
    -   ServiceNow product documentation external content connector
    -   Webcrawler external content connector

Your instance needs inbound mTLS support to run external content connector crawls. If inbound mTLS support isn't already activated for your instance, it should be automatically activated after you install the External Content Connectors Application Suite plugin.

**Note:** Automatic activation of inbound mTLS support on your instance may take up to 24 hours. To check the activation status for this feature, see [Verify whether inbound mTLS support is activated for your instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/verify-adcv2-inbound-mtls-enabled.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the External Content Connectors Application Suite application \(sn\_ext\_conn\_suite\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can't find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  Select **Install**.

4.  If you want to use the ServiceNow product documentation external content connector, repeat the preceding steps to find and install the External Content Connectors SN Docs \(sn\_ext\_conn\_sndocs\) application.

    See the [External Content Connectors SN Docs](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/6269b0fc1b95a650ddfa16db234bcb89) application on the ServiceNow Store.

5.  If you want to use the Webcrawler external content connector, repeat the preceding steps to find and install the External Content Connectors Web Crawler \(sn\_ext\_conn\_wc\) application.

    See the [External Content Connectors Web Crawler](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/5169bc781bd9a650396216db234bcb1b) application on the ServiceNow Store.


## What to do next

With the External Content Connectors applications installed, connector admins can configure connectors to crawl content, metadata, users, and group memberships from supported external content repositories. They can also configure crawl settings and create and schedule crawls for those connectors. For details on external content connector configuration, see [Configuring External Content Connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/configuring-ext-cont-connectors.md).

Check whether inbound mTLS support is activated for your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance. You need this feature activated to run crawls for external content connectors.
