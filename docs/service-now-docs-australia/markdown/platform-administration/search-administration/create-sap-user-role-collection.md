# Create a SAP user and role collection

Create a user and a role collection in the SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\) cockpit. The SAP DMS external content connector needs this user account to access your SAP DMS content.

## Before you begin

You must be a global account administrator on the SAP BTP.

-   Document Management Service, Application Option
-   Document Management Service, Integration Option
-   Document Management Service, Repository Option
-   Cloud Foundry Environment
-   Authorization and Trust Management Service

If you don't already have a subaccount with these entitlements in your SAP BTP global account, perform the [Create a subaccount in the SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/create-subaccount-sap-btp.md) preliminary task before performing this task.
