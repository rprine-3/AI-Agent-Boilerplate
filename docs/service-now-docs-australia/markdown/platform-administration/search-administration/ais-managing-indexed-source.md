# Managing indexed sources from the AI Search Admin console

If you have the ais\_admin role, you can create, view, or edit indexed sources directly from the AI Search Admin console.

## Indexed sources overview

Indexed sources are ServiceNow AI Platform® tables and external documents that you want to make searchable. AI Search then adds the content from these sources to its search index. The configuration for the indexed sources is shared by AI Search and other applications. For more information, see [Indexed sources in AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/indexed-sources-ais.md).

The following example shows the indexed sources configuration table in the Shared Configuration tab of the AI Search Admin console. From here, you can view, edit, or create indexed sources.

## Indexed sources table

The Indexed sources configuration table displays key details of existing indexed source, such as name, source table, type, status, and more.

Overall status

</td><td>

Status of the indexed source:-   **Inactive**

The indexed source isn't searchable and overrides other statuses.

-   **Never indexed**

The indexed source is active, but it has never been full indexed. This status can be combined with the **Reindex required** status.

The indexed source is being indexed manually.

The indexed source configuration is updated and the source must be indexed again.

Indexing method

</td><td>

Methods used in information retrieval systems, such as AI Search to organize and retrieve text-based data by selecting either keyword or semantic:-   **Keyword**

Helps to identify and index-specific keywords or phrases from the text.

-   **Semantic**

An advanced semantic vector search that goes beyond keywords. This method helps to understand the meaning or context of words within a document.
