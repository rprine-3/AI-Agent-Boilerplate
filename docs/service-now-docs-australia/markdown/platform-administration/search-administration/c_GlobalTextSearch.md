# Global search finds records from multiple tables

Search multiple record types from a single search field.

To perform a global search, perform one of the following actions based on your UI version.

|UI version|Action|
|----------|------|
|Next Experience UI|Enter your search terms in the Unified Navigation search field, then select **View results** or press Enter.|
|Core UI|Select the search icon in the banner on the upper right of the [System settings for the user interface \(UI\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/r_UI16BannerFrame.md) , then enter your search terms and press Enter.|

All UI versions also have a global search keyboard shortcut. The `ui_global_text_search` UI Macro provides the global search field.

For a list of search source tables that the system searches by default, along with steps for adding new search source tables, see [Default global search sources for Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md) and [Default global text search groups for Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md).

Global search supports Boolean operators, quoted phrases, and wildcard characters. For details on these search features, see [Boolean operators allow conditional search results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/c_BooleanOperators.md), [Quotation marks allow exact phrase searches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/c_PhraseSearches.md), and [Wildcard characters allow searching for patterns and variations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/c_Wildcards.md).

-   **[Global search displays a page of matching results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/global-search-polaris-ui.md)**  
Global search displays a page of results that match your search, grouped by table.
-   **[Text search views control format of global search results for tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/text-search-view-formats-results.md)**  
The text\_search view for a table determines how global search displays results from that table.
-   **[Search settings filter and group global search results by table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/search-settings-filter-group-table.md)**  
Global search filters and groups matching results by table. You can configure search sources \(in Next Experience UI\) or search groups to define tables and groups for global search.
-   **[Global search displays exact matching records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/exact-matches-global-search.md)**  
When your search exactly matches the **Number** field value for a record, global search takes you directly to that record, bypassing the search results page.
-   **[Global search displays your most recent search queries and results in Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/global-search-recent-queries-results.md)**  
When you select the empty Unified Navigation search field, the system displays lists showing your most recent search queries and your most recently viewed search results. Select a **Recently Searched** query to repeat it, or select a **Recently Viewed** search result record to navigate to it.
-   **[Set global text search properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/set-global-text-search-properties.md)**  
Administrators can control how global text search behaves with system properties.
-   **[Set the preview limit for global or workspace search in Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/set-app-preview-limit-polaris-ui.md)**  
Override the default limit of 5 preview results per search source on the Next Experience UI search results page for global or workspace search.
-   **[Hide per-table search result counts in Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/hide-result-counts-polaris-ui.md)**  
Suppress display of per-table search result counts in the Next Experience UI search results page.
-   **[Add a workspace application to the Unified Navigation search context menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/add-app-search-context-polaris-ui.md)**  
Enable users to view results for their Unified Navigation searches in workspace applications as well as in global search.
-   **[Global text search suggestions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/r_GlobalTextSearchSuggestions.md)**  
Global text search offers two types of search suggestions.
