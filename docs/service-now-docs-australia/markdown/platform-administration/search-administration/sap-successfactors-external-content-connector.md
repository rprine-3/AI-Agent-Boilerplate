# SAP SuccessFactors external content connector

The SAP SuccessFactors external content connector parses trainings exported from your SAP SuccessFactors Learning environment and makes their content and metadata searchable in AI Search applications.

The SAP SuccessFactors connector runs content and user permission crawls. Unlike most connector crawls, these crawls don't retrieve content or security principals directly from your SAP SuccessFactors Learning source system. Instead, content retrieval involves these steps:

1.  As a one-time step, a SAP SuccessFactors Learning admin creates three custom reports that retrieve the user, library and assignment, and training item data needed by the connector. These custom reports can be imported into SAP SuccessFactors Learning environments as needed.
2.  On a schedule of your choosing, a SAP SuccessFactors Learning admin runs the custom reports in your SAP SuccessFactors Learning environment. This process exports three comma-separated value \(CSV\) data files containing trainings content and security principals from the selected environment.
3.  After each data export, a connector administrator updates the SAP SuccessFactors connector configuration, attaching the latest exported CSV data files.
4.  On a schedule of your choosing, the connector runs content and user permission crawls. During a crawl, the connector parses the attached CSV data files to discover trainings content or security principals. It sends the discovered data to AI Search for indexing.

The indexed content and metadata are stored as records in a connector-specific indexed source. Search administrators can create search sources from this indexed source and link them to search profiles to make the indexed records searchable in AI Search applications.
