# Search signal tables

Search uses tables to store details from user searches, search refinements, and interactions with search results. These details are called search signals. Data from the search signal tables helps improve the relevancy of search results in your system.

Search signals refer to user, query, and similar data stored in columns on search suggestion tables. For a guide to search suggestion tables and their columns, see [Search Suggestions tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-suggestions/understanding-search-suggestion-tables.md).

**Note:** Because the search signal tables are system tables, they are excluded from the Reporting module by default. To learn about enabling reporting on system tables, see [Reporting on system tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_ReportOnSystemTables.md).
