# Create or edit an EVAM view definition

Create or edit an Entity View Action Mapper \(EVAM\) view definition in the AI Search Admin console to customize how your AI Search results appear in the portal or workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or ais\_admin

## About this task

An EVAM is a data source type tool that helps standardize how data appears in lists and cards. An EVAM allows users to combine data from multiple sources, configure views for each source, and navigate through large data sets. By creating or editing an EVAM definition, you can combine the conditions, fields, and declarative actions with an associated view template to customize the result-card interface to your needs.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search Admin** &gt; **AI Search Admin Home**.

2.  On the **Applications** tab, select the application card that you want to create or edit the EVAM configurations for.

3.  In the left pane, select **Result-card Interface**.

    The result-card Interface shows the configured EVAM definition. You can modify the existing EVAM definition or if you’re configuring your application for the first time, you can add a new EVAM definition. For more information, see step 4.

4.  Update an existing EVAM definition or add a new definition.

    -   To update the existing EVAM definition for the result-card interface, select **Change**.
    -   To add a new EVAM definition and configure the result-card interface for the first time, select **Choose**.
    1.  Create or update an EVAM definition for the result-card interface.
