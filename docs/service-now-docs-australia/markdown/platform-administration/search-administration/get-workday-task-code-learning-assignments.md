# Get Workday task code for Find Learning Assignments

Get the task code for the Find Learning Assignments task from your Workday tenant. The Workday external content connector needs this task code to retrieve Learning assignment data from Workday.

## Before you begin

You need the manager role and access to the Find Learning Assignments task in your organization's Workday tenant.

Role required: none

## About this task

This task is optional. The Workday external content connector can retrieve Learning assignment data from your Workday source system. If you don't want to retrieve Learning assignment data from Workday, you can skip this task.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your Workday tenant with your manager credentials.

2.  In the Workday search bar, search for the **Find Learning Assignments** task and select it.

3.  Copy the task code from the Workday URL for the Find Learning Assignments page and store it in a secure location.

    The task code is the path element between the final slash and the `.htmld` extension in the URL shown for the Find Learning Assignments page. As an example, if your Find Learning Assignments page URL is `https://impl.workday.com/example/d/task/3005$6923.htmld`, the task code is `3005$6923`.

    **Important:** Your external content connector administrator needs this task code when configuring the Workday external content connector to retrieve Learning assignment data.


## What to do next

Provide the task code you copied in step [3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/get-workday-task-code-learning-assignments.md) to your connector administrator. They need this task code to configure a Workday external content connector to retrieve Learning assignment data from your Workday source system.
