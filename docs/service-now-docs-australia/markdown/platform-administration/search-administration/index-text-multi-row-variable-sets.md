# Enable indexing of text in multi-row variable sets

Make text from multi-row Service Catalog variable sets searchable in global search.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, Zing doesn't index text from multi-row Service Catalog variable sets. Global search doesn't return results for text in these variable sets.

Administrators can override this default behavior by adding the **glide.ts.index.variableset**system property and setting its value to **true**. With this value set, Zing indexes text in multi-row variable sets, and global search returns results for that text.

To learn more about variable sets, see [Service catalog variable sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_ServiceCatalogVariableSets.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table's list view.

    1.  Select **All**.

    2.  In the **Filter** field, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    3.  Press Enter.

2.  Search the table for a system property with name **glide.ts.index.variableset**.

    -   If the property already exists, change its value to **true** and skip the following steps.
    -   If the property doesn't exist, go on to the following steps.
3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the System Property form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Name|glide.ts.index.variableset|
    |Type|true \| false|
    |Value|true|

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

Zing indexes text from multi-row Service Catalog variable sets so that you can find it using global search.

## What to do next

To see text from multi-row variable sets immediately in global searches, regenerate the text indexes for the affected tables. For details on this procedure, see [Regenerate a text index for a table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-administration/t_RegenerateATextIndexForATable.md).

If you don't regenerate the text indexes for the affected tables, records on those tables will be reindexed as they are updated or added. Global searches will only return text from multi-row variable sets on reindexed records.
