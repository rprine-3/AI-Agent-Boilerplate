# Set up OAuth authentication for a clone target

Complete a one-time OAuth setup to register a target instance for cloning. This process generates a Client ID on the target instance and authorizes the connection from the source instance.

## Before you begin

The target instance must run an OAuth-capable version of the Clone Admin Console OAuth clone target authentication requires Australia Patch 5 or later on both the source and target instances.

Roles required:

-   Source instance: clone\_admin
-   Target instance: clone\_admin and oauth\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Clone Admin Console** &gt; **Clone Home**.

2.  Navigate to **Configuration** &gt; **Clone instances**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  In the **Target Instance** field, enter the target instance URL and select **Continue**.

    The system runs a version compatibility check.

    If the target instance doesn't support OAuth authentication, the system falls back to basic authentication. The target-instance user must have:

    -   the clone\_admin role
    -   the soap role
    -   identity\_type set to machine on the user record
    **Warning:**

    The **identity\_type** field may not appear on the User form by default. If it isn't visible, add it temporarily using Form Layout.

    Users with identity\_type = machine can no longer log in to the instance UI. This configuration supports Basic Auth for automated and integration traffic only.

      recommends using OAuth for cloning. For more information, see [Troubleshooting for registering target instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/register-target-instance-troubleshooting.md).

5.  Select **Setup OAuth on Target**.

    The target instance opens in a new browser tab.

6.  On the OAuth setup page, select **Set up OAuth**.

    The page generates a Client ID.

    If the Client ID is not generated, verify that you have the oauth\_admin role on the target instance and that the page loaded completely before selecting **Set up OAuth**.

7.  Copy the **Client ID**.

8.  Return to the source instance browser tab.

9.  In the **Client ID** field on the Add Clone Target form, paste the Client ID.

10. Select **Add Target**.

    The browser redirects to the target instance to complete authorization.

11. Select **Allow** to grant consent.

    If your session has expired, log in to the target instance before granting consent.

    The browser redirects to the source instance.

    If the browser doesn't redirect to the source instance, return to the Clone Admin Console and select **Reset OAuth or Retry** to restart the authorization.


## Result

The target instance is registered and authorized for clone requests.

## What to do next

-   To submit a clone request to the new target, see [Request a clone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_StartAClone.md).
-   To reset or re-authorize OAuth for this target, see .
