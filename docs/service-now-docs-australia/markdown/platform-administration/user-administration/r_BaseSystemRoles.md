# Base system roles

Administrators can assign one or more base system user roles to grant access to base system platform features and applications.

To learn more about managing per-user subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md) and contact your account representative.

**Important:** Avoid granting an admin role when more specialized roles are available.

## Administrator \[admin\]
