# Grant a time-limited user role

Learn how to assign a role to a user temporarily. Use this feature if you have a user who needs to perform a one-time action that is normally outside their roles.

## Before you begin

Role required: user\_admin

**Note:**

-   Time-limited user roles can be assigned to a user for a maximum of 5 days.
-   For a user, you can assign only `admin`, `snc_read_only`, `impersonator`, and \(or\) `snc_required_script_writer_permission` role as time-limited role.
-   Time-limited user roles are not displayed to the assigned users under the **Roles** tab of the user \(sys\_user\) record.
-   When the time-limited role assigned users log in, they see a notification regarding the role assignment.
-   Time-limited assignments can handle more than one role assignment to a user, even if the total duration across assignments is less than five days.
