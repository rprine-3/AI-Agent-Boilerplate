# Changing normalized company names

You can change a normalized company name several different ways. In all cases, that change affects all normalized fields referring to that company.

You have several options for changing a normalized company name:

-   Edit the Normalized Name field in the Normalized Mappings table. This method is preferred.
-   Edit the Normalized Company name table.
-   Edit the Company Name field on any table that refers to the Company \[core\_company\] table.

**Warning:** If you edit a field whose value is a normalized name, you change the normalized name for ALL discovered names that map to it.
