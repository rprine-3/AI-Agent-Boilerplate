# Time-limited role

Time-limited roles give users the defined role during the defined time period.

Assigning the time-limited roles ensures users have elevated access only when needed, without requiring manual revocation. When you assign a time-limited role to a user, you specify a start and end date. The system automatically activates the role at the start date and removes it when the end date passes, eliminating the need for manual access cleanup.

## Supported roles and limits

Time-limited roles enhance security by automatically reducing privileges when no longer needed, support compliance through time-bound access policies, and improve efficiency by eliminating manual tracking and revocation. The following table provides information about the available time-limited roles and limits:
