# User self-registration

The User Registration Request \[com.snc.user\_registration\] plugin provides the ability for unregistered users to request access to a ServiceNow instance. An administrator can activate the plugin.

A user can request an account by navigating to the instance. If the plugin is installed, a new section is added to the welcome screen to allow users to request a user account.

The user can complete and submit the self-registration form, and see a confirmation that it was submitted. The user receives an email when the account is registered.

**Note:** If the email address entered in the self-registration form is already in the system, the request is not submitted.

## Approve a self-registered user account

When a user submits a self-registration form, an admin can review and approve it.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Pending User Registrations** and open the request.

2.  Use the **Create User** and **Reject** related links on the registration request form to approve or deny the request.

    -   If **Create User** is selected, a new user is created using the email address as the **User ID**.
    -   If **Reject** is selected, the request is marked **Rejected**.
    If the request was accepted, the user is sent an email notification with the login information. If it was denied, the user is sent an email with the rejection information.


## Enable automatic self-registered user account approval

Admins can enable users to self-register. Enable automatic approval of such accounts to streamline user registration.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Properties** &gt; **System**.

2.  Select **Enable auto processing of user registration request**

3.  Select **save**

    If enabled, registration requests do not require approval. Instead, the business rule **Auto-Process User Registration** creates the user record from the information provided.


### What to do next

Request activation of the [Explicit Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/explicit-roles.md) \(`com.glide.explicit_roles`\) plugin. The Explicit Roles plugin creates two roles to differentiate between internal and external users.
