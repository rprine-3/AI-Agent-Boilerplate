# System roles

Administrators can control access to features and capabilities on a ServiceNow instance by assigning roles to users.

Your ServiceNow includes roles to grant access to the platform features and applications included a base system instance. Applications you install on your instance may include additional roles to control access to those installed features. For more information about roles, see [Exploring user administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/exploring-user-administration.md).

**Important:** Base system and roles installed with applications can be deactivated by administrators, but can’t modify or rename these roles.

## Base system roles

Base system roles are present in all ServiceNow instances and don’t require the installation of additional plugins.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

admin

</td><td>

The system administrator role. This role has access to all system features, functions, and data because administrators can override access control list \(ACL\) rules and pass all role checks. Avoid assigning this role to your users when more targeted roles are available.

 **Warning:** Grant this privilege carefully. If you have sensitive information, such as HR records, that you need to protect, you must create a custom admin role for that area. You must also train any users authorized to see those records to act as the administrator. Also note the [Special Administrative Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/r_SpecialAdministrativeRoles.md).
