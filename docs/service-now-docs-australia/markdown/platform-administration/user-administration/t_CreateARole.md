# Create a role

Create a role to control access to features and capabilities in applications and modules. The new role doesn’t have access to any application or module until you add other roles to it, or add it to the appropriate applications and modules.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

After access has been granted to a role, all groups or users assigned to the role are granted the access. Roles can contain other roles, and any access granted to a role is granted to any role that contains it.

For a complete list of the roles included with the base instance, see [Base system roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/r_BaseSystemRoles.md)

**Warning:** If your organization hasn't manually allocated user-based subscriptions before,subscription assignments are based on user roles and the kind of access each role permits. Creating, customizing, and assigning roles can have subscription usage impact. For more information about how roles are evaluated for subscription assignment, see [Automatic subscription assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-subscription-auto-assignment.md).

Move this action to the background so you aren’t waiting when adding a number of group members by adding the system property **glide.ui.schedule\_slushbucket\_save\_for\_group\_roles**. Set the system property to **true**. The system user is used to create records or update existing ones since the action is running in the background.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Roles** and create a record.

2.  Complete the form.
