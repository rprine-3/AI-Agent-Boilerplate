# Delegating roles

Administrators can grant users the ability to assign roles within groups. However, these users can only assign roles that they already have.

Role delegators are users responsible for assigning roles to other users within a group. This role can be assigned manually by granting the role\_delegator role to the user, or through the **Group Manager Change** business rule.

The **Group Manager Change** business rule, which is disabled by default, automatically grants the role\_delegator role to a user who is designated manager of a group in the **Manager** field on the **Group** form. The role is removed when the user is no longer the manager of the group.

Activate the business rule to take advantage of it. For more information on **Business rules**, see [Classic Business rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/c_BusinessRules.md).
