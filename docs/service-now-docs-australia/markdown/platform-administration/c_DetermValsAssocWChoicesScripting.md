# Values to associate with choice labels for scripting

When you write a script that references a choice list, you need to know the value that is associated with each choice.

For example, to check whether the incident\_state field is active, you could not use the condition `current.incident_state == "active"` because the value associated with the choice labeled **Active** is the integer **2**. Instead, you would use the condition `current.incident_state == 2`.

The **Type** field on the choice list dictionary entry determines the data type of the values.

To determine the value associated with a choice, right-click the field label and select **Show Choice List**, and then locate the choice for which you need to know the value.

The **-- None --** option may not have a sys\_choice record associated with it. A choice list field set to **-- None --** evaluates to these values, depending on the script context as listed below.

-   For client-side scripts,such as client scripts: "" \(empty string\)
-   For server-side scripts, such as business rules: "0" \(string of the number zero\)
