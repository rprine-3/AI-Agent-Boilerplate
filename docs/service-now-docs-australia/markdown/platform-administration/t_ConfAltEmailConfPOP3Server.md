# Enable using your own POP3 server

You can use your own POP3 server to store and receive email for the instance.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin
-   Email server required: POP3
-   [Basic email properties:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ConfiguringStandardEmail.md) enabled

## Procedure

1.  Create a mailbox for your instance that has a custom email address on your POP3 server.

    For example, create a mailbox for `service-desk@company.com`.

2.  Navigate to **System Mailboxes** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Email Accounts**.

    The system displays the list of available email accounts.

3.  If you don't want to receive, email sent to the instance@service-now.com mailbox, locate the record for **ServiceNow POP3** and change **Active** to **false**.

    An instance can receive email from multiple POP3 accounts at the same time. Leaving the **ServiceNow POP3** account active permits the instance to receive email sent to the default email address.

4.  Select **New**.

    The system displays an empty email Account form.

5.  Create an email account record for your POP3 server where the **Type** is **POP3**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.
