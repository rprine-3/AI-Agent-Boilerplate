[Create a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/t_CreateAUser.md) who has an email address that you can monitor, and then [create a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/t_CreateAGroup.md) that includes the user that you created.

    2.  Navigate to **Incident** &gt; **Open**, and then open an incident in which the **Priority** is **1 - Critical**.

    3.  In the **Assignment group** field, enter the group that you created.

    4.  From the form context menu, click **Save**.

    5.  Add comments to the form to update the incident, and then click **Update**.
