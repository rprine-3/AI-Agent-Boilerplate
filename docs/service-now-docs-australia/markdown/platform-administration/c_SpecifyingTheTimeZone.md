# Time zone for email notifications

A system property controls the time zone that the instance uses for the date and time stamp of a message.

The date and time stamp of a notification uses the system time zone, not the time zone of any recipient. The email property `glide.email.append.timezone` controls whether to append the time zone. If true, the system time zone of the instance is appended to any Date/Time fields in outbound email messages \(for example, 2018-07-02 04:01:14 PST\).
