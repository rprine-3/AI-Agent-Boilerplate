# Create a push application record for your custom app

Register your customized mobile application with your instance to receive push notifications for the application.

## Before you begin

Complete the following:

1.  [Activate push notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivatePushNotifications.md)
2.  \(iOS only\) [Upload a push certificate to your instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/upload-push-cert.md)

Role required: admin or push\_admin

**Note:** This process describes configuration used in the ServiceNow mobile app. Push Notification configuration for the current ServiceNow mobile UI can be found at [Mobile push notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-push-notifications.md)

## About this task

Push notifications are application-specific: They are sent to one type of mobile application, regardless of how many users have this application installed. If you develop your own mobile application, you must configure it for use by creating a record for it in the Push Application \[sys\_push\_application\] table. By default, ServiceNow mobile applications are automatically set up and ready to use.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Push** &gt; **Push Application**, and then click **New**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
