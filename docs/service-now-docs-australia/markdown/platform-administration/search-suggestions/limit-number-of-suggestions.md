# Schedule suggestion pruning

Search Suggestions limits the number of auto-complete suggestions and search suggestions stored in the Search Suggestion \[sys\_search\_suggestion\] table to 500,000. A periodic pruning job removes the least relevant suggestions and increases the overall relevancy of suggestions.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, the pruning job runs once a week and limits the Search Suggestion \[sys\_search\_suggestion\] table to 500,000 suggestions. Once the table reaches that limit, the pruning job removes the lowest-rated auto-complete suggestions and search suggestions to keep the maximum number of suggestions at 500,000. Pruning the least relevant suggestions improves the relevancy of the suggestions.

How often you run the pruning job might depend on how frequently you [generate suggestions from the Search Suggestion table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-suggestions/schedule-search-suggestion-builds.md), and how quickly the table exceeds 500,000 suggestions.
