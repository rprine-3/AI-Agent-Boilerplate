# Domain separation and Search Suggestions

Domain separation is unsupported in the Search Suggestions application. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: No support

-   The domain field may exist on data tables but there is no business logic to manage the data.
-   This level is not considered domain-separated.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).

## Search Suggestions domain separation overview

Domain separation provides complete data isolation for domain-specific users.

## How domain separation works with Search Suggestions

By default, Search Suggestions results are limited to the specific domain of the logged-in user. Search and auto-complete suggestions aren't shared in parent or child domains.
