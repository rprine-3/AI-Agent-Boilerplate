[Set maximum age for searches used in suggestion generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-suggestions/set-maximum-number-of-search-strings.md)

</td><td>

Specify the maximum age of search strings the system considers when creating auto-complete suggestions and search suggestions. By default, the system only generates suggestions using search strings from the last 180 days.

[Prevent the creation of suggestions in special cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-suggestions/preventing-suggestions.md)

</td><td>

Disable generation of suggestions from specific search strings to keep unhelpful terms from appearing in suggestions or to prevent disclosure of personal or secure information. As part of this task, you may want to [test regular expression patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-suggestions/test-regular-expressions.md) in your Search Suggestion Exclusion List Rule entries.
