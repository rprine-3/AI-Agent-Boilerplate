# Exploring Search Suggestions

Learn how Search Suggestions displays suggestions to users in AI Search applications and the Zing text indexing and search engine. Review the rules that dictate which suggestions are offered in each search application and context.

## Search Suggestions overview

The Search Suggestions application makes it possible for search applications to display suggested search completions or results to users as they enter terms into a search field.

Search Suggestions saves query terms and results from user searches. A Build Search Suggestions script runs against this saved data periodically to generate auto-complete suggestions for AI Search and search suggestions for Zing text search. The Prune Search Suggestions script runs periodically to remove low-relevancy suggestions.

Administrators can limit the age of saved search data used to generate suggestions. They can also configure specific suggestions to prevent them from being displayed to search application users.

## Search Suggestions workflow

In this infographic, see a sample workflow of how different users in an organization configure and use auto-complete suggestions and search suggestions with the Search Suggestions application.

\[Omitted image "search-suggestions-workflow.png"\] Alt text: Infographic showing how administrators, search users, and non-authenticated guest users configure and use Search Suggestions. For details, refer to the following description.

In this Search Suggestions workflow:

1.  -   Administrators configure Search Suggestions settings, including scheduling of scripts and restrictions on which saved search results the system uses to create auto-complete suggestions and search suggestions.
-   The system saves users' search results and uses them to generate new auto-complete suggestions and search suggestions.
2.  -   Search users view and select generated auto-complete suggestions in AI Search applications.
-   Search users view and select generated search suggestions in Zing.
-   Non-authenticated guest users access and review the list of generated suggestions created from searches by external users.
3.  Administrators review and analyze saved search results to improve understanding of how users interact with generated suggestions, allowing for more effective tuning of Search Suggestions settings.
