# ServiceNow Store application listing details

The listing details page for a ServiceNow Store application shows information about the app and its features, as well as technical information about the versions available.

You can view an app's listing details by selecting an app in the ServiceNow Store. Listing details include a header with procurement options, app details, and version details.

## Header

The listing details header shows procurement options, as well as basic information like the application name and the provider. For partner applications, you can select the provider name to view the seller profile.

There are a number of possible procurement options and additional statuses that can be found in the listing details header. Options include but not limited to requesting a 30-day trial, requesting purchase, and signing custom terms and conditions.

Procurement options might be updated or replaced with status messages depending on what actions you take. For example, once you request a trial, the button with that option is replaced with a status message letting you know the trial has been requested. After the trial has been approved, the message is replaced with an option to start the 30-day trial.

Application status messages in the ServiceNow Store are based on the procurement status of an application. After an application is fully procured, a message that it's available for installation is displayed. Installation can be managed through the Application Manager. For more information, see [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/application-manager.md).
