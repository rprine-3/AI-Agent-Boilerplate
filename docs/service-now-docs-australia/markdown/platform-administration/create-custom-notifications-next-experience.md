    |Message Heading|$\{number\} changed|
    |Message|Short description: $\{short\_description\}|

## Result

When triggered, users configured to receive the notifications see notifications with custom content as banners and in the Notifications menu in the Next Experience Unified Navigation.

The UI Notification Inbox \[ui\_notification\_inbox\] table lists all sent notifications and their recipients.

If users receive duplicate notifications, verify that the notification trigger has only one content provider. If the notification has both a Next Experience and Workspace content provider, remove the Workspace content provider from the notification trigger to send only the Next Experience notification with custom content.
