# Email diagnostics

The Diagnostics and Connection page provides information on the current state of your email configuration. This page includes status on email properties, scheduled jobs, and email account connections that affect how your instance receives and sends email.

Email diagnostic information can help you identify problems with inbound or outbound email. The following video shows different steps to determine why your instance is not receiving inbound emails. One of the steps uses email diagnostics to check the email connection status and email reader scheduled job.

Navigate to the Diagnostics and Connection page from either of these modules:

-   **System Mailboxes** &gt; **Email Diagnostics**
-   **System Diagnostics** &gt; **Email Diagnostics**

For quick status on a field, point to the green check mark or red X icon. The check mark icon indicates that the item is operational or healthy, while the X icon indicates that the item is not operational or within the expected range.
