# Types of subscriptions in Subscription Management

Subscriptions to ServiceNow applications come in different types. The type of subscription determines the allocation of users, access to applications, and custom application and table entitlements.

Each type of product subscription is measured according to a meter. For details on the different types of meters and what they measure see [KB0727967](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0727967).
