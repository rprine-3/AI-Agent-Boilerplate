# Manage table cleaner resource usage

Control the system resources used table cleaner by updating the table cleaner job.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, the table cleaner job runs asynchronously with multiple producer threads creating chunks of records for deletion and multiple consumer threads processing the chunks and deleting records.

You can mitigate the impact to system performance by starting a table cleaner run using a smaller dataset, checking resource usage as it runs, and then adjusting the number of producer and consumer threads as necessary to complete the job with minimal impact to your users.

## Procedure

1.  Open the DMJobs \[sys\_dm\_job\] table by entering `sys_dm_job.list` in the filter navigator.

2.  Select the DMTableCleaner job record.

3.  Contact ServiceNow Support to change the number of producers or consumers devoted to creating or deleting chunks of records.

4.  Select **Update**.


## Result

Table cleaner begins the next run using the updated DMTableCleaner job configuration.

## What to do next

Check the status of the next table cleaner run by checking the values in the Chunks Errored column in the DMJob Runs \[sys\_dm\_run\] table. If a problem occurs, determine whether the issue occurred in all chunks or a single chunk. View the status of the individual chunks in the DMJob Chunks \[sys\_dm\_chunk\] table by checking the values in the Message and State columns.
