# Specifying the inbound email processing order

You can configure a processing order for inbound email actions and use the order to manage multiple filters in inbound email actions.

The Ordered Email Processing \(com.glide.email\_ordered\_processing\) plugin is enabled by default for new instances. Users with the admin role can activate the plugin for upgraded instances. The plugin adds the **Order** column to the Rules \[sysrule\] table, which the instance uses to determine when to process emails. Admins can also add a command to an action script that halts processing after the script runs.

## Configure the processing order

Configure the processing order for inbound email actions to force them to run in a prescribed order.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Policy** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Inbound Actions**.

2.  Open an existing inbound action or create one.

3.  Complete the form and assign an order number to the **Order** field to establish when this inbound rule should run in relation to other rules.

    If you upgraded and activated the plugin, the **Order** field might be named **Execution Order**.

    **Note:** Ensure each inbound action has a unique **Order** value to ensure the system stops processing as expected. If multiple inbound actions have the same **Order** value, the system might evaluate all of the inbound actions, even if one of them contains the `event.state="stop_processing";` script or has the **Stop processing** option selected.

4.  To stop rule processing when an inbound email action runs successfully: add the following line to the bottom of the script:

    -   Select the **Stop processing** check box.
    -   Add the following line to the bottom of the **Actions** script:

        ```
        event.state="stop_processing";
        ```


## Manage multiple filters in an inbound email action

Use process ordering and the stop\_processing command to manage multiple filters in inbound email actions.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

In this example, you can create new problem records when `prb:` appears in the subject line and new change requests when `chg:` appears in the subject line. All other emails are used to create an incident. The actions are set up as follows:

### Procedure

1.  Create an action with a condition of `Subject > starts with > chg:` and the `event.state="stop_processing";` command appended to the script.

2.  Assign this action an Order value of `100`.

3.  Create an action with a condition of `Subject > starts with > prb:` and the `event.state="stop_processing";` command appended to the script.

4.  Assign this action an Order value of `200`.

5.  Create an action for incident with no conditions and an Order value of `300`.

    It is not necessary to add the stop\_processing command to the script for the incident action unless you want processing to stop at this rule to avoid continuing to another action.


### Result

If either a change request or a problem is created, the stop\_processing command stops processing, and no incident record is created. If neither a change request nor a problem is created, the inbound email action for incident creates a record.
