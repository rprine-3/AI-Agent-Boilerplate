# Extend the functionality of a Wikitext field

Configure the Wikitext field to link to other sources within the system.

## Before you begin

Role required: personalize\_dictionary

## Procedure

1.  Right-click in the header of the new Wikitext field.

2.  Select **Configure Dictionary**

3.  In the **Dependent** field of the dictionary form, enter the field you want to use for linking to other pages.

    For example, on the Incident table, you might choose the **number** field.

    This configuration enables you to link to any incident by using that incident's number. For example, to open INC0000002, you enter `[[INC0000002]]`.

    The following [dictionary attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_DictionaryAttributes.md) are available for wiki\_text fields.

    -   **preview\_first=true** - sets the preview mode to display on page load, otherwise editor will be displayed
    -   **preview\_selector=true** - enables the toggle button to switch between the editor and preview
    -   **dual\_mode=true** - enables displaying both the editor and the preview simultaneously during edit mode.
