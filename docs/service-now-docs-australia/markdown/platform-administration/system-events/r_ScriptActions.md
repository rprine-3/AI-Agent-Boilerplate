# Script actions

You can use script actions to create server-side scripts that perform a variety of tasks, such as modifying a configuration item \(CI\), or managing failed login attempts. Script actions are triggered by events only.

Role required: sysevent\_script\_action\_admin or admin

To create a new script action, navigate to **System Policy** &gt; **Events** &gt; **Script Actions** and click **New**.

Script

</td><td>

Script that runs when the condition you define evaluates to true. Two additional objects are available in this script:-   event: a [GlideRecord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md)- the sysevent that caused this to be invoked. If you want this first parameter on the event, use **event.parm1** or **event.parm2** for the second parameter. For the date/time of the event, use **event.sys\_created\_on**. To get the user ID that created the event \(if there was a user associated\), use **event.user\_id**.
-   current: a GlideRecord- the event scheduled on behalf of \(incident for example\).
