# Resolve time

The **Resolve time** field is available on the Incident \[incident\] and Request \[sc\_request\] tables. This field allows for easy reporting on how long it takes for requests to be closed, and is stored as an integer number of seconds.

## Business rule calculation

Specific business rules calculate the **Resolve time** field when the record is resolved or marked closed, and measures the difference between the **Opened** and **Closed** dates. The field is stored in the system as an integer number of seconds.

-   On the Incident table, the field is calculated on closure by the business rule **mark\_closed**. The following lines of code calculate the resolve time:

    ```
    if (dataChange || current.calendar_stc.nil())
          current.calendar_stc = gs.dateDiff(opened, resolved, true);
    ```

-   When the incident is closed directly, the calculation is based on the **mark\_closed** business rule. The following lines of code calculate the resolve time:

    ```
    if (dataChange || current.calendar_stc.nil())
            current.calendar_stc = gs.dateDiff(opened, closed, true);
    ```


-   **[Display resolve time as a duration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/t_DisplayResolveTimeAsADuration.md)**  
You can display the resolve time as a human-readable duration rather than an integer representing a duration in seconds.
