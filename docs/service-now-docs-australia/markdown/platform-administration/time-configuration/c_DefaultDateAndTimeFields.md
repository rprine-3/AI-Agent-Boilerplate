# Default date and time fields

Certain time fields are provided by default to store particular date and time fields.

## Global timestamp fields

All records inherit certain time stamp fields from the Global \[global\] table.

-   **Created**
-   **Updated**

These fields are automatically populated with the correct date and time, expressed in Greenwich Mean Time \(GMT\), rather than in the logged in user's local time zone.

## Planned Task time fields

The Planned Task plugin provides a table \(Planned Task \[planned task\]\) with standard fields for measuring a planned task's time. For more information, see Planned Task.

-   **[Task fields for measuring work time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/c_TaskFieldsForMeasuringWorkTime.md)**  
Use default task fields to measure progress and resolution for certain records.
