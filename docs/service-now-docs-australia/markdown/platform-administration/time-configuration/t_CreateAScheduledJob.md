Create a scheduled job on the Schedule Job \[sysauto\] table.

## Before you begin

Role required: system\_scheduler\_admin

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Select the appropriate type of scheduled job.

    -   Automate the generation and distribution of a report

-   **[Automate generation and distribution of a report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/schedule-report.md)**  
Generate and distribute scheduled reports via email.
-   **[Automatically generate something from a template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/t_ScheduleTheGenerationOfAnEntity.md)**  
Schedule the generation of entities, which include changes, incidents, and CIs.
-   **[Automatically run a script of your choosing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/t_ScheduleAScriptExecution.md)**  
Schedule both conditional and non-conditional scripts. If Domain Separation is installed in the instance, you can also select, filter, sort, and schedule scripts based on their assigned domains.
-   **[Enable run types for scheduled job child tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/customize-run-times-for-scheduled-jobs.md)**  
The run types; **Day and Month in Year**, **Day in Week in Month in Year**, and **Week in Month**, require the fields; **Day**, **Month**, and **Year** to be visible. Child tables which don’t display those fields can't create jobs with that run type selected.
