# Change a time zone in a scheduled report

By default, scheduled reports use the time zone of the user who runs them \(the user in the **Run As** field\) to evaluate the query parameters. You are able to change this time zone.

## About this task

For example, a report on 'incidents open today' resolves 'today' based on the user's time zone. To manually specify the time zone used to resolve the parameters of the report:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Scheduled Reports**.

2.  Choose the report with the time zone you want to edit.

3.  Add Run as fields to the layout.

    1.  Configure the form layout to add the **Run as tz** field to the **Scheduled Report** form. See [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md) for instructions.

        The Run as tz field lets you choose either a the time zone of the user who configured the schedule, or a specific time zone.

    2.  Configure the form layout to add the **Run as \[+\]** field to the **Scheduled Report** form. See [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md) for instructions.

        The Run as \[+\] field lets you choose a specific user to run the report as.

4.  Select the time zone you would like to use.

5.  Select the user to run the report as.

6.  Click **Submit**.
