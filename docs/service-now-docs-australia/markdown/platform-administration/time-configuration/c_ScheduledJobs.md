# Scheduled jobs

Scheduled Jobs are automated pieces of work that can be performed at a specific time or on a recurring schedule.

You can automate the following kinds of tasks:

-   Automatically generate and distribute a report
-   Automatically generate and schedule an entity of records, such as an incident, change item, configuration item, from a template
-   Run scheduled jobs from scripts or business rules
-   Scheduling at the end of the month
-   Scheduling for weekdays

For developer training, see [Scheduled Script Executions and Events Objectives](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/washingtondc/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_washingtondc_automating_application_logic/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_washingtondc_scheduled_script_executions_and_events/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_washingtondc_scheduled_script_executions_and_events_objectives) on the ServiceNow Developer Site.

Use the [System Events and Jobs Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/track-events.md) to monitor the system event processing system and the scheduled jobs processing system.
