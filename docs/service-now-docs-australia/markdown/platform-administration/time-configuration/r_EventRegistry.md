# Event registry

You can use events to schedule actions or tasks to occur when conditions are fulfilled.

For example:

-   **kb.view**

    An event triggered when a user views a Knowledge Base article. You use it to trigger the script action Knowledge View that create a Knowledge Use record every time an article is viewed.

-   **incident.commented**

    An event triggered when a user comments on an article, used by two incidents commented email notifications.

-   **Inactivity Monitors**

    If a record has not been updated for a defined length of time, an inactivity monitor triggers an event.

-   **Script Actions**

    Scripts that trigger when an event is recorded in the log. You can set scripts to execute whenever a particular activity occurs in the platform, rather than at a particular time, such as scheduled jobs, or in response to particular conditions, such as [Business rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/c_BusinessRules.md).

-   **Notifications**

    You can also use events to trigger Email Notifications when an event is recorded in the log.
