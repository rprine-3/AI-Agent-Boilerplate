# Display resolve time as a duration

You can display the resolve time as a human-readable duration rather than an integer representing a duration in seconds.

## Procedure

1.  From the Incident or Request form, right-click the form header and click **Configure** &gt; **Table**.

2.  From the **Columns** embedded list, click **Resolve time**.

3.  From the **Attributes** related list, click **New**.

4.  Enter these values.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Attribute|Format|
    |Dictionary entry|Resolve time|
    |Value|glide\_duration|

5.  Click **Submit**.

    The resolve time appears in forms and lists as a duration, expressed in days, hours, and minutes.

    **Note:** This attribute does not change the field data format, which remains an integer representing a duration in seconds. In reports and data exports, it still appears as the actual number of seconds, rather than as a duration.
