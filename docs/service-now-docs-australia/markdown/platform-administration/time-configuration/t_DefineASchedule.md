# Define a schedule

Configure schedules using schedule and schedule entry records.

## Before you begin

Role required: schedule\_admin or admin

## About this task

-   Schedule records specify a time zone and a type of schedule and use one or more schedule entries. Schedule records are saved in the Schedule \[`cmn_schedule`\] table.
-   Schedule entry records specify the time periods that are included or excluded from a schedule. Schedule entries are saved in the Schedule Entry \[`cmn_schedule_span`\] table.

Alternately, you can also use the Business Calendar functions to create schedules. To learn more about creating business calendars and schedules, see [Creating business calendars](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/business-calendars.md).

**Warning:** If you’re using Performance Analytics, use caution when changing time spans. Any change you make to the time span on a business or fiscal calendar can invalidate the Performance Analytics data. Consult with a Performance Analytics administrator before making such changes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Scheduler** &gt; **Schedules** &gt; **Schedules**.

2.  Select **New**, enter a unique and meaningful **Name** and **Description** and then fill in the form.

    For detailed information on Schedule form fields, see [Schedule fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/r_ScheduleFields.md).

    **Note:** If there are no active entries defined for the current schedule, a warning message appears in the Schedule form. If your schedule is a child schedule that contains only exclusions, ignore the message because exclusions are non-active entries.

3.  Right-click the header bar and select **Save**.

    **Note:**

    -   In the Related link, select **Show Schedule** to view the schedule in the calendar using the Next Experience user interface. For more information on this framework, see [Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-landing-page.md). To create schedule entries in the [Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-landing-page.md), refer to [Create schedule entries in the Schedule calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/create-events-next-experience-ui.md).

        To use the [classic schedule calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/schedule-calendar.md), you can add the **glide.schedule.enable\_classic\_calendar** property and set it to **true**. For information on how to add a system property, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).

    -   If you create a schedule of type **maintenance** and save the record, a UI policy hides the **Type** field from the form. To view or change the **Type** value, use the list of schedules instead of the schedule form. Add the **Type** column if necessary. You can click the cell for the value in the **Type** column and modify the value in the list view.
4.  Configure one or more schedule entries.

    For detailed information on Schedule Entry form fields, see [Schedule entry fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/r_ScheduleEntryFields.md).


-   **[Schedule fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/r_ScheduleFields.md)**  
The Schedule form contains the following fields.
-   **[Schedule entry fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/r_ScheduleEntryFields.md)**  
You can only associate a schedule entry with one schedule. The **Schedule Entries** related list contains the definitions of the time periods you want to include in or exclude from the schedule.
