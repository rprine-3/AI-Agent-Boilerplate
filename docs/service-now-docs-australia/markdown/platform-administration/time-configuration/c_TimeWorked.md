# Time worked

The Task \[task\] table provides a time-tracking field called **Time worked**.

\[Omitted image "TimeTimeworked.png"\] Alt text: Time worked field

This field measures how long a record has been viewed to track work time on a ticket. Any table that extends Task can use this field. To use this field, you must first add it to the form by configuring the form layout. The Time worked field does not appear on forms by default.

As the record is viewed, the timer counts upward. To pause the timer, click the stop icon \(\[Omitted image "TimerStop.png"\] Alt text:\).

To resume the timer, click the start icon \(\[Omitted image "TimerStart.png"\] Alt text:\).

When you save a task, the amount of new time in the timer is used to generate a record on the Time Worked \[task\_time\_worked\] table. You can view this table as a related list on the task form.

By default, the time in the **Time worked** field is a cumulative value stored in the task record. If you modify a Time Worked record, the changes are not reflected in the task timer.

You can set the property **com.snc.time\_worked.update\_task\_timer** to enable updating of the task timer value, based on changes to the Time worked records. You do this using the **Update task timer** business rule.

You can also enable the dictionary attribute **time\_worked\_alert** so that updates to the time worked field make the form dirty. By default the attribute is set to false.
