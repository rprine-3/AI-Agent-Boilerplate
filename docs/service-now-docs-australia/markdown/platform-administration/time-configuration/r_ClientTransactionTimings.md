# Client transaction timings

The Client Transaction Timings plugin enhances the system logs by providing additional information about the durations of transactions taking place between the client and the server.

You can track down performance issues to their source by viewing where the time is being consumed, and how time was spent during a transaction.

This plugin requires the [Response Time Indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ResponseTimeIndicator.md) [Response Time Indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ResponseTimeIndicator.md) to be enabled, and collects information from the following browsers:

-   Firefox
-   Internet Explorer
-   Chrome

## Client Transactions Information

Installing the plugin adds the Client Transactions module to the System Logs application. It provides a list of every logged transaction between client and server within the last day:
