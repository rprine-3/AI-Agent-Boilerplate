# Use a relative duration

When you define an SLA, you can set the **Duration type** to be a relative duration.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When using relative durations, you can also use the **Relative duration works on** field. It calculates against the SLA record, or the task record that the SLA record is used for.

This example demonstrates how a relative duration of End of next business day works.

## Procedure

1.  Create an SLA that has a relative duration of **End of next business day**.

2.  Complete the rest of the fields of this SLA with the values as shown, also setting a Timezone if you want.

3.  To show how this Relative Duration works, create a new incident.

    The SLA starts for this incident. In the **Task SLAs** related list, if you look at the **Business time left** and **Start time** fields, notice that the time left is until the next business day at 5pm.

    **Note:** Pause conditions are not compatible with Relative Durations.
