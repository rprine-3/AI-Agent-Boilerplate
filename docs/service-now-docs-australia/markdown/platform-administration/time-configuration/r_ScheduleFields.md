Time Zone

</td><td>

Time zone for the schedule. If you select **Floating**, the time zone is relative to whatever process is accessing the item at the time. -   For example, if a resource manager in Amsterdam sets a floating schedule for 8:00A.M. to 5:00P.M., a user in San Jose sees the schedule as 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.
-   When a schedule is defined in a specific time zone, users in different time zones see the schedule with their own time zone applied.
