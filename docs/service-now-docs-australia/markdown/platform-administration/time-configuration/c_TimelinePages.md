# Timeline pages

Use timeline pages to track any activity bounded by two dates, such as change request start and end dates, or incident open and close dates. Administrators can create timeline pages, which are user interactive.

## Features

-   Make selected timelines available to users by role.
-   Select perspective from daily to yearly views.
-   Create dynamic labels for timeline spans.
-   Configure tooltips for each span.
-   Permit span dragging and resizing by users.
-   Lock timelines to prevent editing.

## Viewing timelines

By default, only administrators have a module to access timeline records. ITIL users can only view timelines by selecting a context menu item from an incident record.

## Administrator role users

Users with an administrator role can view timelines from the timeline page records.

1.  Navigate to **System UI** &gt; **Timeline Pages**.
2.  Select a timeline record to view.
3.  Click **View Timeline**.

## Other users

By default, timeline metrics only appear for incident records. ITIL users can view timelines associated with any task record where the metrics are set to appear as timeline records. To view the Assigned to duration and the State duration metric timelines, ITIL users can select the **Metrics Timeline** context menu UI action.

1.  Navigate to active task record, such as an incident.
2.  Right-click the banner, and select **Metrics Timeline**.

To enable non-administrators to view other timelines, [create a custom module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/time-configuration/t_MakeATimelineVisibleToASelUser.md).
