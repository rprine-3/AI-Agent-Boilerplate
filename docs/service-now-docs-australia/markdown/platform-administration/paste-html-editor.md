# Paste content into an HTML editor

Paste content from a desktop application to the HTML editor. Content might not paste the same from every application.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to an HTML field.

    For example, the **Text** field of a Knowledge article.

2.  Paste the content from another application.

    Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox don't support paste using the Paste icon. Use the command/control+V keyboard shortcut instead.

3.  From the paste formatting options dialogue, choose to **Keep** or **Remove** the text formatting for the pasted content.


## Result

The HTML editor has the following pasting limitations:

-   Pasting images: Pasting images and text from OneNote works in Microsoft browsers. Pasting from OneNote into Google Chrome or Firefox works, but styles and images aren't included. You can still select images individually and paste them into the HTML field. Pasting images and text from Microsoft Word into any browser works as expected.
-   Pasting tables: Pasting tables into Safari doesn't always work correctly. Pasting tables into Internet Explorer only works from Microsoft Excel.
