# Viewing all tables

View a list of all tables on your instance and the number of active data management rules configured on each table.

## Key benefits

-   View tables on your instance in terms of size by checking the **Table size \(GB\)** column.
-   Determine which tables have grown the most in size over the last thirty days by checking the **Growth \(30 days\)** column.
-   Determine how many archive, cleanup, and one-time delete rules are active for each table by checking the **Active rules** column.

By default, the list of live tables and live archive tables is filtered to show tables over 100 MB in size.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

The admin role is required to view the Data Management Console.

## Accessing the Tables view in the Data Management Console

Access table information in the Data Management Console in one of the following ways: You can also access the **Tables** tab by selecting View additional tables on the Overview tab.

-   Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Data Management** &gt; **Data Management Console** and select the **Tables** tab.
-   Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Data Management** &gt; **Data Management Console**. On the **Overview** tab, select **View additional tables**.

## Use cases

-   Monitor data usage for physical tables, including the Task \[task\] table.
-   Monitor data usage for logical tables, including the Incident \[incident\], Problem \[problem\], and Change Request \[change\_request\] tables.
-   Review storage breakdowns across tables in a unified view. Use this data to identify which tables contain the most archived data to adjust rule conditions or schedules.
-   Estimate future object storage requirements by accounting for the compression in columnar storage. Base your storage forecasts on actual object storage growth rates rather than primary database removal rates, as these metrics don't correlate directly.
-   Access data usage and rule details by selecting a table in the list. See [Viewing data usage by table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/data-management-table-data.md).
