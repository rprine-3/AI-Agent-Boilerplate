# Review skipped records using related lists

Use different related lists to resolve, track and review the skipped records in an upgrade.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Upgrade Center** &gt; **Upgrade History**.

    A list of upgrades is displayed.

2.  Select an upgrade from the list.

    System Upgrades form is displayed.

3.  Select any of the following related lists to review the skipped records.

    -   **Skipped Changes to Review related list**

        Resolve the skipped update records by tracking and reviewing them in the Skipped Changes to Review related list. To prevent your customizations from being overwritten during system upgrades, the upgrade process skips \(does not apply the update to\) objects that have been customized. See [Resolve a skipped update and set a resolution status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/upgrade-center/uc-resolve-skipped-update.md) for more information.

    -   **Skipped Changes Reviewed related list**

        View the list of the reviewed skipped records in the Skipped Changes Reviewed related list. When you select a skipped record to review and set a **Resolution Status** to a value other than Not Reviewed, the update record moves from Skipped Changes to Review related list to the Skipped Changes Reviewed related list.

    -   **Copies to Review related list**

        Copies to Review lists all the records that need to be reviewed.

    -   **Copies Reviewed related list**

        Copies Reviewed lists all the records that have been reviewed.

    -   **Customization Unchanged related list**

        Customizations Unchanged lists all records that were skipped \(due to a customization\), but there have been no changes from the last upgrade. See [Revert a customization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/upgrade-center/uc-revert-customization.md) for more information.

    -   **Changes Applied related list**

        Changes Applied lists all changes that were applied in this upgrade.

    -   **Claim Outcomes to Review related list**

        During system upgrades, the Claim Status tab displays outcomes to review and resolve.

    -   **Upgrade Details related list**

        Upgrade Details lists all Upgrade Details records for this upgrade.

    **Note:** The Copies to Review and Copies Reviewed related lists are Platform specific related lists.

-   Deleted: The system deleted this record.
-   Skipped: The system did not change this record in order to preserve customizations.
-   Skipped Error: The system didn't have the upgrade on this file but skipped due to reasons like the record already exist in the system in a different scope or a system property exists.

**Note:** This is editable only by a maint.

-   Reverted: This record was reverted to the base version.
-   Table not found: The system could not find the table that contains this record.
-   Unchanged: The system did not change this record because the baseline component has not changed since the last release.
-   Skipped Manual Merge: The system did not change this record because updating it requires manual intervention.
-   Skipped Apply Once: The system skipped this record because it had already applied an update from an xml file in the apply once folder.
-   Not Latest: The system applied a change, but this change was overwritten later during the same upgrade.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Priority

</td><td>

Relative importance of the conflict that caused the skip.**Note:** ServiceNow prioritizes the skipped records based on the importance of the file types. The prioritization is done as follows:

-   Priority 1 \(highest priority\): UI pages, UI macros, and more
-   Priority 2: Business Rules, Security ACLs, and more
-   Priority 3: Reports and more
-   Priority 4: Form Sections, Choice Sets, and more
-   Priority 5 \(lowest priority\): other

</td></tr><tr><td>

Claim Status

</td><td>

Outcomes:-   N/A: There are no claims on the record \(no need to review\)
-   Won conflict: The loading application loaded the file but is in conflict with the previously loaded file. Recommendation: Review the two versions of the file to confirm your intended outcome.
-   No conflict: There may be one or more applications loading but there is no conflict. However, it is still good to review the outcome to see if it's what you intended.
-   Lost conflict: The file was not loaded because another application has a better claim on the file. Recommendation: Review the two versions of the file to see which should be loaded \(or if they should be merged\).
