# Upgrade Preview module

The Upgrade Preview module enables you to have an unprecedented insight to an instance prior to an actual upgrade. You can explore and preview upgrades to different ServiceNow release versions and see how your instance might be impacted with your current configurations. The Upgrade Preview utility helps you to plan, schedule, and prepare for an upgrade.

The preview status info and link in the message displayed on top of the Upgrade Preview page states the current status of the ongoing preview process. Because you can get an accurate prediction on the new and existing applications and their skipped records, the preview execution time has increased considerably. Select the link in the message to see the status of the preview process.

The Execution Tracker record displays when you select the progress link in the message. Select Show status related list to show the current status of the executed preview process.

**Note:** Depending on the eligibility of your instance, the list of available target versions for preview varies. Only versions that are allowed for a particular instance to be upgraded to, show up on the list. If your instance is not eligible to be upgraded to any version, the drop-down menu is empty.

The following cards display with more information.
