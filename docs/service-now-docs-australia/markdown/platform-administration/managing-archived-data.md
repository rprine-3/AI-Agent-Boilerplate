**Parent Topic:**[Archiving records in Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/archiving-older-records.md)

## Change an archive schedule in Core UI

Modify the system-scheduled job if you need to change the archive interval.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

All active archive rules are executed by a system-scheduled job set to run every 60 minutes.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Scheduler** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Open the **Archive** record.

3.  Modify the **repeat** value.


## Stop an active archive rule in Core UI

Stop archiving by deactivating, deleting, or canceling an archive rule.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Access the archive rule that you want to stop in one of the following ways.

<table id="choicetable_cxh_nkk_1bc"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d224915e191">

Option

</th><th align="left" id="d224915e194">

Steps

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d224915e200">

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Archiving** &gt; **Archive Rules**.
2.  Select the archive rule that you want to stop.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>2.  Stop the archive rule from running.

    -   Deactivate the archive rule by clearing the **Active** check box. The **Archive - Handle archive chunks** business rule updates the state of the corresponding record in the Archive Job Execution Chunks \[sys\_archive\_run\_chunk\] table from **waiting** to **not-needed**.
    -   Contact Customer Service and Support to delete the archive rule.
    -   Cancel the archive rule by calling GlideArchiver\(\).cancel\(\) from **System Maintenance** &gt; **Scripts - Background**. This automatically changes the chunks in the Archive Job Execution Chunks \[sys\_archive\_run\_chunk\] table from **running** to **cancelled**.

### Result

No additional chunks are processed.
