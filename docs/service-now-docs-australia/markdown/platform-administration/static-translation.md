# Static translation

Using static translation, you can customize email notifications for recipients across multiple regions based on their preferred language.

## About static translation for email notifications

Author localized content for the various content fields on notifications, email templates, and email layout forms using static translation after activating the [translation plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/activate-translation-plugin.md).

For static translation, the translation request goes to a translator. The translator provides translations for notification content in different languages.

Not all of the fields on the notification forms are translatable.

|Table name|Translatable fields|
|----------|-------------------|
|Email Notification|Subject, message, message\_html, and message\_text|
|Email Template|Subject, message, message\_html, and message\_text|
|Email Layout|Layout|

**Note:**

-   The static content that needs to be translated in mail scripts must be present inside **gs.getMessage\(\)** and translations for the strings must be available in the Message \[sys\_ui\_message\] table​.

-   You can stop the translation of tokens by creating the **glide.email.outbound.static\_translation.session.language.change.enabled** system property and setting it to false.
