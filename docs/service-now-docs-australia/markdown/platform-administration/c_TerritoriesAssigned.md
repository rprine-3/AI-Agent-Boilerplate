# Territories assigned

Territories are assigned to locations, and are not assigned directly to users.

A user's territory, and so the user's E.164-compliant phone functionality, is based on the user's location. For example, if a user has a location of **SHS quadra 5, Bloco E., Brasilia** defined in the User \[sys\_user\] table, the parent record for Brazil in the location table defines the phone territory. The phone territory may be assigned at any level of the [Map pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_MapPages.md) hierarchy, which is searched going up to the next parent until the territory is found or no parents remain.
