# Install an update to a ServiceNow Store application

Install an update to an application that you purchased from the ServiceNow Store.

## Before you begin

**Note:**

Legacy Application Manager is being deprecated. Starting with Australia patch 1, Legacy Application Manager is no longer available and bookmarks will redirect to the new Application Manager experience.

A known issue affects the use of bookmarks to access the Legacy Application Manager before Australia patch 1. For details about possible issues with accessing the Legacy Application Manager, see the [Deprecated Classic App Manager URL usage causes issues on instances running ZP5 / YP10 and above \[KB2804238\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2804238) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

A new Application Manager experience is available. The new experience simplifies the process of managing your licensed applications by consolidating them in one convenient location, displaying all applications, plugins, installed applications, and available updates. For more information, see [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/application-manager.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the application with the filter criteria and search bar.

    If they are available, you can select customized versions to be installed.

3.  Next to the application listing, select the version to install.

4.  Click **Update**.

    **Note:** When customers upgrade to this new version of your application, the Deletes in your author\_elective\_update folder will be written as Skips in the Upgrade History entry for this application upgrade. Your users can browse the Skip list, and apply the changes on a case-by-case basis. Your customers have the option of setting com.glide.apps.include\_my\_deletes to false, which will skip writing Skip records as well.
