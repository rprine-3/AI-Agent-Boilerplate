# Add choices to a dynamic choice set

Build out a dynamic choice set by defining the choices that belong to it.

## Before you begin

Role required: dynamic\_schema\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Dynamic Schema** &gt; **Dynamic Choice Sets**.

2.  Select the dynamic choice set that you want to update.

3.  In the Dynamic Choices related list, select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Choice Set|The dynamic choice set that contains this choice.|
    |Label|Label used for displaying the dynamic choice.|
    |Value|Internal name for the dynamic choice.|
    |Order|Value that determines the choice's order in a list.|
    |Active|Option to activate the choice in the dynamic choice set.|

5.  Limit the availability of the choice that you want to add.

    -   Restrict the choice to a specific namespace by selecting that namespace in **Within Namespace**.
    -   Restrict the choice to attributes in a specific category by selecting a namespace in **Within Namespace** and the category in **Within Category**.
    -   Restrict the choice to one attribute in a namespace by selecting the namespace in **Within Namespace** and selecting the attribute in **For attribute**.
    The choice is only available in the dynamic attribute store field that belongs to the namespace you selected in **Within Namespace**. Further restrictions might apply if you selected a category or a specific attribute.

6.  Select **Submit**.
