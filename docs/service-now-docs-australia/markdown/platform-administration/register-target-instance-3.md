# IP authentication error

Troubleshoot a IP authentication error that occurs while registering a target instance

## Condition

A failure to authenticate an IP address prevents the target instance from being registered.

## Cause

The IP address for the target instance is outside of the IP range.

## Remedy

If the target instance uses IP range based authentication, it must enable the IP range `10.0.0.0/10.255.255.255` to communicate on a local network. See [IP range based authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_IPRangeBasedAuthentication.md).
