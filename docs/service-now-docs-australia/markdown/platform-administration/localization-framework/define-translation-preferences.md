In Localization Workspace you don't need to add items to the project manually.

For Localization Framework: If this option is enabled, the localization requested items \(LRITMs\) are created upon request for translation of the artifact. You can then create a project and add the corresponding requested items to start the translation. You must have localization\_manager role to create a project. This option helps in the bulk translation of the artifacts to be done at the same time by adding them to a project. Then, the translation progress of the LRITMs is monitored at the project level.

 For Localization Framework: When this option is enabled, translation requests for artifact items are created as follows: -   A localization project is auto created. The corresponding localization requested items \(LRITMs\) are created, bundled, and added to the localization project.
