# Add localization requested items to a project

Add multiple localization requested items \(LRITMs\) to a localization project so fulfillers can translate the items in bulk.

## Before you begin

-   Confirm that your localization project \[sn\_lf\_project\] is in the Draft state.
-   Check the availability of your localization requested items by confirming that they are in the Open state. You can check by navigating to the table Localization Requested Items \[sn\_lf\_requested\_item\]. Also, any items currently attached to another project might not be available for this procedure.
-   Role required: localization\_manager.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Localization Framework** &gt; **My Projects** \[sn\_lf\_project\].

2.  Open the localization project to which you want to add requested items.

3.  On the Localization Project record, select the **Localization Requested Items** tab from the related list.

4.  Select **Edit**.

    **Note:** The Edit button is visible only when a project is in the **Draft** state.

5.  Adjust the filter conditions for retrieving localization requested items, then select **Run filter**.
