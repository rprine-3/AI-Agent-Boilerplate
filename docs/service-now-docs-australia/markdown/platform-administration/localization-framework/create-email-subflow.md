# Create a custom email subflow

Create an email subflow according to your requirements. You can then select this subflow to define translation preferences for a language.

## Before you begin

Roles required: localization\_admin and flow\_designer

## About this task

The Localization Framework provides a default email subflow that you can customize.

Copy the existing email subflow configured for the Localization Framework and then customize it. Publish the customized subflow so that it is available for selection when setting up the translation preference for a language. For more information, see [Create a subflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/create-subflow.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Designer**.

2.  In the Workflow Studio window, click **Subflows**.

3.  Click **Send LF Email for Translation** subflow.

    The Send LF Email for Translation subflow opens in the Workflow Studio in read-only format. The inputs in this subflow are described in the following table:

    |Name|Description|Type|
    |----|-----------|----|
    |lftask\_record|Associated Localization Framework task record.|Reference.Localization Task \[sn\_lf\_insight\]|
    |attachment\_record|Contains a file related to the LFTASK that can be sent via Email for translation.|Reference.Attachment|
    |send\_to|Contains email addresses of the recipients to send the LF task file.|String|
    |source\_language|Language from which the localization task was created.|String|
    |target\_language|Language into which the content of the localization task gets translated into.|String|

4.  In the subflow header, click the more actions icon \[Omitted image "more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions and select **Copy subflow.**

5.  In the **New subflow name** field, enter the name of the new subflow.

6.  To limit the application scope of the subflow, in the **Application** field, select the required application, otherwise select **Global**.

7.  Click **Copy**.

    The new subflow is created and opens in the subflow designer editor. The inputs from the copied subflow appear.

    **Note:** Inputs are fixed and cannot be edited.
