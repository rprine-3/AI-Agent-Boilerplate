# Create and configure a custom artifact

Create and configure custom artifacts of your choice to use the Localization Framework functionality.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you are in the application scope that you want for your custom artifact.

Role required: localization\_admin and script\_include\_admin.

## About this task

From the Zurich release, your custom artifacts can be made available in [Localization Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-workspace/localization-workspace.md). For information about making custom artifacts selectable in Localization Workspace translation requests, see [Dynamic artifact detection in Localization Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-workspace/lw-dynamic-artifact-detection.md).

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that you are in the application scope that you want for your custom artifact, and navigate to **All** &gt; **Localization Framework** &gt; **Artifact Configurations** \[sn\_lf\_config\].

2.  Select **New**.

3.  In the Artifact Configuration form, fill in the fields.
