# Request translations from Insights Dashboard

Request translations for Service Catalog items or Virtual Agent topics from the insights dashboard to localize them into the selected language based on their translation status.

## Before you begin

Role required: localization\_admin or localization\_requestor

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Localization Framework** &gt; **Insights Dashboard**.

    The dashboard provides **Catalog Items Translations** report and **Virtual Agent Topic Translations** report by default using which you can request translations.

    If you have created a report for your custom artifact to display in the dashboard, you can also request translations for the custom artifacts. For more information, see [Create a report for custom artifact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/t_CreateYourOwnReport.md).

2.  In the **Catalog Items Translations** report or **Virtual Agent Topic Translations** report, click the vertical bar of the language into which you want to request translations.

    For example:

    -   Select a language from the **Catalog Items Translations** report to request translations for the Service Catalog items in that language.
    -   Select a language from the **Virtual Agent Topic Translations** report to request translations for the Virtual Agent topics in that language.
    -   If you have a custom report created for an artifact, select a language from that report to request translations into the selected language.
3.  Select one or more documents from the localization insights list.

    -   You can click the **Select All** check box to request translations for all the items in the list.
4.  From the **Actions on selected rows** list, select **Request Translations**.

5.  Click **OK** in the Confirmation dialog box to submit the request.
