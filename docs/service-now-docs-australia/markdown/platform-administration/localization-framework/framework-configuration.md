# Artifact configurations

You can configure the required artifacts and use the Localization Framework to fulfill the translation requests.

Any artifact configured in the Localization Framework application has its own record in the artifact configurations \[sn\_lf\_config\] table.

With the activation of the Localization Framework Installer plugin \(com.glide.localization\_framework.installer\), a record for Service Catalog item and Natural Language Understanding Model are automatically created and configured in Localization Framework.

A record for the Virtual Agent topic is also created and configured in the framework, since Virtual Agent is automatically enabled with the base system. For more information, see [Virtual Agent Lite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/va-lite.md).

Records for Document Template Block Content and HTML Document Template are created in the artifact configurations \[sn\_lf\_config\] table when you activate the Human Resources Scoped App: Lifecycle Events for Enterprise plugin \[com.sn\_hr\_lifecycle\_ent\]. For more information about activating this plugin, see [Activate Lifecycle Events for Enterprise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/activate-hr-lifecycle-events-for-enterprise.md).

You can also create and configure an artifact of your choice and a record for the same is created in the artifact configurations \[sn\_lf\_config\] table. For more information, see [Create and configure a custom artifact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-framework/create-configure-custom-artifact.md).
