# Workflows in the Localization Framework

Workflows in the Settings table define the process for a localization task, including steps for approval and methods for translating and publishing.

## Overview of workflows in the Settings table of Localization Framework

You can configure the path you want your localization task to follow, with available steps for approval, translation, and publishing. You can define these workflows for each language and artifact configured on your instance.

For more information about navigating to the configuration web form for these workflows, see [Configure the Localization Framework preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-framework/define-translation-preferences.md).
