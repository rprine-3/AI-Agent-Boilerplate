# Enable using your own SMTP server

Enable using your own SMTP server so that you can use the existing filtering, retention, or compliance aspects of your own SMTP server while also using the ServiceNow POP3 server.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin
-   Email server required: SMTP
-   [Basic email properties:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ConfiguringStandardEmail.md) enabled

## About this task

You can combine your own internal email architecture with the ServiceNow email architecture to handle email. The following diagram demonstrates how you would use your own SMTP server alongside the ServiceNow POP3 server.

**Note:** Supports only one active SMTP account at a time \(for outbound emails\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mailboxes** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Email Accounts**.

    The system displays the list of available email accounts.

2.  Locate the record for **ServiceNow SMTP** and change **Active** to **false**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  Create an email account record for your SMTP server where the **Type** is **SMTP**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Upgrades an insecure connection to a secure connection using the SSL/TLS encryption protocol, if your email server supports TLS.

-   **__SSL/TLS__**

Connect to an SSL/TLS encrypted port to secure the connection. Email is encrypted between the ServiceNow instance and your mail server.

 **Warning:** Selecting a less secure protocol like **STARTTLS** or **None** may expose your data. To better ensure the security of data in your email server, select **SSL/TLS**.

## What to do next

Configure the SMTP server in your internal email architecture to forward email from the custom email address to the instance email address. Implement a spam filter on the custom email address.
