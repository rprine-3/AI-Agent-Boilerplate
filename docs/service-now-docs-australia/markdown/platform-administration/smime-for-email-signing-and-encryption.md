# Setting up S/MIME for email

S/MIME is a protocol for sending digitally signed and encrypted emails to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity.

## Set up S/MIME for outbound mails \(signing and encryption\)

You can use S/MIME for outbound mails for the following purposes:

-   Digital signature
-   Encryption
-   Digital signature and encryption

To set up S/MIME, the admin must have the following:

-   email\_account\_admin and sn\_kmf.cryptographic\_manager roles
-   Key pair \(private key and public key\)
-   CA certificate
-   Email certificate

Upload the instance email account key pair and email certificates, and enable outbound S/MIME properties. For more information, see [Enable S/MIME](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/enable-smime-for-outbound-and-inbound.md).

If there are multiple recipients and some of the recipients do not have valid certificates, the email will be sent only to recipients with a valid certificate.

## Set up S/MIME for inbound mails \(sign verification and decryption\)

S/MIME for inbound mails can be used for the following:

-   Signature verification
-   Decryption
-   Signature verification and decryption

For information about enabling inbound S/MIME properties, see [Enable S/MIME](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/enable-smime-for-outbound-and-inbound.md).

If the system fails to decrypt a message, no inbound actions will run on the email and it is moved to the received-ignored status.

To set up the system to ignore inbound signed emails if the signature cannot be verified or is invalid, admins can create the **email.inbound.smime.ignore\_unverified\_emails** and set it to true.

For more information about key management and cryprographic module, see [Key Management Framework Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/understanding-kmf.md).
