# Address \(Simple\) field type

The Address \(Simple\) field type provides real-time address suggestions as you enter text to reduce manual entry errors.

You can add the Address \(Simple\) field type to any form in both Core UI and Workspace experiences. When a user enters text in the Address field, closely matched addresses appear for selection. It helps you add accurate addresses without manual entry errors.

The Address \(Simple\) field type uses an external address suggestions API to retrieve matching addresses for suggestion. The following system properties control the API connection:

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|**glide.ui.address.suggestions.api.host.url**|Specifies the host URL of the third-party address validation API. For example, Google Places API.|
|**glide.ui.address.suggestions.api.host.apikey.encrypted**|Stores the encrypted API key for the third-party address validation API specified in host URL. For example, Google Places API key.|

**Note:** You must configure both system properties so that the Address field can return address suggestions.

## Configuring Address field type

To configure the Address field to a form, complete the following setup:

1.  Add the Address \(Simple\) field to a table to store and display data.

2.  Configure the address suggestions API in system properties.
