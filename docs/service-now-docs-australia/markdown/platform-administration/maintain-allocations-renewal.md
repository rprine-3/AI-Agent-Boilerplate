# Maintain per-user subscription allocations in Subscription Management at renewal

Ensure subscription allocations remain consistent throughout the renewal process.

## Before you begin

Role required: usage\_admin, sn\_sub\_man.admin, oradmin

## About this task

When a per-user subscription renews, a new product SKU might be added to your account. This SKU is treated as a new product subscription in Subscription Management.If you've manually allocated user-based subscriptions in the past, you must re-allocate renewed subscriptions by adding groups with measured roles to the subscription.

If you haven't manually allocated user-based subscriptions before, allocations are made automatically based on user and group roles. No action is necessary to maintain allocations after renewal.

## Procedure

1.  Before the renewal date, monitor the subscription end dates on the details page and document the current group allocations.

    See [Viewing product subscription details in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/subscription-details-v2.md).

2.  After the renewal date, add the documented groups to the renewed subscription in Subscription Management.

    See [Allocate subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/allocate-subscriptions-v2.md).


## What to do next

Continue to monitor subscription renewal dates to ensure that your allocations are accurate throughout each renewal.
