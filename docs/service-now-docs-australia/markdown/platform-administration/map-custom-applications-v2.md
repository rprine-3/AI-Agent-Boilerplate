# Map a custom application to a product subscription in Subscription Management

Maintain accurate entitlement for custom tables in a scoped application by mapping the application to a product subscription in Subscription Management. To stay in compliance, you must map custom tables to a product subscription.

## Before you begin

Role required: usage\_admin, sn\_sub\_man.admin, or admin

## About this task

As your developers create and deploy new custom applications and tables on your instances, use Subscription Management to map them to subscriptions. After you map a custom application to a product subscription, additional tables that developers add to the application are automatically mapped to the subscription.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Issues** tab in Subscription Management in one of the following ways.

    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Subscription Management** &gt; **Issues**.
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Subscription Management** &gt; **Issues**.
2.  In the **Unmapped custom applications** tab, look for custom applications that aren't mapped to a subscription.

3.  Update your entitlements by mapping one or more custom applications to a recommended product or a product of your choice.

    When possible, Subscription Management displays recommendations for product subscriptions with available custom table entitlements in the **Recommended Product** column. Subscription Management can't display product subscription recommendations for some unmapped custom applications, which therefore aren't shown in the **Unmapped custom applications** tab. For more information about mapping missing custom applications to product subscriptions, see [Map a missing custom application to a product subscription in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/map-missing-custom-app-sub-mgt.md).

1.  Select the check box for one or more unmapped custom applications.
2.  Select **Map to product**.
3.  Select **Confirm**.

**Map to a product of your choice**

</td><td>

1.  Select an unmapped custom application.
2.  In the **Subscription** lookup list on the Custom Application form, select a subscription.

**Note:** The lookup list doesn't include expired, grandfathered, or Store application subscriptions. If you have a Store application with custom tables that must be mapped to a subscription, select a subscription with a custom table entitlement.

3.  Select **Update**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>
## Result

One or more custom applications are mapped to a product subscription and your custom table entitlement count is updated. If you mapped a custom application to a subscription through the Custom Application form, Subscription Management is updated the next day.
