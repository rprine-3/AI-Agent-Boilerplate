Role required: admin

## About this task

If you want to revert the updates to records made through an update job, execute a rollback operation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Data Management** &gt; **Update jobs**.

2.  Select an update job that has been executed.

3.  Select the **Rollback** related link to revert the updated records.

4.  When prompted, confirm that you want to rollback the delete job.
