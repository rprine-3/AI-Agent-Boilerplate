# Modify string field length

You can modify the maximum character limit for a string field.

## Before you begin

Role required: personalize\_dictionary

## About this task

The URL type field hides the Max Length field on the Dictionary form by default. Browsers support URL length up to 2,083 characters. The URL field is a String field.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to a form that contains the field that you want to modify.

2.  Right-click the field label in the form and select **Configure Dictionary**.

3.  Change the **Max length** field to the desired length.

    **Note:** You can change between string-based data types as long as length changes do not cause any data loss from truncation. For example, you can change from a MEDIUM database type to a VARCHAR\(100\) database type if none of the existing data is greater than 100.

4.  Click **Update**.

    The system cancels any length change that results in data loss due to truncation.
