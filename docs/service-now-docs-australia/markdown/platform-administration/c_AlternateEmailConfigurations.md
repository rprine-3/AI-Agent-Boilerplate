# Advanced email setup

With an advanced email setup, you can use your own SMTP server, POP3 server, or both.

Setting up your own email environment can be useful if you want to use existing filtering, retention, or compliance aspects of your internal email architecture. You can set up email in several ways:

-   Use your own SMTP server to send email.
-   Use your own POP3 server to receive email.
-   Use your own SMTP and POP3 servers to send and receive email.
-   Use an OAuth 2.0-enabled SMTP server to send email from a third-party service.
-   Use an OAuth 2.0-enabled IMAP server to receive email from a third-party service.
