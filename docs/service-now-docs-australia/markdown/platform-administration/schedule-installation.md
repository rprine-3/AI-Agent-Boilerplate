# Schedule installation

Schedule the installation of a plugin, application, or product at the required time from your ServiceNow instance. You can simultaneously schedule multiple installations.

## Before you begin

**Note:**

Legacy Application Manager is being deprecated. Starting with Australia patch 1, Legacy Application Manager is no longer available and bookmarks will redirect to the new Application Manager experience.

A known issue affects the use of bookmarks to access the Legacy Application Manager before Australia patch 1. For details about possible issues with accessing the Legacy Application Manager, see the [Deprecated Classic App Manager URL usage causes issues on instances running ZP5 / YP10 and above \[KB2804238\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2804238) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

A new Application Manager experience is available. The new experience simplifies the process of managing your licensed applications by consolidating them in one convenient location, displaying all applications, plugins, installed applications, and available updates. For more information, see [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager/application-manager.md).

5.  Click **Next**.

    **Note:** If another installation is scheduled at the same time, a message is displayed that the installation can't be scheduled at the mentioned time and auto-populates the next available slot.

    The installation is scheduled and a confirmation message is displayed.


## What to do next

Click the schedule summary icon \(\[Omitted image "schedule-summ-icon.png"\] Alt text: Schedule summary icon. \) to view the installation status and schedule calendar.

\[Omitted image "schedule-summary.png"\] Alt text: Schedule summary.

-   To view the status of the installation, click **View Status**.
    -   If the installation is successful, the details of the plugin, application, or product are displayed.
