Access recent activity for a specific rule in the Data Management Console by navigating to **All** &gt; **System Data Management** &gt; **Data Management Console** &gt; **Tables**. Select a table, select the **Rule details** sub-tab, and then select a specific rule.

    The data policy to which the data management rule belongs.

    The type of data management rule, such as archive, cleanup, or one-time delete.

-   **Status**

    The current status of the data management rule.


## Records in backlog

View the total number of records that meet the conditions for the rule but haven't been processed yet. The count is updated once a day.

## Trend of backlog records

Track the backlog of records that meet the conditions for the rule but haven't been processed yet.

-   Track the progress of the rule over time.
-   Monitor data management rule efficiency and consider adjusting the conditions based on the trend in the backlog record count.
-   Check for bottlenecks that indicate a large number of records in the backlog waiting to be processed.

## Execution history

-   View the date and time a rule was executed by checking the **Execution time** column.
-   Determine how many records were archived or deleted by checking the **Records impacted** column. Consider adjusting the rule's conditions if the number of records isn't sufficient.
