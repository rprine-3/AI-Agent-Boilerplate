# Schedule or execute a job to update records

Schedule a date and time to execute an update job or execute the job immediately.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Consider scheduling the update job to run during non-business hours to minimize the potential performance impact on your users. Updating a large number of records can degrade performance depending on the size of the table. On instances running MariaDB, UPDATE operations affecting a majority of rows may trigger gap locks, escalating to a full table lock until the update completes. INSERT operations are not affected by this locking behavior.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Data Management** &gt; **Update jobs**.

2.  Select an update job record.

3.  Determine whether to schedule the update job for a later time or run it right away.

</td><td>

1.  Select **Execute Now** to run the update job immediately.
2.  When prompted, select **Proceed** to update the records now.
3.  On the Progress page, select **Cancel** to stop the job from continuing to run.
4.  Select **Check execution results** to return to the update job form.
