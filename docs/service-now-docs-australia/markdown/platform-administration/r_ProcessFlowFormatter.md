# Process flow formatter

The process flow formatter provides a graphical summary of the stages in a process. The formatter is typically shown at the top of forms that are part of a process.

Each record on the Flow Formatter \[sys\_process\_flow\] table represents a process stage and can have a different condition applied to it. When specified conditions are fulfilled, the formatter highlights the current stage and places a check mark next to all previous stages.

These examples show a workflow in Core UI interface.

When any formatter stages are defined for a table, they appear on the form associated with that table in the order specified, assuming the formatter has been added to the form.

## Activate the process flow formatter

You can activate the Process Flow Formatter plugin.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
