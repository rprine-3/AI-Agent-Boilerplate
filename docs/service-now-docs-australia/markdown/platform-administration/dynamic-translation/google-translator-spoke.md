## Spoke flows

This spoke has no sample flows.

## Spoke subflows

The Google Cloud Translator Service spoke provides subflows in the Published state to integrate with the Google translation service. These subflows can be used as part of other subflows and flows.

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Detect Language|Contains a set of inputs, actions, and outputs to detect the language of the input text.|
|Translate Text To Multiple Languages|Contains a set of inputs, actions, and outputs to translate the input text to multiple languages.|

## Spoke actions

The Google Cloud Translator Service spoke provides actions to integrate with the Google translation service. Available actions include:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Detect Language|Detects the language of the input text.|
|Translate Text To Single Language|Translates the input text to a single language.|
|Translate Text To Multiple Languages|Translates the input text to multiple languages.|

## Google account requirements

The Google Cloud Translator Service spoke requires configuring your Google Cloud account to generate an OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Grant token.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the GoogleTranslation alias record \(sn\_google\_trans.GoogleTranslation\) to authorize actions. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Google Cloud Translator Service spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/setup-google-translator.md).
