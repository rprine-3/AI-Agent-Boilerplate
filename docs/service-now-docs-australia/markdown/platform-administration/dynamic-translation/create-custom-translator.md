# Create a custom translator configuration

Configure Dynamic Translation for a third-party machine translation provider of your choice.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the Dynamic Translation plugin \(com.glide.dynamic\_translation\) is activated.

Create subflows for your custom translation provider. See [Integrate with a translation service provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/integrate-translation-service-provider.md).

Create language code mappings as needed. For more information see [Language Code Mapping in Dynamic Translation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/language-mapper-dt.md).

Role required: admin

## What to do next

If you are on Xanadu Patch 3 or above, and want to use Exclusion Framework in Dynamic Translation, add your translation provider's exclusion tags. For more information, see [Add an Exclusion Provider Pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/dyn-translation-exclusion-provider.md).
