# Language Detection spoke

The ServiceNow Language Detection Service spoke is an in-house language detection service offered by the ServiceNow platform. It provides a single subflow and action to identify the language of a given text.

The ServiceNow Language Detection Service spoke plugin \(com.glide.language\_detection\_spoke\) is available with the activation of Dynamic Translation plugin \(com.glide.dynamic\_translation\).

This spoke creates an entry named ServiceNow in Dynamic Translation's Translator Configurations \(sn\_dt\_translator\_configuration\) table. By default, this entry is active and marked as default for detection. To configure your own language detection service, see [Integration with other translation services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/integration-with-other-translation-services.md).
