# Translate a knowledge article from a translation task

Start translating articles once they are published and assigned to you for translation.

## Before you begin

-   Activate the Dynamic Translation plugin \(com.glide.dynamic\_translation\).
-   Enable the **glide.knowman.translation.enable\_translation\_task** property. For more information, see [Translation management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/translation-management.md).

Role required: admin, knowledge\_admin, or knowledge

## About this task

**Note:** This procedure has been superseded by the Localization Framework. For more information see [Localization Framework support for Knowledge Base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-framework/lf-support-for-kb-articles.md). This information is provided for legacy context.

For information about how administrators configure the translation API, see [DynamicTranslation API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/dyn-translation-apis.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Translation Management** &gt; **My Assigned Tasks**.

2.  In the Knowledge Translation Tasks page, select one of the listed translation tasks assigned to you.

3.  Select **Translate**.

    The **Translate from** and **Translate to** panes are side-by-side for easy comparison.

4.  Select **Machine translate** to automatically translate to the targeted languages.

5.  Select **Create draft article** to create a draft version of the translated article.

    If a translated article is already present for that language, a new draft version overwrites the existing translated content.

6.  Select **Publish**.

    **Note:** By default, the translated version is always created as v1.0 so that the parent version remain same for all the translated versions. For more information, see [Translated KB articles always show Parent version 1.0 regardless of version used for translation](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1116153).


## Result

The newly created draft is listed in the **Translated Versions** tab.
