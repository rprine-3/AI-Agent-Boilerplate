# Add an Exclusion Provider Pattern

As part of the configuration of Exclusion Framework in Dynamic Translation, enter the tags used by your translation provider to mark text that should not be machine translated.

## Before you begin

Consult your machine translator provider's documentation or account portal to obtain the tags it uses to mark text strings for exclusion from translation.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Exclusion Provider Pattern \[sn\_dt\_provider\_exclusion\_pattern\] table stores the exclusion tags used by machine translation providers. From this table's list view, select the value in the Active column to view a record. \(Selecting the value in the Translator Configuration column opens the corresponding Translator Configuration table entry in Dynamic Translation\).
