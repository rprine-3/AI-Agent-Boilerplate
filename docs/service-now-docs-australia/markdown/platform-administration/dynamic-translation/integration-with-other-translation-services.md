# Integration with other translation services

Enable machine translation on your instance by integrating third-party translator services with Dynamic Translation. You can configure one or more translation service providers of your choice.

Translator services are listed in the Translator Configurations \[sn\_dt\_translator\_configuration\] table. By default several third-party translators are partially preconfigured in this table. You can complete the configuration of a default translator by providing your account credentials and connections.

Alternatively, you can also create a custom spoke. In addition to your account credentials and connections, you must configure flows and any needed language code mappings for your custom translator. See [Integrate with a translation service provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation/integrate-translation-service-provider.md).

Also listed in the Translator Configurations table is a default record for the **ServiceNow** translator. This translator can be used for language detection only, not for translation, so its **Mark as default for translation** check box is not selectable. This optional language detection service is included in your Dynamic Translation subscription.

**Note:** If you activate dynamic translation in the Generative AI Controller, a fully preconfigured spoke to [Microsoft Azure OEM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/dynamic-translation-na-ms-azure-oem.md) Translator Service is added as a row in Translator Configurations.

Consult your service provider's portal for details regarding data privacy policies, cost and usage structure, and other information related to your account with that provider. Test your integration in a non-production instance, including examining logs, before deploying to production.
