# Edit a glossary in Language Asset Management

Edit the contents of your glossary in Language Asset Management. Modify existing terms and translations or add more terms.

## Before you begin

-   First, create a glossary using the provided spreadsheet template and upload it to Language Asset Management. For information see [Upload glossaries to Language Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-workspace/lw-lam-upload-glossaries.md).
-   Role required: sn\_lw.user. From version 3.1.0, both the sn\_lw.user and the sn\_lw.terminology\_manager roles are required.

## About this task

Initially you create a glossary in Language Asset Management by uploading a spreadsheet template. If you want to modify any source terms or their translations, or you want to add more items, use the following procedure to make your updates directly in the UI.

**Note:** The same source term may be repeated in a glossary if assigned to different Part of Speech or Product/Service categories. A source term repeated in two different categories is considered to be two different records. Any changes you make to a source term in one category aren't propagated to the same source term in other categories.

The following video demonstrates how to add a translation to a source term.\[Omitted video\] Description: Adding a translation to a source term in Language Asset Management
