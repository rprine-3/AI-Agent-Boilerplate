# Request translations in Localization Workspace: Languages

Add target languages to a translation request in Localization Workspace.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the languages you intend to add to your translation request have been installed on your instance.
-   Ensure that the language providers that you intend to use have been configured. See [Configure a language provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-workspace/lw-configure-translation-provider.md).
-   Role required: sn\_lw.user

## About this task

Your translation request can bundle multiple target languages and multiple content types. Each language in the request can include different target documents.

**Note:** In the Australia release, only requests from English into non-English target languages are supported. Requests from non-English source languages are not supported.

The following procedure covers step one of four steps in the Translation Request wizard.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Localization Workspace** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select **Request Translation** to open the wizard.\[Omitted image "lw-request-translations-langs1.png"\] Alt text: The Translation request wizard window, open to step one for language selection. In this example, selecting a language group has auto-populated three language rows.

    The **Translation request** wizard opens at the first step, **Languages**.

3.  In the **Short Description** field, enter a name for the translation request.

    The Short Description is displayed in the **My Requests** list on the Home screen, so you can find and monitor your request later. For information see [Localization Workspace Home and translation job status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-workspace/lw-status-synchronization.md).

4.  Select target languages or language groups according to the following guidance.

**Language**

</td><td>

To select an individual language:1.  In the **Target language** field, select an available language from the drop-down list.
2.  In the **Translation provider** field, select a name from the list of providers available for the language you chose.
 You can add more than one language to a request.

**Groups**

</td><td>

When you select a check box for a language group, the Target language and Translation provider fields auto-populate.-   You can add more than one language group to a translation request.
-   After you add a language group to request, you can manually delete individual languages from it. Deletion in the wizard applies only to this request; the definition of the language group doesn't change.
-   You can include a mix of language groups and individual languages in one request.
-   If a language is included multiple times in one request, Localization Workspace clears the value of the Translation provider field. You must then manually select the desired Translation provider for that language.

7.  Select the **Next** button to proceed to the Types step of translation request creation.


## What to do next

Advance to the next step in the wizard, **Types**, to select content for translation.
