# Configuration Hub in Localization Workspace

Configuration Hub provides centralized access to the tables and properties often used by admins. You can update the tables and properties of dependent applications such as Localization Framework without leaving the Localization Workspace interface.

## Overview of Configuration Hub

Localization Workspace extends other ServiceNow AI Platform applications related to localization. Configuring these dependent applications is a prerequisite to working with Localization Workspace. From version 2.0.2, Configuration Hub gives admins access to tables and properties in these applications from the Localization Workspace interface.

**Note:** Any updates you make in Configuration Hub are saved to tables in the target application.

To open Configuration Hub:

With the localization\_admin or the admin role, navigate to **All** &gt; **Localization Workspace** &gt; **Configuration Hub**. Alternatively, you can select the hub's icon while in the workspace. The navigation pane within Configuration Hub lists applications and their components. Select the name of a component to open its table in a workspace pane.

**Note:** In Configuration Hub, Dynamic Translation is displayed to the admin role only. The localization\_admin role can't view Dynamic Translation.
