# Create email notifications for completed translation jobs

Configure email notifications so you can be informed when Localization Workspace translation jobs are completed.

For instructions see [Create notification categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-notification-categories.md).

Role required: admin.

## About this task

For detailed information about configuring email notifications, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).
