# Request translations in Localization Workspace: Scope

Select specific documents to add to a translation request in Localization Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_lw.user

## About this task

In the Scope step of a translation request, you can drill down to select or deselect specific documents from the list of translatable items collected by the Types step.

-   When the Scope screen first opens, all of the retrieved items are selected by default.
-   Items that are currently in the translation process aren't retrieved.
-   If you don't want an item to be included in the translation request, deselect that item by clearing its check box.
-   It's possible to select a document for one target language, and deselect the same document for a different target language.
-   From version 2.0.2, you can use a text filter in the column filter row. Filter operators are the same as other tables in your instance \(such as **starts with**, **contains**, and so forth\).
-   If you search for a term in the filter under the Translation Item column, the system searches for that term only in the titles of documents, not in contents.
-   From version 2.0.2, a bulk select/deselect check box is available in the Filter row.

    **Note:** Bulk selection/deselection applies only to the set of items that you have selected in the Types pane. Review and confirm the items in a translation request before submitting.


The following procedure covers step three of four steps in the Translation Request wizard.

## Procedure

1.  Complete steps one and two in the Translation request wizard, then proceed to this one, **Scope**.

2.  Reveal the filter row by selecting the **Show column filter row** icon, if needed.

3.  Filter the list according to terms in the document titles \(Translation Item\), or by Translation State or Language.

    \[Omitted image "lw-request-translations-scope-filter-row.png"\] Alt text: The Show column filter displays under each column. Under Translation Item, the filter is Operator starts with "How", so only documents whose titles start with the word How are displayed.

4.  Reveal the Types pane by opening the **Resizable panes divider**, then expand Types by selecting the caret icon. \[Omitted image "lw-request-translations-scope-resizeable-panes.png"\] Alt text: In the Scope step, the Types pane is open with the Resizable panes divider highlighted.

5.  Deselect any retrieved documents that you don't want to include in your request by clearing the item's check box.

    You can use the bulk select/deselect check box in the Filter row to select \(or clear\) a set of items. If anything is highlighted in the Types pane, bulk selection/deselection applies only to the highlighted type or language.\[Omitted image "lw-request-translations-scope-types-selector.png"\] Alt text: Under the Types pane, one language \(Brazilian Portuguese\) is selected, and also the bulk select/deselect check box is cleared. This means that Brazilian Portuguese documents are excluded from the request.

6.  Select **Save**.

    A saved translation request has a status of `Draft` in the **My Requests** list on the Home screen.

7.  Confirm the items you have included or excluded, then select **Next** to proceed to the **Estimate** step of the Translation Request wizard.


## What to do next

Advance to the next step in the Translation Request wizard, **Estimate**, where you can review projected costs and set a due date for the translation request.
