# Create email notifications for translation request due dates

As an admin, you can create email notifications triggered by translation request due dates.

## Before you begin

Create your own notification category to identify and group your notifications related to Localization Workspace translation projects. For instructions see [Create notification categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-notification-categories.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

From version 2.0.2, your users may set a due date when requesting translations in Localization Workspace. You can reference these due dates to send email notifications.

For more information see [Request translations in Localization Workspace: Estimate and Due Date](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-workspace/lw-estimate.md). For background information about configuring email notifications, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

The following procedure is specific to notifications for Localization Workspace translation request due dates. In the example scenario, a notification is sent when a translation request is past due \(the request is still in progress after its due date\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Notifications**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields according to the following guidance.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Name**|Enter a unique, descriptive name for these notifications.|
    |**Table**|Select the Localization Project \[sn\_lf\_project\] table from the list of tables.|
    |**Category**|If you have already set up your own category for these notifications, you can select it from the drop-down list. For information see [Create notification categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-notification-categories.md).|
