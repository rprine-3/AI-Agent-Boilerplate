# General guidelines for optimizing your clone duration

A reference topic that includes general guidelines to optimize your clone duration when requesting a clone.

Configuring additional settings for your clone request can significantly increase your clone completion time.

When creating a clone request, consider the following guidelines.

-   Set the amount of data copied from the task table to `Full`. This option clones all data from the task table and its child tables to the target instance.

    **Note:** The `Last 90 days` option can increase duration, as it takes longer to remove records from the task table that are older than 90 days after restoration.

-   Selecting Exclude Attachment Data on the clone request form can add to your clone duration.
-   Don't preserve large amounts of data in your request. If you must preserve table data, such as users, groups, and roles, consider exporting the records to a file and importing them after cloning.
-   Add conditions to the preservers configured for the clone request to only preserve the data that you need.
-   Use clone chaining to split up your request, see [Clone terminology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/clone-terminology.md).
