# Enable using your own SMTP and POP3 servers

You can use your own SMTP and POP3 servers to send email from the instance and to store and receive email for the instance.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin
-   Email servers required:
    -   SMTP
    -   POP3
-   [Basic email properties:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ConfiguringStandardEmail.md) enabled

## Procedure

1.  On your POP3 server, create a mailbox for your instance.

    For example, create a mailbox for `service-desk@company.com`.

2.  Navigate to **System Mailboxes** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Email Accounts**.

    The system displays the list of available email accounts.

3.  Locate the record for **ServiceNow SMTP** and change **Active** to **false**.

4.  If you don't want to receive email sent to the instance@service-now.com mailbox, locate the record for **ServiceNow POP3** and change **Active** to **false**.

    An instance can receive email from multiple POP3 accounts at the same time. Leaving the**ServiceNow POP3** account active means that the instance receives email sent to its default email address.

5.  Select **New**.

    The system displays a empty Email Account form.

6.  Create an email account record for your SMTP server where the **Type** is **SMTP**.

7.  On the form, fill in the fields.
