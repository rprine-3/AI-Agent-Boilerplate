# Define a relationship type

Create type codes that define the relationship between parent and child tasks.

## Before you begin

Activate the Many to Many Task Relations plugin \(com.snc.task\_relations\) first. See [Request many to many task relations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/t_RequestManyToManyTaskRelations.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Task Relationships** &gt; **Relation Types** and select **New**.

2.  Populate the Parent Descriptor and Child Descriptor fields with a short description of the relationship between the two tasks, such as a parent descriptor of Caused By and a child descriptor of Causes.

3.  Select and hold \(or right-click\) the form header bar and select **Save**.

    The Name field automatically populates with the Parent and Child descriptors.
