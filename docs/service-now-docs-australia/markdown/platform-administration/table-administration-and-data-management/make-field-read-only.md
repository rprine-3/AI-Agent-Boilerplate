# Make a field read only

Control whether a field is read only and whether it can be changed by a client script and server-side APIs.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can customize the behavior of a read-only field, including whether a client script or server-side API can modify the read-only field value. You control the read-only behavior by updating the **Read only option** field in a dictionary record.

For details on read only options, see [Configuring read-only security options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/read-only-option.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the field's dictionary entry in one of the following ways.

    -   Navigate to a field on a form, right-click the field, and select **Configure Dictionary** or **Show &lt;field name&gt;**.
    -   Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Dictionary**, and click an entry for a field or table.
2.  Make the field read only by selecting an option in the **Read only option** field.

    The option that you select determines how strict the system treats the security of read-only values once they've been entered. Each option displays the field as read-only in the UI.
