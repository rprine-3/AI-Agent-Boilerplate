# Create a time card

You can create time cards to log time against the work you have done.

## Before you begin

Role required: timecard\_user

## About this task

Starting Australia release, users can select a resource assignment to associate it with time cards to calculate the actual efforts and tag them to the respective projects.

The **Allow time card reporting on** field on the [project form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/t_CreateAProject.md) determines the level at which the time cards for the project tasks can be created.

**Note:** Time Cards created from Project form do not populate Resource plans automatically to avoid random allocations. For more information, see [KB0814884](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0814884) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Time cards can be created automatically or manually.

-   Automatic: Use the following options to automatically generate the time cards:

    -   By updating task:
        -   **Auto create time card on task update**

            Configure time cards to be created when a user updates a task record. The **Auto create time card on task update** setting in the assigned [time sheet policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/create-time-sheet-policy.md) controls this behavior and is set to false by default.

        -   **Auto fill time card with time worked entries**

            Configure time cards to be created when a user records **Time worked**. A time card is created if a time card does not exist for the task. The time sheet policy **Auto fill time card with time worked entries** controls this behavior and is set to false by default.

            In **Project Task**, **Incident**, **Problem**, and **Change** records, the [**Time worked**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_RecordTimeWorked.md) field does not appear by default and must be configured on the form.

    -   By scheduled job: Configure time cards for the project tasks to be generated automatically for users through a [scheduled job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/auto-generate-time-cards.md). Only the admin can configure a scheduled job.
    **Note:** Time cards cannot be created automatically when you use the mobile interface. Use the desktop interface if you want to use the automatic time card feature.

-   Manual: Create a time card for each task and enter the time manually.

1.  Open the time sheet that you want to create the time card for.
2.  In the **Time Cards** related list, click **New**.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d191665e271">

**From a Time sheet related link**

</td><td>

1.  Open the time sheet for which you want to create the time card.
2.  Click any of the following related links:

    -   **Generate Time Cards**: This option generates the time cards for all project tasks assigned to the user for the time sheet week. With this option, time cards are generated only for the project tasks that are in progress or planned in that week.
    -   **Copy from previous time sheet**: This option [copies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/copy-time-sheet.md) all the time cards \(for project and non-project tasks\) from a selected time sheet.
**Note:**

When using the related links for creating time cards:

    -   If a time card exists for a project task for the time card week, a duplicate time card is not created.
    -   Time cards are generated only for those project tasks that are in progress or planned in that week.

</table>3.  Click **Submit**.


## Result

-   The time card is created for the selected time card period.
-   If the time sheet for the week does not exist, a time sheet is created for the time card week.

## What to do next

After the time card is created, the hours for that task can be incremented automatically from the **Time worked** field in the task record. The time sheet policy **Auto fill time card with time worked entries** controls the way the time is updated in time cards. The policy is set to false by default. If automatic updates for time worked are not configured, the user must manually update the time card.

-   **[Copy time cards from a previous time sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/copy-time-sheet.md)**  
Another option for creating time cards is to copy them from an existing timesheet, which copies all the time cards \(for project as well as non-project tasks\) from a selected time sheet.
-   **[Auto-generate time cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/auto-generate-time-cards.md)**  
As an admin, you can configure a scheduled job to generate time cards automatically for project tasks assigned to time card users.
