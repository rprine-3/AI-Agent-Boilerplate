# Configure ServiceNow connection and credential aliases for Google sheets

Configure connection and credential aliases to authenticate an integration between your ServiceNow instance and Google Drive.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The connection and credential aliases record is used to manage the secure connection of your ServiceNow instance with Google Sheets. A connection alias tells the system how to connect to Google Sheets. It defines the endpoint URL of the Google Drive API and tells the system who is connecting. For example, it stores the authentication details, such as the OAuth token and API keys.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

    1.  Select **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_xch_c2v_hfc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the alias. An alias can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. For example, Sheets\_Alias.During an upgrade, the tag in the credential record migrates to a Connection &amp; Credential alias. If the credential tag contains special characters other than alphanumeric characters and underscores, it preserves the tag name after the upgrade. You can still use this migrated alias, but you can't update the alias until you change the name to meet the naming restrictions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ID

</td><td>

Unique identifier for the Connections &amp; Credentials alias, based on the format `scope_name.alias_name`. -   If the scope is Global, the ID is the alias name. For example, if you create a Sheets alias in the global scope, it sets the ID to `sheets`.
-   If you create a workday alias in the HR app scope, it sets the ID to `x_hr_app.sheets`.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent Alias

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**.

    2.  Select **New**.

        |Applies to|Option to specify if the credential record is applicable for all MID Servers, or a specific MID Server. If specific, add the MID Servers as necessary.|
        |Order|Order \(sequence\) in which Discovery tries this credential as it attempts to log on to devices. The smaller the number means that the higher in the list this credential appears.|

    5.  Select **Submit**.

        The OAuth 2.0 credential record is created.

    6.  Open the OAuth 2.0 credential record from the Credentials list.

    7.  From the Integration Type list, select **Personal**.

3.  Create a connection record for your alias.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connections**.
