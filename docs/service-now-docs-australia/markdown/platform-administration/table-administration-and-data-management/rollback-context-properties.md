# Rollback context properties

Change the default expiration period for different types of rollback context records.

Because rollback contexts contain a significant amount of data, they're deleted after 10 days by default. The Clean Expired Rollback Contexts scheduled job runs daily to delete expired records in the Rollback Context \[sys\_rollback\_context\] table. If you need to retain a rollback context for more than 10 days, you can do so by adding a system property.

To add a system property, navigate to the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and add a property for the type of rollback context record that you want to preserve. You can determine which property to add for a given rollback context by matching the property name to the Type column on the Rollback Context \[sys\_rollback\_context\] table.
