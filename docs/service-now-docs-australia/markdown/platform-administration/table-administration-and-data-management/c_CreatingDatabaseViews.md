# Joining tables using database views

Join tables into a single view and then create a report based on that view.

Use the **Database Views** module to create a database view that joins tables to create a pseudo-table that combines data from each table in the view. You can create a report on this data by adding the database view as a table in a report. Accessing the database view does not require database access.

1.  [Create a database view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/t_CreateADatabaseView.md)  
Create the database view.
2.  [Add a table to the database view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/t_AddATableToTheDatabaseView.md)  
Specify the table to join to the database view.
3.  [Example left join in creating a database view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/example-left-join-db-view.md)  
This example shows the proper settings when using left-joins to add tables to a database view.
4.  [Specify a field to return](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_SpecifyAFieldToReturn.md)  
Restrict or specify a field that you want returned by the joined table.
5.  [Relabel a column](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/t_RelabelAColumn.md)  
Sometimes, two different tables may have fields of the same name that are both important \(such as two tables with a sys\_updated\_on field\). For clarity, relabel one of the fields.
6.  [Configuring the number of records to return](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_SpecifyTheNumberOfRecordsToReturn.md)  
Specify the number of records to return for a database view when the view is used in a script.
7.  [Test the database view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/t_TestTheDatabaseView.md)  
Verify that the database view works correctly.
