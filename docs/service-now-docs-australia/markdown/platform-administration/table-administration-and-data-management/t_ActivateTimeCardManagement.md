# Activate Time Card Management

Administrators can activate the Time Card Management plugin \(com.snc.time\_card\). The plugin also activates the Performance Analytics - Content Pack - Project Portfolio Suite Dashboards plugin \(com.snc.pa.time\_card\). However, you need a Performance Analytics license to use the dashboards.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** The Time Card Management plugin also gets activated as part of [PPM Standard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/t_ActivateProjectPortfolioSuiteWithFinancials.md) plugin \(com.snc.financial\_planning\_pmo\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
