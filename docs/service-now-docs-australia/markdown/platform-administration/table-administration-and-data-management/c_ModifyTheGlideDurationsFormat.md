# Modify the Glide durations format

To convert fields that are displayed in milliseconds \(such as 'Resolution Time' on the Incident table\) to a duration format \(Months/Days/Hours/Seconds\), populate the attribute field on the dictionary with: `format=glide_duration`.

Now the value is displayed as a duration in lists and can be utilized in the Configure Calculations functions. This may be useful to illustrate ITIL KPIs such as Mean Time To Repair.
