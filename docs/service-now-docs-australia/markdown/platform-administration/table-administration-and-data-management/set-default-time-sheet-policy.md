# Set a time sheet policy as default policy

As a time card administrator, you can set a time sheet policy as the default policy. The default policy is a global time sheet policy which applies to all the users who are not assigned to any other time sheet policy.

## Before you begin

Role required: timecard\_admin

## About this task

Only one time sheet policy can be set as a default policy.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Time Sheets** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Time Sheet Policies**.

2.  Open the time sheet policy record.

3.  Click the **Set as default** related link.

    **Note:** The related link appears only for a time sheet policy which is not already set as the default policy.


## Result

The **Default Policy** option on the [record form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/create-time-sheet-policy.md) is selected to indicate that the current time sheet policy is set as the default policy. The **Default Policy** option on the earlier default time sheet policy is cleared.

You cannot delete a default time sheet policy. You must first mark another policy as the default policy to delete the current default policy.
