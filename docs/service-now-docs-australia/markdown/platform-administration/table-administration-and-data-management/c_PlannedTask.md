# Extending the Task table with Planned tasks

The Planned Task plugin provides a Planned Task `[planned_task]` table that extends the Task `[task]` table.

The Planned Task plugin cannot be activated independently. It gets activated when activating the Project Management plugin \(through PPM Standard plugin\).

Planned tasks provide additional fields for tasks pertaining to time and effort as part of a planned, multi-stage process.

**Note:** If the Planned Task\_v2 \(`com.snc.planned_taskv2`\) plugin is active when you upgrade to the Geneva or later releases, the system adds the Task column to the Planned Task \[planned\_task\] table. The Task column is of type Composite Field, and stores the Short Description and Number of the task. During the upgrade, the system updates all records in the Planned Task table.
