# Create an application registry for Google Sheets on a ServiceNow instance

Register the Google Drive application in your ServiceNow instance to enable OAuth authorization for exporting table records directly to Google Sheets.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

An Application Registry is a record that defines how your ServiceNow instance can connect to an external application, such as Google Sheets, using OAuth.

It includes the following information:

-   Client ID and Client Secret: Credentials for the external application.
-   Authorization and Token URLs: Web addresses used to log in and get access.
-   Redirect URL: Where the OAuth server sends the user after authorization.
-   Scopes and Profiles: Define what areas of ServiceNow the external application is allowed to access.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  From the list of OAuth application types, select  **Connect to a third party OAuth Provider**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
