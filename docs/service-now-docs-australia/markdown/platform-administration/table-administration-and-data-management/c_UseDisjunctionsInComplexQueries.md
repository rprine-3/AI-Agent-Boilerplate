# Using disjunctions in complex queries

ServiceNow performs conjunction \(AND\) statements before disjunction \(OR\) statements in a query.

When you create a complex query that combines AND and OR conditions, you must use parenthesis around disjunctions to ensure proper grouping of query elements.

## Example

Find all closed incidents \(state = 6\) that are either Priority 1 or Priority 2.

-   Correct query \(with parentheses\):

    ```
    (priority = 1 || priority = 2) && state = 6
    ```

    This query returns all closed incidents where the priority is 1 OR 2.

-   Incorrect query \(without parentheses\):

    ```
    priority = 1 || priority = 2 && state = 6
    ```

    Without parentheses, this query is evaluated as: priority = 1 OR \(priority = 2 AND state = 6\). This returns ALL Priority 1 incidents regardless of state, plus only the closed Priority 2 incidents.

</td></tr><tr><td>

```
priority = 1 || priority = 2 && state = 6
```

</td><td>

P1 OR \(P2 AND Closed\)

</td><td>

ALL P1 incidents + only closed P2

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>Always use parentheses around OR conditions when combining them with AND conditions. This ensures your query returns the expected results.
