# Export data from a list

Export a list of records to a variety of file formats.

## Before you begin

Role required: none. Exporting to XML requires the admin role.

## About this task

Note the following important details:

-   Data exported from a list may be different from what a user sees in the list view. This generally happens when a table has ACLs that are dependent on the user's current session. To avoid blocking user activity on the browser, list export is executed from a background thread and doesn't have access to user session data.
-   To export records in an [embedded list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_EmbeddedLists.md), export the record containing the list. See [Export data from a record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/export-form-data.md).
-   To control how line breaks appear in exported CSV data, use the glide.csv.export.line\_break system property. See [glide.csv.export.line\_break](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).
-   To remove unwanted HTML tags from list data, see the blog [Rendering HTML in Exported Lists](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=1cdc2665dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961967&view_source=searchResult) by a ServiceNow employee in the ServiceNow Community.
-   The platform provides a default upper limit for data exports. See [Export limits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_ExportLimits.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the list of records that you want to export.

2.  Select and hold \(or right-click\) any column header in the list.

3.  Select an export option.

    **Note:** For export to PDF, when the accessibility property is enabled, users will get a pop up when they export to PDF where they can specify whether to create an accessible PDF or not. For more information, see [PDF generation and accessibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/pdf-generation-accessibility.md).
