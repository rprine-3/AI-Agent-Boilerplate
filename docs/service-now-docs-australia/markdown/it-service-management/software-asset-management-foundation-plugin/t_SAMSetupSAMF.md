# Setting up Software Asset Management Foundation plugin

Set up Software Asset Management Foundation plugin before configuration.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin

## About this task

Once you have [requested](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management-foundation-plugin/t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmtSAMF.md) Software Asset Management Foundation plugin and it has been activated from ServiceNow personnel, complete these steps to set up Software Asset Management Foundation plugin before you begin to use it.

## Procedure

1.  Determine whether you are currently running the ITSM Software Asset Management feature of Asset Management using the [Legacy Software Asset Management plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/c_SoftwareAssetManagement.md).

    Check the list of plugins to see if the Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin is active.

    -   If so, complete the [Software Asset Management Foundation plugin migration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management-foundation-plugin/c_SAMMigrationSAMF.md) procedure.

        This step automatically converts and adds new tables, forms and lists, fields and values, and disables deprecated functionality. It also contains manual procedures for you to complete for successful migration.

    -   If not, proceed to the next step.
2.  Determine whether Discovery is activated \(see [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md)\).

    Check the list of plugins to see if the Discovery plugin is active.

    -   If so, run the [Migrate Software Asset Management Foundation plugin software installations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management-foundation-plugin/t_MigrateSWInstallsSAMF.md) script.

        This step copies records from the \[cmdb\_ci\_spkg\] table to the \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table, so that any previously discovered software installs are utilized by the Software Asset Management Foundation plugin.

    -   If not, activate and configure Discovery.

        For more information, see [Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/r-discovery.md).

3.  Proceed to [Get started with Software Asset Management Foundation plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management-foundation-plugin/t_SAMGetStartedSAMF.md) to begin using the Software Asset Management Foundation plugin in your environment.
