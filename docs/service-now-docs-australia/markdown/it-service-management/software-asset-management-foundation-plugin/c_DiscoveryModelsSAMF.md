# Software Asset Management Foundation plugin discovery models and software installations

Software discovery models are automatically created during discovery so you can manually normalize the software installed in your environment.

Software discovery models are stored in the Software Discovery Model \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_discovery\_model\] table.

There is a difference between [software models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management-foundation-plugin/t_AddASoftwareModelSAMF.md) and software discovery models.

-   A software model is a specific version or configuration of software that is purchased and/or available to users.
-   A software discovery model is a model created when a version of software is discovered in a network environment.

Multiple software discovery models can be associated to one software model. For example, a software model can be defined as follows:

-   Publisher = X
-   Product = Y
-   Version = Starts with 10

If there are two separate installs of this product \(version 10.1 and version 10.2\), two discovery models are created. One of the discovery models has the discovered version set to 10.1, and the other discovery model has the discovered version set to 10.2. The reconciliation process associates both of these discovery models to the same software model since they both meet the version criterion of `Starts with 10`.

## Discovery Models

Software discovery models cannot be created manually. The following field combination, called the primary key, is used to match new software installations to a new or existing software discovery model.

Primary key: **Publisher**, **Display Name**, and **Version**

**Note:** When analyzing version numbers, an exact match is always searched for first, but rounds down to a major version number when an exact match is not found.

For example, if no match is found for version number 8.0.4, but version 8.0 is found, then version 8.0 is used in the **Software model** field.

Additional Information

</td></tr><tr><td>

Product type

</td><td>

-   Child: A subcomponent of main software \(not licensable\).
-   Driver: A software product that controls a device.
-   Licensable: A software product that is licensable.
-   Not Licensable: A software product that is not licensable.
-   Patch: A software product designed to update, fix, or improve an existing computer program.
-   Unknown: Not discovered.

For unknown product types, the product type can be changed to another value.

When the product type is changed, the normalization status of the discovery model is updated to Manually Normalized.


 The reconciliation process only considers software discovery models that are licensable.

</table>**Note:** If a normalized discovery model has a missing version, edition, language, or platform value, those field values can be set by the user. Once a new value is set, the normalization status changes form New to Manually Normalized.

## Software Installations

The Software Installations list contains the software installed in your organization and is automatically populated by discovery.

Installed software is placed in the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table by Discovery, and a primary key is built \(using **Publisher**, **Display Name**, and **Version** fields\).

Discovery automatically matches the discovered software installation with a new or existing software discovery model using the primary key.
