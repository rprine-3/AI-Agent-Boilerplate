# Create a SAM Foundation entitlement allocation

A user or device allocation can be added to a software entitlement to specify a user or device to which rights have been allocated.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_user

## About this task

User allocations are stored in the User Allocations \[alm\_entitlement\_user\] table. Device allocations are stored in the Device Allocations \[alm\_entitlement\_asset\] table.

**Note:** The total of all allocation quantities cannot exceed the total number of rights for the entitlement.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Licensing** &gt; **Software Entitlements** and open the software entitlement record to add allocations to.

2.  Click the applicable allocations related list \(**User Allocations** or **Device Allocations**\) to configure \(see table for field descriptions\).

    **Note:** The allocations related list that is shown pertains to the license metric that you chose. Only one related list for allocations is shown.
