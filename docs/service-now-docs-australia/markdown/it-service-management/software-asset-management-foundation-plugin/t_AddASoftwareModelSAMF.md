# Create a SAM Foundation software model

Software models are used to connect purchased software rights with discovered software installations. Additionally, software models can be used to manage suites of software as well as to publish requestable software to the Service Catalog.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_user or model\_manager

## About this task

Manage software available and tie software installations \(software being used\) with entitlements \(software owned\) using software models. Create software models for all software to be monitored.

**Note:** Users with the model\_manager role can navigate to **Product Catalog** &gt; **Product Model** &gt; **Software Models**, but cannot administer all aspects of software models.

Predefined suites are used so suite components are automatically created for known suite parent software models. Discovery maps indicate whether a suite is defined for the product.

You can also track a software model lifecycle phase for use with the .

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Software Asset** &gt; **Licensing** &gt; **Software Models** and create a new record \(see table for field descriptions\).

<table id="table_nr2_nd1_y4"><thead><tr><th>

Field

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Display name

</td><td>

\[Read-only\] Name of the model. The system property **glide.cmdb\_model.display\_name.shorten** controls how software model display names are generated. System administrators can configure this property. Default format is publisher + product + version + edition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Publisher

</td><td>

Publisher of the software. You can use the lookup list provided.**Note:** Publisher is a reference to the company \[core\_company\]. Only companies you are using internally are shown.

 If the publisher and product do not exist, you can [Add a Software Asset Management Foundation plugin custom license metric](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management-foundation-plugin/add-custom-license-metric-samf.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Product

</td><td>

Software product name. The same lookup list provided on the Software Discovery Models form.**Note:** If the relationship between the software publisher \[samp\_sw\_publisher\] and company \[core\_company\] is not correct, products for that publisher may not be shown.

Product classification

</td><td>

The official UNSPSC classification of the product.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Product type

</td><td>

-   Child: A subcomponent of main software \(not licensable\).

-   Licensable: A software product that is licensable.
-   Not Licensable: A software product that is not licensable.
-   Patch: A software product designed to update, fix, or improve an existing computer program.
-   Unknown: Not discovered.
