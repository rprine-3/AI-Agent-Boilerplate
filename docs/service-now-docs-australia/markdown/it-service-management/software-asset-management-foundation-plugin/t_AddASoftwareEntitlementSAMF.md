# Create a SAM Foundation entitlement

Software entitlements enable you to define license details that are matched to software models.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_user

## About this task

Software entitlements are stored in the Software Entitlement \[alm\_license\] table.

**Note:** Entitlements are assigned to [Create a SAM Foundation software model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management-foundation-plugin/t_AddASoftwareModelSAMF.md), which are different than software discovery models.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Licensing** &gt; **Software Entitlements** and create a new record \(see table for field descriptions\).

    The Activities related list contains work notes for the asset.

2.  To perform additional configuration, select the new software entitlement record in the Software Entitlements list.

    1.  To set upgrade and downgrade entitlements, in the Downgrades/Upgrades related list, create a new record to specify which software models to which you have upgrade or downgrade rights \(see table for field descriptions\).

        This allows you to set entitlement to previous or future versions of software \(for example, the purchase of Office Professional Plus 2016 rights entitles you to Office Professional Plus 2013 as well\).

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|

    3.  To manage license keys, in the License Keys related list, create a new record to specify the licenses keys allocated to entitlements \(see table for field descriptions\).

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Is allocated|Check box indicating that the license key has been allocated.|
