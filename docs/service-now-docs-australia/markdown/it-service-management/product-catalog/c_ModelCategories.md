# Model categories

Model categories associate CI classes with asset classes. Model categories are part of the Product Catalog application.

The model category configuration determines if the ServiceNow platform creates an asset from a CI, and, if so, what class of asset. Asset classes in the base system are **Hardware**, **Software License**, and **Consumable**. You can associate a model category to many models and a model to many model categories. For example, a specific model of a computer can be a **Computer** and a **Server**.

Any item that is provided as a service or sold to your customer is tracked as an Install Base Item \(IBI\). The Model category table associates Asset class, CI class, and Install Base Item \(IBI\) class.

**Note:** The Install Base Item class field is available on the Model category form only when the Customer Service Install Base Management \[com.snc.install\_base\] plugin is installed. Currently, only the Medical device install base item \[sn\_hcls\_medical\_device\_install\_base\_item\] is supported when the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application is installed. For more details, see [Medical device install base item table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/hcls-clinical-device-ib-item.md). When an IBI class is created, it associates with an asset when the asset exists, otherwise an asset is created.

The fields in the Asset class and the IBI class are synchronized as follows:

1.  When an IBI class is updated, the Account, Consumer, Location, and Install date field changes are synchronized with the corresponding fields of the Asset class.
2.  When an Asset class is updated, the Location and Install date field changes are synchronized with the corresponding fields of the IBI class.
