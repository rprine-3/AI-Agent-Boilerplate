# Legacy: Incident Daily 7d - 28d dashboard

View the last 28 days of incidents as raw trends, as a 7-day running average, or as a 28-day running average. Filter the scores by assignment groups or by the category of incident.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Incident Daily 7d - 28d dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Incident management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident.md) to view the last 28 days of incidents as raw trends, as a 7-day running average, or as a 28-day running average and filter the scores by assignment groups or incident.

## Indicators

-   **Number of open incidents**

    Daily count of the number of incidents that do not have a resolution date. This indicator is used as the basis of several other indicators on this dashboard.

-   **Number of resolved incidents**

    Daily count of indicators with State = Resolved.

-   **Average resolution time of resolved incidents**

    The average number of days it takes to resolve an incident, provided it is resolved. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed duration of resolved incidents\]\] / \(\[\[Number of resolved incidents\]\] \* 24\).

-   **Number of open incidents not updated in last 5 days**

    Daily count of the number of incidents last updated more than five days ago.

-   **Number of open incidents not updated in last 30 days**

    Daily count of the number of incidents last updated more than 30 days ago.
