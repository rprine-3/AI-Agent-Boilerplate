# Legacy: Incident Premium dashboard

This dashboard uses Workbench widgets and other advanced Platform Analytics features to give you all the information about the Incident process in one place.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Incident Premium dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Incident management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident.md) for Workbench widgets and other advanced Platform Analytics features to know about the Incident process in one place.

</table>## Indicators

-   **Number of open incidents**

    Daily count of the number of incidents that do not have a resolution date. This indicator is used as the basis of several other indicators on this dashboard.

-   **Number of new incidents**

    Daily count of the number of incidents opened 'today.'

-   **Number of closed incidents**

    Daily count of indicators with State = Closed.

-   **Number of resolved incidents**

    Daily count of indicators with State = Resolved.

-   **Average age of open incidents**

    The average age in days in which an incident has been open. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed age of open incidents\]\]/\(\[\[Number of open incidents\]\]\*24\).

-   **Average reassignment of open incidents**

    The average number of times currently open incidents have been reassigned. This indicator is shown as 'Average re-assignment times' in the Process by State tab. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed re-assignment of open incidents\]\] / \[\[Number of open incidents\]\].

-   **Average age of last update of open incidents**

    How long on average it has been since the last update to one of the currently open incidents, in days. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed age of last update of open incidents\]\] / \(\[\[Number of open incidents\]\] \* 24\)

-   **% of incidents not updated in last 5 days**

    The percentage of currently open incidents that have not been updated for the last five days. The score is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of open incidents not updated in last 5 days\]\] / \[\[Number of open incidents\]\] \) \* 100

-   **% of incidents not updated in last 30 days**

    The percentage of currently open incidents that have not been updated for the last 30 days. The score is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of open incidents not updated in last 30 days\]\] / \[\[Number of open incidents\]\] \) \* 100

-   **% of new critical incidents**

    The percentage of new incidents filtered on the Priority breakdown with the breakdown element 1 - Critical. The score is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of new incidents &gt; Priority = 1 - Critical\]\] / \[\[Number of new incidents\]\] \) \* 100.

-   **Average close time of incidents**

    The average amount of time in days it takes to close an incident. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed duration of closed incidents\]\] / \(\[\[Number of closed incidents\]\] / 24\)

-   **% of incidents resolved without reassigning**

    The percentage of incidents with a State of Resolved that were never reassigned from the first assignment group. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Number of resolved incidents by first assigned group\]\] / \[\[Number of resolved incidents\]\] \* 100.

-   **% of incidents closed by self-service**

    The percentage of incidents with State = Closed and Close code = Closed/Resolved by Caller. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Number of incidents closed by self-service\]\] / \[\[Number of closed incidents\]\] \* 100.

-   **% of open incidents reassigned at least once**

    The percentage of incidents that are open and that have been transferred at least once. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Number of reassigned open incidents\]\] / \[\[Number of open incidents\]\] \* 100

-   **% of incidents resolved same day opened**

    The percentage of incidents with State = Resolved where the day in the Resolved field is the same as the day in the Opened field. The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Number of incidents resolved on the same day opened\]\] / \[\[Number of resolved incidents\]\] \* 100.

-   **% of incidents not solved**

    The percentage of closed incidents where Close code = Not Solved \(Not Reproducible\) or Not Solved \(Too Costly\). The score is calculated according to the formula \[\[Number of incidents not solved\]\] / \[\[Number of closed incidents\]\] \* 100.


The following indicators are not shown directly on the dashboard but are used in calculating formulas:

-   Summed age of open incidents
-   Summed re-assignment of open incidents
-   Summed age of last update of open incidents
-   Number of open incidents not updated in last 5 days
-   Number of open incidents not updated in last 30 days
-   Summed duration of closed incidents
-   Number of resolved incidents by first assigned group
-   Number of incidents closed by self-service
-   Number of reassigned open incidents
-   Number of incidents resolved on the same day opened
-   Number of incidents not solved
