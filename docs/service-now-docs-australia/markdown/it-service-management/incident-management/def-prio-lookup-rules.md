# Define priority lookup rules

Define impact and urgency combinations that determine incident priority and the SLA for each priority for an organization. Only administrators and data lookup administrators can configure these rules.

## Before you begin

Role required: data\_lookup\_admin, or admin

## About this task

Priority lookup rules are organizational configurations set by administrators. These rules ascertain how impact and urgency values combine to determine the priority of each incident. Individual incident responders cannot change the priority lookup rules. If the calculated priority seems incorrect for your organization, contact your system administrator to review the configured rules.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Policy** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Priority Lookup Rules**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Impact|Impact is a measure of the effect of an incident, problem, or change on business processes.|
    |Urgency|Urgency is a measure of how long the resolution can be delayed until an incident, problem, or change has a significant business impact.|
    |Priority|Priority is based on impact and urgency, and it identifies how quickly the service desk should address the task.|
    |Application|Application scope of the rules. The scope defines whether the rules are available for all applications or for scoped applications.|
    |Active|Option to define whether the rule is active or not.|
    |Order|Sequence in which the rules appear in the priority lookup list. This field indicates the sequence of the rule that is executed first.|

    **Note:**

    Priority is calculated according to the following sample data lookup rules:

    |Impact|Urgency|Priority|
    |------|-------|--------|
    |1 - High|1 - High|1 - Critical|
    |1 - High|2 - Medium|2 - High|
    |1 - High|3 - Low|3 - Moderate|
    |2 - Medium|1 - High|2 - High|
    |2 - Medium|2 - Medium|3 - Moderate|
    |2 - Medium|3 - Low|4 - Low|
    |3 - Low|1 - High|3 - Moderate|
    |3 - Low|2 - Medium|4 - Low|
    |3 - Low|3 - Low|4 - Low|

    By default, the **Priority** field is read-only and must be set by selecting the **Impact** and **Urgency** values. To change how the priority is calculated, you can either alter the priority lookup rules or disable the **Priority is managed by Data Lookup - set as read-only** UI policy and create their own business logic.

4.  Select **Submit**.
