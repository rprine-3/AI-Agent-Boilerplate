# Associate CIs with incident

Associate affected or impacted configuration items \(CIs\) with an incident record to find out how the incident affects other CIs with dependent relationships.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use the **Configuration Item** field when there is a single, primary CI that is the cause of the incident and the **Affected CIs** or the **Impacted Services/CIs** related list when multiple CIs are affected by the incident.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident** &gt; **Open**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Open the incident record to which you want to associate CI items.

3.  Perform the following actions:
