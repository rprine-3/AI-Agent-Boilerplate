# Legacy: ITIL dashboard

Use this dashboard to view, maintain, and track the tasks and incidents for operating the IT service desk.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the ITIL dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [IT Agent dashboard for Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/it-agent-dashboard-sow.md) to view, maintain, and track the tasks and incidents for operating the IT service desk.
