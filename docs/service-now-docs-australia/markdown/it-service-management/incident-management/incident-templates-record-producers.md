# Incident templates and record producers

Templates simplify the process of submitting new records by populating fields automatically. A template ensures consistency in the way information about the incident is captured. A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that allows end users to create task-based records, such as incident records, from the service catalog.

You can use incident templates to quickly create incidents for similar issues.

-   An administrator or user with the template\_editor\_global role can create templates that are available to everyone.
-   An administrator can enable the global option for any personal template that a user creates so that all other users can access the template.
-   A user with the itil role can create their own templates for incidents they log frequently.

ESS users typically log incidents using a record producer in the service catalog. A template can be used to create an incident record producer. The template automatically populates fields in the incident form.

For example, an incident record producer can be created to request account access to a network server. The user who submits the incident enters variable values, such as the server name, level of access needed, and due date. The incident template assigned to the record producer populates the incident **Category**, **Subcategory**, and **Assignment Group**. These fields and values applied from the template do not appear in the record producer form.
