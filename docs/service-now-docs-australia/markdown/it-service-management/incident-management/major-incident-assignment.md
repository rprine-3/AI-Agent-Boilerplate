# Major incident assignment

A major incident is assigned to a group automatically at the time of proposal and promotion based on the value of the property **Major Incident Management Group \(sys\_id\) to whom the Major Incident should be re-assigned on promotion to 'Major Incident'** \(**sn\_major\_inc\_mgmt.major\_incident\_management\_group**\). The assigned group works on the major incident and resolves it.

The incident is assigned to an individual if the On-Call Scheduling plugin \(com.snc.on\_call\_rotation\) is activated and a shift is defined for the group. The following table illustrates the different conditions under which a major incident is assigned to a group and a user.
