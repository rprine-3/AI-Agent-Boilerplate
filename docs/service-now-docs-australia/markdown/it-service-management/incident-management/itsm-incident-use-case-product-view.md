# Applying CSDM guidelines to Incident Management

Incident Management supports the incident management process with the ability to identify and log incidents, classify and prioritize incidents, assign incidents to appropriate users or groups, escalate, resolve, and report incidents. The goal of this product view is to help you to understand how Incident Management key entities work with the core CSDM framework.

Features of Incident Management that get the most benefit from the CSDM include:

-   Agent Workspace gives agents the information they need to quickly prioritize and resolve incidents. CSDM-populated CI and service data surfaces business impact context directly on the incident form, reducing time spent gathering context.
-   The major incident workbench provides a single-pane view to identify, track, and resolve high-impact incidents. CSDM service modeling surfaces impact services and dependent CIs in real time on the workbench.
-   The native mobile app allows agents to quickly view and respond to tasks on-the-go. CSDM-populated CI data ensures that incident context and service relationships are available to agents in the field.
-   Incident deflection encourage self-help by suggesting related knowledge base articles. Accurate CI classification in CSDM improves the relevance of article suggestions
-   Drag-and-Drop functionality on visual task board Improves collaboration on incident tasks. CSDM service relationships help route tasks to the correct assignment groups.
-   Performance analytics provide detailed insights into performance trends. CSDM-aligned service hierarchies enable accurate reporting by business service and service offering.

For more information about CSDM health and data quality, see [Incident Management considerations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/itsm-incident-use-case-trouble.md).

Incident Management includes a form you can use to report incidents.

\[Omitted image "incident-form.png"\] Alt text: Elements on the Incident form with numbered fields.

The incident form references the following attributes and related lists.

1.  Service — References the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\] table.
2.  Service Offering \(attribute\) — References the \[service\_offering\] table. Displays the service offerings affected by the incident in the Service Offerings related list.
3.  Configuration Items — References the \[cmdb\_ci\] table
4.  Affected/Causal CIs — Related list \[task\_ci\] table. \(The Incident form allows Application Services to be chosen as CIs\)
5.  Impacted Services — Related list \[task\_cmdb\_ci\_service\] table
6.  Service Offering — Related list \[task\_service\_offering\] table

-   **[Incident Management and CSDM tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/itsm-incident-use-case.md)**  
Incident Management manages and uses CSDM tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to Incident Management.
-   **[Incident Management use case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/itsm-incident-use-case-example.md)**  
Incident Management restores normal service operation, while also minimizing impact to your business and maintaining the quality of your data.
-   **[Set up the Incident Management form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/csdm-inc-mgt-form-configure.md)**  
Configure the Incident form to see the impact of an incident and then restore affected services. The CSDM framework enables you to view rich context for incidents: the CIs involved in the incident and the service offerings, business applications, and business services that the incident affects.
-   **[Incident Management considerations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/itsm-incident-use-case-trouble.md)**  
Consider these points while implementing the CSDM framework.
