# Legacy: Major incident overview dashboard

Major Incident Overview module provides two versions of the Performance Analytics \(PA\) Dashboard to review major incident information at a glance.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Major incident overview dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Major incident dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/major-incident.md) to view the process and communication related metrics for Open and Closed major incidents.

Users with itil, sn\_incident\_write, major\_incident\_manager or communication\_manager role can access the dashboard.

The two versions of the Performance Analytics \(PA\) Dashboard are normal and premium. You must activate the Incident Management - Major Incident Management plugin \(com.snc.incident.mim\) to view the normal dashboard. To access the premium version of Major Incident Overview dashboard, activate Performance Analytics – Content Pack for Major Incident Management \(com.snc.pa.incident.mim\).

You can navigate to the dashboard in the following ways:

-   **Incident** &gt; **Major Incidents** &gt; **Overview**
-   **Self – Service** &gt; **Dashboard** &gt; **Major Incident Overview**
