# Create an incident task

Create an incident task to communicate and request work from assignment groups other than the one initially assigned to the incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, sn\_incident\_write, or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident** &gt; **Open**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Open the incident record.

3.  In the **Incident Tasks** related list, click **New**.

    If you don't see the **Incident Tasks** related list, you need to add it. For information on how to add a related list, see [Add a related list to a form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md).

    Alternatively, you can also right-click on the header form and on the context menu, and then select **Create Incident Task**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
