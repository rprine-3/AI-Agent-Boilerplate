# Accept or reject a major incident candidate

When an incident is proposed as a major incident candidate, a major incident manager can accept or reject the candidate. The manager accepts a candidate as a major incident if the incident requires accelerated resolution.

## Before you begin

Role required: major\_incident\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Perform any of the following actions.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).
