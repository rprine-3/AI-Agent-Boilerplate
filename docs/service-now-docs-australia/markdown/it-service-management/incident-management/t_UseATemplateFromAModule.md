# Create a module that uses incident template

Create a module to log an incident with pre-filled field values from an existing template.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

In the [Create incident template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/t_CreateAnIncidentTemplate.md) topic, you have created the Bond Trade Access Denied template. In this topic, you can use the template with a module in the Self-Service application.

## Procedure

1.  Point to **Self-Service** and select the edit icon \[Omitted image "edit-module.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon.

2.  In the Modules related list, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    -   **Title**: `Bond Trading Access Denied`.
    -   **Order**: In the Module records list, view the order numbers and enter a number that is appropriate. For example, if the order number of **Homepage** is 50 and the order number of **Business Applications** is 52, and you want to place the new module between **Homepage** and **Business Applications**, enter the order number as 51.
    -   **Hint**: `Log an incident about the Bond Trade application`.
    Link Type section:

    -   **Link Type**: URL \(from Arguments:\)
    -   **Arguments**: `incident.do?sys_id=-1&sysparm_template=Bond Trading Access Denied`

        **Note:** This path deploys the template in the new incident record.

4.  Select **Submit**.

    The new module appears in the Self-Service application.
