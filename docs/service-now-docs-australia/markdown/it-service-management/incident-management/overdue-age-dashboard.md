# Legacy: Overdue by Age dashboard

This dashboard lets you see incidents that are overdue according to an SLA, divided by age buckets. You can see the average age of the incidents, the average number of times they have been reassigned, and how long on average since the last update. You can also group them by standard breakdowns like Priority and Assignment Group.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Overdue by Age dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Incident management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident.md) to view the incidents that are overdue according to SLA, divided by age buckets.

This dashboard is inactive by default. Before using this dashboard, a Performance Analytics administrator or power user must open the Dashboard Properties, assign an owner, and select **Active**.

    The number of incidents on the Incident.SLA.Open indicator source with the following characteristics:

    -   Related to an SLA task of type 'SLA' \(contract\_sla.type\)
    -   Not in stage 'Cancelled' \(task\_sla.stage\)
    -   The amount of time taken to work on the task is over the SLA limit, determined by having an elapsed percentage \(task\_sla.percentage\) value more than 100%.
-   **Average age open and overdue incidents**

    The score is calculated according to the following formula: \[\[Summed age of open and overdue incidents\]\] / \[\[Number of open incidents that should be resolved in time\]\]

-   **Average reassignments of open and overdue incidents**

    The score is calculated according to the following formula: \[\[Summed reassignments of open and overdue incidents\]\] / \[\[Number of open and overdue incidents\]\]

-   **Average age of updated since of open and overdue incidents**

    The average length of time in days since the last update of open, overdue incidents. The score is calculated according to the following formula: \[\[Summed age of updated since of open and overdue incidents\]\] / \[\[Number of open and overdue incidents\]\] / 24
