# Synchronizing parent and child incidents

The parent and the child incidents are synchronized such that the state of a child incident changes depending on the state of the parent incident.

</table>**Note:**

This table applies only to standard incident life cycle states. When a parent incident is proposed or accepted as a major incident, the states of any associated child incidents do not change automatically. For more information, see [Managing major incidents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/major-incident-management.md).

When an incident has a child incident, the following actions take place:

-   If an ITIL user reopens the parent incident, then the parent incident as well as the child incident reopens. Both the parent and the child incident state is set to **In Progress**.
-   If an ESS user reopens the parent incident, the parent incident state is set to **In Progress** but the child incident is not reopened.
