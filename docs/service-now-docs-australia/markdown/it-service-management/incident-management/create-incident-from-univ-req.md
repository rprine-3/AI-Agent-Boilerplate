# Create incident from Universal Request

Create an incident from a universal request record to restore service to a customer as soon as possible. After creating the incident record, you can investigate potential solutions.

## Before you begin

Role required: routing\_agent and ITIL or admin

Activate the Universal Request \(sn\_uni\_req\) and the Universal Request Integration for Incident Management \(sn\_inc\_uni\_req\) plugins.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Universal Requests** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the universal request record from which you want to create an incident.

3.  Click **Create Incident**.

    An incident record is created and associated with universal request. The incident record is not saved until you submit the record.

4.  Fill in the fields on the [incident form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/create-an-incident.md) and click **Submit**.

    The universal request number from which the incident is created appears in the **Universal Request** field on the Incident form. The incident number appears in the **Primary Ticket** field and also in the **Associated Tickets** related list of the Universal Request form.
