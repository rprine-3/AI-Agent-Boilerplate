# View major incident information on the Incident form

When an incident enters the major incident life cycle, the **Major Incident** and the **Post Incident Report** tab appears on the incident form.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, sn\_incident\_read, or admin

Incident is in the major incident life cycle.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident** &gt; **Open**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Select the incident which is in the major incident life cycle.

3.  Click the **Major Incident** tab.
