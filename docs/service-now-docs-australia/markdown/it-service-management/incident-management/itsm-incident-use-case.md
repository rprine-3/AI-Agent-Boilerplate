# Incident Management and CSDM tables

Incident Management manages and uses CSDM tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to Incident Management.

## CSDM tables used by Incident Management

The Incident form references the following CSDM tables:

1.  Service instance \(formerly application service\) \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_discovered\] table or any infrastructure CI.
2.  Configuration Item tables \[cmdb\_ci\*\]
3.  Business Service \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_business\] table and Technology Management Service \(formerly Technical service\) \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_technical\] table: Use the service classification attribute to identify business services, technical services, and application services as types of services.
4.  Service Offering \[service\_offering\] table: Uses the service classification attribute to identify business services, technology management services, and service instances as types of service offerings.

    See the Incident Management documentation for information about service commitments on a service offering \(for example, resolution time for incident\).
