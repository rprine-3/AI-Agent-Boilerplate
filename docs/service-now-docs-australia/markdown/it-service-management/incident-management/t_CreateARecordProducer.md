# Create a record producer to log incidents

Create record producers to log incidents directly from Service Catalog.

## Before you begin

Role required: catalog\_admin or admin

## About this task

Incident record producers provide users with an interface from which user can log an incident. For example, the default **Can We Help You?** category features record producers such as **Create Incident** to enable users to log incidents from the catalog.

The following example demonstrates how to create a record producer to request a wireless router reset.

## Procedure

2.  Select **New** and complete the steps in [Create a record producer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_DefRecProdInSCat.md) using the following information:
