# Monitor a contract

You can monitor contracts by viewing contract history and creating contract reports.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset, contract\_manager\(core UI and Hardware Asset Workspace only\), sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin \(Enterprise Asset Workspace only\), or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager \(Enterprise Asset Workspace only\)

**Note:** Contracts with the Contract model set to **Subscription** are readable by all authenticated users regardless of their assigned roles. This allows users to view their own subscription-based assets in the **My Assets** report. For all other contract types, the role requirements in the prerequisites section apply.

## About this task

If changes are made to a contract start date, end date, or terms and conditions, a copy of the contract is automatically saved and placed in contract history. This is useful for tracking changes to a contract and keeping an audit trail. Configure the **Contract History** related list or tab to include columns for creation and update so you can easily see who edited the contract.

## Procedure

1.  Open the list of contracts that are used across your deployment.

    -   If you are using the core UI, navigate to **Contract** &gt; **Contracts** &gt; **All**.
    -   If you are using the Hardware Asset Workspace, open the Contract management view and then select the **All contracts** tab.
    -   If you are using the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Contract and lease management view and then select the **All contracts** tab.
2.  Select a contract.

3.  View the **Contract History** related list \(core UI\) or tab \(Hardware Asset Workspaceand Enterprise Asset Workspace\) and perform one of the following actions.

    -   If earlier versions of the contract exist, click a date in the **Contract Starts** column to view a version.
    -   If an earlier version of the contract does not exist, change the contract's **Start date** or **End date**. Right-click in the header bar and select **Save**. In the **Contract History** related list, click a date in the **Contract Starts** column to view the earlier version.
