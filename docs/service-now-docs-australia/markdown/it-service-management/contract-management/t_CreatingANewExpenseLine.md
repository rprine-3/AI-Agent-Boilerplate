# Create a new expense line

Typically, expense lines are automatically generated based on assets or users, but you can create a new expense line manually if needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset, contract\_manager\(core UI and Hardware Asset Workspace only\), sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin \(Enterprise Asset Workspace only\), or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager \(Enterprise Asset Workspace only\)

## Procedure

1.  Open the list of contracts that are used across your deployment.

    -   If you are using the core UI, navigate to **Contract Management** &gt; **Contract** &gt; **All**.
    -   If you are using the Hardware Asset Workspace, open the Contract management view and then select the **All contracts** tab.
    -   If you are using the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Contract and lease management view and then select the **All contracts** tab.
2.  Select a contract.

3.  In the **Expense Lines** related list \(core UI\) or tab \(Hardware Asset Workspaceand Enterprise Asset Workspace\), click **New**.

4.  Complete the form.

    |Date|The date on which the expense line was created.|
