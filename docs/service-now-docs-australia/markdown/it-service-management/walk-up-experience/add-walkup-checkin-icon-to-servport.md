# Configure Walk-up Experience online check-in icon to appear on Service Portal

Requesters can check into a walk-up location online via the Service Portal. You can edit the Service Portal Home page to replace the general IT **Get Help** support icon link with the Walk-up Experience online check-in support icon link.

## Before you begin

Service Portal for Enterprise Service Management \(com.glide.service-portal.esm\) must be activated.

Role required: sp\_admin or admin

## About this task

To replace the Get Help icon link with the Walk-up Check-in icon link on the Service Portal Home page, access Service Portal Designer. Alternatively, you can add a new container to the Service Portal for the Walk-up Check-in icon link, so that the Get Help icon link remains.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Configuration**.

2.  Click the **Designer** tile on the configuration page.

3.  Select the **Service Portal** index page to edit.

4.  Ensure you are in edit mode by verifying that **Edit** is highlighted as active in the Service Portal Designer banner.

    In edit mode, you can add a new container for the Walk-up Check-in icon link or edit an existing container, depending on where you want to place the icon link.

5.  To edit an existing container, select the **Get Help** icon link container.

6.  Click the edit icon in the upper right corner.

7.  Edit the form fields with the following data and presentation details.

    |Fields|Configuration input|
    |------|-------------------|
    |Data| |
    |Type|Select **Page** to embed the walkup\_online\_checkin page with widget on the icon link.|
    |Page|Select **walkup\_online checkin**.|
    |Presentation| |
    |Title|Enter `Walk-up Check-in`.|
    |Short description|Enter details about the icon link, that you want displayed, such as `Check in to an IT walk-up location to make a request or report a problem.`|
    |Bootstrap color|Select **Default**.|
    |Bootstrap class name|Enter a class name or leave this field empty.|
    |Glyph|Select a glyph or you can select the empty glyph to bypass this field.|
    |Template|Select **Circle Icon**.|

8.  Click **Save**.

    The Service Portal Home page opens in edit mode. The online Walk-up Check-in icon link with your selected glyph image and description displays in place of the former **Get Help** icon link.
