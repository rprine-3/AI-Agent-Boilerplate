# Set up Microsoft Office 365 integration for Walk-up Experience

Enable Walk-up Experience Microsoft Office 365 calendar integration. When requesters make an appointment, modify it, or cancel it, the Outlook calendar is sent invites to an appointment and any updates.

## Before you begin

Logging into the Microsoft Azure Portal \([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)\) with your specific customer account is necessary. You will already have a tenant, as logging into the portal requires access to this tenant. For details about setting up a tenant, refer to [Quickstart: Set up a tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant).

Also required is that you have a Microsoft Office 365 subscription linked to an existing tenant. For details regarding this, refer to [Set up a Microsoft 365 developer subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-get-started).
