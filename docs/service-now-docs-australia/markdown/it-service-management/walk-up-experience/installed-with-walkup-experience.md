Walk-up login\[sn\_walkup.walkup\_login\]

</td><td>

Used to log into the onsite Walk-up Experience portal when needed. For example, at the beginning of the work day for an agent. **Note:** This role is assigned to a user record for purposes of logging into the check-in device, typically a tablet, at the on-site Walk-up Experience portal. It is not an actual human being with an assigned role, but an account used to log into the on-site portal devices. The user record can be assigned only this role in order to access the onsite Walk-up Experience portal. The user record account cannot contain any other associated roles. For security reasons, the Walk-up Experience portal cannot be accessed using the admin role.
