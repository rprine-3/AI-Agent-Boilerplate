# Use platform view to fulfill a Walk-up Experience request from a stockroom

Walk-up Experience agents can access an associated stockroom and fulfill user requests directly from an interaction in platform view.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_walkup.walkup\_technician

## About this task

When a walk-up queue requester requests a consumable, such as a computer monitor or keyboard, you can quickly fulfill the request by accessing an associated on-site stockroom. Walk-up requester can leave the queue with the requested item in hand.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **** &gt; **Technician** &gt; **My Assigned Walk-ups**.

    The Interaction list opens.

2.  Click the interaction **Number** associated with the request.

3.  Select **Stockroom Consumables** in the Related Links section of the interaction.

    The associated Stockroom list opens displaying all available consumables.

4.  Select the requested consumable **Display name**.

5.  Select the **Consume** button.

6.  Update the form with the **Quantity**, **Asset**, and **User** information.

7.  Select **OK**.

    The Consumable form indicates that an item has been consumed and attached to the specified user.

8.  Retrieve the item from the stockroom and provide it to the requester.

9.  Return to the interaction in your **My Assigned Walk-ups** module to change the **State** to **Closed Complete** and click **Update** to update the interaction.

    Alternatively, you can click **Close** to complete the interaction.

    If you cannot fulfill the request from the associated stockroom, click the **Create Request** related link from the interaction form to access the Service Catalog. Refer to [Create a request through a catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/service-management-for-the-enterprise/t_CreateARequestThroughTheCatalog.md) to order an item for the requester.
