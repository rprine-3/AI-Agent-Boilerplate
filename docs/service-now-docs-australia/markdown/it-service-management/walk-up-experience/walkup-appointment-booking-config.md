# Configure Walk-up Experience appointment booking

Create or modify appointment booking configurations for the Walk-up Experience. You can view or modify the Walk-up Experience application appointment booking configuration and create or modify related service appointment configurations.

The base system Walk-up Experience application includes a default appointment booking configuration that can be modified. By default, the information stored in the Walk-up Experience application appointment booking configuration applies to all services within that application. Services within the Walk-up Experience application are defined as the actual walk-up queue locations. You can create new appointment booking service configurations for the Walk-up Experience application or modify existing configurations.

For example, you may want to configure one walk-up queue to accept appointment booking every day from Monday to Friday, but for another queue, you only want appointment booking available on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By configuring appointment booking at the service level, you can achieve this goal.

Specific Walk-up Experience set-up criteria for appointment booking include the following configurations:

-   Define different appointment schedules and time windows per queue location.
-   Define the time window in which you want to support appointments. For example, 15 minutes now\_V. 30 minutes.
-   Define the time window capacity. For example, the maximum number of appointments per time window.
