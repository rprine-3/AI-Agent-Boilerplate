# Configure excluded hours for Walk-up Experience appointment booking

Using the **Appointment Booking** application, you can specify excluded appointment hours in the schedule for your Walk-up Experience location.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_admin or admin

## About this task

Configure your Walk-up Experience location to exclude certain hours of operation from users scheduling appointments. For example, you can set the appointment booking availability schedule to run from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday. On Friday, you can schedule the appointment booking availability from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. You can also completely remove appointment booking for a specific day of the week, for example, Mondays or Friday.

Reconfigure the **Holiday Schedule** field on the Appointment Booking Service Configuration form for your walk-up location to use a custom **Off hours schedule** instead of the default holidays schedule.

## Procedure

1.  To create a schedule to exclude your unavailable appointment booking hours, navigate to **Walk-up Experience** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Schedules**.

2.  Select **New.**

3.  Provide a name for your schedule, for example, `Off hours schedule`.

4.  Add a description, if desired.

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  In the **Schedules** list, search by **Name** for the new **Off hours schedule** record.

7.  Select **Off hours schedule** to open the record.

    Use the Schedule Entries related list to create two separate excluded hours schedule entries, one for **Friday off hours** and one for **Weekday off hours**.

9.  Select **Update** to save your changes.

10. Add the **U.S. Holidays** default off-hour schedule as a child schedule to the **Off hours schedule**.

    1.  Click the Child Schedules related list.

    2.  Click **Edit** and use the slush bucket to move the **U.S. Holidays** schedule into the **Child Schedules List** for the **Off hours schedule**.

        Adding the **U.S. Holidays** schedule as a child ensures that all holidays are excluded from appointment booking and overrides the **Off hours schedule** configurations for holidays.

        **Note:** The **U.S. Holidays** schedule is the default off-hours schedule for the United States. Default off-hours schedules will differ depending on your location.

    3.  Click **Save**.

11. Click **Update** to save the **Off hours schedule** record.

12. Next, to configure your walk-up location to use the **Off hours schedule**, navigate to **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment Booking Configuration**.

13. Select **Walk-up Experience** and then the walk-up location you want to reconfigure, for example, San Diego Tech Lounge.

15. Click the **Daily Schedule** tab to configure the daily start and end times for the walk-up location.

    For this location, the hours of operation begin at 8:00 a.m. and end at 5:00 p.m. \(17:00\), Monday through Friday.
