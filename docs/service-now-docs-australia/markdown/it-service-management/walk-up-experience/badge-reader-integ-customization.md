# Customize badge Reader Integration

Badge Reader Integration includes several scripted extension points for you to customize script includes installed with the feature.

The underlying Badge Reader Integration script includes are read only. Customers who want to modify the look and feel of the feature can alter several script includes using scripted extension points.

Various scenarios exist whereby the ability to modify script-includes code is beneficial. For example, if you already use a data model to store your badge numbers, you may not want to use the Badge Reader Integration application User Badge \(sn\_badge\_user\_badge\) table to store your badge numbers. Instead, you can create an extension implementation for sn\_badge.BadgeReader that supports your data model.

Perhaps you want to customize the types of data you receive from a badge scan or how you want to parse that data. You can create an extension implementation for sn\_badge.BadgeReaderParser that supports your data model.

The following code is available for alteration using scripted extension points with the Badge Reader Integration application:
