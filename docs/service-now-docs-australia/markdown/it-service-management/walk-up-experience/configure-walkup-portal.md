# Configure the Walk-up Experience portal

Create engaging walk-up center service portals featuring your logo, portal theme, desired catalog, links to a knowledge base and social community, and more.

## Before you begin

Walk-up Experience includes a complete base-system **Walk-up Portal** with theme. The **Walk-up Portal** pages are meant to be used as built. You can create custom portal pages to meet your needs by copying the portal pages and associated widgets and making changes to the copies. You can configure both an online check-in portal and a physical check-in portal for your walk-up locations.

There are several ways to configure the Walk-up service portal:

-   **Service Portal** application: Modular user interface framework for quick and easy building and customization of application portals.
-   Service Portal Walk-up form: Requires CSS and HTML experience.

Role required: sn\_walkup.walkup\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  To configure the Walk-up service portal using the **Service Portal** application, navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Service Portal Configuration**.

2.  To customize the base-system walk-up portal with your unique branding, title, logo, theme colors, layout, properties, widgets, and more, or to create a new walk-up portal, refer to [Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ServicePortal.md) for detailed information.
