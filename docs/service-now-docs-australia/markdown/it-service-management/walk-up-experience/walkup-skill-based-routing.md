# Configure skill-based routing in Walk-up Experience

Route work items to assigned groups. Use skill-based routing to ensure that the right work goes to the right agent depending on the walk-up reasons.

Identify skills for a specific set of conditions defined for walk-up reasons. Use business rules to automatically add the skills to those types of work items. In the Walk-up Experience application, the work items get automatically assigned to the right agents based on the skills.

-   When a new walk-up interaction is opened trough the check-in portal or booking an appointment, Advanced Work Assignment routes the interactions to agents who have the skill set required to address the reason for interaction.
-   The administrators must activate **Skill determination for interaction** BR on interaction table for Advanced Work Assignment to route interactions based on the agent's skills.
-   New interactions opened after the set up are routed to the available agent with the respective skills.
-   If an agent is unavailable and the interaction does not need any mandatory skills, the walk-up task is routed based on the assignment rule associated with the location.
