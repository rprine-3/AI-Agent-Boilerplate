# Configuring Walk-up Experience

Customize your Walk-up Experience portal and configure appointments, notifications, walk-up venue locations, associated stockrooms, customer satisfaction surveys, and hours of operation to meet your required needs.

Walk-up Experience includes associated notifications to alert requesters when the location is closed or when an interaction is assigned to an agent. Pre-built customer satisfaction surveys capture user sentiment about the experience. Also included are several configurable tables for customizing your walk-up portal and service center experience. You can configure and specify the following features for your experience:

-   Configure an online check-in channel for requesters to join a walk-up queue before physically arriving at the walk-up location.
-   Access the pre-built **Walk-up online check-in Experience** widget for use in your Service Portal. Make minor label changes directly in the widget without customizing through the code.
-   Configure the physical walk-up location queue information to manage and administer the walk-up service centers.
-   Establish walk-up locations, set hours of operation, enable online check-in, determine assignment groups, associate stockrooms, as well as design the queue time display and position notification system.
-   Configure reasons for visits to a walk-up queue by location.
-   Add a logo and brand your portal and walk-up location to fit your style.
-   Access location-specific branding elements, such as logo images, for walk-up queues. These configuration options are found in the Walk-up Location Queue \[wu\_location\_queue\] table.

The following applications are included in the **Administration** module of the Walk-up Experience navigation bar:

|Application|Description|

|Portal Configurations|Create and modify custom Walk-up Experience online and on-site service portals.|
