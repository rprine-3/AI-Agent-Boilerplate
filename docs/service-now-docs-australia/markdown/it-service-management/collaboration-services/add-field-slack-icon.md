# Set up slack for a user or group

Set up slack from an incident to communicate and work together in channels with a user or a group.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

To enable slack for the **Assignment group** field, ensure you have set up a slack channel for that group.

## Procedure

1.  Download the `Fix script to add Slack field decorators` update set to get the fix scripts from ServiceNow Store app.

2.  Import the update set file.

    For more information, refer [Import an update set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/t_SaveAnUpdateSetAsAnXMLFile.md).

3.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Fix Scripts**.

4.  Open the **Add Slack Field Decorator** fix script.

5.  In the **Scripts** field, edit the script to indicate the table and the field for which you want to enable the slack communication.

    The slack icon appears next to the following fields mentioned in the script.
