# Slack slash commands

Slash commands provides a quick way to invoke your app to perform specific actions from Slack.

You need to [configure slash commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/set-up-slack.md) to execute the commands. Only a user with the sn\_incident\_write, itil or admin role can execute the commands.
