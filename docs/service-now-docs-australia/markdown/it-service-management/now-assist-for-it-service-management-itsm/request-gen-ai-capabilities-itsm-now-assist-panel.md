# Request the generative AI capabilities in ITSM by using the ServiceNow Otto panel

Use the ServiceNow Otto panel to request the contextual generative AI capabilities in IT Service Management \(ITSM\) such as a chat summary, incident summary, or incident resolution notes in a conversational manner. You can also add comments and work notes. These capabilities provide you with a quick resolution to issues.

## Before you begin

Make sure that Next Experience is enabled in the instance. For information about enabling Next Experience, see [Considerations for activating Next Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-adoption-paths.md). For information about Next Experience, see [Next Experience UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-landing-page.md).

Role required: itil

## About this task

You can access the ServiceNow Otto panel from the Core UI or Service Operations Workspace for ITSM to request generative AI capabilities for ServiceNow Otto for ITSM skills. For information about these skills, see [Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/now-assist-itsm-skills.md).

Using the ServiceNow Otto panel saves time for an agent, for example, the agent can quickly learn the details of an incident by reading the incident summarization. The summarization gives enough details about the associated interaction so that the requester doesn't have to repeat the same information to the agent. For information about the ServiceNow Otto panel, see [ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-overview.md).

For information about how to activate the ServiceNow Otto panel, see [Activate the ServiceNow Otto panel standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-now-assist-panel.md).

## Procedure

1.  Log in to an instance where ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) is installed.

2.  Request generative AI capabilities to summarize a chat for an interaction, summarize a chat for an incident that was created from an interaction, summarize an incident, or generate incident resolution notes.
