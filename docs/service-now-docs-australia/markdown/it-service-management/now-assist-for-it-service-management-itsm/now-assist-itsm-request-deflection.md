## About this task

For the incident classification flow, see [Resolve issues using in-form deflection ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/now-assist-itsm-deflection-workflow.md).

## Procedure

1.  Access the **Create New** incident form.

    1.  Navigate to the employee portal.

    2.  Search for `Create incident with ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)`.

2.  In the **Short description** field, enter a brief summary of your issue.

3.  In the **Please describe your issue below** field, describe what you need.

    Describe what you need, such as `I need a new laptop` rather than `my laptop is not working`. ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) classifies your description as a request and personalizes the recommendation based on your assigned hardware and location context.

    Selecting **Solution found** closes the form and marks the issue as resolved through deflection. No incident is created. The issue is recorded as deflected.

7.  If the recommended catalog item doesn't meet your need, provide additional details in the **Please describe your issue below** field and select **Proceed with incident creation**.

    Select **Proceed with incident creation** to create an incident record that will be assigned to an incident management team. Use this path when deflection is not applicable or when you need formal tracking and assignment.
