# Generate a knowledge article from the Service Operations Workspace for ITSM and classic environment by using ServiceNow Otto

As an agent or knowledge writer, quickly generate knowledge articles from resolved and closed incidents within the Service Operations Workspace for ITSM application and classic environment by using the ServiceNow Otto application.

## Before you begin

You can generate a knowledge article in any incident state that is set by your administrator using the **com.snc.incident.create\_knowledge.multistate.enable** system property. The incident must also not have an existing knowledge article that is associated with it.

The Knowledge generation skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. When new customers install a ServiceNow Otto product, designated skills are turned on automatically. For existing users who upgrade, there will be no change to the skill activation. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

**Important:**

-   Install the applications and plugins listed in the tables below and update them to the corresponding store app version before configuring the Knowledge Generation skill.
-   For information on the plugin version numbers that correspond to the release you’re installing, see [https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/2c09636e1be06a50a85b16db234bcb74\#versionSummary](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/2c09636e1be06a50a85b16db234bcb74#versionSummary)

-   For Knowledge Management, you must install and update the following store apps to the corresponding application version.

    |Store application name|Plugin ID|
    |----------------------|---------|
    |ServiceNow® Otto for Knowledge Management \[app-knowledge-gen-ai\]|sn\_km\_gen\_ai|
    |Knowledge Capabilities in UI Builder \[app-knowledge-uib\]|sn\_km\_uib|

-   For ITSM Service Operations Workspace, you must install and update the following store apps to the corresponding application version.

    |Application name|Plugin ID|
    |----------------|---------|
    |Service Operations Workspace ITSM Applications|sn\_sow\_itsm\_cont|
    |ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)|sn\_itsm\_gen\_ai|
    |Service Operations Workspace Core|sn\_sow|
    |Record Page for Service Operations Workspace|sn\_sow\_record|
    |Service Operations Workspace ITSM Common|sn\_sow\_itsm\_common|
    |Incident Management for Service Operations Workspace|sn\_sow\_inc|
    |Interaction Management for Service Operations Workspace|sn\_sow\_interaction|


To enable an agent to see the ServiceNow Otto experience on the Create Article page, configure the following knowledge base generation criteria:

-   Install the knowledge skills. For more information, see [Configure ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/configure-now-assist-for-itsm.md).
-   Make sure that the following criteria are in place in the AI Admin Hub console:
    -   Specify the table record and input fields.
    -   Specify the conditions for the skill availability from the list of attributes.
    -   Specify that the knowledge base generation feature for the In-product or ServiceNow Otto panel is displayed.
-   Configure the Create Article feature to apply the supported template, Incident-KCS article - HTML, or Standard article.

-   Currently, only the Create Article experience is available.

Role required: itil

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  Open an incident that is assigned to you.

    In the incident record, resolve and close the incident.

3.  Create the article by selecting the **Create knowledge** option from the UI action drop-down menu in the incident.

    \[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-knowledge-option.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow Otto in ITSM knowledge article option.

    **Note:**

    -   The **Create knowledge** UI action is only visible when an incident doesn't have an existing knowledge article that is associated with it.
    -   When the **Create knowledge** action is initiated, it gets redirected to an interceptor page. The Knowledge article interceptor page displays only when the KCS integration for incident management \(com.snc.incident.knowledge\) plugin is not installed.

        **Important:** If the KCS integration for incident management \(com.snc.incident.knowledge\) plugin is installed, then the interceptor page is skipped.

        A series of steps is then executed within the [Knowledge Management application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management.md).

        This includes determining if the following actions must be done:

        -   Display the write option using ServiceNow Otto.
        -   Present a list of similar records.
        -   Generate a submission record if the **glide.knowman.submission.workflow** property is enabled.
    -   If you encounter a duplicate **Create Knowledge** button, see the [Resolving duplicate Create Knowledge actions](https://www.servicenow.com/community/itsm-articles/issue-and-resolution-two-quot-create-knowledge-quot-actions-in/ta-p/3418702) community article for the resolution.
4.  In the Knowledge article interceptor page, select a knowledge base and an article template.

    |Knowledge article interceptor page|UI display|
    |----------------------------------|----------|
    |**In Service Operation Workspace**|\[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-kb-interceptor-sow.png"\] Alt text: The knowledge article interceptor page in Service Operations Workspace|
    |**In Core UI**|\[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-kb-interceptor-ui16.png"\] Alt text: The knowledge article interceptor page for core UI.|

5.  Select **Next**.

    **Note:** When you use the standard template, the content from the incident's **Description**, **Resolution**, and **Additional comments** fields are populated in the respective fields in the article body of the standard template.

6.  To add or update the knowledge article, follow the instructions in the table below.

    -   When creating an article using ServiceNow Otto, the process once triggered can’t be stopped. ServiceNow Otto continues to generate the article even if you close the dialog box.
    -   **Note:** You can edit a knowledge article in an incident using the **Edit knowledge article** button. This button displays under the following conditions:

-   When the incident is in resolved or closed state or for any state your system administrator has enabled the **com.snc.incident.create\_knowledge.multistate.enable** system property.
-   If you have only one article attached to the incident and you have write access to the article.
