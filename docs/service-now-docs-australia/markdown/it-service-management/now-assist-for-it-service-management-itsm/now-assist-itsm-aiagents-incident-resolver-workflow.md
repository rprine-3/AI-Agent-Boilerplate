## Link catalog items and Knowledge articles to incidents

When you make a query or a request in the Otto panel, you can get recommendations for relevant catalog items. The recommendations get automatically added to the incident's **Work notes** section. The workflow uses relevant Knowledge articles and similar incidents to get the recommended steps for incident resolution that gets added to the incident's **Work notes** section.

In the AI Agent Studio, the human agent gets notified as soon as the recommendations to resolve incidents get generated so that they can follow the on-screen instructions and complete the task. For more information, see [Request the generative AI capabilities in ITSM by using the ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/request-gen-ai-capabilities-itsm-now-assist-panel.md).

## Generating the incident resolution steps in the Otto panel

As a user, do the following in the Otto panel:

1.  Open the panel and enter the incident number for which you want to generate the incident resolution steps.

    The Investigate and Resolve ITSM incidents workflow gets triggered and the ITSM Incident Resolution Plan Investigation AI agent takes over the issue resolution.

2.  Using AI search, the AI agent retrieves the top 10 most relevant catalog items related to the incident.

    The URLs to these catalog items are added to the **Work notes** section in the incident.\[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-inv-resol-nap-cat-comment.png"\] Alt text: Now Assist for ITSM Investigate and Resolve ITSM incidents workflow catalog comments

3.  The AI agent gathers all relevant information required for the investigation.

    The retrieved data includes similar resolved incidents, relevant knowledge base articles, and other contextual information. The AI agent generates a resolution plan based on this information.

4.  The resolution plan is added to the incident's work notes.

    If the AI agent was unable to create a resolution plan, then it displays a message indicating the failure.
