# Summarize an incident when reassigning it by using ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)

Provide information about the incident when assigning it to another agent or assignment group by summarizing all actions until hand off. For example, an agent can summarize an incident when reassigning it to another agent if the incident is incorrectly assigned or needs troubleshooting by another agent or assignment group.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    A summary of the incident is generated in the **Work notes** field in the Assign dialog box.

    **Note:** If your system administrator has enabled the **glide.ui.advanced** system property and if the incident is saved without any changes to the **Assigned to** or **Assignment group** fields, the Assign dialog box isn't displayed and the incident is saved directly.

3.  Edit the **Assigned to** or **Assignment group** fields if necessary.

4.  Select **Save**.

    The generated incident summary is posted as work notes for the incident.
