# ITSM Virtual Agent pre-built LLM topics

ITSM Virtual Agent includes pre-built Large Language Model \(LLM\) topic conversations designed to help your users complete the common IT-related tasks such as checking and resetting a password.

LLMs are used to identify and trigger the action that a user wants to perform.

ITSM Virtual Agent pre-built LLM topics are read only and have **\(Template\)** as the suffix in their name. To use them, duplicate the topic in the ITSM Virtual Agent conversation scope and rename it according to your company naming conventions.

For ITSM Virtual Agent pre-built Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) topics, see [Using ITSM Virtual Agent pre-built topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/itsm-virtual-agent/using-itsm-va.md).

**Note:** All demo topics will be available with the demo data.

<table id="table_an3_5t2_4bc"><tbody><tr><td>

Check Ticket and Support Status

</td><td>

Check the status of your IT tickets and support cases.

 Once the conversation is initiated, it progresses by collecting data about the ticket one question at a time.

**Note:** For HR cases, an Admin must allow Core RCA records for Read operation and Write operation.

-   sys\_scope = Now Assist in Virtual Agent
-   target\_scope = Human Resources: Core
-   target = Table: HR Case
-   status = Allowed
-   source = Script Include: ITSMTopicsHelper

See [Requested restricted caller access \(RCA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/requested-rca.md) for more information.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Show Pending Approvals

</td><td>

Check pending approvals that are needed to take action upon and pick those to be processed.

 You can either Approve or Reject your tickets by picking the list numbers provided to you by the Virtual Agent.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>## Core ITSM topics

<table id="table_us4_xc3_nbc"><tbody><tr><td>

\(DEMO\) Check IT Ticket Status \(Template\)

</td><td>

Check the status of your IT ticket.

 Once the conversation is initiated, it progresses by collecting data about the ticket one question at a time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

\(Deprecated\) Escalate IT Ticket

</td><td>

Raise the urgency of your IT ticket for a faster resolution. Escalating a ticket priority requires choosing the incident and verifying the escalation.

 Users must provide a justification to escalate the incident. Virtual Agent escalates the incident to the next urgency level. For example, from low to medium, or from medium to high.

 If an incident is already at high-level urgency, Virtual Agent alerts the user to this and asks if the user would like to add a comment to help expedite resolution.

</td></tr><tr><td>

\(DEMO\) Open IT Ticket \(Template\)-LLM

</td><td>

Open a ticket leveraging machine-learning algorithms with application logic for predicting similar open tickets.

 Prevent users from opening duplicate incidents by finding similar incidents and asking if the user wants to add comments to the similar incident.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service Disruptions

</td><td>

Access all known outage information.

 When a user asks if a particular system is down, Virtual Agent returns a list of links displaying planned or unplanned outages and any system degradations.

 Users can click the links for more detailed information about a specific outage or degradation, as well as click **Show more** when additional outages are known.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Password reset topics

End users can initiate a password management conversation with Virtual Agent by entering the keywords `Reset`, `Change`, `Unlock`, or `Password`.

Users who aren’t logged in can perform the Reset Password and Unlock Account actions. Users who are logged in can perform the Change Password, Reset Password, and Unlock Password actions.

Requirements:

-   Password Reset \(com.glideapp.password\_reset\) plugin
-   Password Reset Virtual Agent Conversations \(com.snc.password\_reset.virtual\_agent\) plugin

**Note:** For the password reset process to be available in Virtual Agent, ensure that you selected the **Enabled on Virtual Agent** check box in the Password Reset process configuration page.
