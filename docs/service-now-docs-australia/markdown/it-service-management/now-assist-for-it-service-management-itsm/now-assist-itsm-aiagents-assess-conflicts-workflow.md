# IT Service Management AI agent collection assess conflicts for a change request agentic workflow

Use the assess conflicts for a change request agentic workflow to run conflict detection for change requests and assess conflicts, and identify affected configuration items \(CIs\) and impacted services.

## Assess conflicts for a change request agentic workflow overview

Using the assess conflicts for a change request agentic workflow, you can run conflict detection for change requests to view existing conflicts and the summary of conflict types, affected CIs, and impacted services.

The summary of each conflict type generated using the assess conflicts for a change request agentic workflow includes the following sections:

-   Affected CI
-   Conflicting change
-   Maintenance or blackout schedules

You can also use the workflow to rerun conflict detection.

**Note:** The assess conflicts for a change request agentic workflow doesn’t have a trigger and is invoked manually.

To modify the assess conflicts for a change request agentic workflow, [duplicate it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements.

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

## Assess conflicts for a change request

Autonomously assess conflicts for change requests.

**Note:** The workflow can be accessed by roles contained within the sn\_change\_write or itil roles.
