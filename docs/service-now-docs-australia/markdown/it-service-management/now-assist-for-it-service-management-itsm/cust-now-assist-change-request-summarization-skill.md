# Customize the ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) change request summarization skill

Enhance the efficiency of the change request summarization skill by customizing it with different inputs and prompts using the skill configuration guided setup.

## About this task

You can modify and edit prompts in the AI Skill Kit by selecting the **Edit prompt in AI Skill Kit** option in step 6.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

You need the sn\_skill\_builder.admin role to customize the prompt in the AI Skill Kit.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **Skills**.

2.  In the **Technology** feature group, select **ITSM** from the product list.

3.  Activate and copy the change request summarization skill for customization.

    1.  In the All available skills section, locate the skill that you would like to activate and select **Activate skill**.

        You can choose to make a copy of the skill before activating it.

    2.  Select the More actions icon \[Omitted image "more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon. for the skill in the Active skills section, and create a copy that you can customize by selecting **Make a copy**.

        A confirmation message is displayed.

    3.  Select the **Make a copy** button in the confirmation message.

        A guided setup leads you through the configuration of the general details, input, prompt, availability, display, review, and activation of the customized skill.

4.  In the General details step, fill in the fields.

    For information about the inputs and triggers for each skill, see [Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/now-assist-itsm-skills.md).

    1.  Enter a name and description for the skill.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

5.  Choose the change request input data.

    Configure the base input table and fields that are used as the source to generate a response for the input template states - Assess, Authorize &amp; Scheduled, Implement &amp; Review, Closed.

    Each skill relies on a base input table and input fields with descriptions to provide context for the Now LLM Service to generate a response.

    Select only those related tables that are offered with the base system as part of the input data.

    1.  Add base input table fields.

        The following base input fields values are available by default:

        -   Short description
        -   Description
        -   Work notes
        -   Additional comments
        -   Risk
        -   Impact
        -   Justification
        -   Implementation plan
        -   Risk and impact analysis
        -   Test plan
        -   Backout plan
        -   Close code
        -   Close notes
        -   Service offering
        -   State
        -   Conflict status
        -   Type
        You can edit or remove the Work notes, Additional comments, Risk, Impact, Justification, Implementation plan, Risk and impact analysis, Test plan, Backout plan, Close code, Close notes, Service offering, State, Conflict status, and Type fields. You can also add new fields and descriptions for them by selecting **+New base input field**.

        **Important:** If you add a new field with the same name as an existing field, the name and description of the new field will override the description of the existing field.

    2.  Add rule conditions to determine when the input template is used.

        By default, record state determines which input template the LLM uses.

    3.  Add additional input data sources.

        The data sources could include related tables, activity streams, and relationships. The Change Risk Details, Conflict, Applied Change Policy, Impacted CIs, and Affected CIs related input tables are available by default. You can edit these tables or add new related tables, activity streams, or relationships by selecting **+New data source** and then selecting the desired option.
