# IT Service Management AI agent collection Generate post incident reviews agentic workflow

Use the Post-incident review AI agent to generate a review report after a major incident is resolved. You can review and revise this report if necessary.

## Generate post incident reviews agentic workflow overview

Using the Generate post incident reviews agentic workflow, generate reports after an incident is resolved. The report includes the following sections:

-   Executive Summary
-   Customer/Service Impact
-   Detailed Technical Summary
-   Action Items &amp; Prevention

The time taken to create the report after the incident is resolved may be reduced, and the business impact may be minimized when responses to major incidents are both effective and efficient. For information on how major incidents are created, see [Major Incident Management process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/major-incident-management-process.md).

To modify the Generate post incident reviews agentic workflow, [duplicate it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements.

In the AI Agent Studio, the fulfiller receives a notification as soon as the report is generated, enabling them to follow the on-screen instructions and complete the task. For more information, see [Request the generative AI capabilities in ITSM by using the ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/request-gen-ai-capabilities-itsm-now-assist-panel.md).

## Generating the Post Incident Reviews workflow in the Otto panel

As a user, do the following in the Otto panel:

**Note:** When the **Assigned to** field is populated and the major incident is moved to the resolved state, then the workflow gets triggered through the Otto panel.

1.  To trigger the workflow manually, open the Otto panel and enter the major incident number for which you want to generate the post incident review.

    The Post-incident review AI agent validates that the incident is a major incident and that it is in resolved state. If the validation fails, the workflow requests a valid major incident number.

2.  The Post-incident review AI agent retrieves the following information from the incident:
    -   Short description and detailed description
    -   Assignment group and assigned to user
    -   Category and subcategory
    -   Service and configuration item
    -   Resolution notes and business impact
    -   Activity logs and work notes
3.  The AI agent collects the following related records:
    -   Child incident details
    -   Associated problems
    -   Change requests and caused-by change requests
    -   Incident tasks
4.  The AI agent generates the Post Incident review report that includes the following four sections:
    -   **Executive Summary:** This includes the non-technical overview such as the nature of the incident, duration, affected users, and the key highlights.
    -   **Customer / Service Impact:** This includes the scope of the impact, affected regions and services, and impact to the service availability.
    -   **Detailed Technical Summary:** This includes the technical description of failures, environmental context, root cause analysis, and the timeline of events.
    -   **Action Items &amp; Prevention:** This includes the completed and outstanding action items, root cause explanation, remediation steps, preventive measures.
5.  The AI agent displays the complete Post Incident Review report to the user and request feedback.
6.  The user provides the feedback by either approving the report or asking for revisions such as requesting for more concise, more detailed information or requests specific modifications.
