# Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)

Get a quick overview of the skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\). By configuring the inputs or triggers for a skill, you can determine how and when a skill is used.

## ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) overview

Depending on the selected skill, you can configure the inputs or triggers. These settings determine how and when a skill is used. An input identifies the data that is used for a skill, such as the table and fields that are used to generate an incident summary. A trigger initiates an action, such as when the system generates a chat summary.

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).
