# Using ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) Generative AI skills

If you have the itil role, you can summarize the chat interactions with a requester, summarize an incident, and generate resolution notes by using the ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) application. You can also understand the chat and incident context and propose resolutions more quickly to the requester.

**Note:**

-   If you want a subset of users with itil role to access the ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) skills, you can create a role or a group for those users. For more information, see [Create a new role or a group to access Now Assist skills](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2078019).
-   Some of the Now Assist for ITSM skills are now turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application.

    When new customers install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.

    **Note:** For existing users who upgrade, there will be no change to the skill activation.

    For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

-   By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use AI in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, AI only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)
