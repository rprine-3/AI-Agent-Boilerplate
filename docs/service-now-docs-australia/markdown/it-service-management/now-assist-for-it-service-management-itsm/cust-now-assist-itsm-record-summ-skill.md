# Customize a ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) Incident Summarization skill

If you have the admin role, you can customize a ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) skill so that agents can use the generative AI skills in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM and in Core UI. Use the AI Skill Kit to customize your prompts.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

You need the sn\_skill\_builder.admin role to customize the prompt in the AI Skill Kit.

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **AI Admin Hub**.

2.  Select the **AI Skills** tab.

3.  In the **Technology** feature group, select **ITSM** from the product list.

4.  Activate and copy the ServiceNow Otto for ITSM feature skill for customization.

    1.  On the feature card that is associated with the skill that you would like to activate, select **View details**.

    2.  In the All available skills section, locate the skill that you would like to activate and select **Activate skill**.

        You can choose to make a copy of the skill before activating it.

    3.  Select the more actions icon \[Omitted image "more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon. for the skill in the Active skills section, and create a copy that you can customize by selecting **Make a copy**.

        The copy that you make is listed in the Active skills section.

    4.  Select the copied skill from the Active skills section to open it.

        A guided setup leads you through the configuration of the general details, input, availability, display, review, and activation of the customized skill.

5.  In the General details step, fill in the fields.

    For information about the inputs and triggers for each skill, see [Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/now-assist-itsm-skills.md).

    1.  Enter a name and description for the skill.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

6.  Choose input data.

    The input data is read-only.

    \[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-inc-summ-choose-input.png"\] Alt text: Choose input data screen that contains the input tables and fields to define the prompt.

    The following table lists the base input table fields and descriptions, including a relevant example.

<table id="table_pxf_tq4_dhc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

</td><td>

For example, `Description`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field description

</td><td>

Description of the base input field value.

 For example, `Short description of incident, provides quick info about the issue.`

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    1.  For each input template state \(New, WIP, Resolved, and Closed\), configure the rule conditions by using the condition builder to filter the data further.

        The rule conditions determine when the input template is used. By default, the record state determines the input template that the Now LLM Service uses.

        The following table lists the input template states.

        |State|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |New|State is New.|
        |WIP|State is Work in Progress.|
        |Resolved|State is Resolved.|
        |Closed|State is Closed.|

    2.  For each input template state \(New, WIP, Resolved, and Closed\), select **+New data source** to configure the additional related table and activity stream data, as needed.

        Adding the input data sources, such as the related tables and activity streams, provide more context to the Now LLM Service in a related list.

        You can also add the rule conditions to these additional related table and activity stream data sources.

        The following table lists the data sources you can add to the input data.
