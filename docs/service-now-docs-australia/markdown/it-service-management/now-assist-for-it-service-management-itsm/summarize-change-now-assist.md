# Summarize a change request by using ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)

Quickly capture the important details of a change request, including the current status, by using the change request summarization skill in the ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil

## About this task

The Change summarization skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. When new customers install a ServiceNow Otto product, designated skills are turned on automatically. For existing users who upgrade, there will be no change to the skill activation. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

A change request summary provides you with a concise summary of a change request. The summary is based on the change request state and is generated from the information that you enter in the following fields:

-   Short description
-   Description
-   Work notes
-   Additional comments
-   Risk
-   Impact
-   Justification
-   Implementation plan
-   Risk and impact analysis
-   Test plan
-   Backout plan
-   Close code
-   Close notes
-   Service offering
-   State
-   Conflict status
-   Type

For information about the change request states, see [State progression for normal, standard, and emergency changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/normal-standard-emergency-states.md).

You can summarize a change request in Core UI and Service Operations Workspace for ITSM.
