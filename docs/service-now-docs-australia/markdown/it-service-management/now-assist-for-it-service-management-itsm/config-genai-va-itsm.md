# Configure Otto for Virtual Agent in ITSM

Enable your requesters to have a streamlined, conversational experience that is based on generative AI as they submit a catalog item request in Virtual Agent. By offering this generative AI experience, your organization can provide an additional self-service tool.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

Detect and mask sensitive data using the Sensitive Data Handler so it is not viewed by the agent or requester. For more information, see:

-   [Sensitive Data Handler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/ac-sensitive-data-overview.md)
-   [Configuring Sensitive Data Handler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/ac-configure-sensitive-data-handling.md)

## About this task

The generative AI capabilities can provide a human-like catalog request experience over the Virtual Agent conversational interface. By using the generative AI capabilities with Virtual Agent, your organization can provide a conversational experience for request submissions.

Drive productivity by providing a virtual agent on familiar channels, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Copilot.

When you configure generative AI for catalog item request submissions, your requesters get the following experience:

-   Contextual question prompts that enable a more human-like conversation that is based on answers to previous questions.
-   Slot filling that recognizes the answers to one or more questions on the requester's input.
-   Ability to answer catalog item questions.
-   Ability to exit the request submission process at any point.

Although the following catalog item question types are supported in the conversation mode, natural language responses aren't supported for them:

-   Reference
-   Lookup select box
-   Lookup multiple choice
-   Requested For
-   Attachment
-   Multiple choice question with more than 10 choices
