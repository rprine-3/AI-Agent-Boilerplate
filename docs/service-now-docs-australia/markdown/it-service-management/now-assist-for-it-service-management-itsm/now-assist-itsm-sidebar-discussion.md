## About this task

You can do these actions by using the Sidebar discussion summarization skill:

-   Summarize the Sidebar discussion at any point during the discussion.
-   Share the Sidebar discussion to the work notes.
-   Provide feedback for the summary.

**Note:** The Sidebar discussion summarization skill is on the Chat skill card in the Technology group.

You can use Sidebar discussion summarization for any task table that you have enabled Sidebar on.

Summarizing Sidebar chats integrated with Microsoft Teams is supported. For more information, see [Sidebar and Microsoft Teams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/sidebar-teams-overview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** and open an incident that supports Sidebar discussion and summarization.

2.  Choose an existing discussion, or start a new discussion.

3.  Generate a summary of the Sidebar discussion during the conversation either by either entering `/Summarize` in the Active Sidebar discussion window, or by selecting the quick action icon \[Omitted image "now-assist-sidebar-lightning-bolt-icon.png"\] Alt text: Quick action icon. and selecting **Summarize**.

    \[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-sidebar-discuss.png"\] Alt text: Sidebar discussion summarization.

    The Sidebar discussion summary appears in the Discussion that is summarized by the ServiceNow Otto modal.

4.  Add the summary to the incident work notes, and provide feedback about it.

If you'd like to provide feedback, select either the helpful icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-helpful.png"\] Alt text: Helpful icon.\), or the not helpful icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-not-helpful.png"\] Alt text: Not helpful icon.\)

 This feedback improves the generative AI model and can help to improve future versions of this skill.

 The system gathers the feedback on each generated summary and stores it in the generative AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).
