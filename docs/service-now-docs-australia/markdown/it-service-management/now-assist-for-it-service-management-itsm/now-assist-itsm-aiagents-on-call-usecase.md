# IT Service Management AI agent collection Who is On Call agentic workflow

Use the Who is On Call agentic workflow to retrieve on-call roster information for specific shifts, groups, or time periods. The agent provides accurate information to conversationally understand who is on-call.

## Who is On Call agentic workflow overview

Using the Who is On Call agentic workflow, retrieve on-call roster information to determine who is currently assigned to on-call duties. The agent performs the following tasks:

-   Retrieves on-call member information with contact details
-   Supports date-range queries with automatic fallback mechanisms

The Who is On Call agent streamlines on-call roster queries by providing accurate, timezone-aware responses. This reduces manual lookups and ensures the correct on-call personnel are identified even across multiple shifts and groups.
