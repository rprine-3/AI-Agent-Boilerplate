# Change CI suggestion AI agent \(latest\)

This AI agent autonomously identifies and populates both the primary configuration item \(CI\) and affected configuration items on a change request without requiring multiple user interactions.

**Note:** Available starting with the Australia Patch 5 release. Requires ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) v17.1.2 or later.

## Workflow

1.  Get the current Change Request number from the active change record or from the use input.
2.  Retrieve the change request context from its field values.
3.  Analyze the change details to identify the Primary CI and Affected CI candidates.
4.  Present the candidate CIs list to user for identifying a suitable Primary CI or Affected CIs.
5.  Automatically update the change request record with the user-selected primary CI and affected CIs.
