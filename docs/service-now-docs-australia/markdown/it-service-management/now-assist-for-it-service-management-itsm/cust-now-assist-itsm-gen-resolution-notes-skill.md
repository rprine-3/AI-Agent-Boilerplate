# Customize a ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) resolution notes generation skill

If you have the admin role, you can customize a ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) skill so that agents can use the generative AI skills in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM and in Core UI.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

## About this task

From the AI Admin Hub console, you can select the input tables, related lists, and fields for each input template of the incident summarization skill.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **ServiceNow Otto Admin**.

2.  Select the **AI Skills** tab.

3.  In the **Technology** feature group, select **ITSM** from the product list.

4.  Activate and copy the ServiceNow Otto for ITSM feature skill for customization.

    1.  On the feature card that is associated with the skill that you would like to activate, select **View details**.

    2.  In the All available skills section, locate the skill that you would like to activate and select **Activate skill**.

        You can choose to make a copy of the skill before activating it.

    3.  Select the more actions icon \[Omitted image "more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon. for the skill in the Active skills section, and create a copy that you can customize by selecting **Make a copy**.

        The copy that you make is listed in the Active skills section.

        **Note:** You can only duplicate a summarization skill or the Change risk explanation skill. The fields for the skills that you can’t duplicate have read-only values.

    4.  Select the copied skill from the Active skills section to open it.

        A guided setup leads you through the configuration of the general details, input, availability, display, review, and activation of the customized skill.

5.  In the General details step, fill in the fields.

    For information about the inputs and triggers for each skill, see [Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/now-assist-itsm-skills.md).

    1.  Enter a name and description for the skill.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

6.  Choose input data.

    Configure the base input table fields and related lists for the different input templates \(New, WIP, Resolved, and Closed states\) for the skill.

    Each skill relies on a base input table and input fields with descriptions to provide context for the Now LLM Service to generate a response.

    Select only those related tables that are offered with the base system as part of the input data.

    1.  For each input template state \(New, WIP, Resolved, and Closed\), select **+New related table field** and configure the base input table fields.

        Add multiple base input fields if more inputs are needed.

        \[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-input1.png"\] Alt text: Choose input data screen that contains the input tables and fields to define the prompt.

        The following table lists the base input table fields and descriptions, including a relevant example.

<table id="table_c53_vp5_dbc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Base input field

</td><td>

Field in the Incident table whose value this skill uses in its response.

 For example, `Short description`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field description

</td><td>

Description of the base input field value.

 For example, `Short description of incident, provides quick info about the issue.`

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    2.  For each input template state \(New, WIP, Resolved, and Closed\), configure the rule conditions by using the condition builder to filter the data further.

        The rule conditions determine when the input template is used. By default, the record state determines the input template that the Now LLM Service uses.

        You can build the condition out further by selecting **+New condition** and configuring additional parameters.

        The following table lists the input template states.

        |State|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |New|State is New.|
        |WIP|State is Work in Progress.|
        |Resolved|State is Resolved.|
        |Closed|State is Closed.|

    3.  For each input template state \(New, WIP, Resolved, and Closed\), select **+New data source** to configure the additional related table and activity stream data, as needed.

        Adding the input data sources, such as the related tables and activity streams, provide more context to the Now LLM Service in a related list.

        You can also add the rule conditions to these additional related table and activity stream data sources.

        \[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-input2.png"\] Alt text: Choose additional input data screen that contains the input tables and fields to define the prompt.

        The following table lists the data sources you can add to the input data.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    4.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

    5.  Handling custom state choices for the Change request summarization skill.

        **Note:** When you add a new state or modify an existing state in a Change request record, you must add the GenAI Summary Card to the Change Overview Container record to display the **Summarize** button.

        To add the GenAI Summary Card:

        1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Workspace Configuration** &gt; **Overview Container.**

            Make sure the application scope is set to **Change Management for Service Operations Workspace**.

        2.  In the Change Overview Containers list, select the state that you've added or modified.
        3.  Add the GenAI Summary Card to the Change Overview Cards related list.

        For more information, see the KB article on [Handling custom state choices for the Change request summarization skill](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2027162).

7.  Trigger frequency

    Refreshes the sentiments for all updated incidents. You can set the trigger frequency for the refresh using the **Sentiment Analysis Scheduled Job \(Incident\)** scheduled job.

8.  Cluster incidents

    If you’re using the Suggested steps generation skill, select **Launch clustering** in the **Record clustering** screen to group records based on similar past closed incidents.

    **Note:**

    -   You should have at least 2000 records for successful clustering. If you get an error that there aren’t enough records to cluster, broaden your filter criteria. You can perform this action by setting the rule conditions to include more records or add more data.
    -   For information on troubleshooting steps to resolve issues with the Suggested steps generation skill, see [Troubleshoot Suggested steps generation skill set up](https://www.servicenow.com/community/itsm-articles/troubleshooting-steps-for-now-assist-for-itsm-suggested-steps/ta-p/3256267).
    To broaden the criteria:

    1.  In the **Choose input** screen, select **Edit conditions**.\[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-suggested-steps-edit-conditions.png"\] Alt text: Suggested steps edit conditions screen

        Select **Switch scope** if you’re unable to edit the conditions.

    2.  Change the conditions as needed and select **Set**.

        The updates you make are displayed in the **GAF Suggested Steps ITSM grouping** in AI Skill Config record.

9.  Customize the prompt.

    Review and test the prompt for each input template configuration. You can edit the prompt by adding new predefined sections and ordering the sections as needed.

    1.  For each input template state \(New, WIP, Resolved, and Closed\), select the prompt sections from the list of available sections to include in the generated summary.

        To add a section, you must configure the relevant input data in the Choose input data step before you do this step.

        The available prompt sections that you can select:

        -   **Issue**
        -   **Key Actions Taken**
        -   **Resolution**
        -   **Service Level Agreement**
        -   **Affected CIs and Impacted Services**
        -   **Child Incidents**

            **Note:** When there are too many child incidents and the size of the data goes beyond the LLM token limit, the child incidents section shows the "Too much information and cannot be shown" message.

        The following table lists the mandatory prompt headers.
