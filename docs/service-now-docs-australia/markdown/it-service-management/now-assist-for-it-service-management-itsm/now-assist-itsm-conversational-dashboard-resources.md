# ITSM Virtual Agent resources analytics

Track knowledge base articles and catalog items referenced in the ITSM Virtual Agent interactions to identify which resources support successful incident deflections instead of being transferred to a live agent for resolution.

Using the **Resources** tab, you can monitor the knowledge base articles and catalog items that ITSM Virtual Agent interactions reference. It provides visibility into the resource usage by tracking which knowledge articles or catalog items support successful interactions and which ones are associated with transferring the incident resolution to a live agent. These insights help evaluate the effectiveness of the knowledge and catalog content for each interaction and identify opportunities to improve self-service capabilities.

With standardized deflection metrics, users can:

-   Understand adoption and usage trends.
-   Quantify deflection vs. live-agent transfer rates.
-   Identify which knowledge articles and catalog items enable successful self-service.
-   Pinpoint optimization opportunities.
-   Enable consistent ROI measurement and data-driven improvements across departments.

## Track metrics for the Resources tab

Review the resource usage when the ITSM Virtual Agent deflected interactions and resolved them without requiring a transfer to a live agent.

Track which knowledge base articles or catalog items the ITSM Virtual Agent referenced when resolving interactions without transferring to a live agent, and which ones were not successful in preventing that transfer.

## Resources tab—Resources for successful deflections

\[Omitted image "now-assist-itsm-va-dashboard-successful-knowledge-articles.png"\] Alt text: Bar chart showing top knowledge articles referenced in successful deflections with corresponding data table previous.

|Widget|Descriptions|
|------|------------|
|Top 10 knowledge articles referenced in successful deflections|A bar chart showing the knowledge base articles most frequently referenced in chats that the ITSM Virtual Agent resolved. Use this visualization to quickly identify the highest-impact articles supporting self-service resolution.|
|All knowledge articles referenced in successful deflections|A table listing all knowledge base articles referenced in chats that the ITSM Virtual Agent resolved, along with the number of times each article was referenced. Use this data to assess the breadth of knowledge coverage where self-service was effective.|
