# Insights and Opportunities for Incident dashboard reference

Reference information for the widgets on the Insights and Opportunities for Incident dashboard, including descriptions of each indicator and the data it presents.

## KPI widgets

Use this widget to understand overall support demand and identify significant changes in incident intake.|
|SLA status|A bar chart showing the number of incidents that are on track vs. breached against their SLA targets. Use this widget to quickly assess service delivery compliance and identify whether SLA breach rates require attention.|
|Incident sentiment trend|A line chart showing the AI-inferred sentiment score of incident interactions over time. Scores range from negative to positive, reflecting the overall tone and quality of incident interactions. Use this widget to track whether sentiment is improving or declining across the selected period.|

## Incident trends

|Widget|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Incident trends|A sortable table listing incident trend categories, clustered by recurring themes, and ranked by total incident count. Use this table to identify recurring issues that may benefit from problem management, knowledge articles, or automation. Select a row in the table to open the trend category view.|

## Distribution widgets

|Widget|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Top departments|A horizontal bar chart showing the departments with the highest incident volume. Use this widget to understand which parts of the organization are generating the most support demand and to align staffing or self-service capabilities accordingly.|
|Geographic distribution of incidents|A world map visualization showing the geographic distribution of incidents by location. Use this widget to identify regional support patterns, plan coverage, and verify resources are aligned with demand across locations.|

Use this table to identify which CI types are most frequently involved in incidents and to focus asset management or change efforts accordingly.|
