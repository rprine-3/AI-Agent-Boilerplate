## Managing IT-related issues using Voice AI agents

Using the ServiceNow Otto for ITSM Voice AI agents, you can do the following:

-   Create incidents and manage tickets using voice calls.
-   Use generic queries such as, "Is there an update to my ticket from yesterday?" or "What's the status of my VPN ticket?" and get responses in the context of your questions.
-   Escalate a ticket to a higher priority or add a comment to the ticket.

To modify the Voice AI agents, duplicate it, and adjust the settings according to your requirements.

**Important:**

-   When you modify an AI agent, or a tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.
-   In the Define availability screen for the AI agent, make sure that the **Status** field is enabled to activate the AI agent.

**Note:** The Voice AI agents are installed with the IT Service Management AI voice agent collection application \(sn\_itsm\_voice\_aia\).
