# Define event mappings for Work scheduler

Add event mappings required for card interactions and for the card properties transformation to the page configurations in Work scheduler.

## Before you begin

It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
