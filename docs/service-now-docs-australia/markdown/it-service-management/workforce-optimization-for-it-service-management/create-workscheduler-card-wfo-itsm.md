# Create a Work scheduler card using the Next Experience UI Builder

Create a work scheduler card and add the components that you want to display based on your needs in the Work Scheduler application in manager workspace.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: workspace\_admin or ui\_builder\_admin​

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  In the **My experiences** list, select **Manager Workspace**.

3.  Select the Pages icon.

4.  In the **Page** menu, select **Work scheduler**.

5.  In the left pane, go to the **Content** section and navigate to **Body \(Flex\)** &gt; **Work queue \(Flex\)** &gt; **Sidebar**.

6.  In the right pane, select the icon \(\[Omitted image "edit-card-icon.png"\] Alt text: Edit card icon\) in the **Work item cards default** sub-page.

7.  In the left pane, select **Body \(Flex\)** &gt; **Viewport1**.

8.  In the right pane, select **+Add** and enter a name for the card.

    The **Path** field is automatically populated.

    A new card is created.

    **Important:** After you create the work scheduler card, you must select the name of this card in the **UX app route** field in the work configuration you have created.
