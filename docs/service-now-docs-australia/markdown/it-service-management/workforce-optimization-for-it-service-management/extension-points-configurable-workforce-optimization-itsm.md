# Event type extension points in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Use extension points to call scripts for event categories such as a meeting, time off, or work time.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Creating custom event types using extension points

When you create extension points for custom events, consider the following:

-   Which users can create an event?
-   Does the event have to go through an approval process?
-   Is it a work-type or a non-work type event?

Here are some examples that provide guidance on some of the considerations you may want to take into account when you create a new custom event using extension points:

-   When you create an event for monthly staff meetings, take the following into consideration:
    -   Only managers can create this type of event.
    -   This is a non-work type event.
    -   The event does not have to go through an approval process.
-   When you create an event for time-off requests, take the following into consideration:
    -   Any employee can create this event.
    -   The is a non-work type event.
    -   The event has to go through a manager approval process.

To see a list of extension points that you can use for Workforce Optimization for ITSM, navigate to **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**. In the Extension Points list, open the sn\_shift\_planning.EventManager extension point.

Use scripted extension points to integrate customizations without altering the core components in the application code. When customizing a base application, you implement the scripted extension points by creating the custom script includes and registering them against the scripted extension points.

|Extension point name|Description|
|--------------------|-----------|
|sn\_shift\_planning.EventManager|Implement this extension point to customize the logic for the event categories that you create.|

You can use extension points to create events such as meeting, training, and time-off requests. For example extension point implementations, see the following extension instances in the Implementations related list:

|Category|Extension script|
|--------|----------------|
|Meeting|AgentScheduleMeetingEventManager|
|Break|AgentScheduleBreakEventManager|
|Training|AgentScheduleTrainingEventManager|
|Time off|AgentScheduleTimeOffEventManager|
|Work|AgentScheduleWorkEventManager|
