# Domain separation and Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Domain separation is supported in Workforce Optimization for ITSM. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Support level: Basic



-   Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
-   The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider \(SP\) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).
