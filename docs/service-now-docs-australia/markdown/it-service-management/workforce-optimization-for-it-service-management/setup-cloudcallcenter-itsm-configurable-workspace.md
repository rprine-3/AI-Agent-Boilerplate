# Associate Amazon Connect queues for ITSM to a ServiceNow instance

Set up phone queues for Amazon Connect to gain visibility into the queues using Workforce Optimization for ITSM.

## Before you begin

Enable the Advanced Work Assignment plugin \(com.glide.awa\) to create the Amazon Connect queues. You must activate this plugin before you activate the Cloud Call Center Core \(sn\_cti\_core\) plugin so that you can successfully integrate the two applications.

After you [install the Cloud Call Center applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/install-ccc-apps.md), when you enable the Advanced Work Assignment plugin \(com.glide.awa\), the Amazon Connect \(phone\) service channel appears in the Workforce Optimization for ITSM.

Role required: sn\_wfo\_cfg\_ws.admin or sn\_cti\_amzn\_cct.admin

## About this task

After an agent completes a call using Workforce Optimization for ITSM, you can learn:

-   Who was on hold and how long they were on hold
-   How long the calls are taking
-   Which agents are available and when they're available
-   How many agents are available and what is their current utilization

You can see the following queues when you install the demo data with the sample contact flow:

|Calls get routed to this queue|When|
|------------------------------|----|
|Basic Queue|An utterance is generic, such as, "Let me talk to an agent."|
|VIP Queue|A user who has the VIP field enabled calls Support.|
|IT Equipment Support|An utterance includes IT equipment support or hardware issues.|
|Application Support|An utterance includes application support.|

A routing profile links queues to agents. Every agent must have a routing profile in the Amazon Connect instance that is integrated with the ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [create a routing profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/routing-profiles.html).

**Note:**

-   You can associate each profile with multiple Amazon Connect queues.
-   You must associate each of these queues in your Amazon Connect instance with the corresponding queue in your ServiceNow instance using an Amazon Connect ARN number. This association enables you to report on queue statistics and call metrics within Workforce Optimization for ITSM.

## Procedure

1.  Create placeholder queues for an Amazon Connect \(phone\) service channel if you need additional queues.

    For more information on creating a queue, see [Create a work item queue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-create-queue.md).

    **Note:** Do not add work item routing conditions when you create placeholder queues.

2.  Associate the ServiceNow Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) queue record with the Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) queue ARN.

    1.  In the Amazon Connect instance, navigate to **Routing** &gt; **Queues**.
    2.  Select a queue.
    3.  Copy the ARN for the queue.
    4.  In the ServiceNow instance, navigate to **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Queues** and select the corresponding queue.
    5.  In the **Cloud Call Center Source ID** field, enter the ARN number.
    6.  Click **Update**.
    7.  Repeat these steps for each queue.
3.  Add assignment groups to a queue.

    1.  Select a work item queue.
    2.  Click the Group Queue Priorities related list.

        **Note:** You may have to configure the form to display this related list.

    3.  Click **New**.
    4.  In the **Group** field, add an assignment group that include agents who can handle this queue.
    5.  In the **Order** field, select the order number for the assignment group that shows the priority in which incoming calls are handled.
    6.  Click **Submit**.
