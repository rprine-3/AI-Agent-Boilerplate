# Using extension points to include access for specific groups in Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace

Use scripted extension points to add access for managers to view assignment groups data other than the default groups that they manage in Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To see a list of extension points that you can use for Workforce Optimization for ITSM, navigate to **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**. In the Extension Points list, open the sn\_wfo\_common.ApplicableGroupsDefinitionManager extension point.

Use scripted extension points to integrate customizations without altering the core components in the application code. When customizing a base application, you implement the scripted extension points by creating the custom script includes and registering them against the scripted extension points.

|--------------------|-----------|
|sn\_wfo\_common.ApplicableGroupsDefinitionManager|Implement this extension point to customize the logic to include access for managers to see assignment groups other than the default groups that they manage in the Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace.|
