# Using Voice with Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Use Voice to deflect incidents away from your human agents using bots. You can record phone interactions when agents resolve issues. Also, you can monitor those interactions to evaluate and improve the quality of incident resolutions.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

This video provides an overview of the Voice application:

With the Voice application, you can:

-   Enable your workforce to use the voice channel and get call recordings, call transcripts, and reports of sentiment analysis when agents interact with callers. You can visualize all of this information within the Channels application in Workforce Optimization for ITSM.
-   Analyze the call transcripts and sentiments of users after an interaction is complete so that you can create assessments and provide feedback and training for agents.
-   Synchronize agent presence within the queue.

**Note:** You can integrate any third-party telephony service with the [ServiceNow Voice Center application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cloud-call-center-overview.md). By default, the Voice provides you with the ability to integrate with the Amazon Connect application.

You can visualize the metrics from the Amazon Connect phone queues that are routed through Voice using the Channels application in Workforce Optimization for ITSM.The Voice application uses [Advanced Work Assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-overview.md) to report data from the Amazon Connect queues.
