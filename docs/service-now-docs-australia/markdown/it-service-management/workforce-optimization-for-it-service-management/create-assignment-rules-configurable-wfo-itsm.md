# Create assignment rules and groups

Define agent assignment rules and specify groups of agents who are eligible to receive overflow work assignments for a queue.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

You must first create a new assignment rule before you create a service channel. For more information, see [create a service channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-create-service-channel.md). Use [Exploring Advanced Work Assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-overview.md) \(AWA\) to route work items automatically to agents based on an agent's availability, capacity, and skills.
