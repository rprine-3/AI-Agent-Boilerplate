# Configure KPIs for service channels

Configure key performance indicators in service channels to track the ongoing work and real-time performance of your teams.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_channel\_mgmt.admin

## About this task

Add the [Channel Management reports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configurable-wfo-itsm-channel-management-reference.md) that are by default configured with Workforce Optimization for ITSM or create a new KPI report that matters the most to you. Key performance indicators help managers perform the following actions:

-   Review real-time performance as the team is actively working on tasks across channels and queues.​
-   Track progress against KPIs and drill down into agents, team, and individual performance.​
-   Drill down into all queues and monitor ongoing incidents, interactions, and tasks.
-   Jump in and support agents for help-requested work items using chat whisper or add work notes to a task.​
-   Refine data in the dashboard using the Assignment Group interactive filter without modifying the reports. For more information, see [Interactive Filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_HomepagePublishers.md).

**Enable or disable KPI score auto-refresh**

-   By default, the KPI scores are set for auto-refresh every five seconds. You can change the interval using the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.kpi\_auto\_refresh.interval.seconds** system property.
-   To disable auto-refresh, set the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.channels\_card\_auto\_refresh.enable** property to **false**.

**Refresh the service channel cards automatically or manually**

-   By default, the service channel cards are set for auto-refresh every two minutes. You can change the interval using the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.channel\_card\_auto\_refresh.interval.seconds** syetem property.
-   To manually refresh the service channel cards, select the refresh icon.
