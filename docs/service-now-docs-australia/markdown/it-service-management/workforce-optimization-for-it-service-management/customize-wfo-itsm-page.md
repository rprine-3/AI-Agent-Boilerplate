# Customize a Workforce Optimization for ITSM page using the Next Experience UI Builder

Clone an existing Workforce Optimization for ITSM page and customize it based on your needs using the Next Experience UI Builder.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: workspace\_admin or ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

All Workforce Optimization for ITSM Next Experience UI Builder pages and page variants are read-only. You can copy a page variant and then customize it. You can create a page variant from scratch or use a page template. For more information, see [Create a variant of a page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/create-variant.md).

**Note:** After you copy and customize a page variant, any automatic updates applied to the original read-only page variant will not be applied to the page variant that you have customized.
