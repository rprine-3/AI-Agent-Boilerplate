# Exclude access for specific groups in Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace

You can remove access to assignment group data and display only the assignment groups that are relevant for the logged-in user in the Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for ITSM** &gt; **Manager Workspace Configuration** &gt; **Group Exclusions**.

2.  On the **Groups not included in WFO** form, select **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a meaningful name for one or more groups you want to exclude from displaying in the Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace.

4.  Set the filter conditions to exclude the groups.

    For example, if you define a condition as **\[Name\]** **\[does not contain\]****\[Support\]**, then the Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace doesn't display any groups that contain Support in the group name.

    For information on configuring condition builders, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).

5.  Select **Submit**.
