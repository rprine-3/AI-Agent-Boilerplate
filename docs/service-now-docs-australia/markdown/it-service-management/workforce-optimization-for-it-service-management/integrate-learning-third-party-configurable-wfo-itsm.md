# Integrate Coaching with Learning with third-party learning management systems

Connect your ServiceNow instance with third-party learning sites to pull learning content into your repository.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

**Important:** Coaching with Learning application is available from the ServiceNow® Store. To enable this application, see [Activate Workforce Optimization for ITSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/activate-configurable-workforce-optimization-itsm.md).

Role required: learning\_admin

## About this task

**Applications to integrate third-party learning sites**

Activating the Coaching with Learning \(sn\_coach\_lrn\) plugin enables the following applications from the ServiceNow Store:

-   [Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-integrations-framework.md)
-   Cornerstone spoke
-   Pluralsight spoke
-   Udemy spoke
-   ServiceNow University spoke. For more information on the ServiceNow University spoke, [ServiceNow University Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/now-learning-spoke.md).

For information on integrating with third-party learning sources, see [Integrating Learning Core with third-party learning management systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/setup-learning-third-party-1.md).

## Procedure

1.  Create the integration source for each of your third-party systems.

    **Note:** Cornerstone, Pluralsight, Udemy, ServiceNow University integrations are available by default.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    The records from the third-party content are pulled into your ServiceNow instance using and API call. To successfully run this API call, you must do the following:

    1.  In the application navigator, enter `sys_properties.list` and press **Enter**.
    2.  For each of the following properties, set the value to **1638400**:
        -   com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length
        -   com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.serialized.val\_size\_limit
    For more information on these system properties, see [Coaching With Learning System Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configurable-wfo-itsm-coaching-reference.md).

3.  Activate schedule flows to integrate third-party learning content.

    1.  Navigate to **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Designer**
    2.  In the **Flows** section, select each of the following flows and click **Activate**:
        -   Trigger Cornerstone Learning Sync
        -   Trigger Pluralsight Learning Sync
        -   Trigger Udemy Learning Sync
        -   Trigger ServiceNow University Sync
    3.  Navigate to **Learning** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Learning System Configuration**
    4.  Select each of the third-party learning sources and set the **Active** field to **true**.
    Schedule flows automatically run on a scheduled basis to synchronize third-party learning content into your ServiceNow instance.

4.  After you [configure the third-party integration sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/integration-source-coaching-with-learning-coaching-wfo-itsm.md) you can refresh the entire third-party content or synchronize new and updated services into your ServiceNow instance.

    -   To refresh the entire content, set the **full\_pull** property to **true**.

        **Note:** We recommend that you periodically refresh the entire content.

    -   To synchronize new and updated services, set the **full\_pull** property to **false**.
    1.  Open any integration source for which you want to pull content.
    2.  Click **Run Job**.
    The integration framework pulls the corresponding third-party learning courses into the Learning External Content \[sn\_lc\_external\_content\] table on your ServiceNow instance.

    When synchronizing new and updated services, the content is populated as described in the table below.

<table id="table_h4y_4lj_ppb"><thead><tr><th>

When you integrate Coaching with Learning with third-party learning management systems, the source record for Cornerstone OnDemand, Pluralsight, Udemy, and ServiceNow University applications are automatically created in the Enterprise Service Management Integrations Framework. These source records contain a predefined set of properties and integration services.
