# Configure supervisor lists for service channels

Configure supervisor lists in a service channel to view the list of active work items across service channels and queues.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_channel\_mgmt.admin

## About this task

A database view that defines table joins is used for generating reports for a supervisor list. For example, you can create a database view that can join the Incident table to the Interaction and Metric tables. When you use this database view, and create a supervisor list to report on the active work items, you may include fields from any of these three tables. For more information, see [Working with database views for reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DatabaseViews.md).

**Note:** You can configure three supervisor lists for each service channel. The first three lists with the lowest order number appear in Channel Management.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for ITSM** &gt; **Channel Management** &gt; **Service Channels**.

2.  Select the service channel to which you want to add a supervisor list.

3.  Click the **Supervisor Lists** tab.

    **Note:** If you do not see the **Supervisor Lists** tab, you must [configure the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md) and the Reports related list.

4.  Click **New**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields:

<table id="table_u41_bmm_1fb"><thead><tr><th>
