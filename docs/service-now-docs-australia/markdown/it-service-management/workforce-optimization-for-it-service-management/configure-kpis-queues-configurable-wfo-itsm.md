# Configure KPIs for queues

Configure key performance indicators in queues to track the incoming work for specific categories of work in a service channel.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_channel\_mgmt.admin

3.  Click **Edit**.

4.  Add Workforce Optimization for ITSM KPIs \(reports\) that are filtered based on **My Managed Groups**.

    To create reports that explicitly apply to your managed teams, refer to [Create a report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_SingleScoreCharts.md).

5.  Click **Submit**.

    The key performance indicators are added to the queue and appear in the **All Queues** tab in Manager Workspace. By default, the indicators get automatically refreshed at an interval of five seconds. You can add the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.kpi\_auto\_refresh.interval.seconds** property to the system properties to modify the interval time.
