# Add events to the team calendar

Create a meeting, training, time-off request, a custom event, or an adhoc work shift from the team calendar.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.admin

**Note:** In the team calendar, when you select an event for a team member and delete it, the event is also deleted for other participants in the event.
