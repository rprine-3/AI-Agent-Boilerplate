# Setting up Channels in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Set up service channels, queues, and key performance indicators \(KPIs\) to route work items automatically to agents based on an agent's availability, capacity, and skills.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

With Workforce Optimization for ITSM:

-   As a channel administrator, you can set up service channels and work item queues and then automatically route incoming work to agents. You can also configure real-time refresh intervals for the metrics and lists so that managers can always see the latest information about their teams.
-   As a manager, you can view the real-time operational metrics for the work that is being done by your teams and the specific items that your teams are working on.

**Note:** As an administrator, you can configure filters to refine the search and view targeted results. Filters are persisted across all channel management pages in the session. To view a list of the default interactive filters and the KPI reports for channels, queues, agents, and groups that you can map to the interactive filters, see [the filter configuration tables for Channels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configure-filter-configurable-manager-workspace.md). By default, the assignment group filter is applied to all lists and groups that you manage. You can disable interactive filters by using the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.filter\_config.enable** property.
