# Workforce Optimization for ITSM components

The Workforce Optimization for ITSM application has tables to store user and application data or database views and a schedule job to collect data for indicators.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
