# Automatically add skills to incidents or interactions in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Define conditions for incidents or interactions and add skills required for those conditions using skill determination rules. When new incidents and interactions that are created meet these conditions, the skill determination business rule automatically adds the skills to those records. In the Workforce Optimization for ITSM Channels and Work scheduler applications, the work items get automatically assigned to the right agents based on the skills.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## About this task

The following business rules are used in Workforce Optimization for ITSM skill determination:

-   **Skill determination for incident** evaluates new incidents for the conditions defined in the skill determination rules set for all incidents and adds those skills to the incident records.
-   **Skill determination for interaction** evaluates new interactions for the conditions defined in the skill determination rules set for all interactions and adds those skills to the interaction records.

The table below shows the skill determination rules available for Workforce Optimization for ITSM.
