# Track and manage your teams' schedule

Create, update, or monitor your teams' schedule from one location. You can approve or reject requests for swapping shifts or time off for agents within your assignment group.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.admin

## About this task

Using the team calendar, you can access the list of all of your agents by assignment group. When you select a shift for an agent, you can see the agent's work schedule including the break time. You can also view the number of agents that are scheduled at every time interval for each group.

## Procedure

1.  Modify an agent's shift.

    The schedule that includes this shift must be in **Preview** or **Published** state.

    1.  Navigate to **Workforce Optimization for ITSM** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.
    2.  Click the Schedule icon \(\[Omitted image "schedule-icon.png"\] Alt text: Schedule icon\).
    3.  In the **Team Calendar** tab, navigate and point to the shift for the agent that you want to modify the schedule for.
    4.  In the shift pop-up window, click the Edit icon \(\[Omitted image "edit-icon.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon\).
    5.  Modify the agent's shift as desired.

        **Note:** If the existing shift has a break, you can add more breaks to the shift.

    6.  Click **Save**.
2.  Approve or reject an agent's time off or shift-swap with another agent.

    **Note:** You must approve a request two days before the time-off or shift-swap start date. If not, the approval will be auto-rejected. An administrator can change this default setting. For more information, see **Setting the due date for time-off and shift-swap request approvals** in [Scheduling in Workforce Optimization for ITSM in configurable workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configurable-wfo-itsm-scheduling-reference.md).

    1.  Click **Approvals**. You can view all agent requests in your queue and the details for each request. You can use the **Compose** field to communicate with the agent.
    2.  Select a request that you want to approve or reject and do one of the following:
        -   To approve a request, click **Approve**.
        -   To reject a request, click **Reject**.
    If you approve the request, the schedule gets updated in the team calendar based on the approvals.
