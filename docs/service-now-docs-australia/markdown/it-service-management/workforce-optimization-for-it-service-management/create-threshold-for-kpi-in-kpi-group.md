# Create a threshold for each KPI in a KPI group

Create a threshold for each KPI in a KPI group to monitor the indicator status and analyze your team’s performance. Define the threshold with upper- and lower-limit values to assess team performance for each indicator.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_team\_perf.team\_performance\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for ITSM** &gt; **Team Performance** &gt; **KPI Groups**.

2.  Open any KPI group for which you want to create a KPI threshold, for example, IT Service.

3.  Open any KPI, for example, Closed incidents.

4.  Select the **KPI Thresholds** tab.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ydz_ncc_gxb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

KPI

</td><td>

Name of the KPI that you selected. This field is auto-filled.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Lower Threshold

</td><td>

Lower limit defined for this KPI.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Upper Threshold

</td><td>

Upper limit defined for this KPI.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

The status for the defined threshold: Critical, Positive, or Warning.

 **Note:** The corresponding icon for each status is displayed in the Workforce Optimization workspace when the **Show Icon** check box is enabled for the status. This option is enabled by default for the critical status.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

A number for the defined threshold limits. This number must be unique for each set of limits.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Show Icon

</td><td>

Corresponding icon for each status. The icons are displayed only on the Manager Workspace when the **Show Icon** check box is selected.

 The parent KPI related to the KPI group shows the icons based on a threshold in the grid component, if applicable.

 Users can view the following icons based on a threshold in the Workforce Optimization workspace.

-   The critical icon \(\[Omitted image "critical-icon.png"\] Alt text: Critical icon.\)
-   The positive icon \(\[Omitted image "positive-icon.png"\] Alt text: Positive icon.\)
-   The warning icon \(\[Omitted image "warning-icon.png"\] Alt text: Warning icon.\)
 The icons are displayed on all the pages where the parent KPIs are related to the KPI group based on the values that you set for the lower- and upper-threshold limits.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Select **Submit**.

    **Note:** In the Manager workspace, when users drill down into a KPI, the single scorecard component shows a threshold warning for critical thresholds nearing or exceeding the threshold limit. The following are examples of the messages that the scorecard shows:

    -   Approaching threshold of 95%
    -   Exceeded threshold of 170
    The scorecard shows the warnings corresponding to the followings conditions:

    -   **For maximize type KPIs**
        -   Value &lt; Lower Threshold \(Critical\): Exceeded &lt;Lower Threshold Value&gt;
        -   Lower Threshold \(Critical\) &lt; Value &lt; Upper Threshold \(Critical\): Approaching &lt;Lower Threshold Value&gt;
    -   **For minimize type KPIs**
        -   Value &gt; Upper Threshold \(Critical\): Exceeded &lt;Upper Threshold Value&gt;
        -   Lower Threshold \(Critical\) &lt; Value &lt; Upper Threshold \(Critical\): Approaching &lt;Upper Threshold Value&gt;
