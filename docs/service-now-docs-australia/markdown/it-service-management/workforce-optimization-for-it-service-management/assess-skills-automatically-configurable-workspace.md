# Assess the quality of your agent's completed tasks

Assess the ability of your agents to resolve incidents or the quality of their completed tasks.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

You can create an assessment from an interaction or any task type. When you manually create an assessment, you can add a survey to it. Coaching assessments also get created and assigned to the coach based on the trigger conditions that are defined in coaching opportunities.

Role required: sn\_coaching.coach

## About this task

If the [coaching opportunity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/coaching/cf-create-coaching-opportunity.md) includes a survey, you can opt to take the survey and the assessment. When you use a survey to [assess a trainee](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/coaching/cf-assess-trainee.md), the score for the survey is automatically calculated when you complete the survey. The assessment rating is then updated based on that score.

The Coaching Overview screen displays the average quality of the tasks that were completed in the past 30 days for your assignment groups.

-   The donut chart displays the number of assessments in various states of completion. You can point to one of the states and click to open all assessments in that state.
-   The bar chart displays assessments created by coaching opportunities. You can click on any of the data in the graph to access the assessments.
-   You can click on the graph that displays the indicator data and access detailed information on the indicator.

## Procedure
