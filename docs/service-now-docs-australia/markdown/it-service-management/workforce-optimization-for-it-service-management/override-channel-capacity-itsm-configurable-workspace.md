# Override channel capacity for an agent

Change the default number of work items that an agent can handle for a service channel.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_wfo\_cfg\_ws.manager

## About this task

By default, the override capacity is valid for 12 hours. Administrator can change the duration using the **sn\_channel\_mgmt.awa\_agent\_temporary\_override\_time.minutes** system property. For information on adding a system property, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md). The capacity resets to the previous value after the specified time. The scheduled job **Reset Temporary Capacity Override** is executed every two minutes to check the invalid or expired overridden capacity and resets to the previous value.

**Note:** You can override the channel capacity for a single agent at a time. Ensure that an agent to whom you want to override the channel capacity needs to be associated with Advanced Work Assignment and the required channels.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for ITSM** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Navigate to an agent's profile.
