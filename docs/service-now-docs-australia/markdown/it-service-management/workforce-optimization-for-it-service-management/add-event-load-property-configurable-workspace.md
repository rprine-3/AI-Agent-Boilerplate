# Configure an event load order in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Add a system property to display your preferred event categories first on the calendar.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Set the map application scope to **Shift Planning**. For information on how to set the scope, see [Set map application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/set-map-application-scope.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the application navigator, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter the following field values.

<table id="table_yfh_h3p_f4b"><thead><tr><th>

{
   "fastLoad":[

}
```

 where fastLoad is the array of sys\_ids for event categories that you would like to load first. The remaining custom event categories will be loaded after all event categories with fastLoad categories are loaded and updated on the calendar.
