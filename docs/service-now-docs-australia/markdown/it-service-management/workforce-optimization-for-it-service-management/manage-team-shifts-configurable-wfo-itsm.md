# Create a shift plan

Schedule shifts for your team so that you can make sure that you are covering all work assignments and breaks. You can also specify the days of the week that you might need to override scheduled shifts.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.admin

## About this task

In the **Shifts** tab, you can view the work shifts and on-call shifts in separate tabs. The shifts are grouped by active and inactive shifts. The contextual side panel displays the active and then the inactive shifts in the order it is displayed in the **Shifts** tab. You can scroll through the shifts using pagination.

**Note:** Your administrator can set user preferences for the pagination size to view work shifts and on-call shifts. For more information see, [Scheduling in Workforce Optimization for ITSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configurable-wfo-itsm-scheduling-reference.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Click the Schedule icon \(\[Omitted image "schedule-icon.png"\] Alt text: Schedule icon\).

3.  Click the **Shifts** tab.

    -   **Search shift plans:** Type keywords in the Work shift or On-call shift search field to access related shift plans easily.
    -   **Filter shift plans:** Use the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "filter-schedule-icon.png"\] Alt text: Filter schedule\) to view shifts based on whether the shift is in draft or published state.
        -   To filter work shifts, in the **Work shift** tab, click the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "filter-schedule-icon.png"\] Alt text: Filter schedule\) and select the desired state of shifts you want to view using the **State** field. Use the **Days of week** filter to narrow down the display of shifts based on the desired days in a week.
        -   To filter on-call shifts, in the **On-call shift** tab, click the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "filter-schedule-icon.png"\] Alt text: Filter schedule\) and select the desired state of shifts you want to view.

**Create a work shift**

</td><td>

1.  Create a work shift.
    1.  Click **Work shift**.
    2.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the shift.
    3.  Select the time window for the shift.
        1.  In the **Time Zone** field, select the time zone of the users that you want to allocate to the shift.

**Note:** To add a shift for agents working in their local time zones, select the **Use agent time zone** option. The system uses the time zone that is specified in the agent's user record.

        2.  In the **Start Time** field, enter the time of day when you want to start the shift.
        3.  In the **End Time** field, enter the time of day when you want to end the shift.
    4.  Select the days of the week for which you want to add this shift.
    5.  Click **Save**.
2.  Add schedule breaks to the shift.

    1.  Select the shift that you created.
    2.  Click **Add break**.
    3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the break.
    4.  Set a duration for the break.
        1.  In the **Duration** field, enter the length of time for the break.
        2.  In the **Earliest Start Time** field, enter the earliest time to start the break.
        3.  In the **Latest End Time** field, enter the latest time to end the break.

For example, you can set the earliest start time as 11:00, the latest end time as 15:00, and the duration of the break as one hour. If you add four agents to that work shift, the Scheduling application automatically staggers the break duration for each agent. Stagger breaks to ensure that your four agents can cover the entire shift span.

        4.  Click **Save**.
You can view the number of agents for each hour or day on the shift span window.

    7.  Click **Save**.
2.  Create the on-call rotation.

    1.  Select the shift that you created.
    2.  Click **Create Rotation**.
    3.  From the **Agents** field, select the names of the agents you would like to be part of the shift. When you click the field, the name of all agents that belong to the group that the on-call shift is being created for is displayed.
    4.  From the **Rotate interval** field, select if you want the rotation to be daily or weekly.
    5.  Click **Save**.
**Note:** The **Escalation Type** field is auto-populated with **Rotate through rosters** field value if multiple rosters have been created for the rotation. If not, it is populated with **Rotate through members** field value.

3.  Click **Publish** to make the shift active and publish it on the schedule.
 **Note:**

-   You can select an active on-call shift and click **Unpublish** to make the shift inactive and remove it from the schedule.
-   You can view all on-call shifts that have been published on the schedule in the agent and team calendar. When you add new agents to the on-call rotation, it might take some time to refresh the data on the team calendar.
-   You can click on an on-call shift in the team calendar to see more details.
