# Configure the due date logic for shift approval flows

As an administrator, you can configure the due date logic for the time-off request and shift-swap request approval flows.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Make sure that your application is in the Shift Planning scope.

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can configure the flows to restrict who can approve the requests. For example, you can set it to only the manager of the agent's primary assignment group who can approve them. If the agent submits the request for approval within two days before the agent time-off start date, then the request for approval is auto-rejected.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Designer**.

    Each flow has a requester and an approver workflow.

2.  Configure the due date logic for the Time-off request flow.
