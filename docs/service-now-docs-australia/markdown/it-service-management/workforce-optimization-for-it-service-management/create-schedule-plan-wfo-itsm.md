# Create a schedule plan

Manage your team's schedule by creating a schedule plan that covers a span of time and includes your team's work shifts. You can also assign agents to shifts based on their skills and availability. This way, you can make sure that you are using your resources in the best way possible for your organization.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.admin

## About this task

You can set the number of days to cache agent schedules using the **sn\_shift\_planning.number\_of\_days\_to\_cache** [system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configurable-wfo-itsm-scheduling-reference.md).

If you do any of the following:

-   Import agent schedules using table import
-   Disable business rules and use a script to load the data

you must manually run the **Shift Planning - Delete All Agent Schedules Cache** [schedule job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configurable-wfo-itsm-scheduling-reference.md) to clear the cache.

**Note:** Your administrator can set user preferences for the pagination size to view schedule plans. For more information see, [Scheduling in Workforce Optimization for ITSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/configurable-wfo-itsm-scheduling-reference.md)
