# Create a client state parameter for Work scheduler

Add custom client state parameter values to add properties to the card components.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Role required: workspace\_admin or ui\_builder\_admin​

## Procedure

1.  Select the Client state icon \(\[Omitted image "client-state-icon.png"\] Alt text: Client state icon\).

2.  In the Client state parameters section, click **+Add**.

3.  Create the client state parameter.

    1.  In the **Name** field, enter **cardProps**.
    2.  From the **Type** menu, select **JSON**.
    3.  In the **Initial value** field, select **Edit**.
    4.  In the **Initial value** pop-up screen, enter the following code:

        ```
        {
            "tagline": {},
            "heading": {},
            "dropdowns": [],
            "content": [],
            "assignedTo": null,
            "aria": {}
          }
        ```

    5.  Select **Apply**.
    Here's a demo on how to create client state parameters.
