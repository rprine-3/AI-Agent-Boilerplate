# Channel Management extension point in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Use extension points to call scripts to configure the list sort order in Channel Management.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To see a list of extension points that you can use for Workforce Optimization for ITSM, navigate to **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**. Use scripted extension points to integrate customizations without altering the core components in the application code. When customizing a base application, you implement the scripted extension points by creating the custom script includes and registering them against the scripted extension points. For detailed information on implementing extension points, see [Using scripted extension points in server-side scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/scripted-extension-points.md).

Add or modify the columns and sort directions in the `vardata` section to configure the sorting mechanism for the All Agents and All Queues lists in Channel Management. As an example, The Presence State column with **ASC** as a sort direction in the extension script displays the Presence State records in an ascending order in the All Agents list.

**Note:** You can create multiple implementations; however, the implementation with the lowest order number is executed.
