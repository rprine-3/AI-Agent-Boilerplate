# Configure a list menu to display in the Learning tab in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Add a system property to add to or modify the list menu for Coaching with Learning in the Coaching application in Workforce Optimization for ITSM.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

**Important:** This feature is available with the Coaching with Learning plugin \(sn\_coach\_lrn\) from the ServiceNow Store. To enable this feature, see [Activate Workforce Optimization for ITSM for configurabe workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/activate-configurable-workforce-optimization-itsm.md).

Set the map application scope to **Coaching With Learning**. For information on how to set the scope, see [Set map application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/set-map-application-scope.md).

Role required: admin
