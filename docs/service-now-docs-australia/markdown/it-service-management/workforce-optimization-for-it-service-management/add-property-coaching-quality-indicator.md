# Configure an indicator to display in the Coaching Overview tab in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Add a system property to display the desired indicator in the Coaching Overview tab in the Coaching application.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Set the map application scope to **Coaching**. For information on how to set the scope, see [Set map application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/set-map-application-scope.md).

Role required: admin
