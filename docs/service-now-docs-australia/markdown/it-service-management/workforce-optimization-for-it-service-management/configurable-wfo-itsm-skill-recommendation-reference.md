# Skill Recommendation components in Workforce Optimization for ITSM

Workforce Optimization for ITSM uses roles to administer skill recommendation, tables to store skill data, and properties to modify default behavior, and scheduled job to recommend skills in configurable Workforce Optimization for ITSM.

**Important:** Starting with the Brazil release, Workforce Optimization for ITSM is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   **Default value:**3

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of resolved similar tasks to use for predicting skills.

sn\_sre.number\_of\_similar\_incidents

</td><td>

The number of resolved similar incidents to use to predict skills using supervised learning, ordered by confidence of prediction, to resolve similar types of incidents.-   **Type:**Integer
