# Assign skills after completing an assessment

Automatically assign skills to trainees for specific skill levels based on the course items they have completed. For example, if a trainee completes the course items for learning Japanese at an expert level, then the skill level 'expert' can be assigned to the trainee.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_coaching.coach and sn\_coaching.admin

## About this task

You can associate skills with coaching opportunities, coaching assessments, or course items. When a trainee completes a coaching assessment, you can automatically assign the skill the trainee has acquired during that coaching opportunity.

The coaching assessments generated from coaching opportunities award the skills to the trainee after the assessment is complete. If the assessment is configured to include assigned course items, the skills associated with course items are also added to the assessments.

## Procedure

1.  Associate skills with coaching assessment or opportunities.
