# Create a requisition on Coupa through Procurement application

Create software requisitions directly on Coupa through the ServiceNow Procurement application to purchase software.

## Before you begin

To create a requisition on Coupa through ServiceNow Procurement application, you must perform the following tasks.

-   Create and publish a Coupa integration profile. For more information see, [Create a Coupa integration profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/procurement/create-coupa-int-profile.md).
-   Ensure that the Purchase Order you create has at least one Purchase Order Line, and all Purchase Order Lines must be for software products.
-   Synchronize reference data types on both ServiceNow Procurement and Coupa applications. For more information, see [Reference data synchronization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/procurement/ref-data-coupa.md).

If all these conditions are met, you can create a requisition in Coupa.

If the conditions aren’t met, requisitions aren't created on Coupa, and the legacy procurement flow continues on the Procurement application.

Role required: sam\_admin and procurement\_integrator

**Note:** The procurement\_integrator role is added to the sam\_admin role. The procurement\_integrator role enables the SAM admin to view the connections and aliases.

## About this task

You can create a requisition on Coupa through the following ways:

-   When a user requests software through Service Catalog. For more information, see [Request a catalog item from Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/request-cat-item-portal.md).
-   If a procurement\_user or sam\_admin directly creates a Purchase Order on the Procurement application. For more information, see [Create a Purchase Order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/procurement/t_CreateAPurchaseOrder.md).
-   When a sam\_user creates a Purchase Order directly from the Remediation Options form. For more information, see [View software model results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/t_ViewSWModelResults.md).

Requisitions are of the following types:

-   **Catalog request**: A requisition created for an item that is already present in the external purchasing application.
-   **Non catalog request**: A requisition created for an item that isn't present in the product catalog of the organization.

For more information about creating a Purchase Order, see [Create a purchase order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/procurement/t_CreateAPurchaseOrder.md).

</table>4.  Right-click on the form and select **Save**.

    You can add purchase order line items to specify what you are ordering from this vendor. For more information about creating a purchase order line item, see [Create a purchase order line item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/procurement/t_CreateAPurchaseOrderLineItem.md). A requisition line is created with a unique ID in Coupa.

5.  After you’ve added at least one purchase order line item, select **Order**.

    A requisition ID is displayed on your Purchase Order and the corresponding requisition line IDs are displayed on your Purchase Order Lines.

    **Note:** Wait for some time and then reload the Purchase Order form to view the generated IDs or errors.


## Result

After the status of the Purchase Order is **Received** on Coupa, the following activities occur:

-   **Assets** and **Receiving Slips** get created and you can find the **Purchase Order Number** on the Purchase Order form.
-   The Asset Management - Procurement Integration application automatically generates entitlements.
-   On receipt of the assets, the scheduled job **ITAM - Sync Coupa purchase orders** creates a Receiving Slip and Receiving Slip Lines on the ServiceNow Procurement application. This job also pulls the Coupa fields such as Manufacturer part number, Status, and Receiving quantity. The values returned from Coupa through the receiving transactions are used to populate the created entitlements. However, if these values are not available from the receiving slips, then the Asset Management - Procurement Integration application uses the values populated in the Purchase Order of the Procurement application.
-   If any discrepancy exists on the Purchase Order, Asset Management - Procurement Integration creates entitlement import errors. You can view the errors by selecting the **Entitlement Import Errors** tab under a Purchase Order, Purchase Order Line item, and Receiving Slip line.
