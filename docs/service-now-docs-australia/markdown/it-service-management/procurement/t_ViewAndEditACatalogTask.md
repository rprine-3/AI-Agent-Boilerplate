# View and edit a catalog task

Catalog tasks are used to source items and fulfill requests. You can view and edit catalog tasks from a request.

## Before you begin

Role required: procurement\_admin or procurement\_user

## About this task

If a request requires approval, a catalog task is created automatically when the request is approved. If a request doesn’t require approval, a catalog task is created automatically when the request is created.

**Note:** If a request contains one requested item and the item has no model specified, a catalog task isn’t created automatically. If a request includes multiple items and only some have a specified model, catalog tasks are automatically created, but only for those items with a model.
