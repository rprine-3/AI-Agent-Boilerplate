# ITSM Success Dashboard Admin console

The ITSM Success Dashboard offers valuable insights to both the leadership team and process owners, enabling them to assess the performance of their product implementation.

The performance is assessed by utilizing the established key performance indicators \(KPIs\). This process categorizes configuration activities and provides information in each category such as planning guidance, pre-setup steps, and links to useful help content.

## Prerequisites

For more information on the ITSM Success Dashboard roles, see [Success Dashboard indicators user roles and responsibilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/itsm-success-dashboard-indicators/success-roles.md)
-   Review and configure self-service KPIs: You can review and configure the self-service KPIs for Knowledge deflection, Virtual Agent deflection, and Catalog Item fulfillment level.
