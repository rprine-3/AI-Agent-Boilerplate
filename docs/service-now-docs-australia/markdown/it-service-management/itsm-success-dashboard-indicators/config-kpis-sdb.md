# Configure Success Dashboard indicators KPIs

Success Dashboard indicators has a prescriptive methodology for measuring performance. But you can reconfigure the source of the Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) by replacing the available indicators in the base system or by adding more indicators.

For example, your organization may have a different method to determine **Self-solved using Knowledge**. You cannot change the definition of **Self-solved percentage** and **Call deflection** that use `Self-solved using Knowledge`, but you can replace or add the KPIs and its constituents.

There are two major types of indicators:

-   Primary indicators: The indicators prescribed by ServiceNow.

    **Warning:** You must not modify any primary indicators as these are prescribed by ServiceNow®. Modifying these KPIs might impact your scores.

    -   You can view the primary indicators in the Primary Indicator Registry table `(sn_sd_primary_indicator_registry)`.
    -   You can view the corresponding Performance Analytics indicators in the Primary Indicator table `(sn_sd_primary_indicator)`.

        Primary indicators are of the following types:

        -   Manual: The formulae for these indicators are made up of other primary indicators.
        -   Automatic: The formulae for these indicators are automatically calculated based on the contributing indicators.
-   Contributing Indicators: The indicators listed in the Contributing Indicator Registry `(sn_sd_contributing_indicator_registry)` table and that point to primary indicators.
    -   When these indicators are registered with automatic primary indicators, the formula of the primary indicator is automatically updated to include these indicators in the sum.
    -   When these indicators are removed from the registry or marked inactive, the formula of the primary indicator is updated to remove this indicator from the sum. For example:

        ```
        Self-solve (manual primary indicator) = Self-solved using Virtual Agent (automatic primary indicator) + Self-solved using Knowledge (automatic primary indicator) + Automated Resolutions (automatic primary indicator) 
        ```

        Where:

        -   Self-solved using Virtual Agent = Any Service group issues self-solved using VA \(the only contributing indicator registered for this primary indicator\)
        -   Self-solved using Knowledge = Any Service group issues self-solved using Knowledge \(the only contributing indicator registered for this primary indicator\)
        -   Automated Resolutions \(automatic primary indicator\) = Incident or HR ticket auto-resolution \(the only contributing indicator registered for this primary indicator\)
