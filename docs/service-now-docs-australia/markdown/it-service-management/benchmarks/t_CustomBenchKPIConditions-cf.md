# Link or customize a benchmark KPI

You can customize KPI conditions to fit the needs of your organization better.

## Before you begin

The Benchmarks admin role does not provide application-specific roles. Therefore, although a Benchmarks admin can access a KPI through the Benchmarks application, changes to KPI conditions require the role specific to the KPI application.

For example, a Benchmarks admin cannot modify conditions for the knowledge base KPI \(Knowledge Use \[kb\_use\] table\), SLA KPI \(Task SLA \[task\_sla\] table\), ITOM KPIs \(CMDB Health Scorecard \[cmdb\_health\_scorecard\] table\), Security Operations KPIs \(Vulnerable Item \[sn\_vul\_vulnerable\_item\], or Security Incident \[sn\_si\_incident\] tables\) from within Benchmarks without specific access granted to those tables \(knowledge\_admin, sla\_admin, asset, or sn\_si.special\_access roles\).

Role required: sn\_bm\_client.benchmark\_admin

## About this task

Customizing KPI conditions is useful to adjust the criteria to more accurately represent the data that your company is interested in.

For example, if your implementation does not use priority 1 incidents, you can change the criteria for high priority KPIs from 1 to 0, which returns more accurate data for your organization.

**Note:** It takes one to two months for aggregate monthly data to accurately reflect changes made to KPI conditions. For example, changes made within the month include a combination of data:

-   Data for the previous condition \(up until the date the condition was changed\)
-   Data for the new condition from that date forward

For further analysis, you can link a Performance Analytics indicator that you are already using to the corresponding Benchmarks indicator to see breakdowns, in addition to individual scores, when drilling down on KPI data.

For example, link **Number of resolved incidents by first assigned group** to **Benchmark: Number of incidents resolved on first assignment** to view breakdown values by priority, assignment group, and category.

**Note:** Individual scores are shown by default but you must have [Performance Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/pa-overview.md) to use linking to show breakdowns.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Benchmarks** &gt; **Setup** and click a KPI to access the KPI conditions.

    \[Omitted image "BenchConditions.png"\] Alt text: Number of high-priority incidents resolved

2.  Change the conditions, as appropriate.

3.  To link a Performance Analytics indicator to a Benchmarks indicator, follow the procedure in [Link an automated indicator to a benchmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/link-automated-indicator-benchmark.md).
