# Exploring Benchmarks

Use Benchmarks for ITSM to get a comparative insight relative to industry averages of your peers and to the industry top performers. With Benchmarks get a quick visibility into your key performance indicators \(KPIs\) and trends.

The ServiceNow Benchmarks application securely collects daily data on your instance and then aggregates the data into monthly global benchmark reports.

Performance Analytics collects daily data on customer instances. The data from the previous month is uploaded at the beginning of the following month via a scheduled job. If there are any errors, there are multiple retries.

This video provides an overview of how you can get started with Benchmarks.

During the month the data is uploaded, the data is aggregated and monthly results \(your instance results, global results, and your ranking\) are downloaded to the customer instance mid month. Monthly recommendation candidates are provided that you can implement to help improve your KPI performance. An email notification is sent when the global data is available.

ServiceNow has over 2850 customers that have opted into the Benchmarks program. All ServiceNow customers are allowed to participate in the Benchmarks program by opting in from their ServiceNow production instance, except:

-   Express customers
-   Federal customers
-   Customers with on-premise instances

**Note:** You must have a production instance to opt into the Benchmarks program.

Managed Service Providers \(MSPs\) and MSP-managed instances are supported and have exclusive access to global MSP aggregate score data. All instances will support the following benchmarks that can be downloaded for comparison in the Benchmarks dashboard:

-   Global, which applies to all customers
-   Industry category
-   User size, based on active user count
-   Companies in your industry category and those that are of similar size to your company
-   Geographical regions

**Note:**

-   These benchmarks aren’t calculated using MSP data.
-   Along with the above Benchmarks, you will also receive the top performers in each of these categories.
-   Changing KPI configuration within the month requires one to two months of data collection before your monthly values reflect that change.
-   The Benchmark Scheduler \(bm.scheduler\) user is added with Benchmarks. It’s required for Benchmarks data collection.

Using the **Compare with** drop-down in the Benchmarks dashboard, you can filter the benchmarks results by industry, ServiceNow user size, or geographical region to make the results more relevant to your organization.
