# Benchmark KPIs

You can enable or disable a benchmark KPI, and customize KPI conditions. Integration with Performance Analytics provides daily data collection and drill down capabilities on KPI data.

Benchmarks offers ITSM, ITOM, Virtual Agent, Security Operations KPIs, Success Dashboard, and Strategic Portfolio Management.

**Note:** Upgrading Benchmarks does not change KPI status or configuration from the previous release. New KPIs are enabled by default.

Benchmarks uses anonymous, aggregated usage data from customers who have opted in to calculate global and industry benchmarks. The KPIs in the Benchmarks application are performance analytics indicators that only collect the usage count data, for example, the total number of incidents in a month, based on the monthly aggregates. During data collection, the Benchmarks application does not consider any other details such as description of incidents, or information about requests, changes, or applications.

The participating customer count for each cohort bucket in Industry Category, User Size, and Three geo regions aggregates are large enough to calculate monthly benchmarks values and to maintain full anonymity. To further ensure data anonymity, the Benchmarks user interface allows you to use only one filter at a time.

## Benchmarks KPI categories

Benchmarks supports KPIs from other ServiceNow applications such as ITSM, ITOM, Security Operations, Conversational Interfaces, Success Dashboard, and Strategic Portfolio Management. For more information, see Benchmark KPIs.

## Strategic Portfolio Management KPIs

Benchmarks supports Strategic Portfolio Management KPIs. For more information, see [SPM Benchmarking KPIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/spm-benchmarking-kpis.md).

## Benchmarks data transfer

Your Benchmarks score data is automatically uploaded to ServiceNow on the third day of the month. Global scores are automatically downloaded to your instance on the 11th day of the month.

You can manually upload or download scores beyond those days of the month \(on demand\) by executing the Benchmarks scores scheduled jobs through the **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs** navigation item.

-   Upload the benchmark scores \(automatically runs on the first day of the month\)
-   Download the benchmark scores \(automatically runs on the ninth day of the month\)

These on-demand scheduled jobs are useful if, for any reason, there was a failure in the automatic upload or download scores process and it is after the cutoff dates. You can also run a scheduled job to generate six months of historical data.

## Email notification

Users with the Benchmarks admin \(sn\_bm\_client.benchmark\_admin\) and Benchmarks data viewer \(sn\_bm\_client.benchmark\_data\_viewer\) roles automatically receive email notification regarding availability of monthly scores, historical data recalculation, and new KPIs. You must have system admin \(admin\) role to modify the email recipient list.

-   An email containing notification information is sent when the monthly global data is available. Monthly results \(your instance results, and global results\) are downloaded to the customer instance mid month.
    -   Subject: New Monthly Benchmarks report is available now
    -   Body: ServiceNow Benchmarks has been updated with &lt;month&gt; data. You can see the updated Benchmarks by viewing the Benchmarks Dashboard &lt;Benchmarks Dashboard Portal link&gt;.
-   An email containing notification information is sent when historical data for the past six months is recalculated.
    -   Subject: Historical Global Benchmarks scores have been refreshed
    -   Body: The global Benchmarks scores of last six months have been recalculated with improved data quality. You can see the updated Benchmarks by visiting Benchmarks Dashboard &lt;Benchmark Dashboard Portal Link&gt;.
-   An email containing notification information is sent when an updated KPI version is introduced \(with some fixes, for example\).
    -   Subject: One or more Benchmarks KPI versions have changed
    -   Body: The latest Benchmarks scores have a new version of following KPIs with improved data quality.

        &lt; KPI name&gt;.

        You can see the updated Benchmarks by visiting Benchmarks Dashboard &lt;Benchmark Dashboard Portal Link&gt;.


Benchmarks notification emails are accessed using the **System Settings** &gt; **Notifications** navigation menu.
