# Update instance URL in the Desktop Assistant configuration file

As a system administrator, update the instance URL in the Desktop Assistant configuration file to automatically populate the Desktop Assistant login page instance URL on devices where it is installed.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** Only the system administrator must update the configuration file or make changes to it while deploying Desktop Assistant on devices.

Desktop Assistant users can update the instance URL when logging in to the application. For more information, see [Open and log in to Desktop Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/open-desktop-exp.md).

## Procedure

1.  On your computer, navigate to the folder that contains the `settings.json` file.

    -   On Windows devices: Navigate to the `C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\desktop_assistant_app` folder.
    -   On macOS devices: Navigate to the `Users/user_name/Library/Application Support/desktop_assistant_app` folder.

        **Note:** If you don’t see a folder, use Command+Shift+period \(.\) key to show hidden folders.

2.  Find and open the `settings.json` file.

3.  Enter the Desktop Assistant instance URL in the **instanceURL** field of the JSON file.

    In addition to the instance URL, system administrators can also customize the Desktop Assistant login page by changing the loginHeader, loginBody, and companyLogoSvg values in the configuration file.

4.  Save and close the JSON file.
