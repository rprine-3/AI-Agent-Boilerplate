# Exploring Digital End-User Experience

The Digital End-User Experience \(DEX\) suite provides proactive visibility to help you understand and improve the end-user experience across your organization. It includes Application and Device Health, DEX Content Playbook, Desktop Assistant, Digital Experience Score​, and Proactive Engagement to help diagnose and address negative experiences.

## Digital End-User Experience overview

The Digital End-User Experience \(DEX\) provides end-to-end visibility into the health of applications, networks, and end-user devices. DEX provides such features as application, user, and device navigation, trend analysis, and various useful metrics. With DEX you can identify the root cause of an issue instead of addressing only its effects.

## Digital End-User Experience benefits

Having a positive digital experience can lead to the following benefits:

-   **Proactive visibility into the end-user experience**

    Gain insights into the digital experience of your application and services from the end-user viewpoint, regardless of their location, device type, or network connectivity. Identify and measure the health of user systems — view what applications and system crashes are happening. All this reliability data is brought together in one central workspace, enabling your IT team to examine detailed data without deploying additional monitors.

-   **Increased productivity**

    Access digital tools and resources easily to troubleshoot IT issues, reset passwords, or access software. Reducing the burden on IT staff can increase productivity. The DEX Content Playbook includes policies and checks for metrics and subsequent actions required for different operating systems.

-   **Issue analysis**

    Identify and analyze issues by providing insights into pain points, usage patterns, performance, and impact. By analyzing DEX data, organizations can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance the digital workplace experience for end users.

-   **Performance evaluation**

    Provide insights into the productivity, efficiency, user behavior, and engagement. DEX provides a wealth of device performance and health information. This data can help IT teams understand how a given application is being used and identify areas for improvement.

-   **Enhanced engagement**

    Promote end-user experience and productivity by continuously measuring and monitoring application and device health metrics. Gain end-to-end visibility and insights into the overall user experience and quickly identify users, applications, and devices with poor experiences that need your attention. A positive digital experience can support end-user engagement and job satisfaction.

-   **Optimized end-user digital experience**

    Desktop Assistant is a centralized hub that gives employees visibility into requests and device health. It supports internet connection testing and provides a usage metrics dashboard for communication with the ServiceNow® instance.


## Better together

-   **[DEX for Service Desk Agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/features-of-investigation-tab.md)**

    As a Service Desk agent, navigate to the DEX device health page from the ServiceNow Core UI incident experience or from the Investigate tab within the Incident experience in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\). Configure a computer Configuration Item \(CI\) and install the DEX plugin for the ability to analyze device metrics from within the platform, getting valuable insights for effective issue investigation.

    Use incident investigation with DEX to review device health, detected issues, and suggested resolutions. Implement resolutions and remedial actions directly from your workspace and monitor the status of actions. For more information, see [Incident investigation with DEX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/dex-diagnostics-guided-resolutions.md).

    Use the DEX issue diagnosis and resolution agentic workflow to resolve detected issues with automated root cause analysis, targeted resolution plans, and resolution summaries documented in incident records. For workflow details, see [DEX issue diagnosis and resolution agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/now-assist-itsm-dex-diagnosis-resolution-workflow.md).

-   **[Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/c_SoftwareAssetMgmt.md)**

    Unifying the experience of DEX application with Software Asset Management \(SAM\) software enables you to access SAM-normalized software content. This integration provides software metering data from DEX to integrate with SAM for software licensing reclamation and, in turn, reduce software license costs. For more information, see [Using DEX or SAM for application monitoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/using-dex-or-sam-for-app-monitoring.md).
