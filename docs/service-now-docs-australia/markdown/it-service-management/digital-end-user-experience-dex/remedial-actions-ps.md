# Creating and executing a PowerShell script-based remedial action

A custom remedial action can be created using a PowerShell script packaged in an Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) plugin and executed on endpoint devices through a check definition.

The ACC plugin contains the PowerShell script that defines the remedial action using commands and a Ruby script that calls the PowerShell script from the ServiceNow instance. When the signed ACC plugin is uploaded to a ServiceNow instance, the ACC agent downloads the plugin and executes the remedial action through a check definition you create.

Creating and executing a PowerShell script-based custom remedial action includes the following tasks.

1.  Creating an ACC plugin package that includes the PowerShell script, Ruby script, and allowlist. For more information, see [Create an ACC plugin package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/create-acc-plugin-structure.md).
2.  Generating a self-signed certificate, signing the plugin package, and verifying the signature to enable the remedial action to be executed securely on endpoint devices. For more information, see [Sign and verify an ACC plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/sign-verify-plugin.md).
3.  Uploading the signed plugin package to the ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Create and edit Agent Client Collector plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/create-edit-assets.md).
4.  Creating a check definition and linking it to the ACC plugin to enable the ACC agent to download it and execute the remedial action on the endpoint device. For more information, see [Create a check definition for a custom remedial action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/create-check-def-remedial-actions.md).
5.  Testing the check definition to verify if the ACC plugin is linked and the remedial action runs successfully. For more information, see [Test a check definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/test-check-def.md).
