# Install Digital End-User Experience

Digital End-User Experience \(DEX\) is available with activation of the Digital End-User Experience \[sn\_dex\] plugin. You must have the admin role to install the DEX product \[sn\_dex\]. During installation, Application and Device Health is included as a component in DEX.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Review the [DEX Application &amp; Device Health](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/0db59e3eade11d50f8777e45b2f98b72) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.

Role required: admin

For information about DEX data migration, see the [KB1646364](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1646364) article in the knowledge base.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Digital End-User Experience application \[sn\_dex\] using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can’t find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    In the list next to the **Install** button, the versions that are available to you’re displayed.

3.  Select a version from the list and select **Install**.

    In the Review Installation Details dialog box, any dependencies installed with your application are listed.

4.  If you're prompted, follow the links to the ServiceNow Store to get any additional entitlements for dependencies.

5.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select the **Load demo data** check box.

    Demo data are the sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load the demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

6.  Select **Install**.

    **Warning:** Digital End-User Experience is installed with Mutual Transport Layer Security \(mTLS\) automatically enabled on the ServiceNow instance. As an updated, more secure version of SSL, mTLS enhances security by encrypting data and verifying the identity of both the client and server before establishing a connection. If you have legacy security products on any other integrations with ServiceNow, they might break after DEX installation. Update to support TLS or mTLS, aligning with the enhanced security features.
