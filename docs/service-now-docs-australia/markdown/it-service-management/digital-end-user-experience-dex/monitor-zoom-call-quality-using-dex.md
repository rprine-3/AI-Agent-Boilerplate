# Monitor Zoom call quality using DEX

View detailed metrics for the Zoom calls made by users assigned to this device or logged in within the past 15 days.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dex.user

-   Set up DEX for Zoom. For more information, see [Configuring DEX for Zoom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/configuring-DEX-for-Zoom.md).
-   Configure advanced monitoring to monitor Zoom calls quality with DEX. For more details, see [Enable application monitoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/enable-app-monitor.md).

## About this task

The detailed Zoom call metrics include call quality, network performance, and call details to help you troubleshoot issues quickly and improve end-user experience visibility.

-   Each time a user disconnects and rejoins a call, the subsequent joining is counted as a new call.
-   Zoom monitoring doesn’t include webinars or breakout rooms.
-   All the metrics are the aggregated data of all the calls.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  In the primary navigation pane, select the Devices icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-devices.png"\] Alt text: Devices icon\).

3.  Select a device.

4.  Select **Zoom call quality** under **Advanced app metrics**.

5.  Select a **User**.

    **Note:**

    -   Only users with a valid email address can be selected.
    -   The users list includes assigned users and logged-in users \(those who logged in within the past 15 days\).
6.  Select start and end dates, then select **Go**.

    **Note:** The date range is limited to a maximum of 48 hours within the past 30 days.

    The zoom calls appear in cards categorized as: **All calls**, **Bad calls**, **Poor calls**, **Fair calls**, and **Good calls**. By selecting one of these cards, you can see the filtered data in Summary and Call quality metrics. You can also use Additional filters listed below the cards.

    **Tip:** Apply **Additional filters** \(Device type, Version, Network type, Location\) to narrow results and quickly find call details.
