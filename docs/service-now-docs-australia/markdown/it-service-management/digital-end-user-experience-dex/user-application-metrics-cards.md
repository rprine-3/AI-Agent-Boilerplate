# Application performance pages

Access performance and usage data for a specific application to evaluate its efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and make informed optimization decisions.

## Application performance — Installed apps

<table id="table_nbd_jxf_1xb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Installed application that you want to track the performance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Start date

</td><td>

Start date and time within 7 days from current date and time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

End date

</td><td>

End date and time that can’t exceed the current date and time.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Top memory and CPU usage tab

</td></tr><tr><td>

Memory usage

</td><td>

Amount of memory or RAM \(Random Access Memory\) consumed by the top 10 applications in MB

</td></tr><tr><td>

CPU usage

</td><td>

Amount of processing power consumed by the top 10 applications in percentage

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

App performance tab

</td></tr><tr><td>

CPU usage

</td><td>

Amount of processing power consumed by an application in percentage

**Note:** High CPU usage can result in degraded application performance, slower response times, and decreased user satisfaction. Therefore, identify performance bottlenecks and take proactive steps to optimize application performance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Memory usage

</td><td>

Amount of memory or RAM \(Random Access Memory\) consumed by an application in percentage

**Note:** High memory usage can result in degraded application performance, slower response times, and potentially lead to crashes or system instability. Therefore, monitor memory usage to optimize resource allocation and capacity planning, verifying that applications have sufficient resources to meet user demands.

</td></tr><tr><td>

I/O read

</td><td>

Process of reading data from storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives, within a computer system**Note:** Excessive I/O read operations can lead to performance bottlenecks, increased latency, and result in slower system response times. Therefore, monitor I/O read activities to verify that the data retrieval processes aren't a limiting factor for application performance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

I/O write

</td><td>

Process of storing or writing data to storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives, within a computer system**Note:** Excessive I/O write operations can also lead to performance bottlenecks, increased latency, and potentially result in slower system response times. Therefore, monitor I/O write activities to verify that data storage processes don't hinder application performance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of crashes

</td><td>

Trend of the application's crashes on the device over the last 2 hours**Note:** Analyzing this graph enables you to identify potential issues, pinpoint trends, and take proactive measures to enhance the application's reliability and user experience.

</table>## Application performance — Web apps

<table id="id_dqr_1s2_ddc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Installed application that you want to track the performance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Start date

</td><td>

Start date and time within 7 days from current date and time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

End date

</td><td>

End date and time that can’t exceed the current date and time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Response time

</td><td>

Time it takes for the application to respond to a user request in milliseconds**Note:** A slow response time can result in frustrated users, decreased engagement, and lower productivity, while a fast response time can lead to improved user satisfaction and increased engagement. Therefore, it's essential to track response time as a key application metric and continuously monitor and optimize it to promote optimal user experience.

</td></tr><tr><td>

DNS lookup

</td><td>

Time \(in milliseconds\) it takes for a user's device to resolve a domain name into an IP address**Note:** If Domain Name System \(DNS\) lookup identifies an error in the mapping of DNS entries on a user's system, the user can’t access the internet or the intended website.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Page load time

</td><td>

Time taken for a web page to display its content fully and get interactive on a user's request

</td></tr><tr><td>

Failed web requests

</td><td>

Instances where requested web content or resources couldn't be successfully retrieved or loaded by the server**Note:** The failed web requests result provides insights into potential issues affecting web performance. It helps in identifying problems such as server errors, broken links, or network issues that could hinder user experience. Identifying the frequency, type, and reasons behind failed requests helps in troubleshooting, optimizing web infrastructure, and promoting a smoother browsing experience for users.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Availability

</td><td>

Percentage of time that a service is operational and accessible to users
