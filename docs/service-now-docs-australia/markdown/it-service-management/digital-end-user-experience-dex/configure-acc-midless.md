# Configure MID-less Agent Client Collector using a single-line command

Use a single-line command to set up a MID-less Agent Client Collector. You can also use the single-line command to migrate agents configured with a MID Server to have a MID-less configuration.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   In a Linux or macOS environment: root
-   In a Windows environment: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## About this task

Running the single-line command includes flags, which indicate the options to be added to the `acc.yml` configuration file. These options dictate the configuration of the MID-less Agent Client Collector. If you don’t specify an option in the command, the existing option in the `acc.yml` file is used. If there’s no existing option, an error message indicates that the parameter is required to enable connecting to an endpoint.

Running a command validates that a connection can be made with the specified parameter \(for example, the specified registration-key value\). However, the command doesn’t verify if the value of the parameter is valid.

## Procedure

1.  Run the following command in a terminal window: `acc gateway ics <flags>`.

    The available flags appear in the following table:

Optional. If no value is entered, the default location of the `acc.yml` file is used.
