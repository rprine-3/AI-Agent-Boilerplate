    The `Desktop_Assistant_<Version>.msi` file is downloaded to your computer.

When you install Desktop Assistant by using the installer, the instance URL field on the login page is not populated automatically. As a system administrator, you can update the instance URL in the Desktop Assistant configuration file. For more information, see [Update instance URL in the Desktop Assistant configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/update-da-instance-url.md).

**Note:** Only the system administrator must update the configuration file or make changes to it while deploying Desktop Assistant on devices.
