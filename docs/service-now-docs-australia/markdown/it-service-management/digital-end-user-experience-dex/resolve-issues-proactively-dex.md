# Resolve issues proactively with DEX Proactive Resolution

Use ServiceNow, Inc. Digital End-User Experience \(DEX\) to detect and resolve device and application issues before users report them, reducing disruptions and improving the end-user experience.

DEX supports two proactive resolution strategies depending on how quickly an issue must be addressed:

-   [Real-time proactive resolution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/proactive-resolution-real-time.md)

    Detect and remediate device and application issues using metric rules, alerts, and automated or manual remediation actions. Address time-sensitive issues such as device crashes, high disk usage, or application crashes.

-   [Non-real-time proactive resolution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/proactive-resolution-non-real-time.md)

    Monitor and remediate conditions that require periodic data review, such as system compliance, battery health, system performance, and DEX Score trends.


## Detection and remediation methods

Each proactive resolution strategy uses different detection and remediation methods. The following table summarizes the options available in each strategy.

|Strategy|Detection|Remediation|
|--------|---------|-----------|
|Real-time \(metric-based\)|Metric rules that generate alerts when a threshold is breached|Automated actions defined in the metric rule, or manual bulk actions from the alert|
|Real-time \(auto-correction scripts\)|Check definitions wrapped in policies, run at a defined frequency|Scripts that detect and correct conditions automatically, including when the device is offline|
|Non-real-time|Reports, dashboards, and scheduled jobs that query aggregated data tables|Custom flows, scheduled jobs, or bulk actions from insight reports|

## Other DEX resolution methods

Proactive resolution is a way DEX helps you resolve device and application issues. Based on the role and the workflow, you can use the following methods, many of which work together with the real-time and non-real-time strategies.

-   **Custom insights reports and bulk remediation**

    Identify a population of devices that meet a condition and remediate them as a group. See [Create an insights report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/create-insights-report.md), [Trigger bulk remediation from Insights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/trigger-bulk-remediation-insights.md), and [DEX remedial actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/dex-remedial-actions.md) for more details.

-   **Metric Analyzer**

    Investigate device and application metrics interactively when no metric rule has been authored yet. See [View collected metrics with Metrics analyzer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/view-dex-metrics.md) and [DEX remedial actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/dex-remedial-actions.md) for more details.
