# Set up page-level monitoring

Set up monitoring of the application performance at a specific page level. When collected, you can view the performance metrics data in the Metrics analyzer and device or application view.

## Before you begin

DEX browser extension must be installed on the end-user devices.

The application must be already in the list of monitored applications in **Application Management**.

2.  In the primary navigation pane, select the DEX Administration icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-administration.png"\] Alt text:\).

3.  On the Application management card, select **Configure applications**.

    The list of monitored applications appears.

4.  On the DEX Application Management screen, select a web application from the list.

5.  In the Edit web application form, select **Configure** under **Enable page-level monitoring**.

6.  On DEX Application Pages, select **New**.
