# Configure the Standard change model

Configure the Standard change model to manage the pre-defined templates that requesters use to create Standard changes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_itsm\_chg\_admin.change\_models\_config, sn\_itsm\_chg\_admin.admin, or admin

## About this task

Standard changes are pre-approved and accessed through templates rather than a change type picker. Requesters select a template directly to create a Standard change. Because Standard changes bypass the approval workflow, the model doesn't include availability, approval, or automatic task settings.

## Procedure

1.  Open the **Standard** change model in the Configuration Console.

    For navigation steps, see [Configure change models for Simplified Change Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/configure-change-models-scm.md).

2.  In the **New** section, review the templates listed under Templates that use this change model.

    Each template pre-fills common fields and follows the Standard change model's workflow. Requesters select a template to create a Standard change.

3.  To add a template, select **New template**.

    For steps to configure a template, see [Create and propose a change template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/create-change-template.md).

4.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The Standard change model configuration is saved. Requesters access Standard changes only through the templates listed in the **New** section.
