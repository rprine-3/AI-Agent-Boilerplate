    The user can enable or disable notifications by category. The categories shown in the notification preferences screen are defined in the **Notifications** \[sysevent\_email\_action\] table. The screen to the left shows all the reference categories defined on this table. The screen to the right shows the record matching the selected category.

    After you have updated your system property, your users will be able to enable or disable notifications by the defined categories.
