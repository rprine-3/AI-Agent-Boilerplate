# Continual Improvement Workbench

The Continual Improvement Workbench provides a consolidated view to plan, approve, monitor, and review improvements using a flexible user interface.

The workbench shows tile and list views of improvements in progress, under review, and in the backlog to help you plan and monitor improvements. The workbench can be customized for tasks such as planning meetings and providing status updates to stakeholders.

Shows two groups of improvements.

-   Tiles in Implement and On Hold states.
-   Listings in Review state.

This list can be customized in the Workbench Review list layout.


 Use this section for daily monitoring and assessment of improvements being implemented, as well as those recently implemented that are in review.

Planning tab

</td><td>

Lists two groups of improvements.

-   Listings in Implement and On Hold states.
-   Listing for backlog \(New, Accepted, Assess, and Approved states\).

 Use this section for ranking and prioritization of improvements in the Implement state, or in the backlog \(improvement initiatives in Approved, Assess, Accepted, and New states, listed in that order\).

</table>## CIM Workbench Overview

\[Omitted image "cim-workbench-plan.png"\] Alt text: CIM Workbench Overview

The workbench Overview displays up to 12 improvement initiatives by default in a tile layout. Each tile shows the initiative name, percentage of completion, assignment, priority, and time left for completion.

The percentage of completion is based on the total planned duration of all CIM tasks in each phase of the improvement. For example, if a task in a phase that has a planned duration of 10 days is 100% complete in 10 days, and if another task in the same phase has a planned duration of 5 days and is 0% complete in 10 days, the phase to which these tasks belong will show as 50% complete.

**Note:** Percentage completion values are shown per phase for every improvement.

Color-coded status badges on improvement initiative tiles highlight improvements that require attention.

|Badge name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|Complete|All tasks have been completed \(100 % complete\).|
|Overdue|Completion due date has passed.|
|Due soon|Less than 15% time is left until the due date.|
|On Hold|Improvement has been placed on hold.|

You can search improvements by keyword and sort them by rank, priority, due date, or effort estimate.

## CIM Workbench Planning

\[Omitted image "continual-improvement-workbench.png"\] Alt text: CIM Workbench Planning

The workbench Planning page enables you to prioritize your backlog using an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface, similar to sprint planning. The planned end date is color-coded in red or green to highlight the completion date of an improvement. You can search initiatives by keyword, move items up or down within a list, and group multiple items together.

You can also move items or a group of items from one list to another. Moving improvements between lists changes the state of improvements. For example, moving an item from the Backlog to Work in Progress list changes the state from **Approved** to **Implement**. Conversely, moving an item from Work in Progress back to the Backlog list changes the state to **Approved**.

**Note:** Only approved items can be moved from the Backlog list to the Implement list.
