# Create application records from improvement initiatives

Create records for integrated applications from improvement initiatives or CIM tasks to transform improvement initiatives into broader, actionable efforts to enable improvements across teams and processes.

    -   CIM task: **All** &gt; **Continual Improvement** &gt; **CIM Tasks**
2.  Find and open the Improvement Initiative or CIM task record from which you want to create an application record.

3.  Create an application record by selecting the corresponding application record link in the Related Links section.
