# Applications integrated with Continual Improvement Management

CIM provides integrations with other ServiceNow® applications to enable you to create improvement initiatives from these applications. You can also create records for integrated applications from improvement initiatives.

You can link multiple tasks from integrated applications to a single CIM task and link multiple CIM tasks to a single integrated application task.
