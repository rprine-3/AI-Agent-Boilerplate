## Accept improvement request

In the process of reviewing KPI performance in the Performance Analytics application, the incident manager noticed the **Average time to resolve an incident** KPI scorecard was too high \(24 hours\).

As part of the acceptance process, the Improvement Manager determined that KPI performance improvement aligned with the Automation/Effort Reduction strategic objective, assigned the Improvement Coordinator that drives KPI improvements, and accepted the improvement request.
