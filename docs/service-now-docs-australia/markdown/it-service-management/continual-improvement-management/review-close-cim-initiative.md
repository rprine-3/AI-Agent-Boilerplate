# Review and close an improvement

Once all tasks in each phase of the improvement have been completed, the Improvement Coordinator sets the improvement to review for the Improvement Manager to close.

## Before you begin

-   Incident manager created an improvement request.
-   Improvement Manager accepted and assigned the improvement request.
-   Approver group member approved the improvement.
-   Improvement Manager and Improvement Coordinator implemented the improvement.

Role required: sn\_cim.improvement\_manager, sn\_cim.improvement\_coordinator

## Procedure

1.  Review the improvement for closure.

    1.  Navigate to **Continual Improvement** &gt; **Under Review**.

    2.  In the Improvement Register list, open the improvement in the **Monitor/Review** state.

    3.  On the Improvement Initiative form, verify that all phases in the CIM Phases related list are 100% complete.

2.  Verify the improvement has met the improvement goal.

3.  Close the improvement.

    1.  In the Closure Notes tab, set the closure code, achieved outcome category, and close notes.

    2.  Click **Close** in the header bar to close the improvement.

        The improvement is no longer shown in the Open Improvement Register list.

## Close improvement

In the process of reviewing KPI performance in the Performance Analytics application, the Incident Manager noticed the **Average time to resolve an incident** KPI scorecard was too long \(24 hours\).

As part of the review process for **Improve average time to resolve an incident by 25%** improvement, the Improvement Manager verified the work for the improvement is complete \(Improvement Initiative form and CIM Phases related list shows 100% complete\).

The Improvement Manager also verified the improvement in two places before closing the improvement.

-   Performance Analytics now shows that the **Average time to resolve an incident** KPI has a value of 16 hours, which is more improvement than the target value of 18 hours \(18 hours is 25% faster than the previous average of 24 hours\).
-   Benchmarks application now shows that the company result for the **Average time to resolve an incident** KPI has a value of 16 hours, which is 2 hours better than the global industry average.
