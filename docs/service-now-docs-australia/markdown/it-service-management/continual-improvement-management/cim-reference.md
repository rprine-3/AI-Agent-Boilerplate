</table>## CIM task states

An improvement contains of one or more [CIM tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/continual-improvement-management/implement-cim-initiative.md) to complete the improvement. A CIM task is assigned to an owner to be responsible for the work specified.

The state of a CIM task indicates the level of progress for the task.

<table id="table_mps_55c_cdb"><thead><tr><th>

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Pending

</td><td>

State of a CIM task added before the improvement has been approved.

 If a CIM task is added after the improvement is approved, the CIM task is set to Pending state until the improvement is approved again.

 Once approved, the CIM task is set to Open state.

 If rejected, the CIM task remains in the Pending state.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Open

</td><td>

State of a new CIM task for an improvement that has been approved.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Work in Progress

</td><td>

State of a CIM task for which work has begun.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed Complete

</td><td>

State of a closed CIM task that has been completed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed Incomplete

</td><td>

State of a closed CIM task that has been closed but not fully completed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed Skipped

</td><td>

State of a closed CIM task for which no work has been done.

</td></tr><tr><td>

On Hold

</td><td>

State of a CIM task for an improvement set to On Hold state.

 The state of a CIM task on hold can be manually changed to Open or Work In Progress states.

**Note:** When an improvement is placed on hold, all active CIM tasks \(not closed or canceled\) are also placed on hold, but the state can be changed manually.

When the improvement is taken off hold, all active CIM tasks \(not closed or canceled\) are set to Open state \(unless they were changed manually\).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## CIM approver states

Each improvement needs at least one [approval](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/r_Approvals.md) to progress to the Implement state. The Approvers related list in the improvement contains a list of user approval records and the state of the approval.

The users in the Approvers related list belong to the **Approver Group** specified on the Improvement Initiative form. Once the improvement has been approved by an Approver Group member, approval from other members is no longer required to progress the improvement. However, other Approver Group members can still set their individual approval state.

To require additional approvers, configure the CIM Approval workflow in [Flow Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/flow-designer.md).
