# View snapshots

View the snapshots of all deployables for an application on the **Details** tab for the application. The release pipeline can access only a snapshot that is the currently published version.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: cdm\_viewer

## Procedure

1.  Open an application and select the **Snapshots** tab.

    The tab lists all deployables that are associated with the application. Each deployable displays a short list of its snapshots. Select **Show all** to view the full list of snapshots.

 **Tip:** You can edit the name on the **Details** tab. Select the snapshot name to open the tab.
