# Types of differences between CDM applications

Descriptions and examples of differences between CDM applications when using the Config Data Analyzer tool.

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

## Types of differences

On the **App compare** tab, the **CDIs and variables** tab displays changes to individual CDIs for the node that is selected in the navigation panel. The **Description** column displays one of the following values that describes how the changesets differ.

-   **Values are different**

    Both the reference and target changesets include a particular CDI, but the values differ between the two changesets. See the **Reference** and **Target** columns for the values.

-   **Encryption settings are different**

    The **View encrypted data** setting is selected for one changeset and not selected for the other changeset.

    **Note:** For users that do not have the CDM Secrets \[sn\_cdm.cdm\_secrets\] role, encrypted data always appears as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

-   **Source levels are different**

    One of the following cases:

    -   The value is direct in one changeset and is overridden in the other changeset.
    -   The value is direct in one changeset and is included in the other changeset.
-   **Source levels and values are different**

    In addition to the cases described in "Source levels are different", the value differs between changesets.

-   **Target only**

    A CDI or the value for a CDI appears only in the target changeset.

-   **Reference only**

    A CDI or the value for a CDI appears only in the reference changeset.
