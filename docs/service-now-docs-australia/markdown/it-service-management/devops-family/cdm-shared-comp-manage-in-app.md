# Manage shared components in a CDM application

Add a shared component to an application, view shared components that are available to add, or remove a shared component from an application.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Roles required: CDM Editor \[sn\_cdm.cdm\_editor\]

## About this task

-   While working in an application changeset, you can add, update, or remove a shared component.
-   While working in an application changeset, you cannot modify a shared component in the same way as you can modify a direct component. A collection in an application can, however, override any value in a shared component. Also, you cannot rename a shared component in an application. If such a change is needed, a new shared component with the required name must be created, and then added again in the application.

All of these changes are withing the application changeset.

## Procedure

1.  While working on the **Config data** tab for an application changeset, select the shared components icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-shared-components-panel.png"\] Alt text: Shared components icon.\).

    -   Each card on a Shared components tab displays the name, parent component library, and version for a shared component.
    -   Components are grouped by library and are sorted alphabetically.
    -   Use the **Libraries** selector to display only components in the selected library.
    -   Use the **Search** text box to filter the list of components or libraries.
    \[Omitted image "cdm-shared-components-panel.png"\] Alt text: Viewing available shared components

    -   **Available:** List of shared components that the application can include in its config data.

        For a shared component to be available for use in applications, the component must be in the **Published** state and the library that holds the component must be in the **Available** state.

    -   **In use:** List of shared components that are currently used in the application.
    -   **Updates:** A card appears when a newer published version of a component is available. Select the **refresh** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-refresh.png"\] Alt text: refresh icon\) to ensure that you’re viewing all current updates.
2.  Add a shared component to application data: On the **Available** tab, select **Add**.

    -   The component is added to the **components** folder in the application.
    -   The shared component icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-shared-component.png"\] Alt text: shared component icon\) indicates that the component comes from a component library.
    -   The component is selected and the **Editor** and **Preview** panels display the code of the shared component.
3.  View the config data in a shared component: On any card, select the additional actions menu \(\[Omitted image "icon-actions-menu.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions menu icon\) and then select **View config data**.

    A pop-up displays the latest published version of the shared component code. Variables are not resolved and encrypted data is not decrypted in the pop-up view.

4.  Remove a shared component: Use either of the following methods to remove a shared component from the application data.

    -   On the **In use** tab, select the **X** in the component card and then confirm the action in the pop-up.
    -   On the **Config data** tab for an application, select the **Actions** menu \(\[Omitted image "icon-actions-menu.png"\] Alt text: Actions menu icon.\) for the component and then select **Remove**. Confirm the action in the pop-up.
    **Note:** Removal is not deletion. Removal takes the component's config data out of the application, but the component remains unchanged in the component library. When you remove a component from an application, the component card reappears on the **Available** tab.

5.  Update a shared component.

    Select the **refresh** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-refresh.png"\] Alt text: refresh icon\) to ensure that you’re viewing all current updates. The system indicates that a newer published version of a component is available in the following ways:

    -   Highlighted text "Update" appears next to the component in the **components** folder.
    -   The **Updates** tab displays a card for the component.
    -   The pop-up for committing a changeset includes a notification: "One or more of the shared components have updates available".
    Follow this procedure to review the updated config data and then update a component:

    1.  On the **Updates** tab, select **Update** for the component.

    2.  Review the information on the Update a shared component pop-up and then select **Update**.

        -   The **Details** tab displays name and version information.
        -   The **Latest config data** tab displays the latest version of the shared component code. In the view, variables are not resolved and encrypted data is not decrypted.
6.  Commit the application changeset to generate a snapshot containing all these changes.

    The system generates a snapshot of each deployable that is affected by the changes.
