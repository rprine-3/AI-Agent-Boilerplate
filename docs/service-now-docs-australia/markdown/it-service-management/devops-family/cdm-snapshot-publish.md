# Publish or unpublish a snapshot

Publish a snapshot so that it can be exported to enable the CI/CD pipeline to access and use the config data. Exporters can execute only on published snapshots.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: CDM Editor \[sn\_cdm.cdm\_editor\] or CDM Admin \[sn\_cdm.cdm\_admin\]

## About this task

-   You publish a snapshot when you feel that the deployable that it represents is ready to export to the pipeline.
-   While defining or updating a deployable, you can specify that only validated snapshots can be published.
-   A deployable must be connected to a service to publish its snapshots.
-   If a published deployable is disconnected from services, then you can perform the following actions, but cannot publish snapshots of the deployable until it is connected to a service:
    -   Edit config data.
    -   Create snapshots.
    -   Validate snapshots.
    -   Fix validation errors.

**Tip:** You can add a text description of a snapshot or rename it on the **Details** tab for the snapshot.

-   When exporters look for the latest snapshot, they should look for the latest `created` snapshot that is published.
-   The published\_date is the data at which the publish happens.
-   The unpublish snapshot action removes the publish flag and removes the published\_date value.

## Procedure

1.  Use either of the following methods to publish a snapshot:

    -   On any tab for an open snapshot, select **Publish**.
    -   On the **Version** tab for an application, select **Publish** from the **Actions** menu for the snapshot.
