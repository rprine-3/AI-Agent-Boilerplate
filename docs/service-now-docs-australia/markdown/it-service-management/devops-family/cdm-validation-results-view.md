# View the results of snapshot validation

View validation failures and warnings on the **Validation results** tab for the snapshot.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: cdm\_viewer or cdm\_editor or cdm\_exporter\_editor or cdm\_policy\_editor or cdm\_admin

## Procedure

1.  On the **Snapshots** tab for an application, select the snapshot to open the **Validation results** tab.

2.  View failure and warning information on the **Validation results** tab for the snapshot.

    The **Policies** panel displays a card for each policy that is mapped to the associated deployable.
