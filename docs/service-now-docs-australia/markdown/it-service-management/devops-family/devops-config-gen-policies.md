# Generic policies in DevOps Config

By default, the DevOps Config Policy content pack contains a set of generic policies to validate your configuration data.

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

You can use or customize these default DevOps Config policies to validate that your configuration data content is conformable, or [administrate the full life cycle of PaCE policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/pace-managing-policies.md).

**Note:** You can’t modify the default policies. However, you can make a copy of the policy and customize your copy.

-   When the operator is `!=` or `<>`, the policy is compliant when the key value does not match the reference input value.
-   When the operator is `IN`, the policy is compliant when the key value is included in the reference input list.
-   When the operator is `NOT IN`, the policy is compliant when the key value is not included in the reference input list.
-   When the operator is `CONTAINS`, the policy is compliant when the key value contains the reference input value.
-   When the operator is `NOT CONTAINS`, the policy is compliant when the key value does not contain the reference input value.
