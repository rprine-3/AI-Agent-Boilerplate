# Compare config data of two CDM applications

Use the Config Data Analyzer tool to find similarities and differences between the config data of two applications. You can compare either different applications or different changesets of a particular application.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required:cdm\_viewer, cdm\_editor, or cdm\_admin

## Procedure

1.  While viewing an application, select **Compare config data**.

    The **Compare config data** tab opens.

    The current application \(the application that you started with, **Demo\_App1** in the example\) is called the target. The application to compare to the target is called the reference application. The **Target application** field is set as the latest committed data for the target and is read-only.

    \[Omitted image "cdm-app-compare-tab2.png"\] Alt text: Compare config data tab for setting up the comparison between the target application, Demo\_App1 and a reference application, Demo\_App2.

2.  Select the **Latest data model** option in the **Compare type** field.

3.  Select a reference application \(**Demo\_App2** in the example\).

    The **Reference application** selection list includes the latest committed data for all applications except the target application.

4.  Select the folder icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-folder.png"\] Alt text: folder icon\) to specify a folder path for comparison.

5.  Select **Apply variables** to display fully resolved variable values in the comparison results.

6.  If you've the cdm\_secrets role, you can select **View encrypted data** to view encrypted values in clear text in the comparison results.

    **Note:** The check box is inactive for users who do not have the cdm\_secrets role. When the values in the target and reference differ, the comparison results indicate that the values differ, but the data itself still appears as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

7.  Select **Compare**.

    The Comparison results section displays the differences between the reference changeset and the target changeset.

    **Important:** If you commit changes to a reference application while the **Compare config data** tab is open: When you return to the **Compare config data** tab and select **Compare**, the comparison is performed on the most recently committed changeset, and the updated results are displayed in the results section.

    The letters in the following illustration identify the tools that you can use to analyze the data.

    -   **A. Navigation panel**

        The navigation panel displays the node structure of the applications.

        -   Nodes that include changed CDIs \(either directly or in descendent nodes\) are annotated with **Different**.
        -   Nodes that include newly added CDIs \(either directly or in descendent nodes\) are annotated with the identity of the application changeset that includes the new data, either **Reference** or **Target**.
        -   Use the **Search** field to search for text in the navigation panel.
        -   Select a node to view its contents in the Differences panel.
    -   **B: Differences panel**

        -   By default, all config data is displayed. Select **Diff only** to view only data that differs between the two changesets.
        -   Use the **Search** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-search.png"\] Alt text: Search icon\) to search for text in the Component differences panel.
        -   The panel offers two tabs: **Data model** and **CDIs and variables**. In either tab, expand and close groupings with the expansion icon \(\[Omitted image "cdm-icon-expand.png"\] Alt text: expansion icon\).
        -   If a selection includes more than 50 CDIs, then CDIs are organized into pages of 50.
        The **Data model** tab displays changes to the structure of the application at the folder level, such as, adding, deleting, or renaming a folder.

Differences

</td><td>

The path of the structure for which differences are described.

Text that describes any differences between the reference and target changesets.

Folder

</td><td>

The folder in the structure.

Source level \(Reference/Target\)

</td><td>

-   Direct: The folder is explicitly specified or deleted in the node.
-   Included: The folder is included from a child folder.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>        The **CDIs and variables** tab displays changes to individual CDIs for the node that is selected in the navigation panel.

        -   By default, the root node is selected and the data panel includes all CDIs for both changesets. Select a node in the navigation panel to display data for only that node and its descendents.
        -   When **Diff only** is selected, the number of CDIs that differ appears after the node path.
        -   Node paths are displayed in gray. Use the expansion icon \(\[Omitted image "cdm-icon-expand.png"\] Alt text: expansion icon\) to view CDIs in a folder.

Differences

</td><td>

Indicator to show where the differences are.-   Target: The CDI appears only in the target changeset.
-   Reference: The CDI appears only in the reference changeset.
-   Different: For the specified CDI, the values in the target and reference changesets differ.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Statement of how the changesets differ. For example, the text might indicate that a CDI appears only in the reference changeset or that the values for variable differ between the changesets. See [Types of differences between CDM applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-family/cdm-cda-diff-types.md) for the full list of difference types and their causes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the CDI.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reference \(R\)

</td><td>

Value of the CDI in the reference changeset.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target \(T\)

</td><td>

Value of the CDI in the target changeset.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source level \(R/T\)

</td><td>

The node level in the code at which the CDI is defined. -   Direct: The CDI is defined in the selected node.
-   Include: The value of the CDI is obtained from a node that is included in the selected node.
-   Override: The value of the CDI in an included node is overridden by a value that is specified in the including node.
 Values appear in the following formats:

 -   `<reference level / target level>` when a value appears in both target and reference.
-   `<reference level>` when a value appears in only the reference changeset.
-   `<target level>` when a value appears in only the target changeset.
 For example, when a CDI is defined in the reference changeset with the value `true` and the CDI does not appear in the target changeset, then the last three columns in **CDIs and variables** tab will have the following values:

-   **Reference \(R\)**: `true`
-   **Target \(T\)**: \[Empty\]
-   **Source level \(R/T\)**: `Direct`
