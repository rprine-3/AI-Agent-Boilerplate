# Set the purge period for records of exporter executions

Change the default deletion period. By default, records of exporter executions are deleted after a period of three years.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: CDM Admin \[sn\_cdm.cdm\_admin\]

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Maintenance** &gt; **Table Cleanup**.

2.  In the **Tablename** column, select **sn\_cdm\_exporter\_execution**.

3.  Change the **Age** setting to the retention period in seconds and then save the record.

    Minimum: 1 year. For example:

    -   1 year = 31 536 000
    -   2 years = 63 072 000
    -   3 years = 94 608 000
