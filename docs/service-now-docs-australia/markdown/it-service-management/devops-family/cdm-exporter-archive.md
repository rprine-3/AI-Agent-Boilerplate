# Archive an exporter

Archive an exporter to preserve its record and remove it from the lists that you use in your everyday work.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: cdm\_exporter\_editor, or cdm\_editor, or cdm\_admin

## About this task

-   You can archive only exporters that have standard runs.
-   You can copy and test run an archived exporter. You cannot use the API to run an archived exporter.
-   You cannot perform the export operation using an archived exporter.
-   You cannot delete, modify, publish, or rename an archived exporter or any of its versions.
-   You cannot create new draft of or reuse the name of an archived exporter.
-   To restore an exporter for normal use, set its **State** value to **Active** and publish a version.

## Procedure

1.  While working on an exporter on the **Exporter builder** tab or while viewing a list of exporters, select the exporter and then select **Archive**.

    The **State** value of the exporter is set to **Archived**.
