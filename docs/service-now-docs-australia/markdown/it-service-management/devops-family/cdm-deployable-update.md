# Update the associations for a deployable

Update the name and description of a deployable as well as its associations with applications and other items. This procedure is optional.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: cdm\_policy\_editor or cdm\_editor or cdm\_admin

## About this task

This optional procedure explains how to update the details of a deployable definition. For information on configuring the data in a deployable, see [Create and update a deployable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-family/cdm-deployable-define.md).

**Note:** You cannot change the SDLC environment type \(development, test, or production\) of a deployable because such a change would have significant impact. For example, mapped policies and their inputs might differ significantly between test and production versions of a config dataset.

## Procedure

1.  On the **Settings** tab for an application, select **Deployables** in the tree view.

2.  Select the check box for the deployable, select **Edit**, and then update the settings for the deployable.
