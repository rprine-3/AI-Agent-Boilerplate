# Delete an exporter

Delete an exporter to ensure that users cannot use it to generate config data.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: cdm\_exporter\_editor or cdm\_editor or cdm\_admin

## About this task

-   You cannot delete, modify, or activate exporters that are included in the CDM content pack. Exporters in the content pack have a **Source** value of **ServiceNow**.
-   If an exporter has performed a standard execution, you cannot delete it. This ensures a complete and accurate audit trail. You can archive an exporter that has performed a standard execution. See [Archive an exporter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-family/cdm-exporter-archive.md).
-   If an exporter does not have a standard execution, then you can delete all draft versions and published versions by deleting the exporter.
-   You can delete any draft version of an exporter.

**Tip:** You cannot generate a draft version of a content pack exporter, but you can duplicate one and edit draft versions of the duplicate. Editing a duplicate of a content pack exporter is a good way to create a custom exporter. See [Create a custom exporter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-family/cdm-exporter-create-custom.md).

## Procedure

1.  Use either of the following methods to delete all versions of an exporter: While working on an exporter on the **Exporter builder** tab or viewing a list of exporters, select the exporter and then select **Delete**.

    -   While working on an exporter on the **Exporter builder** tab, select **Delete**.
    -   While viewing a list of exporters, select the exporter and then select **Delete**.
    All versions of the exporter are deleted and the exporter is no longer listed on the **Versions** tab.

2.  To delete only a particular draft version of an exporter, select the version, select **Delete draft**, and then confirm the action.
