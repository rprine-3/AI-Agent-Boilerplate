# Compare two snapshots of a deployable

Use the Config Data Analyzer tool to find changes between two snapshots of a deployable of an application.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

There must be more than one snapshot available in a deployable to compare and the target snapshot must not be the first snapshot in the deployable.

Role required: cdm\_viewer, cdm\_editor, or cdm\_admin

## About this task

To compare snapshots from different deployables or applications, see [Compare snapshots from the same or different applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-family/cdm-cda-snapshots-compare.md).

## Procedure

1.  While viewing an application, select the **Snapshots** tab.

2.  Open a snapshot of a deployable.

3.  In the Snapshot record page, select the **Config data changes** tab.

    The current snapshot is auto-populated in the **Target snapshot** field.

    \[Omitted image "cdm-snapshot-compare-change.png"\] Alt text: Compare config data tab for comparing application snapshots.

4.  Select another snapshot in the **Reference snapshot** field.

    The **Reference snapshot** field lists all snapshots that are older than the target snapshot. The **Reference snapshot** field is inactive when older snapshots are not available. Even if newer snapshots created after the target snapshots exist in the deployable, they are not listed.

5.  If you've the cdm\_secrets role, you can select **View encrypted data** to view encrypted values in clear text in the comparison results.

    **Note:** The check box is inactive for users who don’t have the cdm\_secrets role. When the values in the target and reference differ, the comparison results indicate that the values differ, but the data itself still appears as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

6.  Select **Compare**.

    The Config data changes section displays the comparison results. It shows the changes between the selected reference and target snapshots.

    The following image displays the Config data changes section that contains the comparison result that you can use to analyze the data.

    \[Omitted image "cdm-snapshot-compare-change-result.png"\] Alt text: The Configuration data changes section, which includes a navigation panel and a changes panel, displays the comparison result.

    -   **A: Navigation panel**

        The navigation panel displays the node structure of the deployable.

        -   Nodes that include changed CDIs \(either directly or in descendent nodes\) are annotated with **Edited**.
        -   Nodes that include newly added CDIs \(either directly or in descendent nodes\) are annotated with **Added**.
        You can search for a node name in the **Search** field. Select a node to view its contents in the Changes panel.

    -   **B: Changes panel**

        The panel displays a list of changes to individual CDIs for the node that is selected in the navigation panel.

        -   By default, the root node is selected and the data panel includes all CDIs for both snapshots. Select a node in the navigation panel to display data for only that node and its descendents.
        -   Node paths are displayed in gray. Use the expansion icon \(\[Omitted image "cdm-icon-expand.png"\] Alt text: expansion icon\) to view CDIs in a folder.
        -   When **Changes only** is selected, the number of CDIs that have changes appears after the node path.
        -   When **Script view** is selected, the list view toggles to editor view.
