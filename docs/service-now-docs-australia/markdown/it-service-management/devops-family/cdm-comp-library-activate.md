# Activate a component library

Activate a component library to make all of its shared components available for use.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Washington D.C. release, DevOps Config is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Role required: cdm\_admin

## About this task

A library can be in the Unavailable state in the following situations:

-   When a library is created for the first time
-   When a library and its components are being created
-   When a newer version of the library is being created

If a library is unavailable, no component within that library can be used, updated, or exported. However, it does not impact applications that are already using components within this library.

When the library is ready for use, you can activate it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **DevOps Config** &gt; **DevOps Config Workspace**.

2.  Click the component libraries icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-component-libraries.png"\] Alt text: Component libraries icon.\) in the left navigation to open the **Component libraries** tab.

3.  In the left pane, select a component library.

4.  Select the **Available** toggle switch to make the library available so that its shared components can be used in applications.


## Result

-   The library and the shared components in it become available for use.
-   The status of the library is set as Available.
