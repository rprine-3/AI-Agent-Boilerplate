# Deploy the similarity model

Deploy the Similar incidents model to predict the similar records for the incidents. 

## Before you begin

You must access the model and set the preferences for your model. For more information on setting model preferences, see [Assess the similarity model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/task-intelligence-for-itsm/assess-the-similarity-model.md).

Role required: sn\_ti\_admin.tia\_admin or admin 

## Procedure

1.  Review your choices from the previous pages and information about how the model was trained.

    \[Omitted image "TI\_deploy\_similarity\_model\_page.png"\] Alt text: UI of the page to review the model's information. It shows "How this model was trained" and "What your model will do."

2.  Select **Deploy** to deploy the model.


## Result

A pop-up appears confirming that your model was deployed.

## What to do next

After you deploy the model, view its predictions and performance in the following places:

-   To monitor prediction accuracy and model performance over time, navigate to **All** &gt; **Task Intelligence for ITSM** &gt; **Monitoring**. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analytics for Task Intelligence for ITSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/task-intelligence-for-itsm/task-intel-monitor-analystics.md).
-   To surface similar records to agents, open an incident in Service Operations Workspace. Recommendations appear in the side panel when the configured recommendation uses the model.
