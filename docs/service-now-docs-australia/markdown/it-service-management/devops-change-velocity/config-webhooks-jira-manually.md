# Configure webhooks in Jira manually

Configure webhooks in your Jira Server or Jira Cloud instance to send sync notifications to the DevOps Change Velocity application.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_devops.admin or sn\_devops.tool\_owner in DevOps Change Velocity.
-   Jira admin role in your Jira Server or Jira Cloud instance.

## About this task

If you have connected your Jira tool using OAuth 2.0 based authentication, the webhooks are created for the OAuth 2.0 integration app in Jira when you configure automatically, whereas if you have connected using basic authentication, the webhooks are created for all your projects in Jira. If you choose to configure the webhooks manually for a Jira tool created using OAuth 2.0 based authentication, a duplicate webhook may get created.

## Procedure

1.  In DevOps Change Velocity, in the Configure to send data playbook activity, select **Configure manually** when configuring the tool instance to send data.

    \[Omitted image "jira-plybk-05.png"\] Alt text: Jira webhook configuration.

    **Note:** You can also access manual configuration from the Jira tool record in DevOps Change Velocity. From the tool record, select **Configure** &gt; **Configure manually**.

2.  Copy the **Webhook URL** field from the ServiceNow instance connection details for Jira.

    **Note:** Select **Copy** in the appropriate field to copy the value to your clipboard. The field label changes to **Copied**, but you can copy multiple times.

    -   For Jira Cloud instance, navigate to **Settings** &gt; **System** &gt; **WebHooks**.
4.  Select **Create a WebHook**.
