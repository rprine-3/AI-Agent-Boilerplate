# DevOps test tool integration

Test tool integration lets you view test results in DevOps for Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and GitLab unit, functional, and performance tests.

For GitLab and Jenkins, only JUnit test type integration is supported.

**Note:** For other test types, use the [DevOps - POST /devops/tool/\{capability\}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/devops-api.md) endpoint of the [DevOps API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/devops-api.md).

-   Selenium tests run and published using TestNG are reported by the Jenkins plugin for ServiceNow DevOps.
-   Test type categorization is supported.
-   Additional tests results reported by tools, such as Apache JMeter, can be processed in DevOps using custom Workflow Studio subflows \(no pipeline changes required\).

 **Note:**

-   For GitLab and Jenkins, only the JUnit test type integration is supported.
-   For ADO, GitHub, and GitHub Enterprise, the JUnit, NUnit, XUnit, and Unit test type integrations are supported.

 You can change the default test type by modifying the **\[sn\_devops.default\_test\_type\]** [DevOps property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-administration.md).

</table>## Test type mapping

The test type mapping connects the test type and entity being tested with the DevOps tool \(**DevOps** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Test Type Mappings** module.\)

\[Omitted image "test-type-mappings.png"\] Alt text: Test type mappings

An accurate test type mapping ensures that the test type always appears as intended in the test summary results.

Path to the generated test result file on the Jenkins server.

 This is useful so test reports with attributes that don't conform to JUnit or TestNG implementation, such as JMeter for example, can still be leveraged by DevOps.

 Separate multiple files by a comma.

 **Note:** You must use a Workflow Studio subflow to transform a raw test payload.

## Transforming a raw test payload

You can transform a raw test report \(a report containing attributes that do not conform to JUnit or TestNG implementation\), such as JMeter for example, by configuring the **DevOps Test Subflow Policy** decision table to call a custom subflow \(**Decision Tables** &gt; **Decision Tables** module\).

**Note:** You must create the custom Workflow Studio subflow that transforms the raw test payload.

If there is more than one test type in a performance stage, you can use the **DevOps Test Type Policy** decision table to configure the test type for each test so the test result payloads are transformed correctly.

Configuration

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

DevOps Test Subflow Policy

</td><td>

To automatically call a custom subflow that transforms the raw payload received by the tool.

 Decision inputs:

 -   Test Result Payload
-   Test Type

</td><td>

Create a decision that specifies the custom subflow to call when the raw payload is received.

 Set the conditions to contain fields that would be included in the raw payload.

 For example, to call Jenkins BZ Performance Test custom subflow:

 Conditions:

-   `Test Type is Load`

\(Load is the test type configured for performance tests\)

-   `Test Result Payload contains throughput`
-   `Test Result Payload contains concurrency`

 Answer: FLow: Jenkins BZ Performance Test

</td></tr><tr><td>

DevOps Test Type Policy

</td><td>

To automatically set test types when more than one type of test is configured in a performance test stage.

 This is necessary so the results for the second test type get transformed correctly.

 For example, when both a Load performance test and a JUnit performance test are mapped in the same DevOps step, the JUnit test results won't get formatted correctly unless a decision is created.

 Decision inputs:

-   Step
-   Test Result Payload
-   Tool Integration
-   Pipeline

</td><td>

Create a decision for each type of test in the performance test stage to set the test type.

 Load test:

-   Conditions:
    -   `Step is Perf Tests`
    -   `Test Result Payload contains throughput`
    -   `Test Result Payload contains concurrency`
-   Answer: `TestType: Load`


 JUnit test:

 -   Conditions:
    -   `Step is Perf Tests`
    -   `Test Result Payload does not contain throughput`
    -   `Test Result Payload does not contain concurrency`
-   Answer: `TestType: JUnit`

## Test summary results

You can view test summary results these ways.

-   **DevOps** &gt; **Test Results** module \(Test Summaries and Performance Test Summaries\).
-   [DevOps change request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-change-acceleration.md) - Test Results related list.
-   [DevOps Pipeline UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-pipeline-ui.md) - Quality tile.
