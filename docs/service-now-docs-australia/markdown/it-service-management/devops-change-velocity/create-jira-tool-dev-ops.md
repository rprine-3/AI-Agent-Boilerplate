</table>    2.  Select **Connect**.

        If the connection is successful, the tool is created in the DevOps Change Velocity and connected to your Jira instance.

    3.  Permission checks are run on the credentials that you entered.

        Permissions required and permissions that are available are displayed. If you want to enter credentials with better permissions, select **Re-enter credentials**. For detailed information on all the required permissions, see Jira permissions in [Permissions required for DevOps tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/tool-req-permission.md).

        \[Omitted image "jira-plybk-07.png"\] Alt text: Permission checks for connecting to Jira.

    4.  Select **Next**.

5.  Specify the access for the tool.

    1.  If you want to control access to the tool, add the groups that must be given access to the tool in the **Maintained by** field.

        The tasks these users in the groups can perform depends on the role assigned to them.

        -   DevOps Tool Owner role: Can view and edit the tool.
        -   DevOps App Owner role: Can view the tool and can associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects \(such as plans, repositories, and pipelines\).
        -   DevOps Administrator role: Can edit all tools.
        -   Other DevOps roles: Can view the tool.
        **Note:** If you don't select a group and skip this step, all users with the DevOps Tool Owner role will be able to edit the tool.

    2.  If you choose to control access to the tool, the **All App Owners can view and associate tool objects to applications** option becomes available for selection.

        This option enables all users having the DevOps App Owner role to access the tool. If selected, they’ll be able to view, associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects.

    3.  Select **Assign**.

        \[Omitted image "jira-plybk-04.png"\] Alt text: Specify tool access.

6.  To send data in real time between DevOps and your Jira instance, select **Configure**.

    This action does the following:

    -   Registers a webhook between your Jira and ServiceNow instances, and enables real-time data transfer between the two.
    -   If you have connected your Jira tool using OAuth 2.0 based authentication, the webhooks are created for the OAuth 2.0 integration app in Jira when you configure automatically. And if you have connected using basic authentication, the webhooks are created for all your projects in Jira. If you choose to configure the webhooks manually for a Jira tool created using OAuth 2.0 based authentication, a duplicate webhook may get created.
    All the discovered Jira projects are listed as Plans.

    If you don’t choose to configure now, you can enable nightly polling later to fetch data for any tracked plans by setting the **Enable Polling** system property to **Yes**.

    \[Omitted image "jira-plybk-05.png"\] Alt text: Configure Jira instance.

    To configure manually, select **Configure manually**. See [Configure webhooks in Jira manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/config-webhooks-jira-manually.md) for more information.

    **Important:**

    -   If you're connecting from the Home page or Tools module, the connection is complete and you're taken to the Summary page.
    -   If you're connecting from the Applications module, then plans available in your Jira instance are discovered. You can track and import historical data from them.
7.  Select the plans to track.

    1.  Select the plans for which you want to track updates and associate to the application.

        After the tool onboarding is complete, the work items only for these selected plans are automatically imported.

    2.  Select **Next**.

        \[Omitted image "jira-plybk-03.png"\] Alt text: Select Plans from Jira to track.

    3.  If you want to import plan data, select the date range and select **Submit**.

        You can import up to 90 days of data.

        \[Omitted image "jira-plybk-09.png"\] Alt text: Import plan data.

8.  From the **Summary** page, select **View tool record** to review the details of the connected instance and the plans discovered from it.

    \[Omitted image "jira-plybk-06.png"\] Alt text: Connection summary.


## Result

You’ve successfully onboarded your Jira tool to DevOps Change Velocity.

## What to do next

From the tool record page, you can:

-   See the details and status of the tool.
-   **Discover** plans and **Configure** webhooks.

    **Note:**

    -   By default, projects are discovered in a set of 50 for Jira Cloud. 50 is the maximum pagination limit supported by Jira. If you want to reduce this value, then you should edit the respective constant in DevOpsCommonConstants script.
    -   Project and version data that are discovered aren't updated or tracked in real time.
-   Assign groups to control access to the tool using the **Maintained by** field.
-   Check credential permissions and update credentials for the tool. For more details, see [Check permissions and update credentials for tools — Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/update-credentials-check-permissions.md).
-   From the **Plans** tab, select a plan to view its details such as imported work items, features, and others.
-   To import historical data from the plans, associate the plans with an application, and import the data. For more information, see [Associate tool objects to applications - Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/apps-associate-objects-wkspc.md).

**Note:** It is recommended not to update the project key for projects in Jira. If the project key is updated, the updated object names will not reflect in DevOps Change Velocity. Only when the object is updated in Jira, the new name will reflect in DevOps Change Velocity.

-   **[Connect a Jira tool using OAuth 2.0 with 3LO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/connect-a-jira-tool-using-oauth-2-0-with-3lo.md)**  
Authenticate a Jira tool connection using OAuth 2.0 with three-legged OAuth \(3LO\) to enable secure, delegated access to your Jira account.
