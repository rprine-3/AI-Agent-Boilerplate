3.  Select **Next**.

    The DevOps playbook opens to help you complete the onboarding tasks.

4.  Enter your GitLab instance details.

    1.  Enter your GitLab instance URL.

    2.  In the **Credential type** field, select one.

        -   Basic Auth
        -   OAuth 2.0
    3.  Enter the credentials.

        -   Basic Auth: Enter the username and password/access token of your GitLab instance.

            **Note:** Only personal access token is supported. When you generate the token, select the scope API and grant read/write access including all the groups and projects, container registry, and package registry.

        -   OAuth 2.0: Enter your OAuth credential.

            For more information on OAuth2.0 credentials, see [Setting up GitLab OAuth 2.0 credentials for DevOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/setting-up-gitlab-oauth.md).

    4.  If your GitLab instance is attached to a MID Server, select the **MID Server** option and enter its details.

        For more information about MID server, see [MID Server selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_MIDServerSelector.md)

    5.  Select **Connect**.

        \[Omitted image "gitlab-connect-workspace-2.png"\] Alt text: Connect to Gitlab tool - Enter instance details screen

5.  Permission checks are run on the credentials that you entered.

    Permissions required and permissions that are available are displayed. If you want to enter credentials with better permissions, select **Re-enter credentials**. For detailed information on all the required permissions, see GitLab permissions in [Permissions required for DevOps tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/tool-req-permission.md).

    You can choose to continue with the tool connection even if you don't have all the required permissions.

6.  Select **Next**.

7.  Specify the access for the tool.

    1.  If you want to control access to the tool, add the groups that must be given access to the tool in the **Maintained by** field.

        The tasks these users in the groups can perform depends on the role assigned to them.

        -   DevOps Tool Owner role: Can view and edit the tool.
        -   DevOps App Owner role: Can view the tool and can associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects \(such as plans, repositories, and pipelines\).
        -   DevOps Administrator role: Can edit all tools.
        -   Other DevOps roles: Can view the tool.
        **Note:** If you don't select a group and skip this step, all users with the DevOps Tool Owner role will be able to edit the tool.

    2.  If you choose to control access to the tool, the **All App Owners can view and associate tool objects to applications** option becomes available for selection.

        This option enables all users having the DevOps App Owner role to access the tool. If selected, they’ll be able to view, associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects.

    3.  Select **Assign**.
    \[Omitted image "gitlab-connect-workspace-6.png"\] Alt text: Specify tool access

8.  Select the projects for which you want to configure webhooks automatically.

    You can also choose to enable nightly polling to retrieve data for any tracked pipelines by selecting the **Enable Polling** property option in the **Administration** module. See [DevOps Change Velocity properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-administration.md).

9.  Select **Configure**.

    \[Omitted image "gitlab-connect-workspace-4.png"\] Alt text: Connect to the Gitlab tool - configure screen

    To configure manually, select **Configure manually**. See [Configure webhooks in GitLab manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/configure-webhooks-in-gitlab.md) for more information.

    **Important:**

    -   If you're connecting from the Home page or Tools module, the connection is complete and you're taken to the Summary page.
    -   If you're connecting from the Applications module, then plans, repositories, and pipelines available in your project are discovered. You can track and import historical data from them.
10. Select the pipelines that you want to associate to the application, and select **Associate pipelines**.

    For each selected pipeline, all steps are imported for the last successful execution.

11. In the Assign services to pipeline steps activity, specify **Step type** and **Service** for each pipeline step.

    Completing this step as part of tool onboarding enables the DevOps Insights dashboards to show more meaningful data immediately.

12. Select the plans you want to associate to the application, and select **Associate plans**.

13. Select the repositories you want to associate to the application, and select **Associate repositories**.

14. In the Import historical data step, select the date range in the **Start date** and **End date** fields and select **Import data**.

    **Note:** You can import up to 90 days of data.

15. Select **Next**.

16. From the **Summary** page, review the details of the successfully connected GitLab tool.

    Select **View tool record** to review the details of the connected instance.
