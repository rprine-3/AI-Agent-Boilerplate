# Model a GitLab basic CI pipeline in DevOps

Model a GitLab basic CI pipeline by mapping the pipeline to an app, and mapping DevOps pipeline steps to GitLab pipeline jobs.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_devops.admin

## Procedure

1.  Map your pipeline to an app.

    1.  Navigate to **DevOps** &gt; **Apps &amp; Pipelines** &gt; **Apps** and open the application record to associate with the pipeline.

    2.  In the Pipelines related list, click **Edit...** to select a pipeline to associate with the app, or click **New** to create the pipeline.

        **Note:** While associating a pipeline with an app, the pipeline steps are also fetched during import.

        For a new pipeline, fill in the **Orchestration pipeline** field using the group name, subgroup name \(if applicable\), and project name as specified in GitLab.

        For example, `My Group/My SubGroup/My Project`.

        If a project is not under a group, simply specify `My Project`.

    3.  Click **Submit**.

2.  Open the pipeline record again and create DevOps steps to map to each GitLab pipeline job so an orchestration task can be created.

    Steps can be created in one of the following ways.

    -   Automatically create and map pipeline steps in DevOps by running your GitLab pipeline.

        Pipeline steps are automatically created, mapped, and associated when DevOps receives step notifications from your GitLab pipeline during the run.

    -   Manually create and map each pipeline step to a GitLab pipeline job.

        In the Steps related list, click **New** to create a DevOps step for each GitLab pipeline job \(**Orchestration stage** field\).

        **Note:** The **Orchestration stage** field value of each step is case-sensitive and must match the original name of the corresponding GitLab pipeline job.

<table id="table_v1m_crk_wmb"><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the pipeline step.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Pipeline

</td><td>

Pipeline in which the step is configured.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Pipeline step type.-   Build and Test
-   Test
-   Deploy
-   Deploy and Test
-   Manual
-   Prod Deploy


</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order in which the steps are run.

 **Note:** The step order determines the order of the cards in the [Pipeline UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-pipeline-ui.md).

The order of the cards in the Pipeline UI is by task execution.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Orchestration stage

</td><td>

GitLab pipeline job name \(case-sensitive\).

 **Note:** For step association with GitLab CI pipeline jobs, the **Orchestration stage** field must be configured.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Business service

</td><td>

Configuration service that applies to the step.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>        Once orchestration tasks are created, associate each orchestration task in the Orchestration Tasks related list with a DevOps pipeline step.

3.  Select the **Change control** check box in a step to enable [change acceleration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-change-acceleration.md) and the corresponding configuration fields.

    **Note:** The [Change Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/c_ITILChangeManagement.md) feature must be installed for change acceleration.

<table id="table_xm1_tdf_llb"><tbody><tr><td>

Change receipt

</td><td>

Select to enable change receipt for the step so the pipeline doesn't pause when a change request is created.

 All pipeline data is included in the change, but approval is not required for the pipeline to proceed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Change approval group

</td><td>

Approval group for the change request.

 The change approval group becomes the **Assignment group** in the DevOps change request.

 **Note:** Ensure that the selected group has members and a group manager so approver field is not empty.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Change type

</td><td>

Change request type to create.-   Normal \(default\)
-   Standard
-   Emergency


</td></tr><tr><td>

Change model

</td><td>

Change model for the change request. For more information, see [DevOps change models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/devops-change-multimodel.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Template

 **Note:** This field is shown only when **Change type** is Normal or Emergency.

</td><td>

List of templates to use to auto populate fields for Normal or Emergency change requests.

 Select a template or create a new one.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Standard change template

 **Note:** This field is shown only when **Change type** is Standard.

</td><td>

List of standard change templates to use for Standard change requests.**Note:** This field is required for Standard change type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Change controlled branches

</td><td>

\(Multibranch only\) Comma-separated list of branches under change control. Wildcards are supported.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    You can set up change control in GitLab for manual GitLab jobs.

    **Note:** A pipeline must be run and completed at least once before enabling change control.
