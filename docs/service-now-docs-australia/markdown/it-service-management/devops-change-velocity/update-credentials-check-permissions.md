# Check permissions and update credentials for tools — Workspace

You can perform permission checks and update credentials like passwords and access tokens for your tools from the tool details page.

## Permission checks

You can perform permission checks on connected tools at any time, to verify if the existing credentials have the necessary permissions. This check helps to determine if there are possible impacts or if you must get a token or credential with higher-level permissions for the tool.

**Note:**

SonarQube and Rally doesn't have the option to check for permissions.

1.  From the DevOps Change Workspace, navigate to Tools and select the tool to open the details page.

    The **Permission check result** field shows whether the tool credentials have all the necessary permissions, have partial permissions, or if permissions haven't been checked. The **Last Permission check** field tells you when the permission checks were previously run.

2.  Click **More Actions**.

    -   For Bitbucket, select **Check password permissions**.
    -   For GitHub and GitHub Enterprise with OAuth credentials using the GitHub app, select **Check credential permissions** and then enter the **GitHub app slug name**. Click **Check permissions**.
    -   For others, select **Check credential permissions**.
    You can see the status of the checks depending on your credential permissions. You need sufficient permissions on your credentials for seamless discovery and import.

3.  If permissions aren’t sufficient, it’s recommended to update the credentials with those having higher-level permissions, or update the permissions for the objects on the external tool.

## Update credentials

You can update the tool credentials with credentials having sufficient permissions for seamless discovery and import of data from your tool.

1.  From the DevOps Change Workspace, navigate to Tools and select the tool to open the details page.
2.  Click **More Actions**. Depending on your tool, the options to update your credentials are displayed.
