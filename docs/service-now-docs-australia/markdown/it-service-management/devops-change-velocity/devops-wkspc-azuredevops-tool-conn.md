# Onboard Azure DevOps to DevOps Change Velocity — Workspace

Connect to your Azure DevOps instance using the DevOps Change Workspace playbook to collect data for planning, coding, orchestration, artifact, and software quality functions.

You can connect to Azure DevOps \(ADO\) at your organization level or at individual project level. If you're connecting at the project level, for each project at your organization, you must repeat the connection process. After connecting to an instance of the tool, you can configure additional settings that enable DevOps to import pipelines, task execution records, and step execution records.

When you configure webhooks in your Azure DevOps instance to send data to DevOps Change Velocity, Azure DevOps uses token authentication for the integration user by default. The DevOps Change Velocity APIs are invoked using token authentication and you don’t have to enter the integration user name and password while configuring. If the devops.system user isn’t available in your ServiceNow instance, you must set the **Switch to this user after token based authentication is successful** property. For more information, see [DevOps Change Velocity properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-administration.md). The step to enter the integration user name and password is required only in the following scenarios:

-   If DevOps Config is installed, as DevOps Config APIs are invoked using basic authentication.
-   If you use the Azure Invoke REST API service connection. You must enable the **This property decides whether to create a Generic Connection on configure operation for Azure DevOps** property in this case.

**Note:** DevOps Change Velocity uses the term instance to refer to a particular occurrence of a tool. Azure DevOps uses the term project instead.

From the **Projects** tab on the tool record page, select a project to navigate to the project record page. From here, you can discover project objects, and configure webhooks for the project.

-   Select **Discover** to discover the project objects, including existing plans \(boards\), repositories, and pipelines.
-   If you created the tool directly at the project level, then selecting **Discover projects** from the **Projects** tab of the tool record page will discover all the projects in your organization.
-   Select **Configure** and enter the integration user credentials to configure webhooks for the project.
-   If you're on the tool records page, selecting **Configure projects** and entering the integration user credentials gives the list of unconfigured projects in your organization. Select the projects that you want webhooks configured for and select **Configure**.

    **Note:** The step to enter the integration user name and password is required to configure webhooks only when DevOps Config is installed or the Generic Connection on configure operation for Azure DevOps property is disabled. If this step is not required, webhooks are configured using token-based authentication.

-   To import historical data to the project objects like plans, repositories, or pipelines, associate the objects with an application, and import the data. For more information, see [Associate tool objects to applications - Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/apps-associate-objects-wkspc.md).

### Result

You’ve successfully onboarded your Azure DevOps tool to DevOps Change Velocity at the project level.

### What to do next

From the **Projects** tab on the tool record page, select a project to navigate to the project record page. From here, you can discover project objects, and configure webhooks for the project.

-   Select **Discover projects** to discover the project objects, including existing plans \(boards\), repositories, and pipelines. This will discover all the projects in your organization as well.
-   Select **Configure projects** to configure webhooks for the project.
-   If you're on the tool records page, selecting **Configure projects** and entering the integration user credentials gives the list of unconfigured projects in your organization. Select the projects that you want webhooks configured for and select **Configure**.

    **Note:** The step to enter the integration user name and password is required to configure webhooks only when DevOps Config is installed or the Generic Connection on configure operation for Azure DevOps property is disabled. If this step is not required, webhooks are configured using token-based authentication.

-   To import historical data to the project objects like plans, repositories, or pipelines, associate the objects with an application, and import the data.
