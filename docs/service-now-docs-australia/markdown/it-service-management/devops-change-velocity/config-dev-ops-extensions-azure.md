## Set up an Azure release \(CD\) pipeline in DevOps

Use the ServiceNow DevOps extension for Azure DevOps to configure change control, and artifacts and packages in your Azure release \(CD\) pipeline.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_devops.admin

### About this task

**Note:** Change control in Azure release \(CD\) pipelines is supported in pre-deployment gates only. Pre-deployment gate change requests are mapped to the step execution of the first job in that stage.

Phases in an Azure release pipeline are mapped to a step. The step name for a multi-config or multi-agent job must include the phase name only, and not the actual job name derived at pipeline execution run time.

Task executions for skipped jobs are marked as failed.

### Procedure

1.  In Azure DevOps Pipelines, select **Pipelines &gt; Releases**, and then select your release pipeline.

2.  Select **Edit** to open the pipeline editor.

3.  Select the pre-deployment \(\[Omitted image "pre-deployment-icon.png"\] Alt text: Pre-deployment icon\)icon for your stage, and then select the toggle button to enable **Gates**. \[Omitted image "deployment-enable-gates.png"\] Alt text: Enable Gates in Pre-deployment conditions

4.  Select **+Add**, and select **ServiceNow DevOps Release Gate**. \[Omitted image "ado-release-gate-add.png"\] Alt text: Add ServiceNow DevOps Release Gate

5.  Select **ServiceNow DevOps Release Gate** and select the ServiceNow endpoint. \[Omitted image "ado-release-gate-servicenow-endpoint.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow DevOps Release Gate fields

6.  Exit the release gate configuration, and expand the Evaluation options section to configure the following timing fields.

<table id="table_tg3_2hq_wmb"><tbody><tr><td>

The time between re-evaluation of gates

</td><td>

Re-evaluation interval in minutes, hours, or days.

 If the change request is canceled or rejected, the Azure pipeline release gate keeps re-evaluating the change request status at the configured interval until timeout.

 No user intervention is required for further attempts of re-evaluation after the change request has already been approved, rejected, or canceled.

</td></tr><tr><td>

The timeout after which gates fail

</td><td>

Timeout value in minutes, hours, or days.If the pre-deployment conditions fail, the subsequent jobs of the stage are marked as failed, and the start and end time defaults to the current system time.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    \[Omitted image "dev-ops-azure-gate.png"\] Alt text: DevOps Azure gate config

7.  Configure artifacts in your Azure release \(CD\) pipeline.

    To set up artifacts using the build pipeline as the source, these names must match.

    -   Repository name, and build pipeline name \(for example, DeployableRepo\).
    -   Name property of the build pipeline artifact, and source alias property of the release pipeline artifact \(for example, BuildDrop\).
    In addition to the build pipeline, you can select artifacts from any other eight sources. To track commit &amp; work item details, follow these rules.

    -   When the source is the build pipeline, the `semantic version` property of the artifacts should be in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` \(for example 5.1.3\).
    -   When the source is not the build pipeline, define a `semantic version` by implementing the **DevOpsArtifactSemanticVersionAPI** extension interface.
    See [Artifacts and packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/using-dev-ops-release-change.md) for more information regarding artifacts.
