</table>    **Important:** If you want to discover and track tool objects like pipelines while connecting to the tool, you must connect your tool from the Application module. The steps for associating tool objects in this procedure are only applicable when you connect your tool from the Application module.

2.  In the **Tool name** field, enter a name for the tool.

3.  Select **Next**.

    The DevOps playbook opens to help you complete the onboarding tasks.

4.  Enter your Harness instance details.

    1.  Enter your password or access token for Harness.

    2.  Enter a value in the **Account Identifier** field.

        **Note:** Account Identifier is the unique identifier for your account in the Harness platform. Copy it from Account Settings of your Harness account.

    3.  If your Harness instance is attached to a MID Server, select the **MID Server** option and enter its details.

        For more information about MID server, see [MID Server selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_MIDServerSelector.md)

    4.  Select **Connect**.

        \[Omitted image "harness-workspace-2.png"\] Alt text: Connect to a tool - Enter instance details page

5.  Specify the access for the tool.

    1.  If you want to control access to the tool, add the groups that must be given access to the tool in the **Maintained by** field.

        The tasks these users in the groups can perform depends on the role assigned to them.

        -   DevOps Tool Owner role: Can view and edit the tool.
        -   DevOps App Owner role: Can view the tool and can associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects \(such as plans, repositories, and pipelines\).
        -   DevOps Administrator role: Can edit all tools.
        -   Other DevOps roles: Can view the tool.
        **Note:** If you don't select a group and skip this step, all users with the DevOps Tool Owner role will be able to edit the tool.

    2.  If you choose to control access to the tool, the **All App Owners can view and associate tool objects to applications** option becomes available for selection.

        This option enables all users having the DevOps App Owner role to access the tool. If selected, they’ll be able to view, associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects.

    3.  Select **Assign**.
6.  In the Configure webhooks manually screen, copy the ServiceNow instance connection details for Harness.

    \[Omitted image "harness-workspace-3.png"\] Alt text: Configure webhooks manually screenSee [Configure webhooks in Harness manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/configure-webhooks-in-harness-manually.md) for more information.

7.  Select the pipelines that you want to track and associate to the application, and select **Associate pipelines**.

    For each selected pipeline, all steps are imported for the last successful execution.

8.  In the Assign services to pipeline steps activity, specify **Step type** and **Service** for each pipeline step.

    Completing this step as part of tool onboarding enables the DevOps Insights dashboards to show more meaningful data immediately.

9.  In the Import historical data step, select the date range in the **Start date** and **End date** fields and select **Import data**.

    **Note:** You can import up to 90 days of data.

10. Select **Next**.

11. From the **Summary** page, review the details of the successfully connected Harness tool.

    Select **View tool record** to review the details of the connected instance.


## Result

You’ve successfully onboarded your Harness tool to DevOps Change Velocity.

**Note:** If your tool credential changes, you must also update the credentials in DevOps Change.
