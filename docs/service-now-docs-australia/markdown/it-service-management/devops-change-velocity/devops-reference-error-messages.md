</td><td>

You can find the GitHub app slug name on the settings page of your GitHub app. The GitHub app slug name is the URL-friendly name of your GitHub app. For example, if you have created a GitHub app with the name **Test App**, the corresponding URL-friendly GitHub app slug name will be **test-app**. In your GitHub url - "https://github.com/settings/apps/test-app", "test-app" is the GitHub app slug name. For more information, see [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/apps/apps?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-an-app).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Password value is too long and could be truncated after encryption. Please either reduce password length or increase field size.

</td><td>

From 18th January 2023, Jira has extended the length of API tokens for Atlassian accounts. You must increase the maximum password value to more than 255 in the discovery\_credentials table to accommodate the extended character length. For more information, see the [KB1269878](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1269878) kb article and [Atlassian documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unexpected behaviour from remote host: Circular redirect to 'https://bitbucket.org/account/signin/?next=%2F...%2Frest%2Fapi%2F1.0%2Fusers'.

</td><td>

This error might occur if you try to connect to a BitBucket Cloud instance. BitBucket Cloud is not supported. You must use a BitBucket Server instance to connect to ServiceNow DevOps. Connect to your BitBucket instance via an MID server. A MID server is required if your tool instance is hosted on-prem. For more information about MID server, see [MID Server selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_MIDServerSelector.md)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mismatch in tool URL: Tool URL entered in ServiceNow: https://&lt;URL of the Jenkins instance you entered&gt; Tool URL entered in Jenkins: https://&lt;Jenkins location URL entered in Jenkins&gt; In Jenkins, under Manage Jenkins &gt; System, check that your configured Jenkins URL is the same as the Tool URL entered here. See the troubleshooting tool on-boarding errors.

</td><td>

This error occurs when the Jenkins URL entered in DevOps is different from the Jenkins URL entered in your Jenkins instance.

 From your Jenkins instance, navigate to **Manage Jenkins** &gt; **System** &gt; **Jenkins Location**. The **Jenkins URL** entered here must match the **URL of the Jenkins instance** entered in DevOps.

</table>## Tool permissions

This section lists the steps required to resolve tool permission errors when you create a DevOps tool using workspace playbooks. Tool permission check guidelines are displayed in a pop-up when you connect to a tool from the workspace.

-   **Action**

    If any permission is missing, perform the following steps:

    -   Update the permissions for the provided credentials in the external DevOps tool. Select **Refresh** in the pop-up to perform the checks again.
    -   Close the pop-up, use different credentials, and select **Connect** again. The permission check pop-up appears with results of the newly entered credentials.
    -   Review the impact column, and if the impact does not affect your use-case, select **Continue** anyway.
    If all permission checks are successful:

    -   Select **Continue** to progress to the next step in the playbook.
    -   If errors show up in the result, try again by selecting **Refresh**.
    -   If the error persists, update the [Tool permission check timeout per record \(in milliseconds\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/devops-reference-error-messages.md) property and try again.
-   **Tool permission check timeout property**

    During the tool connection process, the system performs permission validations in the foreground, and restricts the tool connection page. For every permission validation, a REST API call is made to external tools to evaluate the availability of the permission. The REST API response time may vary based on your network settings. To avoid delays, you can specify how long the system should wait to get a response from an external tool before marking the permission as an error. You can specify this time using the **Tool permission check timeout per record \(in milliseconds\)** property **\(sn\_devops.permission\_check\_timeout\)**. If you find that some of the permission checks are resulting in an error, try increasing the timeout value, and select **Refresh** in the Permissions pop-up.
