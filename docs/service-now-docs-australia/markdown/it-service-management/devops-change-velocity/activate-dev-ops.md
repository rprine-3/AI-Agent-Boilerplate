</table>## About this task

To install the DevOps application on a subprod instance, navigate to the DevOps Change Velocity app on the ServiceNow Store and select **Request Install** to send your request.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select the **Not Installed** tab to view a list of applications available for installation.

3.  Find the DevOps Change Velocity application using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID \(sn\_devops\_chgvlcty\). If you can’t find an application, you may have to request it from the ServiceNow store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release note information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

4.  Select **Install**.

5.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    If your application requires other applications, install them first if they are not already installed.

    Installing your application also automatically installs the dependent applications or plugins if they aren’t installed already.

6.  If you want to install demo data, select **Load demo data**.

    Demo data includes sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

    **Note:** If you don't load the demo data for a store application during installation, you can’t load it later.

7.  Select **Install**.

    Based on your connection, the installation procedure can take almost an hour or more to complete.


## Result

Installing DevOps Change Velocity also installs the dependent applications, user roles, tables, scheduled jobs, and other components.
