    1.  If you want to control access to the tool, add the groups that must be given access to the tool in the **Maintained by** field.

        -   DevOps App Owner role: Can view the tool and can associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects \(such as plans, repositories, and pipelines\).
        -   DevOps Administrator role: Can edit all tools.
        -   Other DevOps roles: Can view the tool.
        **Note:** If you don't select a group and skip this step, all users with the DevOps Tool Owner role will be able to edit the tool.

    2.  If you choose to control access to the tool, the **All App Owners can view and associate tool objects to applications** option becomes available for selection.

        This option enables all users having the DevOps App Owner role to access the tool. If selected, they’ll be able to view, associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects.
