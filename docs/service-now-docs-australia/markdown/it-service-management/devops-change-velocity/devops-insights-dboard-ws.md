# DevOps Insights dashboard - Workspace

The DevOps Insights dashboard provides a flexible graphical view of operational and business reports. Use the dashboard to evaluate the results of your overall DevOps process.

**Note:** To collect daily or historical Insights data, unless these jobs were previously customized, you must select **Active** and set the **Run As** credentials to **System Administrator**:

-   **\[DevOps\] Daily Data Collection \(Daily\)** \(active by default\)

    **Note:** This is a scheduled job \(to be run regularly\) to collect daily DevOps data. For optimal performance, set this job to run during periods of low usage.

-   **\[DevOps\] Historical Data Collection \(On Demand\)** \(inactive by default\)

    For new DevOps Insights installations, if you have already been using the DevOps app and you Installed DevOps Insights at a later date, run the Historical Data Collection job to collect historical Insights data.

    **Note:** This is a one-time job to collect historical DevOps data, and not meant to be on a schedule. It might take awhile, so plan on running this job during a period of low usage.


## Summary dashboard

The DevOps Insights Summary dashboard enables an overview of key metrics across various categories from accelerate to quality metrics along with a quick glance of the most active applications.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Changes awaiting approval

</td><td>

 By default, change requests in the New or Assess state are considered awaiting approval.

 To specify the states that are considered awaiting approval, update the **Change Request Awaiting States** property setting. For details, see [DevOps Insights properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/devops-insights-workspace-properties.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Change acceleration savings

</td><td>

Net amount saved per month by automating DevOps changes.

 When a change is automated, a developer doesn’t have to manually fill out the change request and associate each work item, code commits, test results and other evidence and artifacts to the change. After this activity is automated, hours that would have been spent on filling out the change, searching, tracking down and attaching items from other tools to a change, will now be saved. More work items require a relatively increasing number of hours to associate them manually. Therefore, higher numbers of work items should result in more hours saved after the change is automated. Change acceleration savings are calculated by multiplying the hours saved by the average hourly developer cost.

 To change the default value of the average hourly developer cost, update the **Average Hourly developer Cost** property setting. For details, see [DevOps Insights properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/devops-insights-workspace-properties.md).

</td><td>

Calculation: Average hourly developer cost multiplied by developer hours saved.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Developer hours saved

</td><td>

Number of developer hours saved per month by automating DevOps changes.To change the default value of 1 \(one\) hour per developer, update the **X hours per Developer time** property setting. For details, see [DevOps Insights properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/devops-insights-workspace-properties.md).

</td><td>

Calculation: Number of work items in a change request multiplied by 1 hour per developer.
