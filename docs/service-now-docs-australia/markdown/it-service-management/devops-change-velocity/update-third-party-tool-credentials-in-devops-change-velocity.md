</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d46202e75">

**From Workspace**

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces &gt; DevOps Change Workspace &gt; Tools &gt; &lt;tool type&gt;**.
2.  Select the tool for which you want to update your credentials.
3.  In the tool record, select **More Actions &gt; Update credentials**.
4.  Select the **Credential type**.

    -   If the credential type is **Basic Auth**, enter the new password or access token.
    -   If the credential type is **OAuth**, enter the new credential.
**Note:** This step is only applicable for tools which support OAuth 2.0 based authentication.

5.  Enter the updated credentials in the corresponding field.

**Note:** You can change your password/token, username, or authentication type.

6.  Select **Check permissions** to verify if the required permissions are available.

**Note:** If you are connecting to GitHub, for OAuth 2.0 and GitHub App credential, the GitHub app slug name is required to check permissions. If it is not provided, tool credentials will be updated without checking permissions.

7.  Select **Update credentials** to update the credentials. The tool will be in the disconnected state.
8.  Select **Connect** to establish the connection.

-   **[Notifications on tool credential expiration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/notifications-for-tool-credential-expiry.md)**  
Notifications are sent to tool users on expiration of tool credentials to alert them. Notifications are also sent proactively before the expiration of tool credentials for GitHub tools created with basic authentication. This enables tool users with the sn\_devops.tool\_owner or sn\_devops.admin roles to update the tool credentials and prevent any loss of data.
