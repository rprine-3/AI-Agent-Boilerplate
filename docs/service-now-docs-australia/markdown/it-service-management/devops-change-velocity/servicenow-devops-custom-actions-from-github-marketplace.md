# ServiceNow DevOps custom actions from GitHub marketplace

Use the custom actions from the GitHub marketplace to collect scan data, manage workflows, and update change request details.

Alternatively, you can use Docker container images to implement custom actions for GitHub Actions pipelines. For more information, see [Implement custom actions for pipelines using Docker image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/servicenow-custom-actions-for-gitlab.md).

    The custom action `servicenow-devops-sonar` must be configured at steps level of job in the workflow with **uses** keyword. The inputs of this custom action must not be tampered to save SonarQube analysis results in the ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [ServiceNow DevOps Sonar](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/servicenow-devops-sonar-scan-results).


## ServiceNow DevOps Test Report custom action

Save unit test results of the project initiated by the workflow run in your ServiceNow instance. The ServiceNow DevOps Test Report custom action must be used at the steps level of job in the workflow.

View the unit test results saved in your ServiceNow instance by navigating to **DevOps** &gt; **Test Results** &gt; **Test Summaries**.

You can also view by navigating to **DevOps** &gt; **Orchestrate** &gt; **Task Execution** and clicking a relevant **Task Execution** record.

Perform the following tasks to use the custom action.

-   Create Secrets in the GitHub Repository.
-   Configure the DevOps Test Report custom action in the workflow.

    The custom action `servicenow-devops-test-report` must be configured at steps level of job in the workflow with **uses** keyword. The inputs of this custom action must not be tampered to save the unit test results in your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [ServiceNow DevOps Test Report](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/servicenow-devops-unit-test-results).


## ServiceNow DevOps Register Artifact custom action

Save artifacts created or deployed by the workflow run in your ServiceNow instance. Use the ServiceNow DevOps Register Artifact custom action at steps level of job in the workflow.

View the artifacts details saved in your instance by navigating to **DevOps** &gt; **Artifact** &gt; **Artifacts**.

Perform the following tasks to use the custom action:

    The custom action `servicenow-devops-register-artifact` must be configured at steps level of job in the workflow with **uses** keyword. The inputs of this custom action must not be tampered to save artifact details in your instance. For more information, see [ServiceNow DevOps register artifacts](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/servicenow-devops-register-artifact).


## ServiceNow DevOps Register Package custom action

Save packages created or deployed by the workflow run in the ServiceNow instance. Use the ServiceNow DevOps Register Package custom action at steps level of job in the workflow.

View the package details saved in the ServiceNow instance by navigating to **DevOps** &gt; **Artifact** &gt; **Packages**.

Perform the following tasks to use the custom action.

-   Create Secrets in the GitHub Repository.
-   Configure ServiceNow DevOps Register Artifact custom action in the workflow.

    The custom action `servicenow-devops-register-package` must be configured at steps level of job in the workflow with **uses** keyword. The inputs of this custom action must not be tampered to save artifact details in your instance. For more information, see [ServiceNow DevOps register package](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/servicenow-devops-register-package).


## ServiceNow DevOps Change Automation custom action

Create a change request in the ServiceNow instance to pause and resume the workflow run from the ServiceNow instance.

Use the ServiceNow DevOps Change Automation custom action at steps level of job in the workflow. If the change is not created within the time period specified in the threshold \(changeCreationTimeOut\), and the **abortOnChangeCreationFailure** parameter is enabled, the pipeline will be aborted.

This custom action creates a change request in ServiceNow, enables the **Change Control** option, and polls the ServiceNow instance at the defined time interval for change status until either the change is approved or rejected or the timeout threshold \(timeout\) is reached. GitHub aborts the workflow run if the timeout threshold is reached and the **abortOnChangeStepTimeout** parameter is enabled. \[Omitted image "github-actions-console-2.png"\] Alt text: GitHub Actions console - change step timeout

This custom action immediately resumes the workflow run when change receipt is enabled for pipeline in ServiceNow without waiting for the change to be approved or rejected in the ServiceNow instance.

View the change created for the workflow run in the ServiceNow instance by navigating to **DevOps** &gt; **Orchestrate** &gt; **Pipeline Change Requests**.

The change number with status **pending\_decision** is displayed in the GitHub Actions console while polling the ServiceNow instance for change status. The details like change comments, approved by, approved on, and status are logged in GitHub Actions console after the change is approved or rejected or canceled by the user in the ServiceNow instance. \[Omitted image "github-action-console1.png"\] Alt text: GitHub Actions console - change approved

You can navigate to the console logs in your pipeline to view the state of a change request when a change request is created. The change details will be displayed according to the polling time interval. The policy conditions associated with the change request state will also be evaluated and displayed in the logs. For example, if the DevOps Change Request Advanced Automation policy is activated, the policy conditions will be evaluated and the corresponding decision made \(auto-approve/auto-reject/manual-approval\) will be displayed in the logs.

The following change request details are displayed:

-   number
-   details
-   status
-   sys\_id
-   type
-   risk
-   priority
-   changeState
-   plannedStartDate
-   plannedEndDate
-   changeRequestURL

\[Omitted image "github-change-state.png"\] Alt text: Change state in GitHub pipeline console logs

**Note:** **changeState** is the state of the change request, and **status** is the status of the step execution.

The logs for policy conditions will be displayed for the base system change flows as follows:

-   DevOps Model Change Policy: Only logs will be displayed on change creation and when the change state is updated.
-   DevOps Change Request Minimal Automation Policy: Logs along with change decision and policy conditions corresponding to the change decision will be displayed.
-   DevOps Change Request Advanced Automation Policy: Logs along with change decision and policy conditions corresponding to the change decision will be displayed.

The change policy input and decision conditions are stored in the Decisions \[sys\_decision\_question\] table. Logs will be displayed if the following fields and operators are used as input for policy conditions:

-   **Fields**
    -   code\_coverage
    -   commits\_without\_work\_item
    -   integration\_tests\_failed
    -   load\_tests\_failed
    -   regression\_tests\_failed
    -   num\_of\_outages\_in\_last\_7\_days
    -   num\_of\_current\_outages
    -   num\_of\_open\_incidents
    -   total\_num\_of\_commits
    -   tests\_passing\_percent
    -   risk
    -   code\_security
    -   commits
-   **Operators**
    -   &lt;=
    -   &gt;=
    -   !=
    -   =
    -   &lt;
    -   &gt;
    -   ISNOTEMPTY
    -   ISEMPTY
    -   BETWEEN
    -   ANYTHING
    -   NSAMEAS
    -   SAMEAS
    -   GT\_FIELD
    -   LT\_FIELD

**Note:** If any field is modified in a change policy other than the base system fields, then those fields must be manually added to the flow for policy conditions to be evaluated.

Perform the following tasks to use the custom action.

-   Create Secrets in the GitHub Repository.
-   Configure ServiceNow DevOps Change Automation custom action in the workflow.

    The custom action `servicenow-devops-change` must be configured at steps level of job in the workflow with **uses** keyword.
