# Azure DevOps PAT scopes for DevOps

Scope access levels are required when using a personal access token \(PAT\) to access Azure DevOps during setup.

Scope access level settings are based on the capability you have configured. Set the corresponding access level for seamless functionality. For information on creating a PAT, see [Personal access token \(PAT\)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).

**Important:** With the access level permissions specified in the following table in Azure DevOps, and the ServiceNow DevOps extension, you can connect to Azure DevOps from ServiceNow. Your Azure DevOps admin does not have to manually configure webhooks and service connections in Azure DevOps.

**Important:**

-   When onboarding a Project, the **Project Administrators** privilege requires the owner of the PAT to be a member of the project's **Project Administrators** group.
-   When onboarding an Organization, the **Project Administrators** privilege requires the owner of the PAT to be a member of the organization's **Project Collection Administrators** group.

</table>**Note:** You must have the Update build information permission on your pipeline for all pipeline features to work seamlessly. Contact your ADO Project Administrator if you don't have this permission.

## Limitation of Azure DevOps

If you create an Azure tool with custom defined access level, and you reconfigure that tool because of change in your Integration user credentials, then the existing service hooks for release created and release deployment aren't updated. Instead, two new service hooks are created with new configuration details. To avoid the duplication of these service hooks, you must create the tool with full access level.
