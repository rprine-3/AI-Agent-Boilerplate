# DevOps Insights Standard dashboard - Classic

Use the DevOps Insights application with ServiceNow Performance Analytics to gain insight into your DevOps environment.

**Important:** The Insights Standard dashboard is deprecated for new users. Instead, you can use the Insights dashboard from the DevOps Workspace. For more information, see [DevOps Insights dashboard - Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/devops-insights-dboard-ws.md)

**Note:** To collect daily or historical Insights data, unless these jobs were previously customized, you must select **Active** and set the **Run As** credentials to **System Administrator**:

-   **\[DevOps\] Daily Data Collection \(Daily\)** \(active by default\)

    **Note:** This is a scheduled job \(to be run regularly\) to collect daily DevOps data. For optimal performance, set this job to run during periods of low usage.

-   **\[DevOps\] Historical Data Collection \(On Demand\)** \(inactive by default\)

    For new DevOps Insights installations, if you have already been using the DevOps app and you Installed DevOps Insights at a later date, run the Historical Data Collection job to collect historical Insights data.

    **Note:** This is a one-time job to collect historical DevOps data, and not meant to be on a schedule. It might take awhile, so plan on running this job during a period of low usage.


Reports in the dashboard tabs get updated when the dashboard is refreshed.
