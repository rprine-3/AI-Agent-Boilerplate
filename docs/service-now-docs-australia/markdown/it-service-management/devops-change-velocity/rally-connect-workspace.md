</table>    **Important:** If you want to discover and track tool objects like plans while connecting to the tool, you must connect your tool from the Application module.

2.  Enter a tool name to identify your tool and select **Next**.

3.  On the Enter Rally instance details playbook activity, enter the following details:

    1.  In the **URL of the Rally instance** field, enter your Rally instance URL.
    2.  Select the credential type as **Basic Auth** or **OAuth 2.0**.
        -   Basic Auth: Enter the password or access token of your Rally instance.
        -   OAuth 2.0: Enter your OAuth credential.

            For information on setting up your OAuth 2.0 credentials for Rally, see [Setting up Rally OAuth 2.0 credentials for DevOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/setting-up-rally-oauth-2-0-credentials-for-devops.md).

    3.  \(Optional\) If your Rally instance is attached to a MID Server, select the **Use MID Server** option and enter its details.

        A MID server is required if your tool instance is hosted on-prem. For more information about MID server, see [MID Server selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_MIDServerSelector.md).

4.  Select **Connect**.

    On successful connection, the tool is created in ServiceNow and connected to your Rally instance.

    \[Omitted image "rally-plybk-01.png"\] Alt text: Connect Rally to DevOps Change Velocity.

5.  Specify the access for the tool.

    1.  If you want to control access to the tool, add the groups that must be given access to the tool in the **Maintained by** field.

        The tasks these users in the groups can perform depends on the role assigned to them.

        -   DevOps Tool Owner role: Can view and edit the tool.
        -   DevOps App Owner role: Can view the tool and can associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects \(such as plans, repositories, and pipelines\).
        -   DevOps Administrator role: Can edit all tools.
        -   Other DevOps roles: Can view the tool.
        **Note:** If you don't select a group and skip this step, all users with the DevOps Tool Owner role will be able to edit the tool.

    2.  If you choose to control access to the tool, the **All App Owners can view and associate tool objects to applications** option becomes available for selection.

        This option enables all users having the DevOps App Owner role to access the tool. If selected, they’ll be able to view, associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects.

    3.  Select **Assign**.

6.  Configure webhooks automatically in Rally to send real-time notifications.

    **Note:** If you prefer not to configure webhooks, you can enable nightly polling to fetch data for all tracked plans by selecting the **Enable import polling** check box in [DevOps properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-administration.md).

    1.  Select the plans that you want to track.

    2.  Select **Configure**.

    \[Omitted image "rally-plybk-03.png"\] Alt text: Connect Rally to DevOps Change Velocity.

    **Important:**

    -   If you're connecting from the Home page or Tools module, the connection is complete and you're taken to the Summary page.
    -   If you're connecting from the Applications module, then plans available in your instance are discovered. You can track and import historical data from them.
7.  If you want to import plan data, select the date range and select **Submit**.

    You can import up to 90 days of data.

    \[Omitted image "rally-plybk-06.png"\] Alt text: Import plan data.

8.  From the **Summary** tab, select **View tool record** to review the details of the connected instance and the plans discovered from it.
