# Retry errored inbound events

Run base system or modified scheduled jobs to retry processing errored inbound events. Specify the exceptions or errors to retry events that are in an **Error** state.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_devops.admin

## About this task

A scheduled job retries processing inbound events that are in **Error** state. You can choose to use the scheduled job with its base-system properties or customize the properties to suit your needs.

-   Run a scheduled job on inbound events that are in error state.
-   Update the list of exceptions and errors so that you can retry processing errored inbound events with those exceptions.
-   Specify the count for maximum attempts the retry jobs runs on an inbound event.
-   Specify the time elapsed since the last retry job. The retry job runs again on the errored inbound events after the duration you specify.

Based on your error or exception, perform any of the following steps to retry processing the inbound events.

## Procedure

1.  Modify the **Retry Errored Inbound Events** scheduled job frequency.

    1.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

    2.  Search and open the **Retry Errored Inbound Events** job.

        The job checks for errored inbound events.

        **Note:** By default, the scheduled job runs repeat every two minutes. You can modify the frequency \(in minutes\), as required.

    3.  Select the frequency to run the job, from the **Run** field, and configure the corresponding fields.

    4.  Click **Update**.

    You have modified the frequency of the scheduled job.

2.  Modify properties related to retry processing inbound events.

    1.  Navigate to **DevOps** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**.

    2.  Modify the **Maximum retries for errored inbound events** property.

        **Note:** The default value for this property is 3. You can modify the count as needed.

        Processing inbound events are retried based on the count you specify.

    3.  Modify the **Time elapsed \(in minutes\)** property.

        **Note:** The default value for this property is 1440 minutes \(24 hours\). You can modify the count if required.

        Based on the value in this property field, the system retries processing inbound events. For example, if the last attempt to process the inbound events was on 12 noon on 1 January, by default, the scheduled job retries processing errored events after 1440 minutes or 1 day from the timestamp of the last attempt to process the inbound event.

    4.  To update the exceptions list based on which errored events are retried for processing, modify the **Errors or exceptions \(comma separated\) for which errored inbound events are set to Retry** property.

        **Note:** The default value of this property is **TimeOutExceptions, FlowObjectAPIException**. You can update the exceptions you want to retry processing in a comma-separated format.

        The exceptions you enter for the property are checked for the **Processing Details** field in the inbound event's record and retries processing.


## Result

The scheduled job to retry processing inbound events runs based on either the properties you have configured or the base system properties that are specified by default.
