## Configure webhooks manually for Jenkins

Configure webhooks in Jenkins to send sync notifications to the DevOps Change Velocity application.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_devops.admin or sn\_devops.tool\_owner in DevOps Change Velocity, Jenkins admin

### About this task

You can add a total of ten ServiceNow DevOps configurations. For example, you can configure Jenkins connections for your Development, Testing, Production instances, and so on.

If you are an upgrading customer, you must download and install the latest Jenkins plugin to enable multiple ServiceNow configurations. After installation, your existing configuration will be retained and made the default configuration.

In the ServiceNow DevOps Configuration section in Jenkins, the values in the **Name** field and the combination of the **Instance URL** and **Orchestration Tool ID** fields must be unique.

If you choose to automatically configure a tool from ServiceNow, then the existing set up for ServiceNow DevOps Configuration will be over-written in Jenkins.

If DevOps Config is installed, you will only be able to configure Jenkins manually.

### Procedure

1.  In DevOps Change Velocity, choose **Configure manually** when configuring the tool instance to send data.

    \[Omitted image "jenkins-workspace-connect-8.png"\] Alt text: Configure webhooks automatically.

2.  Select **Copy** in the appropriate field to copy the value to your clipboard.

    The field label changes to **Copied**, but you can copy multiple times.

    \[Omitted image "jenkins-workspace-connect-9.png"\] Alt text: Configure webhooks manually.

3.  In Jenkins, navigate to **Manage Jenkins** &gt; **System configuration** &gt; **Manage Plugins** &gt; **Configure System**.

4.  In the ServiceNow DevOps Configuration section, select **Add**.

    **Note:** You can add multiple connections by selecting **Add** for each new configuration.

5.  Configure the plugin by filling in the fields.

    When enabled, Jenkins starts sending events to DevOps as inbound events.

    **Note:** Values are case-sensitive.
