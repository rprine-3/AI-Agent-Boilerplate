Integration username

</td><td>

This field is available only when the option to configure webhook is selected.Enter the username for the DevOps Integration User account.

**Note:**

-   The step to enter the integration user name and password is required to configure only when DevOps Config is installed or the **This property decides whether to create a Generic Connection on configure operation for Azure DevOps** property is enabled. If this step is not required, webhooks are configured using token-based authentication.
