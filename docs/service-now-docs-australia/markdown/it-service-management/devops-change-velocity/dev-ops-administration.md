</td><td>

Retrieves only those orchestration tasks and pipelines which are in folders whose nesting level is less than or equal to the number specified here. Folder Depth is the level of nesting done on folders in Jenkins, which contains the orchestration task and pipelines that you want to discover. For example, if you want to discover orchestration tasks and pipelines for a folder structure that is nested 2 times in your Jenkins environment, you must enter 2 as the value for this property.

DevOps change request handler subflow

</td><td>

If you are using a custom subflow instead of the Default Change Handler subflow in Flow Designer \(which is used to populate the change request fields with default values\), then you must update this property value to the new subflow. You can copy the Default Change Handler subflow in Flow Designer and update it according to your organization's needs. For information on the Default Change Handler subflow, see [Customizing DevOps flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/using-dev-ops-model-change-flow.md).For information on copying a subflow, see [Copy a subflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/copy-subflow.md).

</td><td>

\[sn\_devops.change\_request\_handler\_subflow\]

</td></tr><tr><td>

Coding tool repositories per page

</td><td>

The number of repositories that must be displayed per page when you import repositories after connecting to a tool. The total number of repositories imported is not dependent on this property, but the number of repositories that must be displayed per page from the total number of repositories imported can be specified using this property. For example, if your tool contains 1000 repositories and you specify 100 as the property value, 1000 repositories will be imported of which 100 will be displayed per page in the Import Requests page.

 When you discover repositories, the number of repositories that must be retrieved per API call in the backend is also dependent on this property value. For a large number of repositories, set a relatively smaller value in this property so that lesser number of repositories are retrieved per call and the system does not time out.

Import based evidence collection for orchestration capability

</td><td>

This property modifies how pipeline events are processed. When switched on, the setting reduces instance overhead by skipping step-level processing in the pipeline. The skipped step-level events will be ignored with the processing details, "IGNORED: This event is ignored because the 'Import based evidence collection for orchestration capability' property is enabled". Conversely, switching off reverts to the standard mode, where all inbound events undergo processing.
