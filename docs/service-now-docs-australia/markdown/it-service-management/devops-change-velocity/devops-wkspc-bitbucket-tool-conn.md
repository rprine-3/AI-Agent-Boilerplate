</table>4.  Select **Connect**.

5.  Permission checks are run on the credentials that you entered.

    Permissions required and permissions that are available are displayed. If you want to enter credentials with better permissions, select **Re-enter credentials**. For detailed information on all the required permissions, see Bitbucket permissions in [Permissions required for DevOps tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/tool-req-permission.md).

    You can choose to continue with the tool connection even if you don't have all the required permissions.

6.  Select **Next**.

7.  Specify the access for the tool.

    1.  If you want to control access to the tool, add the groups that must be given access to the tool in the **Maintained by** field.

        The tasks these users in the groups can perform depends on the role assigned to them.

        -   DevOps Tool Owner role: Can view and edit the tool.
        -   DevOps App Owner role: Can view the tool and can associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects \(such as plans, repositories, and pipelines\).
        -   DevOps Administrator role: Can edit all tools.
        -   Other DevOps roles: Can view the tool.
        **Note:** If you don't select a group and skip this step, all users with the DevOps Tool Owner role will be able to edit the tool.

    2.  If you choose to control access to the tool, the **All App Owners can view and associate tool objects to applications** option becomes available for selection.

        This option enables all users having the DevOps App Owner role to access the tool. If selected, they’ll be able to view, associate, discover, import historical data, and modify pipeline steps \(if applicable\) of the tool's objects.

    3.  Select **Assign**.

8.  Select the repositories for which you want to configure webhooks automatically.

    Real-time notifications are ideal to maintain the most up-to-date information particularly for automating change requests.

    You can also set up webhook by configuring it manually. Alternatively, you can choose to enable nightly polling to fetch data system for any tracked repositories by setting the **Enable Polling** property to **Yes**.

9.  Select **Configure**.

    \[Omitted image "bitbucket-workspace-connect-4.png"\] Alt text: Connect to the Bitbucket tool - select items to configure screen

    To configure manually, select **Configure manually**. See [Configure webhooks in Bitbucket manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/config-webhooks-bitbucket-manually.md) for more information.

    **Important:**

    -   If you're connecting from the Home page or Tools module, the connection is complete and you're taken to the Summary page.
    -   If you're connecting from the Applications module, then repositories available in your instance are discovered. You can track and import historical data from them.
10. Select the repositories you want to associate to the application, and select **Associate repositories**.

11. In the Import historical data step, select the date range in the **Start date** and **End date** fields and select **Import data**.

    **Note:** You can import up to 90 days of data.

    Imported commits, branches, and pull request records from the repository are added to the corresponding related lists.

12. Select **Next**.

13. From the **Summary** page, review the details of the successfully connected Bitbucket tool.

    Select **View tool record** to review the details of the connected instance and the repositories discovered from it.
