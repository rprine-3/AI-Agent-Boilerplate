# Rally integration with DevOps Change Velocity

Connect to your Broadcom Rally instance to discover plans and configure real-time notifications to enable change traceability and automation.

## Rally integration overview

With this integration, you can configure and expose data like projects, user stories, and defects from Rally. You can then associate these planning objects to an application for end-to-end traceability.

**Install Rally plugin**

You must install the Rally application from [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

**Note:**

-   The default object types configured for Rally are `"ObjectTypes"["HierarchicalRequirement","Defect","Feature"]`.
-   The file script include **Rally state mapping helper** is editable. You can override this file with your specific customization as required.
-   Scheduledstate in Rally is used when mapping object state to internal ServiceNow work item state.
-   For tool mappings, see [Tool mappings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/dev-ops-tool-integration.md).
