## Create a tenant in Microsoft Entra

Create a tenant in Microsoft Entra and set up the required permissions to create an Azure DevOps \(ADO\) app.

### Before you begin

Role required: Tenant Creator in Azure DevOps.

### About this task

Your tenant represents your organization and helps you to manage a specific instance of Microsoft Cloud services for your internal and external users.

If you have an existing tenant, which has access to create an ADO app, you do not need to perform this procedure. If you don’t have a tenant, you must create a tenant in Microsoft Entra, which will have access to create an ADO app.

### Procedure

1.  In the [Microsoft Entra](http://entra.microsoft.com) portal, navigate to **Overview &gt; Manage tenants**.

2.  Select **Create**.

3.  Select the **Workforce** configuration, and select **Continue**.

4.  Enter the following information:

    -   Your desired Organization name into the **Organization name** box.
    -   Your desired Initial domain name into the **Initial domain name** box.
5.  Select **Next: Review + Create**.

6.  Review the information that you entered and if the information is correct, select **Create** in the lower left corner.

    For more information, see the [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant) documentation.


## Add a user to tenant in Microsoft Entra

Add a user who contains the admin role, to the tenant created in the previous procedure.

    |Account enabled|This option is checked by default. Clear to prevent the new user from being able to sign in. You can change this setting after the user is created. This setting was called **Block sign in** in the legacy create user process.|

4.  Select **Next: Properties** to complete the next section.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Identity|Enter the user's first and last name. Set the User type as either Member or Guest.|

The combination of age group and consent provided by parent options determine the Legal age group classification. The Legal age group classification may limit the user's access and authority.|
