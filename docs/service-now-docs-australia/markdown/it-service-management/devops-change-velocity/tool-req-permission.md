# Permissions required for DevOps tools

Permissions required in your third-party tool to connect to DevOps Change Velocity.

## Azure DevOps permissions

**Important:** With the access level permissions specified in the following table in Azure DevOps, and the ServiceNow DevOps extension, you can connect to Azure DevOps from ServiceNow. Your Azure DevOps admin does not have to manually configure webhooks and service connections in Azure DevOps.

**Important:**

-   When onboarding a Project, the **Project Administrators** privilege requires the owner of the PAT to be a member of the project's **Project Administrators** group.
-   When onboarding an Organization, the **Project Administrators** privilege requires the owner of the PAT to be a member of the organization's **Project Collection Administrators** group.

</table>-   **Limitation of Azure DevOps**

    If you create an Azure tool with custom defined access level, and you reconfigure such a tool because of change in your Integration user credentials, then the existing service hooks for release created and release deployment are not updated. Instead, two new service hooks are created with new configuration details. To avoid the duplication of these service hooks, you must create the tool with full access level.
