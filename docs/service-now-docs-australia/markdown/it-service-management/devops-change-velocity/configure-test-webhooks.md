# Configure and test webhooks

Manually configure webhooks in Azure DevOps and test them.

**Parent Topic:**[Azure DevOps integration with DevOps Change Velocity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/devops-change-velocity/azure-devops-integration-dev-ops.md)

## Configure webhooks in Azure DevOps manually

Configure webhooks in Azure DevOps to send sync notifications to the DevOps Change Velocity application.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_devops.admin or sn\_devops.tool\_owner in DevOps Change Velocity, Azure DevOps admin

### About this task

You can also access manual configuration from the Azure DevOps tool record in DevOps Change Velocity.

### Procedure

1.  In Azure DevOps, open the project for which you are configuring webhooks.

2.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Service Hooks** and create a NEW SERVICE HOOKS SUBSCRIPTION, in Azure DevOps.

3.  In DevOps Change Velocity, choose **Configure manually** when configuring the tool instance to send data.

4.  In DevOps Change Velocity, copy the **Webhook URL** field from the ServiceNow instance connection details for Azure DevOps.

    **Note:** Select **Copy** in the appropriate field to copy the value to your clipboard. The field label changes to **Copied**, but you can copy multiple times.

5.  Modify the copied Webhook URL to reflect your tool details, and paste the URL in Azure DevOps.

    For example:

    `https://myinstance.service-now.com/api/sn_devops/v2/devops/tool/{code | plan | artifact | orchestration | test | softwarequality }?toolId=23410545938c71d0db5bfe686cba1036&projectId=<project_sys_id>`

    1.  Select one of the tool capabilities `{code | plan | artifact | orchestration | test | softwarequality }` to match your tool.

        For example:

        `https://myinstance.service-now.com/api/sn_devops/v2/devops/tool/orchestration?toolId=23410545938c71d0db5bfe686cba1036&projectId=<project_sys_id>`

    2.  Replace `<project_sys_id>` with your Azure DevOps project ID in ServiceNow \(native\_id column in the sn\_devops\_project table\).

    3.  Copy the modified URL to the **URL** field of the NEW SERVICE HOOKS SUBSCRIPTION in Azure DevOps.

6.  In DevOps Change Velocity, copy the **Secret token** field from the ServiceNow instance connection details for Azure DevOps.

7.  In Azure DevOps, in **Header** field of the NEW SERVICE HOOKS SUBSCRIPTION, paste the copied **Secret token** in the correct format.

    1.  Use this format for the Azure DevOps **HTTP headers** field:

        "`token : <tokenValue>`"

    2.  Replace `<tokenValue>`, with the copied **Secret token** from the ServiceNow instance connection details for Azure DevOps.

## Test webhooks in Azure DevOps

You can manually test if webhooks are configured correctly directly from Azure DevOps for each project.

### Before you begin

Role required: Azure DevOps admin privileges

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to Azure DevOps and select the project for which you want to test webhooks.

2.  Navigate to **Project settings** &gt; **Service hooks**.

    For each project, DevOps Change Velocity creates webhooks for these events:

    -   Build completed
    -   Code pushed
    -   Release created
    -   Release deployment completed
    -   Run stage state changed
    -   Work item created
    -   Work item deleted
    -   Work item restored
    -   Work item updated
3.  Select a webhook and select **Edit**.

4.  Select **Next** to see the URL and authentication details.

    \[Omitted image "azure-test-wh-01.png"\] Alt text: Details of the configured webhook.

5.  To test the webhook, select **Test**.

    -   If the webhook is configured correctly, you’ll receive a **Succeeded** message.

        \[Omitted image "azure-test-wh-02.png"\] Alt text: Success message when webhook is configured correctly.

    -   If the webhook is configured incorrectly, you’ll receive a **Failed** message.

        \[Omitted image "azure-test-wh-03.png"\] Alt text: Failure message when webhook is configured correctly.

        To fix a webhook, you can try the following options:

        -   Reconfigure the webhooks by selecting **Configure** from the project record page in DevOps Change Velocity. This will reconfigure all the existing webhooks for the project.
        -   Verify if the **toolId** and **projectId** are correct in the **URL** field. You can find the correct values in the tool record page in DevOps Change Velocity.

            \[Omitted image "azure-test-wh-04.png"\] Alt text: toolId and projectId in the URL.

        -   If you're using the integration user credentials for authentication, check if the credentials are correct in the **Basic authentication** username and password fields.

            \[Omitted image "azure-test-wh-05.png"\] Alt text: Basic authentication fields in the webhook.

        -   If you're using the secret token for authentication, the token value is masked in the **Basic authentication password** field. You can replace the token in this field.

            \[Omitted image "azure-test-wh-06.png"\] Alt text: Token in the webhook.
