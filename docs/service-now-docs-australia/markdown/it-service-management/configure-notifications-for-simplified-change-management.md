# Configure notifications for Simplified Change Management

Add and manage notifications for Change Management to keep users informed about approvals, status updates, and task assignments at key steps in the change process.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_itsm\_chg\_admin.notification\_config and sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user

**Note:** The sn\_itsm\_chg\_admin.notification\_config role no longer automatically inherits the sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user role. Users who need to configure the console must now be assigned both the appropriate Change Management role \(for example, sn\_itsm\_chg\_admin.notification\_config\) and the sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user role explicitly. Existing roles aren't modified during upgrade, allowing you to maintain full control over assignment of elevated privileges. After upgrading, if you have previously relied on inherited access, you won't be able to configure the console until the sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user role is assigned explicitly.

## About this task

Notifications keep stakeholders informed at critical points in the change lifecycle such as when a change is submitted for approval, assigned, updated, or completed.

The following types of pre-configured notifications are available:

-   Assignment and task notifications alert users when a change request or change task is assigned directly to them or to their group, ensuring the right people are aware of new work.
-   Update notifications notify relevant parties when a change request or task receives a work note or comment, whether the record is assigned or unassigned, so no updates go unnoticed.
-   Status and lifecycle notifications cover key state transitions, including when a change request is approved, rejected, put on hold, taken off hold, or when its state changes. Emergency change created and Unauthorized change created notifications flag high-priority situations requiring immediate attention.
-   CAB notifications manage meeting logistics for CAB delegates and board members, covering meeting invitations, cancellations, and delegate additions so all participants have the information they need ahead of CAB reviews.
-   Calendar notifications handle adding and removing change events from assignees' calendars, keeping schedules aligned with change activity.
-   External and survey notifications inform stakeholders when an external change is registered in the system and prompt users to complete a survey on change completion.
-   Approval notifications \(Change approved, Change rejected\) alert the assigned user of the final approval decision, supporting timely action on the change.

    For more information on creating notifications, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

10. Select **Submit**.

    As an alternative to the form-based wizard, you can also complete this configuration through the **Configure with AI** conversational flow, accessible from the banner at the top of the page.

    **Note:** To deactivate a low-value notification without deleting it, locate it in the **Notifications** list and set its **Active** field to **false**. Deactivated notifications remain in the list and can be reactivated at any time.


## Result

The notification is saved and appears in the **Notifications** list. It fires automatically whenever the defined conditions are met.
