# Exploring L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist

The L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist uses AI agents to accomplish bigger tasks, such as task triage or updating customers with solutions that worked for similar issues.

## L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist overview

The L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist is an autonomous worker that is designed to help handle incidents end-to-end without human intervention. It uses knowledge articles and historical data to investigate and resolve assigned incidents. It communicates directly with requesters and escalates incidents to human agents when confidence is low.

Onboarding the L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist can be helpful for high-volume, repeatable L1 incidents, a well-maintained knowledge base, and a clear resolution path. The L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist addresses routine and low-level work, such as handling password reset requests. This frees human agents to focus on more complex work.

You can assign the L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist to different assignment groups and roles to limit the scope of work and the data accessed.

Skills are the types of issues that the L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist can handle. Tasks are the specific actions that the L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist uses to solve those issues. After configuring, you can test your L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist to verify it's working as expected. Once the L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist has been activated, you can monitor its performance and activity on the records it handles.

The tasks available to the L1 IT Service Desk AI Specialist include:

-   Task classification and assignment
-   Incident triage and diagnosis
-   Investigate and resolve
