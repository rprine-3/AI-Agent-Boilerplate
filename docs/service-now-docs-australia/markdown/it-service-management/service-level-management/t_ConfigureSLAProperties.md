Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Level Management** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  Select one of the following:

    -   **SLA Engine**

        configure properties for the SLA engine.

    -   **SLA Logging**

        configure logging properties for SLA Script Includes and logging output destination.

    -   **SLA Repair**

        configure properties for the SLA Repair process.

## SLA engine properties

Administrators can manage the SLA engine using SLA engine properties.

Navigate to **Service Level Management** &gt; **Properties** &gt; **SLA Engine** to view SLA engine properties.

<table id="table_dfk_jkh_gr"><thead><tr><th>

Property name

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.calculation.percentage**

</td><td>

Maximum 'Actual elapsed percentage' value after which the 'SLA - update calculations' scheduled job will stop regularly calculating the SLA's time values. This is used to prevent 'long since breached' records from being unnecessarily updated. Setting to '0' will stop all calculations and leaving this blank will allow all SLAs to be calculated.

 By default, this is set to 1,000%, so that recalculation stops after the breach is exceeded by a factor of 10.

 -   Type: integer
-   Default value: 1000

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.maximum\_duration**

</td><td>

Maximum duration in days that is allowed in the SLA definition.-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 1095

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.engine.version**

</td><td>

Run the 2011 SLA engine \(2010, 2011\)

 -   Type: choice list
-   Default value: 2011

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.engine.async**

</td><td>

Run the 2011 SLA engine asynchronously after task insert or update operations.

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.compatibility.breach**

</td><td>

Enable compatibility with 2010 'breached' status of SLAs \(default: false\)

 Only enable if you require the old way of showing breached status \(in the stage value\), for reporting purposes. Using only the 'breached flag' is preferred

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.default\_conditionclass**

</td><td>

The name of the Script Include class used to evaluate SLA Conditions for the 2011 SLA engine \(use to override with your own extension of the SLAConditionBase class\).

 -   Type: String
-   Default value: SLAConditionBase

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.workflow.run\_for\_breached**

</td><td>

An update to a Task can result in an SLA being attached that is already breached. For example, when an incident that has already been open for a while is upgraded to high priority with a short resolution SLA.

 By default, if there is a workflow specified in the SLA Definition, the workflow doesn't run when the Task SLA is already breached at the time it attaches.

 Enable this property if you would like the workflow to run for a task SLA that is already breached when it is attaches to the task.

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.flow.run\_for\_breached**

</td><td>

An update to a task can result in an SLA being attached that is already breached. For example, when an incident that has already been open for a while is upgraded to high priority with a short resolution SLA.

By default, if there is a flow specified in the SLA Definition, the flow doesn't run when the task SLA is already breached at the time it attaches.

Enable this property if you would like the flow to run for a task SLA that is already breached when it attaches to the task.

This property isn't present in the base system. To use it, create it manually. Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**, and then select **New**. Add the following details:

-   **Name** = `com.snc.sla.flow.run_for_breached`
-   **Type** = `true | false`
-   **Value** = `true`

The property value is read at run time by the `TaskSLAFlowSNC` script include.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.calculate\_planned\_end\_time\_after\_breach**

</td><td>

Continue to re-calculate the "Planned End Time" of SLAs after they have breached

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false

 **Note:** zboot customers do not have this property available in the SLA Engine Properties page.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.calculation.use\_time\_left**

</td><td>

Use field business\_time\_left to calculate breach time instead of business\_percentage field. Using business\_time\_left is more accurate because the business\_percentage field is rounded to 2 decimal places. This means that once the business percentage reaches 99.995%, it is recorded as 100%, and the task SLA is marked as breached.-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false

</td></tr><tr><td>

**glide.sla.calculate\_on\_display**

</td><td>

Recalculate Task SLA records when a Task form is displayed. This ensures that the task SLAs calculations are up to date but this may increase form load time.-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false

</td></tr><tr><td>

**com.snc.sla.always\_populate\_business\_fields**

</td><td>

When set to true, business fields such as **Business elapsed time** are populated with the same values as in actual fields when no schedule is specified on the Task SLA.

 If the property is false, the business fields will be empty when a Task SLA has no schedule.

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: true for new instances, false for upgraded instances

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## SLA logging properties

Administrators can configure SLA logging using SLA properties.

Navigate to **Service Level Management** &gt; **Properties** &gt; **SLA Logging** to view SLA logging properties.

The **Logging level for...** properties set logging levels for relevant script includes. This allows you to activate extra logging targeted at whenever that script include is invoked via a task SLA. For example, if you know of an issue with the **TaskSLAworkflow** script include, you can use **the com.snc.sla.workflow.log** property to enable logging on that script include. These properties are all set to **Notice** level by default.

 Database and node logs \(**gs.log**\) are visible as system logs from ServiceNow, node logs \(**gs.print**\) only appear in log files.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>### Logging levels

The following logging levels are available for the **Logging level for...** properties:

|Level|Name|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|Emerg|Emergency|Total failure.|
|Alert|Alert|System corruption of a database, for example.|
|Crit|Critical|Typically used for hardware errors, for example.|
|Err|Errors|Errors|
|Warning|Warnings|Warnings|
|Notice|Notice|Possible action required but not essential.|
|Info|Informative|No action required.|
|Debug|Debugging|Generally not used except for capturing everything for fault-finding.|

**Note:** By default, logging levels are set to **Notice**

## SLA repair properties
