# Task SLA table

The Task SLA \[task\_sla\] table stores Task SLA records for the SLAs attached to particular tasks.

For each task, attached SLAs are accessible in a related list on the Task's form.

## Stage values

The following **Stage** values are defined:

-   **In progress**

**Note:** The **Breached** stage value is also available for systems either using the 2010 SLA engine, or running in compatibility mode.
