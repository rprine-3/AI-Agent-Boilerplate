# Use exact times in SLA calculations

When business percentages are used for SLA calculations, they are rounded up to two decimal places.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

As a result, breaches can occur when SLA calculations are rounded up to 100%. You can enable SLA calculations to instead use the business time or actual time left.

For example, a business percentage of 99.951% is rounded up to 100%, which causes a breach.

For more accurate SLA calculations, enable the SLA engine property for using the exact value of the business time left if a schedule is specified or the actual time left if the SLA has no schedule specified.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Service Level Management** &gt; **Properties** &gt; **SLA Engine**.

2.  For the **Use field "business\_time\_left" to calculate breach time instead of "business\_percentage" field** property, select the **Yes** check box.

3.  Click **Save**.
