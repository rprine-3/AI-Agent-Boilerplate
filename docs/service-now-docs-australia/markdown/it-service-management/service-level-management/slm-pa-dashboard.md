# Service level management PA dashboard

The Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) Overview module provides a Performance Analytics \(PA\) Dashboard to review SLA information at a glance.

**Note:** The Service Level Management PA dashboard is deprecated. SLA KPIs are available in the individual dashboards for each workflow, such as [Incident management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident.md) or [Change Management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change.md). For more information on Platform Analytics Solutions containing preconfigured dashboards, see [ITSM dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/itsm-dashboards-content-pack-sd.md).

Users with the itil role can access the dashboard.

You can navigate to the PA dashboard in the following ways:

-   **Service Level Management** &gt; **Overview**
-   **Self – Service** &gt; **Dashboard** &gt; **SLA Overview \(Premium\)**

This dashboard has the following requirements:

-   An entitlement to use Performance Analytics with Service Level Management.
-   The Service Level Management PA Dashboard \(com.snc.pa.sla.overview\) plugin, which contains this dashboard.
-   The SLA Breakdowns plugin \(com.snc.sla.breakdowns\) plugin, because some of the reports are generated from the breakdown data.

</table>## KPI tab

The KPI dashboard uses the following Performance Analytics indicators:

|Indicator|Version introduced|
|---------|------------------|
|Average durations of breached task SLA closed today|London|
|Number of closed task SLA today|London|
|Average duration of achieved SLA today|London|
|Number of achieved closed task SLA today|London|
|Achieved SLAs Today|London|

**Note:** These indicators are calculated on a daily basis to provide trend analysis.

Further operations are performed on the Performance Analytics indicators to generate the following KPIs on the dashboard:
