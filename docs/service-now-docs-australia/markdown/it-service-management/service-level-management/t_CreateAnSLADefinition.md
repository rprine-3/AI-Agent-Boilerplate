# Create an SLA definition

Create SLA definitions to set the conditions under which SLAs attach, pause, stop, and reset on task records. Use them to track and enforce service commitments across your organization.

## Before you begin

When you create an SLA definition, avoid using dot-walked fields that change frequently in any of the SLA conditions \(start, stop, pause, and reset\). The SLA engine features, such as SLA Timeline and SLA Repair, replay the audit history of the Task record that the task\_sla is attached to. The SLA engine does not replay the audit history of any dot-walked fields from that Task, rather only considers the final state of the dot-walk fields.

For example, a pause condition is set to an incident dot-walk field `incident.company.cost_center`. The value of the Cost Center is first set to Finance and later changed to Engineering. When the SLA repair runs, only the final value of the Cost Center is considered. So, if the SLA pause condition is: `incident.company.cost_center is Engineering`, SLA Repair pauses immediately, because SLA Repair does not consider the previous Cost Center value: Finance. This condition also applies to SLA Timeline \(and when executing the SLA Engine asynchronously\).

If the requirement is to pause when incident.company.cost\_center is Engineering and not Finance, then the audit history must be on the Task record using a custom field. Create a custom field \(in this example on the incident table\) such as: u\_company\_cost\_center and a business rule to populate the field when either the company changes or the Cost Center of the company changes. Instead of setting the SLA pause condition to the dot-walked field, set it against the custom field. This approach helps that the task\_sla, SLA Repair, and SLA Timeline show consistent results.

**Note:** The deeper the dot walk, the more business rules are required.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Level Management** &gt; **SLA** &gt; **SLA Definitions**.

2.  Select **New**.

    The SLA Definition form is displayed.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_fzg_nxf_qs"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name that identifies the SLA definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

The type of agreement being defined: **SLA**, **OLA**, or **Underpinning contract**. **Note:** Type is used for reporting purposes only.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target

</td><td>

The target of the agreement being defined: **None**, **Response**, or **Resolution**. Target is used for filtering, searching, and reporting purposes only.**Note:** This feature is available only in new instances starting with Jakarta or a later release.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table that determines the records tracked by the SLA. SLAs can be defined for any table that extends the task table, including incident, change request, and service catalog tasks. You can also create an SLA definition for configuration items \(CIs\) and business services for Event Management.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Flow

</td><td>

The flow to run when the SLA definition attaches to a Task record. Selecting a flow disables the **Workflow** field. If retroactive start is enabled, a task SLA may already be breached when it attaches. By default, the flow does not run in this case. To change this behavior, set the **com.snc.sla.flow.run\_for\_breached** property to `true`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Workflow

</td><td>

The workflow to run when the SLA definition attaches to a Task record. Selecting a workflow disables the **Flow** field. If retroactive start is enabled, a task SLA may already be breached when it attaches. By default, the workflow does not run in this case. To change this behavior, set the **com.snc.sla.workflow.run\_for\_breached** property to `true`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Vendor

</td><td>

The vendor associated with the SLA definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service Commitment

</td><td>

Option to differentiate between a normal SLA definition and a service offering SLA definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable logging

</td><td>

Option to activate debug logging for this SLA definition only.The debug logging information includes details of the conditions that have matched or not matched, and the before and after values for the task SLA and task records.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Duration type

</td><td>

The method for calculating the duration of the SLA. The duration can be a **User specified duration** where the working hour and time zone specifies the duration before the SLA is marked as breached.The second type of duration is **Relative Duration**, where a date and time in the future is configured. For example, **Breach on Due Date** or **End of next business day** can be selected. If the date and time in the **Due Date** field is outside the schedule for the task SLA, the breach time is set to the next available scheduled time. For more information, see [SLA duration types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-level-management/c_SLADuration.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Duration

</td><td>

The length of time the SLA runs before it is marked **Breached**. This field appears only when the duration is **User specified duration**.

**Note:** The number of days specified in this field is converted to 24-hour blocks. If the **Schedule** field identifies a schedule with eight-hour days, a duration of **1 Day** sets the SLA to breach three business days later.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Relative duration works on

</td><td>

The record that the relative duration should be calculated for. The working hours, date and time zone recorded for relative duration are dependent on either the schedule of related **Task record** or the defined **SLA record**.

This field appears only when the relative duration is selected in the **Duration type** field. For more information, see [SLA duration types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-level-management/c_SLADuration.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Schedule source

</td><td>

The schedule to be used when creating task SLAs. You can specify one of the following options:-   **No schedule**: If the **No Schedule** option is selected, the SLA calculates the schedule duration based on a 24 x 7 schedule.
-   **SLA definition**: If the **SLA definition** option is selected, the **Schedule** list appears.

**Schedule**: Specify the hours during which the SLA timer runs.

-   **Task field**: The option label reflects the table selected in the **Table** field. For example, if **Incident** is selected, this option appears as **Incident field**. If the **Task table field** option is selected, the **Schedule source field** list appears.

**Schedule source field**: Select the appropriate field from the task such as an incident or problem that provides the schedule. For example, **Configuration item** &gt; **Schedule**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Timezone Source

</td><td>

The time zone source to be used when creating task SLAs. One of the following time zones can be specified:-   **The caller's timezone**.
-   **The SLA definition's timezone**: If the **The SLA definition's timezone** option is selected, the **Timezone** list appears.

**Timezone**: Specify a time zone for the SLA. The time zone can be the system time zone or active standard geographical time zones.

-   **The CI location's timezone**.
-   **The task's location's timezone**.
-   **The caller's location's timezone**.
For more information, see [Time zones in SLAs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-level-management/c_TimeZonesInSLAs.md).

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Tabs

</td></tr><tr><td>

Start condition

</td><td>

Defines the conditions under which the SLA is attached. From the **When to cancel** list, you can choose the conditions under which the SLA is canceled.

-   **Start conditions are not met** option: If one or more of the specified start conditions change, the SLA is canceled. This option is selected by default.
-   **Cancel conditions are met** option: The start condition must be met only once, thereafter the SLA is canceled only when the cancel condition is met.
-   **Never** option: The SLA is never canceled.
 **Retroactive start**: Option to choose a date and time field from the task that provides the start time of the task SLA. If you select the **Retroactive start** check box, the **Set start to** field and the **Retroactive pause time** check box appear.

-   **Set start to** field: Offers the date and time fields available on the task type that this SLA definition applies to. For example, if you select **Retroactive start** on a Priority 1 SLA definition and choose **Created**, then the SLA starts from the date and time in the **Created** field on the incident.
-   **Retroactive pause time** check box: Enables the calculation of retroactive pause time on the specific SLA definition. For example, if you select **Retroactive start** on a Priority 1 SLA definition and then select the **Retroactive pause time** check box, the SLAs that have enabled retroactive start can recover before the pause time.

**Note:** The **Retroactive pause time** check box is available only when the duration is a user-specified duration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Pause condition

</td><td>

Define the conditions under which the SLA suspends increasing elapsed time. From the **When to resume** list, you can choose the conditions under which the SLA resumes increasing elapsed time.

-   **Pause conditions are not met** option: If one or more of the specified pause conditions no longer match, the elapsed time continues to increase. The **Pause conditions are not met** option is selected by default.
-   **Resume conditions are met** option: If one or more of the specified resume conditions match, the elapsed time continues to increase.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Stop condition

</td><td>

Defines the conditions under which the SLA completes. If all these conditions match, then the task SLA completes regardless of whether it is breached.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reset condition

</td><td>

Determines whether the existing task is canceled or completed on task SLA reset. Defines the conditions under which the running SLA is canceled or completed and a new SLA is attached. For a new SLA to be attached, the start condition must match. Reset condition also helps to configure SLAs when the value of any specific field on the task record changes, changes to, or changes from a specific value. For example, the value of the **Location** field in the task record is 101 Broadway East, Seattle, WA. If you set the SLA reset condition as **Location** **changes from** 101 Broadway East, Seattle, WA, any change in the value of the **Location** field resets the SLA of the task record.
