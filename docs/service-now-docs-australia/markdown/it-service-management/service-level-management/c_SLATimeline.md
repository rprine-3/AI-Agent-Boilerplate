# SLA timeline

The SLA timeline is a feature of the Service Level Management application. The SLA timeline detail helps you understand the progress of an SLA. The timeline provides detailed insight to the task updates which triggered stage changes during the life cycle of a task SLA.

The SLA timeline detail helps you to:

-   View the progress of SLAs, OLAs, and underpinning contracts.
-   View related task updates.
-   Identify the reason a task update triggered a specific stage in the task SLA.
-   Debug and verify a task SLA and the SLA definition.

**Note:** This feature is available only on the SLA Engine 2011 version.

Role required: itil, sla\_admin, sla\_manager

**Business elapsed time:** Specifies the business time that has accumulated from the beginning of the SLA to its end.

 **Business time left:**

Specifies the business time that is remaining by which the SLA task must be completed.**Note:** The selected option from the choice list is saved as a user preference and is selected by default when you navigate to the SLA timeline in the future. Whether you set the system property **Always populate business fields on a Task SLA** to true or false, the SLA timeline always populates the **Business fields for representation**.

Enables filtering of the data displayed by the SLA timeline . You can filter data by selecting the following options:-   **Show only breached**: When selected, displays the task SLAs that are breached. This check box appears only when the SLA engine property **Enable compatibility with 2010 ‘breached’ stage for SLAs** is set to false.
-   **SLA Stage**: Select to view the task SLA records that match the final stage of a specific task SLA.

**Note:** If the SLA engine property **Enable compatibility with 2010 ‘breached’ stage for SLAs** is set to true, the **Completed** stage appears as **Achieved** and the **Breached** check box appears under the SLA stage.

-   **SLA Definitions**: Select to view the task SLA records for a specific SLA definition.

Provides several zoom in/out levels to control SLA timeline zoom resolution.**Note:** If the duration of any task SLA is more than 1 year, then the 5-minutes view is disabled because of performance issues and browser limitations. The condition is applicable for all the browsers.

For IE and EDGE:

-   The 5-minutes view is not available for any task SLA that has a duration of more than 35 days.
-   The 8-hours view is not available for any task SLA that has a duration of more than 10 months, and the default view is set to 16 hours.
-   The 16-hours view is not available for any task SLA that has a duration of more than 21 months, and the default view is set to 24 hours.

The legend provides the following categories.-   **Shapes**
    -   **Completed**: Symbolizes a task update which completed the task SLA.

    -   **Task update with stage change**: Symbolizes an update of the task which also led to the change in SLA stage.
    -   **Breach time \(Estimated\)**: Symbolizes estimated Breach time of an in-progress task SLA that is not yet breached or paused.
    -   **Expected start**: Symbolizes estimated Start time of a task SLA. This scenario is encountered for a retroactive task SLA starting in the future.
-   **Bar color \(SLA Duration\)**
    -   **Below 50%**: Green represents a task SLA stage below 50% of the defined SLA duration.
    -   **In-between 50% and 75%**: Yellow represents a task SLA stage between 50% and 75% of the defined SLA duration.
    -   **In-between 75% and 100%**: Orange represents a task SLA stage between 75% and 100% of the defined SLA duration.
    -   **Above 100%**: Red represents a task SLA stage after the SLA is breached.
    -   **Paused**: Gray represents a task SLA stage when it is paused.
-   **Modifiers**
    -   **Retroactive \(in lighter shade\)**: Represents the stages, updates, and out-of-schedules that are in the retroactive time.
    -   **Out of schedule \(with center stripe\)**: Represents the time period that the task SLA was outside of the schedule time defined in the SLA definition.

Task SLA Details

</td><td>

Displays the details of a task SLA, depending on where you click the timeline. **Stage details**: When you click the update on the task SLA timeline, the stage details section appears with the following information:

-   Summary of the changes or useful information relevant to the selected stage.
-   Information on stage start and stage end such as the start and the end time, actual elapsed time and percentage, actual time left, pause duration. The stage information also displays any breach of the SLA.

**Note:** If no schedule is attached to the SLA definition, then business values are hidden and actual values are displayed. If any schedule is attached to the SLA definition, both the business and the actual values are displayed.


 **Task update details**: When you click the task update, the **Task update details** section appears with the following information:

-   **SLA definition conditions**: Displays the respective conditions of the task SLA and the values for the related columns at that point for the task. A blue check mark appears for the conditions that affect the SLA stage change.
-   **Time**: Displays the date and the time when an update takes place in the task SLA. It also displays the delta changes that occurred in the task for that update.

 **Out of schedule details**: When you click the out of business schedule on the task SLA timeline, the outside business period details section appears with the following information:-   **Start date**: Displays the start date of the selected task SLA.
-   **End date**: Displays the end date of the selected task SLA.
-   **Duration**: Displays the duration of the current out of schedule selection.
-   **Total out of schedule duration**: Displays the total out-ofschedule hours until the end of the current selection.

 **Note:** Click \[Omitted image "SLALeftCarousel.png"\] Alt text: Left Carousel in SLA Timeline and \[Omitted image "SLARightCarousel.png"\] Alt text: Right Carousel in SLA Timeline to navigate to the left and right task update in the details section.

</table>**Note:**

The SLA timeline receives information about the task from the audit history and refers to the current SLA definition to pull data for the SLA timeline. The SLA timeline displays task SLA information as though the SLA repair is already executed, irrespective of whether it is executed or not.
