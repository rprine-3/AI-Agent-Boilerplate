# Define a service contract

A new table of SLA contracts is provided through the **Service Level Management** &gt; **Service Contracts** module. These contracts group together SLAs that relate to a single vendor or customer, as well as the CIs, locations, groups, users, and child contracts that are related to the contract.

The table Service Contract \[ast\_service\] extends the table Contract \[ast\_contract\]. It stores information about service contracts for asset management purposes. To get the service contract functionality, activate the Service Level Management - Contract Management Integration \[com.snc.sla.contract2\] plugin. Installing the SLA Contract Add-on plugin adds relations to this table to make it useful for Service Management purposes. Once the plugin is installed, the Service Contract record possesses related lists for:

-   SLAs
-   Contract CIs
-   Contract Locations
-   Contract Groups
-   Contract Users
-   Child Contracts

**Note:** The **Process non-contractual SLAs** check box is available for the zboot and upgrade customers. The system property **com.snc.sla.contract.tables** is not available for zboot customers so that contracts are processed for any table in the system instead of specific tables.

</table>## Add contract field to task form

Depending on how the contract is used, the **Contract** field can be added to any task form by configuring the form. For information about how to configure a form, see [Form configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/basic-form-administration.md) . As the **Caller**, **Assignment Group**, **Location**, and **Configuration item** fields are populated, the **Contract** field filters appropriately, helping the support desk to associate the ticket to the correct contract.

**Note:** Do not add the same field to different sections of a form unless the field displays read-only data. Having two or more instances of an editable field can cause data loss and prevent the proper functioning of UI and data policies.
