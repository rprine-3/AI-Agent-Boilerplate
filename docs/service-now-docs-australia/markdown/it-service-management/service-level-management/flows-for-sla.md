# Flows for SLA

Use the flow actions to send SLA notifications when the duration specified in the SLA definition is crossed.

Starting with the Yokohama release, the new base system flows replace the existing workflows for Service Level Management. However, you can continue to create custom workflows or use the existing ones. To migrate your existing workflows to flows, check the new base system flows available in Workflow Studio for guidance. For any new requirements, use flows.

You can create and edit flows using Workflow Studio. The default flow that is available with the Service Level Management plugin is **Default SLA flow**.

The Default SLA flow creates events to send notifications. For example, it notifies the assigned user when a task SLA reaches 50% completion.

The **SLA Notification and Escalation flow** creates the events that send out notifications. When a task reaches 50% of its allotted SLA duration, a notification is sent to the assignee and the user listed in the **Supported by** field on the configuration item. At 75% and 100%, a notification is sent to the assignee and the assignee's manager.

**Note:** This feature is available only in new instances starting with Orlando or a later release.
