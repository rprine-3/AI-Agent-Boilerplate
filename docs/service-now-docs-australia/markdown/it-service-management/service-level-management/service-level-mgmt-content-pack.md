# Legacy: Platform Analytics Solutions for Service Level Management

This Platform Analytics Solution contains preconfigured dashboards. These dashboards contain actionable data visualizations that help you improve your business processes and practices.

**Note:** The Service Level Management PA dashboard is deprecated. SLA KPIs are available in the individual dashboards for each workflow, such as [Incident management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident.md) or [Change Management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change.md). For more information on Platform Analytics Solutions containing preconfigured dashboards, see [ITSM dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/itsm-dashboards-content-pack-sd.md).

## Enabling the Platform Analytics Solution

Use the Performance Analytics widgets on the dashboard to visualize data over time, analyze your business processes, and identify areas of improvement. With solutions, you can get value from Performance Analytics for your application with minimal setup.

**Note:** Solutions include some dashboards that are inactive by default. You can activate these dashboards to make them visible to end users according to your business needs.

For unlimited access to all features of this Platform Analytics Solution, purchase a Performance Analytics subscription. For more information, see [Activating your Performance Analytics subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_PremiumPerformanceAnalytics.md).

To enable the solution for Service Level Management, an admin navigates to **System Definitions** &gt; **Plugins** and activates the Service Level Management PA Dashboard \(com.snc.pa.sla.overview\) plugin.

To use this Platform Analytics Solution, you must have an entitlement to use Performance Analytics with Service Level Management.

## Domain separation and 'Run As' user

In some solutions, System Administrator is the **Run As** user for data collection jobs in the Platform Analytics Solutions. In other solutions, the **Run As** user for data collection jobs is left blank. Verify that the **Run As** user exists on the instance, and that this user has the appropriate level of access. An inappropriate **Run As** user can cause errors or limit the data that is collected. This setting only has an effect if domain separation is enabled.

The Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) Overview module provides a Performance Analytics \(PA\) Dashboard to review SLA information at a glance.
