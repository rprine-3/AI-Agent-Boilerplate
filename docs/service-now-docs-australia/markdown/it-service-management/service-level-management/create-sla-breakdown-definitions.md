# Create SLA breakdown definitions

You can define an SLA breakdown to capture, store, and relay detailed task ownership information and duration for all task SLA records related to a specific task \(incident\). SLA breakdown is configurable and you can configure it on the basis of a specific SLA definition.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

SLA breakdown data includes:

-   Task SLA
-   SLA Definition
-   Assigned to
-   Assignment Group
-   Start time
-   End time
-   Business time during this period
-   Total % of allocated SLA Duration
-   Whether the Task SLA is breached during this period

**Note:** SLA breakdown is on a per task-type basis. For example, once you define a breakdown definition for Incident that uses the breakdown table \[SLA Breakdown by Assignment\], you cannot define another breakdown definition for this task type.
