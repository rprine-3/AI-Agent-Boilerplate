# Plan product enhancements into different releases

Move product enhancements into different releases of the product or service to plan the scope of your release.

## Before you begin

You can only plan releases that have the validates version option set to true.

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.product\_manager

## About this task

Release planning is done using the Kanban board. The vertical lanes represent releases that are in the Draft or Pending state. The cards in each release lane represent product enhancements associated with the release.

When linking a plan version fromServiceNow® Agile Development 2.0, Jira, or GitLab, you can select the **Auto-create product versions from plan versions** option. Selecting this option automatically creates a release associated with one of the following, depending on the tool you select:

-   A Fix version created in Jira.
-   A Milestone created in GitLab.
-   A Release created in Agile Development 2.0.

When a release is created from a version from one of these planning tools, the product enhancements are planned for the appropriate release as well. This option verifies that the release planning in DPR reflects the planning state from the planning tool.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the products and services icon \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-products.png"\] Alt text: Products and services icon.\).

3.  Select a product or service from the list to open.

4.  Select **Release planning**.

    The Release planning page shows a Kanban board with lanes for the backlog and each product release. Only the releasesthat validate versions and are in Draft or Pending states are shown. You can identify the draft releases by the lane header color or the word \(Draft\) at the end of the release name. The release lanes are sorted by the order of the release creation date, from the most recent to the oldest.

    Enhancements are displayed as cards in the release lane they are associated with.

5.  View a release in the Pending state by selecting the sub menu icon \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-menu.png"\] Alt text: Sub menu icon.\) of a release lane and select the **View release** option.

6.  On the Kanban board, complete your release planning.
