# Retarget a release

Change the release readiness target to reschedule the release period.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.product\_manager or sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

## About this task

The available release targets and the **Out of band** check box depend on the following conditions:

The **Release readiness target** lists target dates based on the product-level release setting.

|Condition|Filtered targets|All targets|
|---------|----------------|-----------|
|Product has release calendars defined in the release settings and targets are linked to those calendars.|✓|✗|
|Product has release calendars defined in the release settings but no targets are linked to those calendars.|✗|✓|
|Product doesn't have release settings configured.|✗|✓|

The visibility of the **Out of band** check box depends on product-level release settings or two system properties.

|Condition|Visible|Hidden|
|---------|-------|------|
|**Release readiness dates** is toggled on in product-level release settings.|✓|✗|
|**Release readiness dates** is toggled off in product-level release settings.|✗|✓|
|Product doesn't have release settings configured and the **sn\_dpr.out\_of\_band\_release\_allowed** system property is **true**.|✓|✗|
|Product doesn't have release settings configured and the **sn\_dpr.out\_of\_band\_release\_allowed** system property is **false**.|✗|✓|
|You don't have any of the roles defined in the **sn\_dpr.out\_of\_band\_release\_roles** system property.|✗|✓|

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the releases icon \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-release.png"\] Alt text: Releases icon.\).

3.  Select a release from the list to open.

4.  On any section page,select the release action icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-actions-menu.png"\] Alt text:\) and then select **Retarget release**.

    **Note:** Release readiness target and Release target are used interchangeably. Both terms refer to the same concept - release readiness target date.

5.  On the Retarget release dialog box, select a different release readiness target from **Release readiness target**.

    **Note:** The new release readiness target date must be within the defined schedule of the release.

6.  You can also make the release as an out-of-band release by selecting **Out of band**.

7.  If you selected the out-of-band option, then select a release calendar from the **Release calendar** to tag the release and use its release target.

8.  Select **Confirm**.


## Result

-   The readiness target date of the release is updated to the new date.
-   For timeline-oriented releases, the phase planned start and end dates, andkey dates impacted are adjusted based on the retargeted date. This adjustment is made after recalculating the number of days that have changed from the original schedule.

    **Note:** If a holiday schedule is attached to the release and the revised key dates fall on a holiday, the last workday before the holiday is considered as the revised key date.


## What to do next

Update the planned dates on the associated change requests manually because they are not automatically updated when you retarget the release.
