# Close a release

Complete a release after all tasks have been completed and all phases are in compliance with the mapped policies.

## Before you begin

A release must be in the Review state to mark it as complete.

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

## About this task

**Note:** A release that follows a stage-oriented process automatically moves to Completed when it’s compliant, provided that the **stage\_workflow\_auto\_transition** system property is set to true.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the releases icon \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-release.png"\] Alt text: Releases icon.\).

3.  Select a release from the list to open.

4.  Review the completeness of the release to determine if all the release work is complete.

5.  Close the release.

    -   In a single product or service release, select **Complete release**from any section page.
    -   In a multi-product release, select **Complete release** on the Dashboard page or any section's page with **All products and services** selected.

        **Note:** The **Complete release** button is not available on the individual section pages when a primary product or included product or service is selected.


## Result

The release is closed and its state is updated to Completed.
