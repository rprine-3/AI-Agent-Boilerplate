Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.product\_manager or sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the releases icon \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-release.png"\] Alt text: Releases icon.\).

3.  Select a release from the list to open.

    The **Artifacts** label is available when you select **Overview**, **Release scope**, or **Change requests**.
