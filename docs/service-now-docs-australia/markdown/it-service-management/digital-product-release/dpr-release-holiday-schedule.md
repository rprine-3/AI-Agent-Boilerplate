# Holiday schedules in a release

You can associate a holiday schedule with a release so that the phase and release durations are calculated considering non-working days.

The following example of a release shows how holiday schedules affect its overall timeline to keep important dates on working days. When a release is retargeted, planned start and end dates for phases are adjusted by the retarget days.

Let's say a release has 4 phases: Planning, Development, Testing, and Implementation, with durations of 10, 25, 15, and 10 days, respectively, totaling 60 working days. The release readiness target date is set to Sep 5, 2025, and has a public and weekend holiday schedule \(U.S. Federal + Weekend holidays in 2025\) associated. So, the start and end dates of each phase are adjusted to account for non-working days \(holidays and weekends on the schedule\), to keep the phase durations intact. Key dates also follow the same adjustment rule.

-   **Considerations:**

    -   Total release duration: 60 working days
    -   Phases and durations: Planning: 10 days; Development: 25 days; Testing: 15 days; Implementation: 10 days
    -   Release readiness target date: Sep 5, 2025
    -   Working days in a week: Mon through Fri \(5 days\)
    -   Non-working days on the associated schedule:
        1.  Weekends are non-working days so skipped.
        2.  Federal holidays in 2025, relevant to the release period are as follows:
            -   Jun 19: Juneteenth \(Thu\).
            -   Jul 4: Independence Day \(Fri\).
            -   Sep 1: Labour Day \(Mon\).
    -   Adjustment rules:
        -   The original end date of the last phase is the release readiness target date, usually a working day so no adjustment needed. For all phases before the last, original start and end dates are derived by counting consecutive calendar days, regardless of whether they fall on working or non-working days. Their adjusted end and start dates are the actual dates on a working day, skipping non-working days.
        -   The original start date is determined by counting all calendar days backward from the adjusted end date. The adjusted start date is the actual start date on a working day, skipping non-working days.
        -   If a key date or the phase start or end date falls on a holiday or weekend, shift to the previous working day.
        -   The duration of each phase \(in days\) remains fixed, but holidays and weekends within the phase period extend the calendar span.
    With these considerations, let's calculate the working days in the release timeline and adjust the phase and release duration accordingly.
