## Restart the release phase

You can start over a stage-oriented release from any previously completed phase if you encounter an issue that requires you to go back.

### Before you begin

**Note:** When you restart a release from a completed phase, it resets that phase and any later phases up to the current one. It also resets the status of tasks, approval requests, and policies linked to each affected phase.

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

### About this task

By restarting a phase, you can reassess and adjust the plan to overcome the new issues, ensuring that the release stays on track and meets its overall goals. For example, if an artifact version fails validation during certification, you can select a new version of the artifact. Then, you can restart the release from an earlier phase to repeat the same tasks, mapped policies, configuration items, and approvals from those phases.

### Procedure

1.  On the Release timeline page, select the release phase action button \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-menu.png"\] Alt text: Release phase action icon.\) and then select **Restart phase**.

2.  On the Restart phase dialog box, select a phase from where you want to restart.

    The list displays the completed phases.

3.  Select **Restart**.


### Result

-   The state of the selected phase updates to In Progress and of all the later phases updates to Pending.
-   The state of the current phase updates to Restarted.
-   The state of all tasks in the affected phases updates to Open.
-   The configuration items associated with the affected phases are reassociated with the newly created corresponding phases.
-   The last run status of the policies mapped to theses phases updates to Not run.
-   Tasks, policies, and approvals associated with the phase before it was restarted are excluded from the respective metrics and lists on the Release overview dashboard.

## Execute the release

View the release status and work on its phases and tasks, and policies.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.product\_manager or sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

### About this task

Automated email notifications are triggered at key release life cycle events. Notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders when:

-   A phase reaches its end date
-   A release task is 2 days from its due date
-   The release is 1 day from its readiness target
-   A phase's state changes
-   A policy is executed and resulted in non-compliant
-   A task approval request is submitted
-   A task approval request is rejected

For more information, see [Email notifications in Digital Product Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-email-notification.md).

    The planned end date must be on or after the planned start date. The planned start date for the next phase is automatically set to the day after the planned end date of the current phase.

    The **Actual start date** and **Actual end date** fields are populated automatically when the phase starts and ends.

    Hover over a phase on the release timeline to display the phase details, including its state, planned start date, planned end date, and actual end date.

3.  Manage the progress of a phase in the release.

    **Note:** If the **stage\_workflow\_auto\_transition** system property is set to true, the phases are automatically closed when all tasks in it are closed and policies comply.

    1.  On the Release timeline page, select a phase on the timeline or use the arrow buttons to navigate to the previous or next phase.

    2.  When all tasks in the current phase are complete and mapped policies comply, mark the phase as complete by selecting **Complete phase**.

        Alternatively, you can complete the current phase from the Release tasks or Release policies pages. Select the release actions icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-actions-menu.png"\] Alt text:\) and then select **Complete current release**.

        **Note:** If any of the mapped policies is noncompliant, you can complete a phase only when you have any of the roles defined in the system property **sn\_dpr.complete\_phase\_override**.

        The state of the current phase is updated to Completed and the next phase is started. The actual end date of the current phase is updated to the current date.

4.  Select **Release tasks** to add tasks in a release phase for a product.

    1.  On the Release tasks page, select **Add task**.

    2.  On the Create task dialog box, add details for the task like its name, phase it belongs to, end date, and description.

    3.  If the task needs approval, perform the following steps:

        1.  Select **Yes** in the **Need approval** field.

            The **Assigned to** and **Approval definition** fields appear.

        2.  From the **Assigned to** list, select the user who would approve the task.
        3.  From the **Approval definition** list, select an approval definition to trigger the approval based on the predefined condition.
    4.  Select **Create task**.

    The task is created in the Pending state andadded to the selected phase.

    For an approval task, an approval record is created for the approvers to review and act.An email notification is also sent to them. For more information, see [Approve or reject a release task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-approve-reject-release-task.md).

5.  Track and manage the progress of tasks for the selected phase.

    1.  On the Release tasks page, expand a phase in the list by selecting the expand row icon.

        You can apply filters to view specific tasks or change the view type by selecting the **Kanban** or **List** option. You can also view only tasks assigned to you by selecting the **My tasks** toggle.

    2.  Select a task to open in the Task details pane.

    3.  Review the task in the Task details pane, or select **Full details** to open the task record in the form view.

    4.  Assign the task in the **Assigned to** field to the user who will work on it.

    5.  Review the approval status for an approval task in the **Approval** field.

    6.  Update the **State** field with the status of the task that doesn't need any approval.

        The state of an approval task is automatically updated when approved.

    7.  Select **Save** to save the changes.

        If you complete the current task and the system property **sn\_dpr.sequential\_task\_execution** is set to true, the next task in the order moves to the Open state.

6.  Select **Release policies** to manage mapping of policies to a release phase.

    1.  On the Release policies page, review the mapped policies by their status.

        **Note:** Policies can’t be mapped to a completed or cancelled phase.

    2.  To map a policy to the selected phase,

        1.  Select **Add**.
        2.  On the Map Policies dialog box, select one or more policies from the list to map to the phase.
        3.  Select **Map policies**.
        The selected policies are mapped to the phase and are listed in the Policy Mappings list.

    3.  To delete an existing policy mapping,

        1.  Select the policies from the Release policies list.
        2.  Select **Remove**, and confirm.
        Selected policies mappings are removed from the phase.

        **Note:** For an in-progress phase, if you remove a previously executed policy, the remaining policies are automatically run after its removal. The updated execution statuses of the individual policies are aggregated and shown in the **Policy status** field on the **Details** tab.

7.  On the Release policies page, select **Run policies** to run policies on the current phase.

    All mapped policies are executed in the background for the current phase \(**In Progress** state\). You can check the execution status by refreshing the list on the **Policies** tab.

    When a policy execution results in a non-compliant status, an email notification is sent to the release admin and other relevant stakeholders.

    When multiple policies are mapped to a phase, their execution statuses are aggregated into the phase's overall status. You can view this aggregated status in the **Policy status** field on the **Details** tab.

8.  If a policy fails compliance, you can request an exception with justification.

    **Note:** This option is only available when both Digital Product Release and GRC: Policy and Compliance Management are installed.

    1.  Select the policy that failed.

    2.  Select Request exception.

    3.  In the Request policy exception, provide the reason, start date, end date, and business justification for the exception.

    4.  Select **Request**.

    The exception request is sent to the Compliance group. For more information about the review and approval of exception request, see [Review the policy exception and extension request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/review-policy-ext-and-extension-req-ws.md) and [Manage policy exceptions and extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/manage-policy-exceptions-ws.md).
