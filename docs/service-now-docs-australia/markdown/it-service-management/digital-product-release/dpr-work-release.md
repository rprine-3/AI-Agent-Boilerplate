Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.product\_manager or sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

## Procedure

    **Note:** The selected schedule must be within the release duration \(release target date\).

    The phase start and end dates are updated and the release duration is recalculated by considering the non-working days in the schedule. For more information on how schedules impact the dates of phases and release target, see [Holiday schedules in a release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-release-holiday-schedule.md).

    2.  On the Create task dialog box, add details for the task like its name, phase it belongs to, end date, and description.

    3.  If the task needs approval, perform the following steps:

    4.  Select **Create task**.

    The task is created in the Pending state andadded to the selected phase.

For more information, see [Approve or reject a release task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-approve-reject-release-task.md).

3.  Track and manage the progress of tasks for the selected phase.

    1.  On the Release tasks page, expand a phase in the list by selecting the expand row icon.

        You can apply filters to view specific tasks or change the view type by selecting the **Kanban** or **List** option. You can also view only tasks assigned to you by selecting the **My tasks** toggle.

    2.  Select a task to open in the Task details pane.

    3.  Review the task in the Task details pane, or select **Full details** to open the task record in the form view.

    4.  Assign the task in the **Assigned to** field to the user who will work on it.

    5.  Review the approval status for an approval task in the **Approval** field.

    6.  Update the **State** field with the status of the task that doesn't need any approval.

        The state of an approval task is automatically updated when approved.

    7.  Select **Save** to save the changes.

        If you complete the current task and the system property **sn\_dpr.sequential\_task\_execution** is set to true, the next task in the order moves to the Open state.

4.  Select **Release policies** to manage mapping of policies to a release phase.

    1.  On the Release policies page, review the mapped policies by their status.

        **Note:** Policies can’t be mapped to a completed or cancelled phase.

    2.  To map a policy to the selected phase,

        1.  Select **Add**.
        2.  On the Map Policies dialog box, select one or more policies from the list to map to the phase.
        3.  Select **Map policies**.
        The selected policies are mapped to the phase and are listed in the Policy Mappings list.

    3.  To delete an existing policy mapping,

        1.  Select the policies from the Release policies list.
        2.  Select **Remove**, and confirm.
        Selected policies mappings are removed from the phase.

        **Note:** For an in-progress phase, if you remove a previously executed policy, the remaining policies are automatically run after its removal. The updated execution statuses of the individual policies are aggregated and shown in the **Policy status** field on the **Details** tab.

5.  Run policies on the current phase to check for the compliance status.

    -   On the Release policies or Release tasks page, select **Run policies**.
    -   On other pages, select the release action icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-actions-menu.png"\] Alt text:\) and then select **Run policies**.
    All mapped policies are executed in the background for the current phase \(**In Progress** state\). You can check the execution status by refreshing the list on the **Policies** tab.

    A scheduled job runs daily to execute the policies that are mapped to the phase. The Execution status column on the Policies list for each phase is updated to show the compliance status after each run.

    When multiple policies are mapped to a phase, their execution statuses are aggregated into the phase's overall status. You can view this aggregated status in the **Policy status** field on the **Details** tab.

6.  If a policy fails compliance, you can request an exception with justification.

    **Note:** This option is only available when both Digital Product Release and GRC: Policy and Compliance Management are installed.

    1.  Select the policy that failed.

    2.  Select Request exception.

    3.  In the Request policy exception, provide the reason, start date, end date, and business justification for the exception.

    4.  Select **Request**.

    The exception request is sent to the Compliance group.

    After the exception is approved, the policy status shows as Compliant with exception in subsequent executions. The phase can be completed if all other policies are compliant.

7.  Add or update key dates in a timeline-oriented release that should be in relation to the release target date.

    These key dates help you define and track important events that can happen during the release period.

    -   Add a new key date to the release:
        1.  On the Release timeline page, select **Add key date**.
        2.  In the Add key date dialog box, fill in the fields.

            For more information, see [Release key date form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/release-key-date-form.md).

        3.  Select **Save**.
    -   Update the existing key dates in the release:
        1.  Select a key date in the timeline bar to open the Key date details form in the side-panel.

        2.  On the Key date form, update the fields.
        3.  Select **Save**.
8.  Manage the progress of a phase in the release.

    1.  On the Release timeline page, select a phase on the timeline or use the arrow buttons to navigate to the previous or next phase.

    2.  When all tasks in the current phase are complete and mapped policies comply, mark the phase as complete by selecting **Complete phase**.

        Alternatively, you can complete the current phase from the Release tasks or Release policies pages. Select the release actions icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-actions-menu.png"\] Alt text:\) and then select **Complete current release**.

        **Note:** If any of the mapped policies is noncompliant, you can complete a phase only when you have any of the roles defined in the system property **sn\_dpr.complete\_phase\_override**.

        The state of the current phase is updated to Completed and the next phase is started. The actual end date of the current phase is updated to the current date.

9.  Close a release after verifying its completeness.

    For more information, see [Close a release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-complete-release.md).
