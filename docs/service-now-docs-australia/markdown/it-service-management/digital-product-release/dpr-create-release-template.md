# Create a release template

Create a release template to predefine the release process. The template contains templates for release phases, tasks, exit criteria for each of the phases, key dates,and approvals.

## Before you begin

Identify phases, tasks within each phase, exit criteria for each phase, key dates,and required approvals for a release. If there are different processes followed for each kind of release or product, you should create multiple release templates.

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.release\_template\_admin orsn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

## About this task

The release teams can use these templates to create a release. All the phases, tasks, key dates,approvals, and phases' exit criteria from the template are applied to the new release. The release template helps the release team track and perform all the required tasks to complete the release on time.

**Note:** You can use the **Back** button to navigate to previous steps in the template creation wizard. The button is available in the Tasks, Policies, and Key dates activities. Data entered in a step is automatically saved when you navigate back.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the release administration icon \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-release-admin.png"\] Alt text: Release administration icon.\).

3.  On the Release administration page, select the **Release templates** tab.

4.  Create a release template or update an existing one.

    -   To create a release template, select **New**.
    -   To modify an existing release template, open the release template from the list.
5.  On the Create release template dialog box, add details like name and short description.

6.  From the **Type** list, select a release type.

7.  Select **Enable release to validate product versions** to determine if a release created from this template can validate a new product versions.

8.  Select **Create**.

    A release template is created and opens in the release template setup playbook page to define the template.

9.  In the Release Process activity, select between a timeline-oriented or stage-oriented release process.

    |Release process|Description|
    |---------------|-----------|
    |**Timeline-oriented process**|This release process is appropriate for creating releases that have fixed deadlines and that follow a strict schedule.|
    |**Stage-oriented process**|This release process is appropriate for creating releases that prioritize completing objectives and features over following a strict schedule.|

10. Select **Mark as done**.

    The Release Process activity is marked as complete and can’t be edited further. The Phases activity becomes editable.

11. In the Phases activity, add phases to the release template.

    1.  Enter a unique phase name, the duration of the phase in days, and a short description.

        The **Duration** field appears only for the timeline-oriented process.The combined duration for all phases in the template must not exceed the maximum duration set in the **sn\_dpr.max\_template\_duration** system property.

    2.  Select **Add new phase** to add another phase.

        Repeat the steps to add more phases as required.

    3.  In the **Release readiness target phase** section, choose a phase from the **Select phase** list to align it with the release readiness.

        The selected phase's end date is considered as the release readiness target date.

    4.  In the **Schedule** section, choose a schedule from the **Select schedule** list as the default schedule.

        The list shows the schedule entries from the Schedule \[cmn\_schedule\] table of the type Excluded.

        Adding a schedule considers holidays and weekends and adjusts the phase and release durations accordingly. This helps improve release planning accuracy by including actual working days. For more information, see [Holiday schedules in a release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-release-holiday-schedule.md).

        **Note:** This option is available only for the timeline-oriented release process.

    5.  Change the order of phases by selecting the move phase up \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-up.png"\] Alt text: Move phase up icon.\) or move phase down \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-down.png"\] Alt text: Move phase down icon.\) icons to define the sequence in which they’re processed in a release.

    6.  Select **Mark as done** to complete adding all required phases to the release template.

        The Phases activity is marked as complete. The Tasks activity becomes editable, displaying each phase in separate tabs.

12. In the Tasks activity, manage tasks to define the work that must be completed during each phase of a release.

    You can also attach supporting files and define template fields for tasks.

    1.  Select a phase tab in which you want to add a task.

    2.  In the **Task name** field, enter a unique name for the task.

    3.  In the **Need approval** field, select whether the task requires approval.

    4.  If approval is required for the task, select an approval definition from the **Approval definition** list.

        For more information, see [Create an approval definition in Digital Product Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-create-approval-definition.md).

    5.  Add supportive fields and documents to the task.

        1.  To include an additional field in the task, select a field from the **Field** list and its default value in the **Update to** field.

            The list shows fields from the Release Task \(sn\_dpr\_model\_release\_task\) table.

        2.  To add a document to the task, select **+ Add file**, and select a document.

            When you create a release from the template, selected fields and attached documents are copied to the release task records. These fields appear in the Release Task record form and documents in the Attachments pane and Activity stream.

            To display custom template fields on the release task record page in the workspace, you must add those fields to the DPR Release Task view. For more information, see [Display custom template fields on release task records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-product-release/dpr-create-release-template.md).

    1.  Select **Add new task** to add another task to the phase.

    2.  After all tasks are added to the current phase, select **Next phase**.

## Display custom template fields on release task records

Configure the DPR Release Task view to display the custom template fields on release task records of a release.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.release\_template\_admin or sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

### About this task

Custom template fields that you add to tasks in a release template are stored on the release task record when a release is created. By default, these fields are not visible on the release task record page in the Digital Product Release Workspace. To display them, configure the DPR Release Task view to include the fields.

**Note:** This configuration applies at the table view level. All users with access to the DPR Release Task view see the custom fields after the view is updated.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Tables** &gt; **DPR Release Task \[sn\_dpr\_model\_release\_task\] table**.

2.  Open the DPR Release Task form view \(dpr\_rel\_task\_view\).

3.  Configure the form layout to add the custom fields on the form.

    For more information on configuring form layout, see [ServiceNow AI Platform® form administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/form-administration-landing-page.md).

4.  Select **Save** to save the form view configuration.

    The custom fields appear on all release task records created from templates that include those fields. This is a one-time configuration — you do not need to repeat it for each release or template.
