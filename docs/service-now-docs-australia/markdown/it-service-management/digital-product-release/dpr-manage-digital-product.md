Watch the following video to learn how release planning in Digital Product Release helps you define the scope of a release.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Release planning in Digital Product Release.

**Note:** When a Plan Version from the DevOps data model is mapped to a Software Model in DPR, any Work Items associated with that Plan Version get automatically listed in the Release scope page. If a work item is associated with a product enhancement, it shows as a child under that product enhancement in the list. You can track these work items on the Release scope page of the release.

This option is available when you have selected the **Auto-create product versions from plan versions** while associating the product with a plan from ServiceNow® Agile Development 2.0, Jira, or GitLab.

The mappings between plan versions and software models are stored in the Plan Version to Software Models \(sn\_devops\_m2m\_plan\_version\_software\_model\) table. The mappings between work items and plan versions are stored in the Work Item to Release Versions \(sn\_devops\_m2m\_work\_item\_plan\_version\) table.
