# Add a product to a multi-product release

Add a product to a multi-product release to expand the scope of the release as requirements evolve. The added product gets its own child release with phases, tasks, and policies aligned to the main release.

## Before you begin

The release must be in the Pending or In Progress state.

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin or sn\_dpr\_model.product\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the releases icon \(\[Omitted image "dpr-icon-release.png"\] Alt text: Releases icon.\).

3.  Select a release from the list to open.

4.  Select the **Products** tab and select **Add product**.

5.  In the **Product name** field, select a product you want to add.

    You can't add a product that already has an active release in this multi-product release. If a product was previously removed, you can add it again.

6.  In the **Version** field, provide the version of the selected product.

    You can select an existing version or enter a new version.

    **Note:** When **Validates product or service version** is selected, the new version number must be unique for the product or service.

7.  Select **Add**.


## Result

A catalog request is submitted and auto-approved. The following actions occur:

-   A release is created for the included product with phases aligned to the main release.
-   Tasks and policies are created for each phase based on the release template.
-   The phase management in the release differs based on the release's current state:
    -   **Pending**: The product is added directly and its release is created.
    -   **In Progress**: The product is added and a release is created and started immediately. The system begins executing policies sequentially from the earliest phase to catch up to the main release's current phase.

## Adding a product to an in-progress release

Consider a multi-product release with three products \(Product A, Product B, and Product C\) that has the following phases: Planning, Development, Testing, Pre-deployment, and Deployment. The release is in the Testing phase.

You add Product D to this release while it is in the Testing phase. When the product is added, the system executes phase policies sequentially for Product D, starting from the earliest phase:

1.  Planning phase policies are executed first.
2.  If Planning policies pass, Development phase policies are executed.
3.  This execution continues until Product D catches up to the current release phase \(Testing\) or until a phase fails.

If policies for any phase fail — for example, Development — Product D remains in the failed phase. The other products aren’t affected and remain in Testing.

|Product|Current phase|
|-------|-------------|
|Product A|Testing|
|Product B|Testing|
|Product C|Testing|
|Product D|Development \(failed\)|

In this case, the Testing phase can’t be closed until all products, including Product D, pass their policies and reach the Testing phase.
