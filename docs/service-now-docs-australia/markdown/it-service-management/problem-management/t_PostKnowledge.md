# Post knowledge

You can create a knowledge article from the problem immediately, and not wait for when the problem is closed.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, knowledge

## About this task

If you have Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — Knowledge Integration plugin \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.knowledge\) activated, see [Create a known error article](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/create-known-error-from-problem.md). The topic applies to legacy Problem \(London or a prior release\) only.

## Procedure

1.  Open a problem from which to post a knowledge article.

2.  Click the **Post Knowledge** related link.

    The resulting knowledge article contains the following information.

    -   The problem number and **Short description** become the knowledge article **Short description**.
    -   The problem **Description** and **Workaround** become the knowledge article **Text**.
    -   The problem **Configuration item** becomes the knowledge article **Configuration Item**.
    -   The article **Topic** is set to **Known Error**.
    By default, the system creates a knowledge article in **Draft** workflow state. If the knowledge submission workflow is enabled, the problem **Short description** and **Work notes** are placed into a knowledge submission instead of an article. For more information, see [Knowledge workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_KnowledgeWorkflows.md).
