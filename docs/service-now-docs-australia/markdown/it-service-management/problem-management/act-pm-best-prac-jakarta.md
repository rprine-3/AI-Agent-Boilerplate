# Activate Problem Management Best Practice — Jakarta

The Problem Management Best Practice - Jakarta plugin introduces lookups \(impact, urgency and priority\) for Problem Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Important:** Do not activate this plugin if you have upgraded from a pre-Jakarta release.

If you have modified the base functionality required for the [Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — State Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/act-pm-best-prac-madrid-state-mod.md) plugin \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\), use the [Migration Utility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/migration-utility.md) to repair the plugin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
