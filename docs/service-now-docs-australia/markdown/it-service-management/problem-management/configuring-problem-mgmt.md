# Configuring Problem Management

Create or redesign problem form layouts to align them with the business process workflow of your organization. Categorize problems for monitoring and reporting. Use data lookup and assignment rules to automatically assign a task to a user or group based on predefined conditions.

**Note:**

-   Use data lookup and assignment rules to automatically assign a task to a user or group based on predefined conditions. For more information, see [Data lookup for prioritizing problems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/prioritise-problems.md).
-   Configure the Problem Management properties to control features such as creating a problem task on a closed problem and reanalyzing a closed or canceled problem. For more information, see [Problem management properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/problem-mgmt-properties.md).
-   Use quick start tests to check if the Problem Management application still works after you make any configuration change such as applying an upgrade or developing an application. For more information, see [Quick start tests for Problem Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/quick-start-tests-pm.md).


## Redirection of UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace

If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the Problem Management module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

**Note:** For new instances, this redirection configuration is automatically available in the base system. For upgrade instances, administrators can configure the redirection behavior from the SOW Admin Center.
