# Legacy: Open Problem Age Monitor dashboard

Use this dashboard to track the progress of open problems across different age buckets. You can break down the problems by priority or assignment group.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Problem age dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Problem dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem.md) to view, and track the open problems.
