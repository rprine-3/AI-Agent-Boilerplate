# Communicate a fix

After you have completed root cause analysis of a problem and have come up with a resolution or fix for that problem, submit change requests to get the problem fixed. Documenting and communicating fix helps user to know the solution to a problem.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, problem\_admin, problem\_manager or problem\_coordinator

## About this task

When you communicate a fix, notification is sent to related incidents that a fix is available. The Incident process is designed to use the fix information or to notify the user of the same. For more information on notification, refer [Synchronization between incident and problem records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/sync-btwn-inci-prob.md).

**Note:** The topic applies to Problems where you have activated the Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid\) plugin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Problem** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Open the Problem record.

3.  Enter the information in the **Resolution Information** &gt; **Fix notes** field.

4.  Save the record.

5.  Under Related Links, click **Communicate Fix**.

    The fix information is copied from the **Fix notes** field on the Problem form to the **Additional Comments** field on the Incident form. An email notification is sent to the caller and the user who is assigned to the Incident.
