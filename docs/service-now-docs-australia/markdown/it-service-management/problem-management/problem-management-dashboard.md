# Legacy: Problem Management dashboard

Use this dashboard to gain a high-level view across the problem management process, from opening to closing.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Problem management dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Problem dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem.md) to view, and track the open problems.

-   **% of new critical problems**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of new problems &gt; Priority = 1 - Critical\]\] / \[\[Number of new problems\]\] \) \* 100

-   **Average close time of problems**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed duration of closed problems\]\] / \[\[Number of closed problems\]\] / 24
