# Use the knowledge check box

As with incidents, problems often generate information that may be needed in the future. The system can automatically submit a knowledge article when a problem is closed.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil

## About this task

**Note:** If you have Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — Knowledge Integration plugin \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.knowledge\) activated, see [Create a known error article](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/create-known-error-from-problem.md). The topic applies to legacy Problem \(London or a prior release\) only.

You can select the **Knowledge** check box and automatically submit a knowledge article when a problem is closed.

## Procedure

1.  Select the **Knowledge** check box on the Problem form.

2.  Resolve and close the problem.

    Closing the problem triggers the business rule **Problem Create Knowledge**. By default, the business rule creates a knowledge article in the **Draft** workflow state, ready for a knowledge team member to review and publish. The problem **Short description** becomes the article **Short description**, and the problem **Work notes** become the article **Text**.

    If the knowledge submission workflow is enabled, the problem **Work notes** become a knowledge submission instead of an article. For more information, see [Knowledge workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_KnowledgeWorkflows.md).
