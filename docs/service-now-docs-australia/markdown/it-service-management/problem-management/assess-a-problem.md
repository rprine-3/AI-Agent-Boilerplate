# Assess a problem

Assess a problem to determine whether the problem requires a thorough investigation.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin, problem\_admin, problem\_manager, or problem\_coordinator
-   Activate the Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — State Model \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\) to get the new best practice states and guided actions to navigate the lifecycle of a problem. For details, see [Activate Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — State Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/act-pm-best-prac-madrid-state-mod.md).

## About this task

Assessing a problem involves analyzing the scale and extent of the problem, as well as its cause and effect.

## Procedure

1.  Click **Assess** and fill the mandatory fields.

**If the problem is valid and requires a resolution**

</td><td>

Click **Confirm**.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d118200e114">

**If there is an existing problem with similar issue**

</td><td>

Click **Mark Duplicate**.**Note:**

-   When you mark a problem as duplicate, the related records from the duplicate problem are moved to the existing problem.
-   The **List of related task records \(comma-separated\) to move over when a problem is marked as a duplicate of another** \(**problem.duplicate.records\_to\_move**\) problem management property controls the related records that are copied from the existing to the original problem.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d118200e142">

</td><td>

Click **Cancel**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>
## What to do next

After you confirm that the problem needs investigation and a resolution, the problem enters the **Root Cause Analysis** state.
