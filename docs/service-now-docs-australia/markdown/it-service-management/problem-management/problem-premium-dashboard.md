# Legacy: Problem Premium dashboard

This dashboard uses advanced features such as interactive filters and workbench widgets to provide a broad view of problem reports, both current and over time.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Problem premium dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [Problem dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem.md) to view, and track the open problems.

## Indicators

-   **Number of open problems**

    Problems on the Problem \[problem\] table created on or before today and with no Closed date. This indicator is used in several other indicators on the dashboard.

-   **Number of closed problems**

    Problems on the Problem \[problem\] table closed today. This indicator is used in several other indicators on the dashboard.

-   **Average age of open problems**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed age of open problems\]\] / \[\[Number of open problems\]\] / 24

-   **Average re-assignment of open problems**

    The average number of times an open problem gets reassigned. The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed re-assignment of open problems\]\] / \[\[Number of open problems\]\].

-   **Average age of updated since of open problems**

    The average time in days since the last update of an open problem. The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed age of updated since of open problems\]\] / \[\[Number of open problems\]\] / 24.

-   **% of new critical problems**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of new problems &gt; Priority = 1 - Critical\]\] / \[\[Number of new problems\]\] \) \* 100

-   **Average close time of problems**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \[\[Summed duration of closed problems\]\] / \[\[Number of closed problems\]\] / 24

-   **% of problems reassigned at least once**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of reassigned open problems\]\] / \[\[Number of open problems\]\] \* 100 \).

-   **% of problems closed on first assignment**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of problems closed on first assignment\]\] / \[\[Number of closed problems\]\] \* 100 \).

-   **Average reassignment count of closed problems**

    The average value of the Reassignment Count field on closed problems, where Reassignment Count is not empty.

-   **% of open problems classified as known error**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of open problems classified as known error\]\] / \[\[Number of open problems\]\] \) \* 100.

-   **% of closed problems without any close notes**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of closed problems without close notes\]\] / \[\[Number of closed problems\]\] \) \* 100.

-   **% of open problems with at least one incident**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula \( \[\[Number of open problems with at least one incident\]\] / \[\[Number of open problems\]\] \) \* 100.


The following indicators are not shown directly on the dashboard but are used in calculating formulas:

-   Summed age of open problems
-   Summed age of updated since of open problems
-   Summed duration of closed problems
-   Summed re-assignment of open problems
-   Number of reassigned open problems
-   Number of problems closed on first assignment
-   Number of open problems classified as known error
-   Number of closed problems without close notes
-   Number of open problems with at least one incident
