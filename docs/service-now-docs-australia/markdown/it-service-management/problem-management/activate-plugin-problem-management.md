# Activate Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — State Model

You can activate the Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — State Model plugin \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\) on your instance using the Problem Management Migration Utility store app.

## Before you begin

Before you activate the plugin, be sure to resolve blocking modifications. For more information, see [Resolve blocking modifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/resolve-blocking-modifications.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

An administrator must activate the Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — State Model plugin \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\) \(first introduced in the Madrid release\) through the Migration Utility because the plugin includes features that are not compatible with the previous version of Problem Management.

New York Patch 9 or Orlando Patch 3 or later are required before the administrator can see and activate the problem state model plugin on an instance. If you do not have the required patch, you have to request the plugin as it is a development plugin.

## Procedure

1.  Activate the plugin.

    If you have the required patch level, you have access to the plugin and can activate it. If you do not have the patch level, you must request it.
