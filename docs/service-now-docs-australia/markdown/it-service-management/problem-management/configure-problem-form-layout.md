# Configure the problem form layout

Configure the problem form so the information it collects is relevant to your organization's processes. You can easily modify the form to show only the fields, related lists, and other elements that you need.

## Before you begin

Role required: personalize\_form

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Problem** &gt; **Create New**.

2.  In the problem form context menu, select **Configure** &gt; **Form Layout**.

3.  Follow the steps in [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md) to perform any of the following layout modifications.

    Some of these modifications are illustrated in the example.

    -   Show or hide fields on a form.
    -   Add a related list to a form.

        The **Incidents** and **Problem Tasks** related lists appear by default. Review the available related lists and select appropriate lists. For example, if you enable auditing for the Problem table, add the **Audit History** related list.

    -   Add an annotation to a form.
    -   Create a form section.
    -   Embed a list within a form.

        This activity allows the embedded list to be used like any other element on the form. In addition, technicians can create records in the list view. Changes made to the contents of the embedded list are saved when the form is saved.

    **Note:** There are other activities described in the form layout topic, but the items listed here are commonly configured during initial setup.
