# Problem Management considerations

Consider these points while implementing the CSDM framework.

-   Service instance: A service instance is a service type that is a logical representation of a deployed application stack.
-   Using service instance for a problem: Some of the scenarios where the service instance can be used for a problem include:
    -   The problem is for an application issue: In this scenario the service instance may be populated in the configuration\_item attribute on the Problem form representing the unique deployment of an application stack. For example, the service instance of MyApp 3.0 Prod has been reported as being unavailable.
    -   The problem on an infrastructure CI is impacting devices. In this scenario the service instance might be populated on the problem’s Impacted Services related list, task\_cmdb\_ci\_service, to identify the service instance as one of the impacted services. For example, the Server Acme42 may be impacting **My service instance of MyApp 3.0 Prod** and other related services.
