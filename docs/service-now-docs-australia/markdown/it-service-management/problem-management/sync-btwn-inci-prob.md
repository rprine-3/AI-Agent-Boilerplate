# Synchronization between incident and problem records

Change in a Problem record impacts related Incident records. Notification is sent to the user for each such update.

When you activate the Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid\) and the Problem Management Best Practice — Madrid — State Model \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\) plugin, the changes in a Problem record impact incidents that are associated to that Problem.
