# Check device health using Desktop Assistant

Monitor and resolve common device performance issues independently by using Device health check through Desktop Assistant.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dex\_desktop.user

**Note:**

The Device health check widget on Desktop Assistant is visible only if you have the latest version of Desktop Assistant installed. Contact your system administrator to install the latest version.

## Procedure

1.  Open Desktop Assistant.

    For information, see [Open and log in to Desktop Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/open-desktop-exp.md).

2.  On the  **Desktop Assistant** home page, select **Device health check **.

3.  On the Device health check page, select the device from the drop-down list.

4.  In the **Diagnose** tab, review the performance category and required actions for the device, applications, and network.

5.  Select a Poor or Average performance category to view the issues and suggested resolutions.

    The resolutions can be remedial action buttons, self-help instructions, or links to resources that provide resolutions. For more information, see [Resolution for Proactive Engagement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/proactive-engagement/resolutions.md).

6.  Implement the suggested resolutions to improve device, application, or network performance.

    **Note:** If a remedial action was triggered in the last 24 hours from either the **Diagnose** or **Device actions** tab, the remedial action button is inactive. It is reactivated 24 hours after the last action was triggered.

7.  Submit feedback about whether the suggested resolution helped resolve an issue.

    -   **Yes**: Select **Yes** if the resolution resolves your issue.
    -   **No**: Select **No** if the resolution doesn’t resolve your issue.

        If you select **No**, you see the option to open an IT ticket, based on the configuration.

8.  Select the **Open an IT ticket** link if you require assistance in resolving an issue.

    An incident record is created and the incident number is displayed. You can select the incident number link to access the record details and status.

9.  Trigger device actions independent of device performance or associated issues.

    1.  On the Device health check page, select the **Device actions** tab.

    2.  To trigger remedial actions for the device, select **Start now**.

    3.  To trigger remedial actions for applications, select **Select item**, select the application from the drop-down list, and then select **Confirm**.

        A status message shows the progress of the action. You can trigger an action for another application while it is still in progress for one application.

        |Status of action|Displayed status|
        |----------------|----------------|
        |Remedial action is successful.|**Completed**|
        |Remedial action hasn’t yet started.|**No action history**|
