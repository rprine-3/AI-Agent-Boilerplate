# Exploring Digital End-user Experience Self-service

Digital End-user Experience Self-service \(DEX Self-service\) enables you to monitor device health performance, view detected issues, and use suggestion resolutions to resolve issues.

## Digital End-user Experience Self-service overview

With DEX Self-service, you can monitor device health on demand. When issues are detected, you can address them by using the suggested resolutions. These resolutions can be remedial actions, self-help instructions, or links to help resources. Additionally, you can initiate device actions even when no issues are detected to maintain optimal performance of your devices and applications.

By default, DEX Self-service is inactive in the base system. To activate it, you must enable the base system issue configurations. For more information, see [Enable issue configurations for DEX Self-service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/enable-dex-self-service-issues.md).

You can access Device health check from the following sources:

|Source|Feature|
|------|-------|
|Employee Center|[Check device health using Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/check-your-device-s-using-employee-center.md)|
|Desktop Assistant|[Check device health using Desktop Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/check-your-device-s-health-using-desktop-assistant.md)|
|ServiceNow Otto for ITSM Virtual Agent|[Check device health using ServiceNow Otto for ITSM Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/check-your-device-s-health-using-now-assist-for-itsm.md)|

When you install DEX Self-service, several base system components are automatically installed. For more information, see [Components installed with DEX Self-service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/components-installed-with-dex-self-service.md).

## DEX Self-service workflow for employees

1.  Access Device health check from any of the following sources:
    -   Employee Center. See [Check device health using Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/check-your-device-s-using-employee-center.md).
    -   Desktop Assistant. See [Check device health using Desktop Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/check-your-device-s-health-using-desktop-assistant.md).
    -   ServiceNow Otto for ITSM Virtual Agent. See [Check device health using ServiceNow Otto for ITSM Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/check-your-device-s-health-using-now-assist-for-itsm.md).
2.  \(Optional\) If there are multiple devices, select a device to check its health.
3.  View the health of the device by performance category \(Good, Average, or Poor\). For more information about how device health is calculated, see [Device heath check calculation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/Device-health-check-calculation.md).
4.  \(Optional\) Trigger device actions for optimal device performance, even when no issues are detected.

    **Note:** You can access the Device actions tab from the Employee Center or Desktop Assistant.

5.  Resolve device health issues by using issue-specific suggested resolutions. A resolution can be any of the following:
    -   Remedial action
    -   Self-help instruction
    -   Link to help resources
6.  Proceed with one of the following actions based on the resolution status:
    -   If the resolution is successful, select **Yes** or **No** to the feedback question to confirm if the resolution helped address the issue. If you select **No**, a fallback action is provided.
    -   If the resolution fails and there’s no improvement in device performance or if you mark an issue as unresolved, a fallback action is provided.

        **Note:** DEX administrators can configure fallback options as part of the issue configurations.

## Operating system support

DEX Self-service supports Windows and macOS devices. Issue configurations for device health checks and device actions are scoped to Windows, macOS, or both, and only matching configurations are available on that device.

The two operating systems differ in how the Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) agent runs device health checks and device actions.

-   Windows: The ACC agent runs device health check and device actions under the ACC agent service account. For setup details, see [Install ACC for DEX on Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/install-acc-for-dex-windows.md).
-   macOS: The ACC agent runs device health checks and device actions under a specific local service account named `_servicenow`. Using an incorrect account name during setup causes device health check and actions to appear to run but not complete successfully. For setup details, see [Install ACC for DEX on macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/install-acc-for-dex-macos.md) and [Configure ServiceNow sudoers file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/config-sudoers-file.md).
