# Customize DEX Self-service issue configurations

Customize device health categories, metric evaluation criteria, and resolutions for issues, to make sure that appropriate resolutions display in DEX Self-service and enable end users to self-solve issues.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dex.admin

## About this task

Device health issues and metric details displayed in DEX Self-service are based on evaluation criteria configured in issue configuration records. If metrics in the evaluation criteria of an issue resolution are defined as **Poor**, the corresponding device health subcategory is also marked as **Poor**. DEX Self-service displays resolutions for subcategories as configured in issue configuration records.

For information about how device health is calculated, see [Device heath check calculation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/Device-health-check-calculation.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Digital Experience Self-Service** &gt; **Issue Configurations**.

2.  Open the issue configuration record that you want to modify.

3.  Update the fields on the form.

    **Note:** For more information on DEX Self-service issue configuration form field descriptions, see [DEX Self-service issue configuration form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/dex-self-service-issue-config-form.md).
