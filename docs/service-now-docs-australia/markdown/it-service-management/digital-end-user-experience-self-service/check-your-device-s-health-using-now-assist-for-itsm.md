# Check device health using ServiceNow Otto for ITSM Virtual Agent

Use the ServiceNow Otto for ITSM Virtual Agent to monitor device performance, diagnose potential issues, and use suggested resolutions to address them.

## Before you begin

-   Install the Digital End-User Experience \(sn\_dex\) application. For more information, see [Install Digital End-User Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/install-app-device-health.md).
-   Configure ServiceNow Otto for ITSM to access the Check Device health topic in the Virtual Agent chat box.
-   Install the Desktop Assistant \[sn\_dex\_desktop\] plugin if you're launching Virtual Agent from Desktop Assistant. For more information, see [Download and install Desktop Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/download-desktop-experience.md).

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Select the Virtual Agent or chat icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-virtual-agent.png"\] Alt text: Virtual agent or chat icon\) that appears on any portal or on the Desktop Assistant header.

2.  Perform any of the following actions to begin a conversation:

    -   In the chat window, enter a phrase related to Device health check and press Enter.

        For example, `Check my device health`.

        **Note:** If you enter a phrase related to a category or subcategory, the Virtual Agent directly provides the corresponding resolution. For example, entering a phrase like `How is my device battery health` prompts the Virtual Agent to provide the battery health status and resolutions to improve it.

    -   Select the **Show my options** button, and then select the **Check Device Health** topic.
    The Virtual Agent displays a list of devices to check the device health if there are multiple devices. After you select a device, or if only one device is available, its status is displayed.

    The Virtual Agent also suggests a list of resolutions to improve the device performance.

3.  If you have more than one device, select a device to check its health.

4.  Select a resolution to improve device performance.
