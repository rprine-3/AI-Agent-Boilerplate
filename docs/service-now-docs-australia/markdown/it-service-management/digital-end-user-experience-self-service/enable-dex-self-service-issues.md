# Enable issue configurations for DEX Self-service

Enable issue resolutions for DEX Self-service to enable end users to self-solve device, application, and connectivity issues.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dex.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Digital Experience Self-Service** &gt; **Issue Configurations**.

    The base system issue configurations are displayed.

    The default value for the **Enabled in EC self-service** and **Enabled in DEX Now Assist topic** columns is **false**.

2.  Open an issue configuration record.

3.  Select the **Enabled in EC self-service** check box to enable the issue in Employee Center portal and Desktop Assistant.

4.  Select the **Enabled in DEX Now Assist topic** check box to enable the issue in ServiceNow Otto for ITSM.

    The ITSM Virtual Agent enables you to check your device's health using prebuilt LLM topic conversation. For more information, see [ITSM Virtual Agent pre-built LLM topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-for-it-service-management-itsm/itsm-va-prebuilt-topics.md).

5.  Verify that the issue code in the **Resolution** field is active.

    1.  Select the reference icon near the **Resolution** field.

    2.  On the Issue Registry preview pop-up, confirm that the **Active** check box is selected.

    3.  If the **Active** check box isn’t selected, activate the issue resolution.

        For information about how to activate an issue resolution, see [Activate Proactive Engagement resolutions for DEX Self-service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-self-service/activate-proactive-engage-resolutions.md).

6.  Select **Update**.
