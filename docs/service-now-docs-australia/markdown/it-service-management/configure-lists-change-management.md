# Configure lists for Simplified Change Management

Configure which columns appear in the change lists for your IT fulfiller staff.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_chg\_setup.lists\_config and sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user

**Note:** The sn\_chg\_setup.lists\_config role no longer automatically inherits the sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user role. Users who need to configure the console must now be assigned both the appropriate Change Management role \(for example, sn\_chg\_setup.lists\_config\) and the sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user role explicitly. Existing roles aren't modified during upgrade, allowing you to maintain full control over assignment of elevated privileges. After upgrading, if you have previously relied on inherited access, you won't be able to configure the console until the sn\_ia\_config.ia\_user role is assigned explicitly.

## About this task

The Lists module in Simplified Change Management allows you to customize the columns and layout of change request lists within the admin experience. This configuration affects how change requests are displayed in both the main list view and related list views on change request records.

## Procedure

1.  From the header of your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Admin Home**.

2.  From the **Manage your products** section, select **View product overview** for IT Service Management.

3.  On the Product Hub page for IT Service Management, from the Configure your product section, select **Configure**.

4.  On the Configuration Console, from the left navigation panel, select **ITSM fulfiller experience &gt; Change Management &gt; Lists**. \[Omitted image "simplified-change-lists.png"\] Alt text: Change lists configuration page

    The Lists configuration page is displayed.

5.  Select the list type to configure as **Default Lists** or **Related Lists** in the **List type to configure** field.

6.  View the available and selected columns.

    -   The left panel shows **Available columns** \(columns not currently displayed in the list\).
    -   The right panel shows **Selected columns** \(columns currently displayed in the list\).
7.  Configure columns for the list view.

    -   To add a column: Select a column name from the **Available columns** list to the Selected columns list.
    -   To remove a column: Select the X icon next to a column name in the **Selected columns** list.
8.  Select **Save** to save your changes.

    To revert unsaved changes, select **Undo**.

9.  When you have finished configuring, select **Mark as configured** to save your settings and mark this step as complete.

    To revert changes made in the current session before saving, select **Undo**.

    As an alternative to the form-based wizard, you can also complete this configuration through the **Configure with AI** conversational flow, accessible from the banner at the top of the page.


## Result

You have reviewed and configured the change lists experience used by your IT fulfiller staff.
