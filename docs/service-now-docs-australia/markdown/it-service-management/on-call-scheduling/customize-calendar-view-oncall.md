## About this task

-   For information on updating a shift, see [Update shift details from the On-Call calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/update-shift-from-calendar-oncall.md).
-   For information on managing a shift, see [Configure or update an On-Call shift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/config-update-shift-oncall.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **On-Call Scheduling** &gt; **On-Call Calendars**.

2.  Click the Calendar View icon \(\[Omitted image "view-calendar-calendar-icon.png"\] Alt text: Calendar View icon\) to open the calendar view of shifts.

    By default, the calendar displays one month of shifts.

    **Important:** The Time Zone view displays shift members grouped by shift within the specified geographical time zone. To open the Time Zone view on this page, click the Time Zone icon \(\[Omitted image "view-calendar-timeline-icon.png"\] Alt text: Time Zone icon\). See [Manage shifts from the Timeline view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/customize-timeline-view-oncall.md).

3.  Perform any of the following operations to organize the view for your needs:

    -   Specify the time period that appears: View events for the current day, week, or month: In the title bar, click **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**.

        **Note:** You cannot view the calendar for a month in the Timeline view.

    -   Navigate to the previous or the next occurrence of the time period: In the title bar, click the left or the right arrow next to **Today** \(\[Omitted image "view-calendar-today.png"\] Alt text: Next and previous date icon\).
    -   View the event of any specific day, week, or month: In the title bar, click the Calendar icon \(\[Omitted image "view-calendar-icon.png"\] Alt text: Calendar icon\) and specify the date.
    -   View the list of navigation shortcuts: In the title bar, click the keyboard shortcuts icon \[Omitted image "view-calendar-keyboard-icon.png"\] Alt text: keyboard icon.
4.  Configure the view: Click the Filter icon \(\[Omitted image "filters-icon.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon\).

    -   To show working hours for a time zone, enable **Time zone**.
    -   To view roster assignments within a time zone, click the **Primary**, **Secondary**, or **Tertiary** check box as needed.
    -   To view roster assignments for all rosters in all time zones, select the **Show all rosters** check box.

        \[Omitted image "show-all-rosters-filter.png"\] Alt text: Show all rosters filter

    -   To show gaps: In the **Review options** section, enable **Show gaps**. An info icon indicates a shift with gaps. Click the icon to view the gaps. Gaps occur when no one is on-call when support coverage is required. Possible reasons:

        -   Time off without coverage.
        -   User has been moved out of the group.
        -   User is marked as inactive.
        For information on resolving gaps and conflicts, see [Resolve gaps, conflicts, and time-off requests in a shift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/resolv-gap-conflct-timeoff-oncall.md).

    -   &gt;To show conflicts: In the **Review options** &gt; **Show conflicts**.

        For example, a conflict occurs when a user is assigned as both primary and secondary point of contact for a shift. An info icon indicates a shift with conflicts. Click the icon to view the conflicts.

        For information on resolving gaps and conflicts, see [Resolve gaps, conflicts, and time-off requests in a shift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/resolv-gap-conflct-timeoff-oncall.md).

5.  To save the view settings, click the Bookmark this filter icon \(\[Omitted image "view-favourite-icon.png"\] Alt text: Bookmark this filter icon\).
