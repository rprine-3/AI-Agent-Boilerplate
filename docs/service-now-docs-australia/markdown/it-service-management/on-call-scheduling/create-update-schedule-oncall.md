# Configure or update an On-Call schedule

Create an On-Call schedule or edit an existing schedule by defining shifts and rosters.

## Before you begin

Role required: rota\_admin, rota\_manager

## About this task

You can use the wizard to create an on-call schedule using an existing template or you can create shifts from scratch. You can create multiple shifts at given time and can preview shifts while creating them. This enables you to create rosters, define escalation policies, and review and publish shifts.

After running the wizard, you can adjust individual roster, escalation, and reminder settings to fine-tune the setup. You can also enable on-call notifications by setting up rotation workflow triggers.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **On-Call Scheduling** &gt; **Create/Edit Schedule**.

2.  In the **Define Schedule**, from the **Select Group** choice list, select the group for which you are defining the schedule.

    You can edit an existing shift for a selected group. If you want to create a new schedule, click **Add shift** button.

    **Note:** When creating a new on-call group schedule, you are redirected to oc\_creation\_wizard page instead of expert\_shell page which is no longer supported.

3.  Choose an existing template for the shifts or create a new shift.

4.  Select the **Allow Shift Schedule overlap** check box to allow overlapping schedules for shifts within the group.

    For example, if a group has a 24x7 schedule, you can create multiple schedules for the group. Shift overlap is required to have a hand-off period between shifts so that multiple shifts can be on-call for the same duration.

    If you select **Allow Shift Schedule overlap**, then the **Escalation rule on Shift overlap** check box appears.

5.  Select the **Escalation rule on Shift overlap** check box to specify which shift needs to be notified of an escalation during a shift overlap.

    You can escalate to an incoming, an outgoing, or to all shifts.

6.  Fill in the form fields.

Make any exceptions as a one-time change in the roster for the shift.
