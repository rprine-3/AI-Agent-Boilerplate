# Set up Microsoft Teams as a contact method for an on-call escalation

Enable users to receive Microsoft Teams notifications for an on-call escalation.

## Before you begin

User should have Microsoft Teams user credentials.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that your ServiceNow instance is configured for Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams and the IT Service Management integration with Microsoft 365 plugin \(sn\_now\_teams\_it\) is active.

    For information on Virtual Agent permission policies, see [Manage Now Virtual Agent permission policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/disable-now-virtual-agent-ms-teams.md).

2.  Select **Microsoft Teams** as your preferred notification channel while defining the escalation settings for a user group.

    For information on escalation settings, see [Escalation and reminder settings for rosters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/escalation-remind-settings-oncall.md).

3.  For the required user group, create a trigger rule that uses the On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement trigger workflow.

    If a user or shift manager sets the preferred contact channel as Microsoft Teams, a notification is sent to the user in Microsoft Teams along with the actions that a user can perform.

    For information on creating a trigger rule, see [Create an escalation trigger rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/create-trigger-rule-oncall.md).
