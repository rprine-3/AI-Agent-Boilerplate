# Set up mobile push as a contact method for an on-call escalation

Enable users to receive mobile push notifications for on-call escalations.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Install ServiceNow Agent and enable mobile push notifications from the **Notifications** tab.

    For information on this tab, see [Base system functionality for ServiceNow mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/base-system-functionality.md).

    The mobile push appears as a communication channel in the ServiceNow instance.

2.  Select **Mobile push** as your preferred notification channel while defining the escalation settings for a user group.

    For information on escalation settings, see [Escalation and reminder settings for rosters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/escalation-remind-settings-oncall.md).

3.  For the required user group, create a trigger rule that uses the On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement trigger workflow.

    If a user or shift manager sets the preferred contact channel as mobile push, a mobile push notification is sent to the user along with the actions that a user can perform.

    For information on creating a trigger rule, see [Create an escalation trigger rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/create-trigger-rule-oncall.md).
