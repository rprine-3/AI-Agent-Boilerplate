# Exploring On-Call Scheduling

The On-Call Scheduling application helps you ensure that dedicated support team members are available to resolve issues as they arise. Learn more about On-Call Scheduling and the benefits it can provide for the different user roles in your organization.

## On-Call Scheduling overview

On-Call Scheduling provides a way to determine which member of a user group is available to work on a task.

On-Call Scheduling finds the right person to assign an incident to, by rotation through a hierarchy of duty rosters. The automated process relieves the administrative burden on resource managers and makes it easy for the incident managers to bring the right resources to the table when needed.

On-Call Scheduling can be used by process owners and support managers who want to collaborate more effectively. On-Call Scheduling simplifies the manual shift maintenance and administration efforts while improving the mean time to resolve \(MTTR\) efficiencies.

## On-Call Scheduling workflow

The various members of an organisation use On-Call Scheduling to work together. See a sample end-to-end workflow:\[Omitted image "Oncall\_workflow.png"\] Alt text: Infographic for on-call scheduling workflow. For the text description, refer to the workflow steps that follow.

</table>## Redirection of UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace

If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the On-Call Scheduling module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

**Note:** For new instances, this redirection configuration is automatically available in the base system. For upgrade instances, administrators can configure the redirection behavior from the SOW Admin Center.
