# Create an escalation policy

An escalation policy includes the policy type that defines the order in which rosters and roster members receive escalation notifications. You can create a custom escalation policy for a shift by overriding settings in a default escalation type, for example, by configuring custom delays between escalation steps.

## Before you begin

Role required: rota\_admin, rota\_manager, or admin

## About this task

Users with rota\_manager role can edit policies only for their groups. Users with rota\_admin and admin role can edit policies for all the groups.

The escalation type determines the order in which members of a user group are notified about the escalation. The escalation type depends on the number of rosters.

-   If a shift has only one roster, the escalation type is automatically set to **Rotate through members** and the escalation path goes through the member list of a roster \(primary, secondary, tertiary\) to determine whom to notify.
-   If the shift has multiple rosters, the escalation type is automatically set to **Rotate through rosters** and the escalation path goes through all rosters to determine whom to notify.
-   If the shift has a customized escalation hierarchy, the escalation type is set to **Custom** and the escalation path goes through members as defined in the escalation hierarchy. See [Create an escalation policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/create-custom-esc-policy-oncall.md) for details.

On-Call Scheduling supports multiple escalation policies per shift; for example, policies based on the priority of the incident or type of task record.
