# Legacy: Viewing Group Overview reports

Run My Groups Overview reports to view the activities of a selected group: Count information on acknowledged and unacknowledged escalations by shift, acknowledged escalations by user, and the hours for each user over seven days.

**Important:** Starting in Xanadu release, the On-Call dashboard is deprecated. Users can use [On-call dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/oncall-scheduling.md) to view, maintain, and track the escalation reports.

## Opening the reports

Any user with the itil role can view the reports. Use one of the following methods to open the reports:

-   Click **Self-Service** &gt; **Dashboards** and select **On-Call Overview**. If you have licensed the premium version, then click **On-Call Overview - Premium**.
-   Click **On-Call Scheduling** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Overview**.

Click the **My Groups Overview** tab and then specify the group in the **My On-Call Groups** list.

-   Acknowledged escalations are accepted by at least one user. The "true" value indicates acknowledged escalations.
-   Unacknowledged escalations are not accepted by any user or are rejected by all users. The "false" value indicates unacknowledged escalations.
