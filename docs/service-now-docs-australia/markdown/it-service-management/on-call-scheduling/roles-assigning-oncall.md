A user with the rota\_admin role can create, read, update, and delete shifts. The rota\_admin can create shifts using the [Create new schedule wizard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/create-update-schedule-oncall.md), modify shifts and rosters, and maintain coverage and time off on the [Manage shifts from the Calendar view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/customize-calendar-view-oncall.md).

 The rota\_admin role contains the platform assignment\_rule\_admin role.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Shift manager \[rota\_manager\]

</td><td>

The Shift manager role is for the manager of a group. The purpose of the role is to distinguish a member that has been delegated the role of managing shifts of a group. The role cannot be used to manage all groups on the instance.

 The role can be delegated to the members of a group. See [Delegating roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DelegateRoles.md) .

 A user with the Shift manager role that meets any of the following requirements can manage shifts for their group:

 -   The user is the manager of the group.
-   The user was delegated the rota\_manager role. For information on delegating the shift manager role, see [Delegate the shift manager \[rota\_admin\] role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/delegate-shift-mgr-role-oncall.md). For information on role delegation, see [Delegate roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DelegateRoles.md) .

**Note:** When a user is delegated a role on behalf of a group, the user can manage the shifts only for that group.

-   The user is configured as a shift manager for a group. For information on configuring group preferences, see [Configure preferences for a user group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/on-call-scheduling/config-group-prefs-oncall.md).
