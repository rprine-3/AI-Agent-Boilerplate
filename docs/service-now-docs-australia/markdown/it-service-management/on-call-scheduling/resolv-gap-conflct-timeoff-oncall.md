# Resolve gaps, conflicts, and time-off requests in a shift

## About this task

Possible reasons for gaps are:

-   User has been moved out of the group
-   User is marked as inactive

A conflict is possible if a user is assigned as both the primary and secondary point of contact for a shift.

2.  Click a shift card.

    **Note:** If you are a shift manager or roster member, the schedule view opens. In all other cases, you are redirected to the calendar view.
