# Configure a table for escalation trigger rules

Configure escalation trigger rules for the tables that do not extend tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Tables that are configured in the Trigger Rule Table Configuration \[trigger\_rule\_table\_cfg\] table appear in the **Table** field in the Trigger Rule form for creating an escalation trigger rule.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **On-Call Administration** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Trigger Rule Table Configuration**.

    In Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\), you can access On-call trigger rule table configuration by navigating to **All** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace Admin Center** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Configuration**. On the **Configurations** tab, from the **SOW configurations** section, navigate to the **On-call Scheduling** tile and select **Configure** and then select **Table configuration for trigger rules**. For more information, see [Manage configurations in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/manage-admin-console-sow-itsm.md)

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
