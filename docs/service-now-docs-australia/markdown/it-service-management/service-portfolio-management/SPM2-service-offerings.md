# Service offerings in Service Portfolio Management

A service offering derives from a service, refining the parent service to a specific business need and performance level.

## Service offerings and commitments

Offering records define different levels of performance for an existing service. For example, you might offer two levels of desktop support in your organization. You can offer a standard offering for upgrades and virus protection and an executive offering that also includes availability guarantee.

Service offering types include business service offerings and technical service offerings.

**Important:** For the Australia release and later, the labels for the items in the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_technical\] table and \[service\_offering\] table are Technology Management Service and Technology Management Service Offering, respectively. Prior to the Australia release, the labels are Technical Service and Technical Service Offering.

Create a complete set of service offerings defined by commitments that define the specifics of the offering. Each service must have at least one defined offering to move to the Catalog phase. This is because service offerings are where you define Service Level Agreements \(SLAs\) and where metrics are collated.

For detailed information about SLAs, including SLA definitions and results, refer to [Service Level Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-level-management/service-level-mgmt-landing-page.md).

## Service offering pricing

Each service offering may have a pricing model and a price unit. Use this pricing data towards creating catalog items.

## Service offering subscriptions

You can subscribe different entities to a service offering. This data is then used to determine the total subscriber count on the offering form.

## Technical service offerings

Technical service offerings can be shown as inherited relationships to business services and offerings. They are not included in metric models and do not use the weighting model.

## Re-parenting service offering types

You can change a service offering parent from one type of service to another. For example, changing an offering parent from a business service to a technical service or vice versa. Offerings cannot be re-parented to an application service. Some important information and guidelines concerning re-parenting service offering types, include:

-   When you change the offering parent from a business service to a technical service you will receive a message alerting you that performance scoring is not available with technical service offerings.
-   When you re-parent from one service type to another, existing weighting rules will apply.
-   If you try to re-parent and the parent service is in Catalog phase with only one offering, you will receive a message that you cannot make this change.
-   If the metric weight on the parent service is &gt;0, you will receive a message alerting you to adjust the data before re-parenting the offering. You cannot re-parent the offering to a different service type until the weight for the offering on the former service type is set to zero.
