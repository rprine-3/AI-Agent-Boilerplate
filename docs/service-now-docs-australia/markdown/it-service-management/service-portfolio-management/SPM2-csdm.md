# Applying the CSDM guidelines to Service Portfolio Management

Service data relates to each other using different applications in different ways. Service Portfolio Management references the Common Service Data Model \(CSDM\) framework to bring service-related data together in a single view.

Since both ServiceNow® products of Service Portfolio Management and Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) closely align with the CSDM, it's helpful to know the common terms and life-cycle fields when working in these applications.

**Tip:** For CSDM set-up information, see [Implementing the CSDM framework in stages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/csdm-implementation-stages.md).

## CSDM life-cycle fields for business and technical services

After the CSDM activation plugin is installed \[**com.snc.cmdb.csdm.activation**\], you can use the CSDM life-cycle fields in Service Portfolio Management. To see the field names, navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portfolio Management** &gt; **Services**, and set the view to Service Portfolio.

Using the CSDM life-cycle fields helps you manage the end-to-end life cycle of services and service offerings. The shared field names provide you with consistency and alignment as you use other ServiceNow applications. For more information about the CSDM, see [Enabling life-cycle synchronization from legacy to asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/csdm-life-cycle-standard-values.md).

**Important:** For the Australia release and later, the labels for the items in the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_technical\] table and \[service\_offering\] table are Technology Management Service and Technology Management Service Offering, respectively. The label changes align with the CSDM, version 5. Prior to the Australia release, the labels are Technical Service and Technical Service Offering.

The following comparison shows the differences from the traditional Service Portfolio Management phase and status fields to the CSDM life-cycle stage and status fields.

These fields also display when you use the Performance Analytics \(PA\) indicators.
