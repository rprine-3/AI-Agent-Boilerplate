# Assign multiple teams to support a service offering

You can assign multiple teams to support a single service offering when several teams are responsible for that offering.

## Before you begin

Role required: service\_editor

## About this task

The service offering team table \[cmdb\_rel\_team\] enables multiple groups to be related to a single service offering. While in the offering record, use the **Team** tab to assign a support group to the offering. Use the Related Links **Teams** tab to add more support groups to the service offering. You can also edit the group type of the teams that you add in the Related Links **Teams** tab.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portfolio Management** &gt; **Service Offerings**.

2.  Open the service offering that you want to assign support teams.

3.  In the first **Team** tab on the offering record, use the Search icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-search.png"\] Alt text: Search icon\) to select the support group for this service offering, and then **Save** the page.

    After you save the page, the support group that you selected displays in the second **Teams** tab, in the Related Links area. The Related Links **Teams** tab has three columns: **User group** \(the support group name that you selected in the first teams tab\), **Group type**, and **Primary**. You can set the primary entry to true or false, indicating that the user group is the primary support group.

4.  In the Related Links **Teams** tab, add more support groups \(of the same group type\) to the **User group** list.

    1.  Select **Edit**.

    2.  Move one or more groups from the **Collection** to the **Teams List**, and then **Save**.

5.  **Save** the offering record.

6.  The Related Links **Teams** tab contains all the teams that you added.

    You can select any team in the **User group** column to change the team. You can also select any **Group type** to change it to one of the other options: Support Group, Approver Group, Change Group, or Managed By Group.
