# Installed with Service Portfolio Management

Service Portfolio Management Core is active by default for users with ITSM licenses. Service Portfolio Management Foundation is administrator activated and enables you to document portfolios, taxonomies, services, and service offerings using a standardized, structured format.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

## Service Portfolio Management plugins

The following two plugins enable you to use the full functionality of Service Portfolio Management:

-   Service Portfolio Management Core \[com.snc.service\_portfolio\_core\]
-   Service Portfolio Management Foundation \[com.snc.service\_portfolio\]

The Service Portfolio Management Foundation plugin automatically activates the Service Portfolio Management Core plugin. Each plugin independently installs a set of roles and tables.

If you install Service Builder from the ServiceNow Store, its plugin \[com.snc.service\_builder\] automatically installs. Service Builder uses the same role set as Service Portfolio Management. See [Service Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-builder/service-builder.md) for more information.
