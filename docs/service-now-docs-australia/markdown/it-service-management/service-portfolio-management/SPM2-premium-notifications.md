# Service Portfolio Management Premium notifications

Notifications are added with Service Portfolio Management Premium to manage your service offering to catalog item relationships.

Service Portfolio Management Premium includes several email notifications that alert catalog admins when a service offering associated with a catalog item is retired or when a new catalog item has been created from a service offering.

The following notifications are included:

<table id="table_cgw_4sm_2mb"><thead><tr><th>
