# Install the Service Portfolio Management Sample Content Pack

Install the Service Portfolio Management Taxonomy Content Pack plugin \(com.snc.spm.content\) to access a sample portfolio structure and service taxonomy. This sample data accelerates your ability to create and manage a service portfolio.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or portfolio\_admin

Dependency: Service Portfolio Management Foundation application

## About this task

Installing the Service Portfolio Management Taxonomy Content Pack \(com.snc.spm.content\) plugin, enables you to:

-   Access demo data and a sample taxonomy structure metadata.
-   Create portfolios and associated taxonomies.
-   Access sample lists of service data.
-   Link to periphery example data, such as vendors and contracts.

You can view the sample content in the **Service Portfolios** module of the Service Portfolio Management application as **Sample IT Services Portfolio**. Alternatively, you can view data in the DPM Workspace. For more information, see [Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-landing.md).

**Important:** For Step 2 in the procedure, enter `com.snc.spm.content` in the Search field, and check the box to **Load demo data**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
