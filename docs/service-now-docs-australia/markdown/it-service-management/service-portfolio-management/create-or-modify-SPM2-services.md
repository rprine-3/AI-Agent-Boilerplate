# Create a service in Service Portfolio Management

Create services that benefit and add value to your internal organization and external customers and users.

## Before you begin

Role required: portfolio\_admin or service\_editor

## About this task

All occurrences of the table and reference field label **Business Service** throughout the product have changed to **Service**. For example, the Business Service form has changed to Service form. This change is for new instances only and doesn't affect existing upgraded instances.

**Note:** You can also create and edit services and service offerings by using the Service Builder application. Service Builder provides a walk-through experience with contextual help along the way. For more information, see [Service Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-builder/service-builder.md).
