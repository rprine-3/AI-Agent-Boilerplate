# Create a service offering in Service Portfolio Management

Create service offerings to define services, document them, track performance against defined availability commitments, and relay the performance information in real time to your end users.

## Before you begin

Role required: portfolio\_admin

## About this task

Often the data that's defined on a service and on its child offerings are identical. For example, the same person may own a service and its offerings, as defined in the **Owned by** field on the **Service** form. However, flexibility exists for defined data to be different between services and child offerings if the organization desires. For example, one person may own the service while another person owns the child offering.

Link service offerings to catalog items required to provision a service. Each service offering has commitments, which in turn, have service level agreements.

A service offering consists of a set of service commitments, which uniquely define the level of service in terms of availability, scope, and pricing. For example, an organization may offer two levels of Desktop Support in your organization. A Standard offering of upgrades and virus protection. And an Executive offering with the standard commitments plus some type of availability guarantee, such as 98% availability from 8-5 on weekdays.

When an offering is added to a service for the first time, some Offering form field values are inherited from the parent Service record. These form fields are: **Owned by**, **Business criticality**, **Delivery Manager**, and **Delegate**. When an offering is added and the parent Service record has empty field values, these fields are also empty on the Offering record. When you first insert an offering into a service, the parent Service record field values overwrite any existing values in the Offering record. You can update the fields after you’ve added the offering, if necessary.

You can also auto-create service offerings when creating a service portfolio. For more information, see [Create portfolios in Service Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-portfolio-management/create-or-modify-SPM2-portfolios.md).
