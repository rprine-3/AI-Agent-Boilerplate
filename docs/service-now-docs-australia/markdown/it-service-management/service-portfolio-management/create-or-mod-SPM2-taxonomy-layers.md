# Create taxonomy layer definitions

Create an unlimited number of taxonomy layers to organize, label, and manage your service portfolio. Taxonomy layers represent the highest containment levels of your service portfolio. Each level supports branches, or nodes, that contain child nodes or services in a hierarchical top-to-bottom structure.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This task applies if you are using the legacy portfolio structure. For information on the legacy and standard portfolio structures, see [Service Portfolio Management taxonomy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-portfolio-management/SPM2-taxonomy.md).

Role required: portfolio\_admin

## About this task

Opening the **Taxonomy Layer Definitions** module displays a list of all existing layers defined for all service portfolios.

By default, the service portfolio name associated with the taxonomy layer is listed in the first **Service portfolio** column of the list. The service portfolio is the parent element to the taxonomy layer. Existing taxonomy layers appear in the **Name** column, and are chronologically sorted in the **Order** column. Your layer with order number 100 is always at the top, followed by order number 200, and so on.

Always associated taxonomy layers with a parent service portfolio. Example layers for an IT services portfolio might include the following taxonomy layers:

-   Service Class
-   Service Group

If the Service Portfolio Management Taxonomy Content Pack \[com.snc.spm.content\] plugin sample data is activated on your instance, review the provided taxonomy data to gain an understanding of how to best define your taxonomy layers. Refer to [Activate Service Portfolio Management Sample Content Pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-portfolio-management/activate-SPM2-content-pack-plugin.md) for more details.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Service Portfolio Management****Taxonomy Layer Definitions**.

2.  Select **New**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Value that represents the hierarchical level where the taxonomy layer will exist. 1 is the highest level, with each chronological number following at a lower level.

**Note:** Layer ordering is locked and cannot be changed when a node is created for any layer in a service portfolio. Nodes cannot be added to layers if there is a gap in the layer order.
