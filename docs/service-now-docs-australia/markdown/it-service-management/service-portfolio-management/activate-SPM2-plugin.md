## About this task

The Service Portfolio Management Foundation plugin \[com.snc.service\_portfolio\] enables your organization to document portfolios, taxonomies, services, and service offerings using a standardized, structured format. It contains demo data and activates related plugins. The Foundation plugin is activated out of the box and activates related plugins, if they're not already active. For general information, see [Service Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-portfolio-management/SPM2-landing-page.md).
