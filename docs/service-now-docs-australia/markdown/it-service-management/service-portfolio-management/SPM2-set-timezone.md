# Set the time zone for availability results in Service Portfolio Management

By default, the time zone to calculate availability for services and commitments is set to the global \(system\) time zone. You can change the global time zone or you can set the time zone for service commitments. With either option, you can recalculate the availability results based on the time zone that you set.

## Before you begin

Role required: portfolio\_admin or admin

## About this task

The following system properties work in the background for you to set the time zone for availability results:

-   spm.availability.global.tz — The default time zone, also called the system time zone. This system property enables you to select a time zone from a list to calculate availability results for all commitments using this global time zone.
-   spm.availability.commitment.tz — When set to true \(or to Yes in the interface\), this system property enables you to calculate availability results using the time zone that you select for a commitment record.

To set the time zone, the availability system property \[com.snc.availability.v2\] must be set to true.

1.  In the Filter navigator, enter `sys_properties.list`.
2.  Enter `*avail` in the **System Properties Name** search field, and then press **Enter**.
3.  Verify that the availability system property \[com.snc.availability.v2\] is set to true.

    **Note:** If the availability system property isn’t set to true, then select the system property name, set the Value field to true, and then select **Update**. A banner might display with a link to edit the record.
