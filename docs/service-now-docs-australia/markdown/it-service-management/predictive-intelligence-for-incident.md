# Predictive Intelligence for Incident Management

Use your instance records to build specific solutions for Incident Management.

## Solution definitions

These solution definitions are available as templates on instances where both Predictive Intelligence and Incident Management are active. Create your own solution definition records to customize the behavior.

## Business rule for classification solutions

This business rule applies only to the Incident Assignment and Incident Categorization solution definitions and is available only on instances where both Predictive Intelligence and Incident Management are active. Create your own business rules on the Incident table to customize prediction and reporting behaviors.

|Business rule|Table|Description|
|-------------|-----|-----------|
|Update Prediction Results|Incident|Updates the solution precision and coverage statistics. Runs when an incident record is closed.|

**Upgrade Information**

If your instance is running on the Kingston release and you are upgrading to the Australia release:

-   In a global domain environment, use the new solutionNames array variable which requires that you explicitly provide the solutions that are called by the business rule.
-   In a domain-separated environment, such as an MSP environment, refer to the commented code in the business rule template for easy customization.
-   The business rule template now calls the applyPredictionForSolution\(\) method to predict regardless of any changes to the default value.

**Maintaining prediction accuracy**

You can manage prediction drift by retraining, modifying, or creating new solutions to reflect changes in your business conditions. Test and modify your business rule over time to ensure it works as desired across multiple consumption points and user Personas.
