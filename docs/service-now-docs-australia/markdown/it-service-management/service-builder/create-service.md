# Create a service in Service Builder

Create a service in Service Builder to model, map, and document your own business and technology management services and offerings that relate to your data in Service Portfolio Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: service\_admin, service\_author, portfolio\_admin, or portfolio\_editor

## About this task

The Service Builder framework offers you the option to create a business service or a technology management service. Once you select the type of service that you want to create, the workflow guides you through the process of adding information in a logical order:

1.  **Details**
2.  **Team**
3.  **Service Performance**
4.  **Manage Offerings**
5.  **Review &amp; Submit**

**Tip:** You can cancel out of creating a service anytime by selecting the **Cancel** button \(next to the **Save** button\). Also, to return to the home page at any time while creating or editing a service, select \[Omitted image "home-polaris-primary2x.png"\] Alt text: Home icon..

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portfolio Management** &gt; **Service Builder**.

2.  From the landing page, select the type of service that you want to create: **Business** or **Technical**.

3.  Review the Getting Started screen, and then select **Continue**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Tip:** When you check out a service that's already been created \(to review or edit it\), the word \[DRAFT\] displays in front of the service name. Once checked back in as saved, the service name doesn't have \[DRAFT\] in front of it.
