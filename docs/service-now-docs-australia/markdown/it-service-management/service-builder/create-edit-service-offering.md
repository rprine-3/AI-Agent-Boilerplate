# Create a service offering in Service Builder

Create a service offering to define and view the products or applications that make up your service in Service Builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: service\_author or service\_editor

## About this task

A service offering represents how a service is provided and who it is for. A service must have at least one offering to be published. The workflow guides you to create a service offering in a logical order:

1.  **Details**
2.  **Team**
3.  **Operations**
4.  **Financials**
5.  **Offering performance**

**Tip:** You can cancel out of creating a service anytime by selecting the **Cancel** button \(next to the **Save** button\). Also, to return to the home page at any time while creating or editing a service, select \[Omitted image "home-polaris-primary2x.png"\] Alt text: Home icon..

To create a service and service offering, you must be assigned the service\_author role. To edit \(not create\) a service or service offering, you must be assigned the service\_editor role.

</table>12. Select the **Financials** tab or select **Continue to Financials**.

13. On the form, fill in the fields.

14. A Service Offering **Cost unit** is a unit of measurement of the service offering. For example, let's say your service is Microsoft Suite. The cost unit would be the number of users. It could also be the API calls. A cost model that's **Per unit** refers to the price per unit. In this case, it would be the price per Microsoft Suite user or API call. The **Estimated Spend** for the Per unit cost model is determined by the price per unit and units per period. A cost model that's **Fixed** refers to a predetermined and agreed-upon total cost. For example, you set a specific price for your Microsoft Suite service and stick to it. The cost unit is still the same \(users or API calls\), but the **Estimated Spend** is determined by the agreed-upon price.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Price model|How the service offering is to be priced. Your selection determines the next field to display.|
    |Price unit|If the price model is set to **Per Unit**, then enter the price unit in this field. For example, license or subscription.|
    |Price|If the price model is set to **Fixed**, then enter the price in this field. Be sure to enter the currency symbol as well \(for example, $ for United States dollar\).|
    |Unit description|If the price model is set to **Per Unit**, then use this field to describe what is included in the unit.|

15. Fill in the rest of the fields.

    The following fields appear conditionally according to the cost source selected in Service Portfolio Management. These fields are enabled as part of the financial optional plugin for Service Portfolio Management. For financial information, the required plugin is com.snc.financial\_management\_for\_spm. For estimate spend information, the required plugin is com.snc.spm.spend. Both plugins require ITSM Pro SKU.

16. |Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Cost model|The cost model that determines how the estimated spend is calculated.|
|Offering cost|If the cost model is set to **Fixed**, then the cost should represent the estimated cost of the offering per time period.|
|Time period|Interval that you want to track the estimated spend \(**day**, **month**, **quarter**, **year**\).|
|Cost Unit|If the cost model is set to **Per unit**, the cost should represent the cost per unit.|
