## About this task

The ITSM Roles plugin \(com.snc.itsm.roles\) includes an additional security model. The security model provides more granular roles across ITSM applications as well as within them, allowing you flexibility in setting up access controls. The ITSM Roles plugin is available by default in new instances. Users upgrading from Madrid or earlier versions must request the plugin.
