# Transfer a request to another department

Transfer a request to another department with or without resolution to fulfill the request.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, routing agent, sn\_request\_write, or sn\_hr\_core\_case\_writer

Configure the sn\_uni\_req.transfer\_type property in the Universal Request properties page to determine how to handle the request transfers. For more information, see [Universal Request properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/ur-properties.md).

The agent can transfer a request with one of the following reasons:

-   **Transfer with resolution**

    The request is resolved and transferred back to UR, a specific department, or a service. Agents can select this option when another departments help is required to fulfill the request.

-   **Transfer without resolution**

    The request isn’t resolved or doesn’t belong to the specific department and transferred back to UR, a specific department, or a service.


## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Open Records** &gt; **Items**.

2.  Select the request item that you want to transfer.

3.  Click **Transfer**.

    **Note:** To transfer a request, either you must be part of the assignment group or the request must have been assigned to you.

4.  In the **Transfer Ticket** dialog box, fill in the details.
