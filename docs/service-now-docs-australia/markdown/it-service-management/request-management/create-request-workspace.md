# Create a catalog request in Agent Workspace

You can create a catalog request in Agent Workspace to join the Service Catalog flow from a different flow. For example, from an incident flow, you can create a request, and associate the request with the incident. It helps you in tracking the requests associated with an incident and vice versa.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil

You can create a catalog request in Agent Workspace to join the Service Catalog flow from a different flow. For example, from an incident flow, you can create a request, and associate the request with the incident. It helps you in tracking the requests associated with an incident and vice versa.

-   To associate a request with any parent table record, the corresponding mapping configuration should be available in the **Catalog Administration** &gt; **Request Parent Mapping** submodule.
-   To associate a record producer request with the parent table record, retrieve the **sysparm\_parent\_sys\_id** and **sysparm\_parent\_table** parameters from the URL using the RP.getParameterValue\(\) method in the **Script** field of the record producer.
-   For the **Create Request** UI actions in workspace on the Interaction \[interaction\] table, the field values should be as follows:
    -   **Workspace Client Script**:

        ```
        function onClick() {
            var result = g_form.submit('sysverb_ws_save');
            if (!result) {
                // failed form submission 
                return;
            }
            result.then(function () {
                var params = {};
                params.sysparm_parent_table = "interaction";
                params.sysparm_parent_sys_id = g_form.getUniqueValue();
                g_service_catalog.openCatalogItem('sc_cat_item', '-1', params);
            });
        }
        ```

-   For the **Create Request** UI actions in workspace on the Incident \[incident\] table, the field values should be as follows:
    -   **Condition**: `current.incident_state != global.IncidentState.CLOSED && gs.hasRole("itil")`
    -   **Workspace Client Script**:

        ```
        function onClick() {
            g_form.submit('sysverb_ws_update').then(function () {
                var params = {};
                params.sysparm_parent_table = "incident";
                params.sysparm_parent_sys_id = g_form.getUniqueValue();
                g_service_catalog.openCatalogItem('sc_cat_item', '-1', params);
            });
        }
        ```
