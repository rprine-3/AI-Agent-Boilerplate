Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Proactive engagement provider

</td><td>

sn\_pren\_provider

</td><td>

Record used to maintain the details of the DEX solution provider such as name and provider code. As of today, we only have Servicenow as the provider.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Issue Registry Templates

</td><td>

sn\_pren\_issue\_registry\_template

</td><td>

This table stores all the end-user issues for which a customer could potentially engage the end-user to self-solve in case of an issue occurrence. Issue registry template records can either come from a third-party DEX/DEX provider or be created directly by the customer, with a reference to the provider. This table specifies the resolution for the issue and how the end user should be engaged, and it holds descriptive fields for the issue, such as Short Description and Description. Additionally, it contains a Unique Issue Code, which is a combination of the Provider Code and Issue Code, ensuring uniqueness across all template records for a customer.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Issue Registries

</td><td>

sn\_pren\_issue\_registry

</td><td>

This table holds all the issues that the customer has chosen for end-user self-solution. An Issue Registry record is created by deploying the Issue Registry template record. Simply having the Issue Registry template record does not make the issue eligible for self-solving; the Engagement Admin must deploy the template to create the Issue Registry record.

 The table stores all the configurations deployed by the customer, including details on whether a custom resolution and notification were configured by the customer, engagement settings, notification channel settings, fallback options, and template parity status.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Resolutions

</td><td>

sn\_pren\_resolution

</td><td>

Record used to store the resolutions configured to be executed when a threshold breach occurs, as per the metric rule configuration. This record could include a self-help instruction with defined steps, a URL with a specified link, a remedial action with a reference to the configured remedial action, or of type incident creation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Notification content

</td><td>

sn\_pren\_notification\_content

</td><td>

Record used to maintain the notification settings such as notification prompt message and resolution consent prompt

</td></tr><tr><td>

Experience Issues

</td><td>

sn\_pren\_experience\_issue

</td><td>

Experience issue record is created once the engagement is initiated with the end-user. This stores data such as user info, **State** of the resolution execution, end reason state, fallback result \(if triggered\), investigative details, etc. This record will be the source of truth for any proactive engagement with end-user.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Experience issue alert

</td><td>

sn\_pren\_experience\_issue\_m2m\_alert

</td><td>

Record used to create a log of the alert that caused experience issue. This is a mapping table between alert and experience issues, with details on count of throttled users and throttling reason.
