# Engagement Settings for Proactive Engagement

It allows you to configure and define how an end user should be engaged to self-solve the issue.

Virtual Agent and Desktop Assistant are the notification channels used to notify the user. As a fallback, an incident can be created, or the user is routed to a live agent. The following field names are displayed in the Engagement settings tab while creating a Proactive Engagement resolution from the metric rules.
