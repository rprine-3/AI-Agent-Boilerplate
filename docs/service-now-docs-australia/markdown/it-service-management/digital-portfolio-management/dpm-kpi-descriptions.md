# Update KPIs in Digital Portfolio Management

You can update the key performance indicator \(KPI\) fields in Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\). The KPI displays in KPI groups in the DPM Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin

## About this task

This procedure accesses KPIs via the KPI group in DPM. To see a list of all KPI indicators without the context of its parent KPI group, enter `sn_team_perf_kpi_group_m2m_pa_indicators.list` in the Filter navigator, and then press **Enter**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Digital Portfolio Management** &gt; **KPI Groups**.

2.  Open a KPI group to view its details.

3.  On the KPIs related list \(tab\), select the item in the **Label** column to open it.

    **Note:** Be sure to select the item in the **Label** column and not in the **KPI** column.

4.  On the form, update the fields.

-   **Time series: Spline**

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active flag

</td><td>

The flag that determines if the KPI displays in the KPI group. KPI groups can display in several places in the DPM Workspace — the enterprise portfolio page, the **Overview** tab of portfolios and nodes, and the **Run** tab of services and offerings, business applications, and service instances. The flag for all KPIs that come with the base system is set to active. As an admin, you can clear the flag so it's inactive.

 -   When checked, the flag is active and the KPI displays in the KPI group.
-   When cleared, the flag is inactive and the KPI doesn't display in the KPI group.
**Important:** Two KPIs can use the same indicator. If both indicators are in a KPI group that is displayed, then both show the same indicator in the KPI groups. If one KPI is set to inactive, then that one is hidden from display, but the other one still displays.

</table>5.  Select **Update**.
