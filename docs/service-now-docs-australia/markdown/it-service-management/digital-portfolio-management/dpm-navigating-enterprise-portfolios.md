# Navigate portfolio types in Digital Portfolio Management

Navigate three types of enterprise portfolios in the Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) application — service, business applications, and service instance. The way to create a portfolio depends on the type. As of May 2025, Enterprise portfolios are created directly in DPM. Business application and Service instance portfolios are created using the enterprise portfolios tables in the DPM module in UI16.

Enterprise portfolios are structured in a nesting content tree format so you can easily navigate each type of enterprise portfolio. Access Enterprise portfolios using the Enterprise portfolio icon \(\[Omitted image "enterprise-portfolio-gray.png"\] Alt text: Enterprise portfolios icon.\). For more information about accessing enterprise portfolios, see [Navigate enterprise portfolios in Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-enterprise-portfolio.md).

Each type of enterprise portfolio offers unique data pertinent to its type. See [the DPM Academy](https://www.servicenow.com/community/itsm-articles/digital-portfolio-management-learning-resources/ta-p/2896465) Learning Resources, especially the video series, for more information about the difference between each portfolio, how they should be used, and who they are for.

## Service portfolios

As of May 2025, you can create service enterprise portfolios directly in the DPM Workspace. Service enterprise portfolios are structured in a nested content tree with the taxonomy node, and then services that are in the service portfolio. You can create a portfolio from scratch or use one of the provided templates. For more information on service enterprise portfolio templates, see [Navigate service enterprise portfolio templates in DPM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-enterprise-portfolio-templates.md).

</table>## Business application portfolios

The DPM Workspace displays enterprise portfolios in a nested content tree starting with the enterprise taxonomy node at the top level \(there could be more than one\). After the top node, it lists the business applications that are in the enterprise portfolio. Here’s an example of a business application enterprise portfolio content tree.

**Important:** The image shows the **Portfolio** field as Enterprise business applications. To select a different type of enterprise portfolio from the one you're in, delete the value in the **Portfolio** field, and then select the field \(again\) to see the other portfolio types \(service, business, or service instance\).
