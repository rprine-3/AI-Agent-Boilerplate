# Digital Portfolio Management related applications and data sources

Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) enables you to use related applications to view and edit service details in the plan-build-run life cycle. All related applications are optional, so they aren't required to use the DPM experience.

## Data Sources

By design, DPM offers a broad reach of data sources to give you a high-level view of information that impacts your solutions. Its data sources reach across hundreds of data elements across more than 70 tables, as well as many indicators. This expansive reach gives you a broad perspective of items that may influence your solutions.

DPM has three main data sources:

-   Record and field lookups, either in direct configuration in UIB or in data brokers. The lookups are listed in the data sources Excel file that you can download from [KB1123710](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1123710).
-   Needs attention attributes are from data brokers. For more information, see [KB1519343](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1519343).
-   Performance Analytics indicators, data collection jobs, and key performance indicator \(KPI\) groups.

For an overview on how DPM aligns with the Common Service Data Model \(CSDM\), see [Apply the CSDM guidelines to Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-csdm.md).

To view details on the Digital Portfolio Management data sources including data elements, source tables, fields, and required plugins, see [KB1123710](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1123710), and select the option to **Download the Data Sources Excel File**.

## Enterprise portfolios

Since the Utah release, you can install the enterprise portfolio plugin \[enterprise portfolio\] that’s available as part of the core ServiceNow AI Platform. Installing the plugin installs two new roles:

-   The enterprise portfolio admin \[sn\_ep.enterprise\_portfolio\_admin\] can create, read, update, and delete \(CRUD\) enterprise portfolios.
-   The enterprise portfolio viewer \[sn\_ep.enterprise\_portfolio\_viewer\] can read enterprise portfolios.

    Installing the enterprise portfolio plugin results in the following:

    -   The DPM admin role inherits the enterprise portfolio admin role.
    -   The DPM manager role inherits the enterprise portfolio viewer role.

## Services and service offerings

**Note:** Your data view in DPM is the same as what your product license permits from the application that you pull data from \(standard or pro\).
