# Relate business capabilities to view in Digital Portfolio Management

You can relate business capabilities for a service or for a business application to see them in the Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin

## About this task

There are two conditions to create a CI relationship in DPM.

1.  The business capability must be created.
2.  The business capability must be related to a service.

You can create a business capability by navigating to **All** &gt; **CSDM** &gt; **Design** &gt; **Business Capability**. For information about configuration item \(CI\) relationships, see [Create or edit a CI relationship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_CreateCIRelationship.md).

## Procedure

1.  Confirm the business capability name and the solution name that you want to relate.

2.  Create the CI relationship.

    1.  Enter `cmdb_rel_ci.list` in the filter navigator, and then press **Enter**.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Parent|The business capability that is to be related to the service or business application. Use the search icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-search.png"\] Alt text: Search icon.\) to select the business capability.|

        |Child|The service or business application to be related to the business capability. Use the search icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-search.png"\] Alt text: Search icon.\).|

    4.  **Submit**.

3.  Confirm the CI relationship.

    You can confirm the CI relationship in one of two ways:

    -   On the business capability record, in the Related Items section.
    -   In the DPM Workspace, on the Info tab of a service or business application.
