# KPI groups installed with Digital Portfolio Management

Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) enables you to view standard key performance indicator \(KPI\) groups that are included with the base system. You can also configure KPIs with the sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin role.

Admins view the back-end details of KPI groups by navigating to **Digital Portfolio Management** &gt; **All** &gt; **KPI Groups**.

In addition to viewing the KPIs that come with the base DPM system, you can also configure them. For more information, see [Configure KPIs in Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-configure-kpi-availability.md).

To see the latest score of KPIs, enable the latest score system property. For more information on this system property, see [KPI groups in Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-configure-kpi.md).
