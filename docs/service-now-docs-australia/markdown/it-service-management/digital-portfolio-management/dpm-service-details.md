# View service and service offering details

View information about services and service offerings that may impact your solutions. Each Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) page presents the life-cycle phase information in tabs — Plan, Build, Run, and Info.

## Status of services and service offerings

When viewing the service and service offering details in DPM, the **Phase** and **Status** of each item is listed on the workspace view and on the list view.

When viewing details of a service or service offering that's retired, an alert banner along the top of the workspace view states that it's retired. In the list view, the Phase is listed as **Retired**, the life-cycle stage is **End of Life**, and the life-cycle stage status is **Retired**.

**Important:** If your organization transitioned from the traditional Service Portfolio Management fields to the CSDM life-cycle fields, then the field names differ from this document. For more information, see [Apply the CSDM guidelines to Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-csdm.md).

**Important:** For the Australia release and later, the labels for the items in the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_technical\] table and \[service\_offering\] table are Technology Management Service and Technology Management Service Offering, respectively. Prior to the Australia release, the labels are technology management service and technology management service Offering.

Services and service offerings display information in DPM via the Plan, Build, Run, and Info tabs. If your organization opts to inactivate one or more of the tabs, then the inactivated tabs aren't visible to you. For example, if your organization doesn't work on planning activities and they inactivate the Plan tab, then the Plan tab isn't visible for you. For more information on how Admins can hide or show tabs, see [Configure the Digital Portfolio Management experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-configure-experience.md).

Keep in mind that what you are able to see in DPM depends on what your product license permits from the source application. See [Digital Portfolio Management related applications and data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-related-products.md) for the required installations and plugins to see each data element.

**Note:** The Strategic Planning Workspace \(formerly known as Alignment Planner Workspace\) is a pro version. The Portfolio Planning Workspace is available for users with a Strategic Portfolio Management \(SPM\) standard license.
