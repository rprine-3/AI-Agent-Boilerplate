# Configure the Digital Portfolio Management experience

If your organization doesn't use certain modules or life-cycle phases in Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\), then configure the experience by hiding those elements from user views.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin

## About this task

Configure the user experience in the DPM Workspace. You can also configure it using the UI Builder application but there's so much you can do in DPM. As a DPM admin, you can:

-   Hide entire tabs, certain sections of a tab, and solutions types \(for example, business applications\) from user views. After a tab or solution type is hidden, that item is also hidden in searches and filters.
-   Hide available item types — services, technology management services, business services, service instances, service offerings, and business applications.
-   Enable system properties to show:

    -   Standard Needs attention panels.

        **Note:** Standard Needs attention panels are set to true for new customers. Existing customers must enable the system property. For more information, see [Work with Needs attention panels in Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-needs-attn-panels.md).

    -   Latest \(or last\) key performance indicator \(KPI\) scores. When enabled, KPIs no longer display as a sum or average across a date range. This feature is only available with the Utah release and later.
    -   DevOps data. For more information, see [DevOps value stream metrics in Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-devops-metrics.md).
    **Note:** You can enable and disable these configurations at any time.
