# View business application details

View information about business applications that may impact your solutions. Each Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) page presents the business application life-cycle phase information in tabs — Plan, Build, Run, Risk, and Info.

## Status of business applications

When viewing the business application details in DPM, the **Status** of each item is listed on the workspace view and on the list view.

When viewing details of a business application that's retired, an alert banner along the top of the workspace informs you. In the list view, the **Life Cycle Stage** is **End of Life** and the **Life Cycle Stage Status** is **Retired**.

**Important:** If your organization transitioned from the traditional Service Portfolio Management fields to the CSDM life-cycle fields, then the field names differ from this document. For more information, see [Apply the CSDM guidelines to Digital Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-csdm.md).

Business application information is displayed in DPM via the Plan, Build, Run, Risk, and Info tabs. If your organization opts to inactivate one or more of the tabs, then the inactivated tabs aren't visible to you. For example, if your organization doesn't work on planning activities and they inactivate the Plan tab, then the Plan tab isn't visible for you. For more information on how Admins can hide or show tabs, see [Configure the Digital Portfolio Management experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-configure-experience.md).

Keep in mind that what you are able to see in DPM depends on what your product license permits from the source application. See [Digital Portfolio Management related applications and data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-related-products.md) for the required installations and plugins to see each data element.

**Note:** The Strategic Planning Workspace \(formerly known as Alignment Planner Workspace\) is a pro version. The Portfolio Planning Workspace is available for users with a Strategic Portfolio Management \(SPM\) standard license.
