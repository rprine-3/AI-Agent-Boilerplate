# Configure personal portfolio solution cards in the DPM Admin Center

Configure the fields that display on the personal portfolio solution cards in the DPM Admin Center. Your configuration determines the fields that display on each solution card in the DPM Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin

## About this task

You can configure the personal portfolio solution card fields to display information on the DPM Workspace homepage:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Digital Portfolio Management** &gt; **DPM Admin Center** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Open **Portfolio properties** and then select **Solution Cards**.

    You have the option to configure the following types of solution cards:

    -   Service
    -   Business service
    -   Technology management service
    -   Service offering
    -   Business application
    -   Service instance
3.  Select **Configure** for the card that you want to configure.

    You must be in the correct application scope to edit the record. If you're in a different scope, then a text banner displays for you to select a link to edit the record.

4.  Review the field names in the **Secondary Values** tab.

    The field names represent the information displayed on the personal portfolio card in the DPM Workspace.

5.  Configure the fields from the list view.

    You can do some minor configuring in the list view.

    -   You can set the **Active** value to true or false. After a field is set to false, it doesn't display on the solution header in the DPM Workspace.
    -   You can change the order that the active fields display on the solution header in the DPM Workspace.
6.  Configure the fields individually.

    -   Select a field to configure. You must be in the correct application scope to edit the record. If you're in a different scope, then a text banner displays for you to select a link to edit the record.
    -   Review or change the information.
