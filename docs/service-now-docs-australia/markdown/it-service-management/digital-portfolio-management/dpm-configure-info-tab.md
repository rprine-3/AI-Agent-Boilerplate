# Configure the Info tab in the DPM Admin Center

Show or hide various sections of the **Info** tab for your solutions in DPM. You can also configure the general information fields. Your configuration determines how the fields are displayed in the **General info** section of the **Info** tab in the DPM Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin

## About this task

Each solution has a **Info** tab that displays information about the solution. For example, for a service, the **Info** tab includes the **General info**, **Offerings**, **Personal portfolios**, **Service description** sections, and more. You can choose to show or hide each of these sections. Additionally, the **General info** section displays the associated service portfolio, service classification \(technical or business\), phase, status, and more. You can configure the **General info** section to best suit the needs of your organization.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Digital Portfolio Management** &gt; **DPM Admin Center** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Select the **Info** tab for the solution.

    **Note:** For the **Portfolio properties** option, select **General info**.

3.  Show or hide sections in the **Info** tab for the Service and offering, Business application, Service instance, or Portfolio solution.

    -   Turn on the toggle key to show each section of the **Info** tab.
    -   Turn off the toggle key to hide each section of the **Info** tab.
    For example, for Service and offerings, you can show or hide the **Service description**, **General info**, **Offerings**, **Personal portfolios**, **Service scope**, **Business case**, **Service contracts**, **Subscribers**, or **Commitments** sections. For Business applications, you can show or hide the **Application description**, **General info**, **Enterprise** or **Personal portfolios** list, **Relationships**, **Contract**, or **Additional information**.

4.  Select **Configure** to configure the information displayed in the **General info** section of the **Info** tab.

    You must be in the correct application scope to edit the record. If you're in a different scope, then a text banner displays for you to select a link to edit the record.

5.  In the form, fill in the fields: **Table**, **Primary field**, **Subheading**, **Header image**, **Hide tags**, and **Ignore highlight**.

6.  Review the field names in the **Secondary Values** tab.

7.  Configure the fields from the list view.

    You can do some minor configuring in the list view.

    -   You can set the **Active** value to true or false. After a field is set to false, it doesn't display in the **General info** section.
    -   You can change the order in which the active fields are displayed.
8.  Configure the fields individually.

    -   Select a field to configure. You must be in the correct application scope to edit the record. If you're in a different scope, then a text banner displays for you to select a link to edit the record.
    -   Review or change the information.
