# View service instance details

View information about service instances that may impact your solutions. Each Digital Portfolio Management \(DPM\) page presents the service instance life-cycle phase information in tabs, primarily Run and Info. The Risk tab displays when you have the Technology Lifecycle Management plugin \[sn\_apm\_tpm\] installed.

As you view the following tables, keep in mind that what you are able to see in DPM depends on what your product license permits from the source application. See [Digital Portfolio Management related applications and data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-portfolio-management/dpm-related-products.md) for the required installs and plugins to see each data element.

## KPI groups for service instances

If your organization uses the enterprise portfolio module with the latest enterprise portfolio tables, then an service instance rolls up to its related business application. This enables you to create a portfolio with business applications that will have the service instances. You could also create a separate portfolio for service instances which contains the application service. In both cases, the service instances inherit KPI groups from both portfolios.

-   An service instance can be in a business application portfolio because:
    -   Service instances roll up to business applications.
    -   Run data from the service instance shows at the business application level.
-   An service instance can be added to an application-type portfolio.

Incidents, problems, and changes can be added to an service instance's Impacted services or the Affected CIs related list. After this addition, you see the rolled up data in the following areas when you:

-   Select **View details** on any affected solution page.
-   View the **Run** tab of any solution page to view the KPI indicators.
-   View the KPIs and Needs attention panels of the affected business applications.

You can also see the rolled up data in the following areas:

-   Enterprise application portfolios
-   Enterprise service instance portfolios
-   Any business application or service instance that is added to your personal portfolios

Since service instances can be in two different types of portfolios, the service instance inherits KPI groups from two different places. See the table for how KPI groups work in the following use cases.

The service instance enterprise portfolio type contains service instances and isn't linked to a business application type.

 You can link an service instance to a business application enterprise portfolio type using cmdb\_rel\_ci. The parent should be a business application and the supporting item should be an service instance. The required relationship is **Consumes: Consumed by**.
