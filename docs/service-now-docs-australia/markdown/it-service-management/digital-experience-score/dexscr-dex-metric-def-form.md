Description

Contributes to DEX score

</td><td>

Option to determine whether the metric can contribute to the overall DEX score.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Value type

</td><td>

Value type of the metric that can be either qualitative or quantitative, depending on how it’s measured and what type of data it collects.-   Quantitative metrics evaluate scores using numbers. For example, the CPU usage or battery health of a device.
-   Qualitative metrics evaluate scores using descriptive information instead of numbers. For example, the information you collect from surveys can provide details on how employees feel about using a particular device or application.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to make the metric definition active. Only active metrics are considered for calculations and aggregations.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Good lower bound

</td><td>

Minimum value for a good metric.For example, let's say the good lower bound for a customer satisfaction metric score is set to 80%. This value means that any score more than 80% is considered good.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Average lower bound

</td><td>

Minimum value for an average metric.For example, let's say the average lower bound for a CPU usage metric score is set to 85 and its upper bound is set to 55. This value means that any score between 85 and 55 is considered average.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Poor lower bound

</td><td>

Minimum value for a poor metric.For example, let's say the poor lower bound for a device crash metric score is set to 5 and its upper bound is set to 2. This value means that any score \(number of times a device crashed\) between 5 and 2 is considered poor.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max upper bound

</td><td>

Maximum value that is considered as the upper bound for the metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Weight

</td><td>

Weighted average for the metric that contributes to the overall DEX score.
