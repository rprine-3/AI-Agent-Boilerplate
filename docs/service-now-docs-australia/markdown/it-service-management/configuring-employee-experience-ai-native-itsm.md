# Configuring the employee experience in Simplified IT Service Management

Enable an AI-first comprehensive employee experience focused on a simplified portal with an AI-first chat approach to find answers, order items, check status, and create incidents.

The following experiences are available after configuring the employee experience:

-   Simplified Employee Center portal supporting AI chat, catalog, and knowledge content.
-   Employee Slate supporting AI chat, catalog, and knowledge content.
-   ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent enhanced with prebuilt AI agents for requesters, enabling incident creation, status checks, and approvals in their preferred channels such as Microsoft Teams.
-   Prebuilt content such as taxonomy, catalog items, and record producers to resolve common IT issues and requests.

For information about available AI agents for employee configurations, see [AI agents and agentic workflows in Simplified IT Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/agents-ai-native-it-service-desk.md).

## Employee Slate

Employee Slate provides an AI-first employee experience that brings search, requests, tasks, knowledge, and communications together in one intuitive destination. Employees can easily find information, manage requests and tasks, stay informed through communications and news, connect with teams, and get work done faster.

**Note:** For upgrading instances, if the Employee Slate is installed, the **Taxonomy** section is hidden from the employee experience configuration.
