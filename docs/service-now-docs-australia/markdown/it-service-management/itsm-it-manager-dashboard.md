# Legacy: IT Manager dashboard

Follow the daily and weekly progress of incidents, problems, and requests for your assignment groups.

IT managers can use the [ITSM Success Dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/itsm-success-dashboard-indicators/explore-success-dashboard-indicators.md) to view the metrics for their assignment groups.

    Number of open incidents not updated in last 5 days as a percentage of number of open incidents, according to the formula `( [[Number of open incidents not updated in last 5 days]] / [[Number of open incidents]] ) * 100`.

-   **Active Breached SLAs Today**

    The result in percentage of the formula `([[Number of breach task sla today]]/[[Number of active task sla]])*100`

    The result, in days, of the formula `[[Summed age of open problems]] / [[Number of open problems]] / 24`

-   **Average age of open requests**

    The result, in days, of the formula `[[Summed age of open requests]] / [[Number of open requests]] / 24`

-   **Average age open incidents**

    The result, in days, of the formula `[[Summed age of open incidents]] / [[Number of open incidents]] / 24`

    The result of the formula `[[Cost of Requests Completed / By week SUM +]]/[[Number of completed requests / By week SUM +]]`. In other words, the weekly sum of the cost of completed requests, including partial weeks, divided by the weekly sum of completed requests, including partial weeks.

-   **Average Cost per Resolved Incident - Weekly**

    The result of the formula `[[Cost of Incidents Resolved / By week SUM +]]/[[Number of resolved incidents / By week SUM +]]`. In other words, the weekly sum of the cost of resolved incidents, including partial weeks, divided by the weekly sum of resolved incidents, including partial weeks.

-   **Average reassignments of open and overdue incidents**
