# Legacy: Age of Open Changes Monitor dashboard

This workbench dashboard enables you to view and assess all open changes separated into age brackets: less than one day, from 1-5 days, from 6-30 days, from 31-90 days, and over 90 days.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Core UI Age of Open Changes Monitor dashboard is deprecated. Users can use Platform Analytics [Change Management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change.md) to view, and track the open changes.
