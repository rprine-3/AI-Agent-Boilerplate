# Create a single CAB meeting occurrence

Depending on your requirements, you can create an individual Change Advisory Board \(CAB\) meeting occurrence.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_change\_cab.cab\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Change Advisory Board** &gt; **My CAB Meetings**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the CAB Meeting form, fill in the fields.

 **Note:** The system automatically updates the **State** field when the meeting starts and ends from within the CAB workbench.

Use filter criteria to drive Change Request date range

</td><td>

If selected, helps to choose a time range for the planned start and end date from **Change Request additional condition** instead of selecting specific dates based on meeting schedule.

**Note:** If you select **the Use filter criteria to drive Change Request date range** field in a cab meeting, the **Change Requests starting after** field and the **Change Requests starting on or before** field is disabled for the meeting, and therefore ignored. The change request additional conditions drive the date range.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Change Requests starting after

</td><td>

Change requests that starts after this date and time should be added to the CAB meeting.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Change Requests starting on or before

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Complete Pre-approved Changes

</td><td>

Check box to mark each pre-approved change request as **Complete** in the CAB meeting agenda. **Note:** Pre-approved changes are automatically marked as complete so that approvers do not have to review them. The pre-approved changes are visible in the CAB Workbench, and can be discussed if necessary.

</td></tr><tr><td>
