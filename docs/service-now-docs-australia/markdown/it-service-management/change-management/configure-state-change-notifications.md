# Modify the email notification for change request state changes

There is a change request email notification, which, if active, sends a notification to the user when the state progresses to **Scheduled**, **Implement**, **Review**, or **Canceled**. You can modify the change request notification to specify when to send it, who receives it, and what it contains.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, the notification is sent to the user who originally requested the change. Notifications are not sent to the user who updated the state on the change request.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Notifications**.

2.  If the **All** menu is not visible, use the filter navigator instead.

    **Note:** Enter `sysevent_email_action.list` in the filter navigator to open the notifications list directly.

3.  Locate and open **Change request state change notification**.

4.  On the form, modify information in the following form sections: **When to send**, **Who will receive**, **What it will contain**.

    For more information about email notifications and the fields in the form, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

5.  Select **Update**.
