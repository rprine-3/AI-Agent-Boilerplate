# Configure change model states

Configure states for change models and define transition between multiple states.

## Before you begin

The change model for which you want to define the states should already exist. For more information, see [Create a Change model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/create-a-change-model.md).

Role required: change\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Change Models**.

2.  Select the change model for which you want to define states.

3.  Navigate to **Model States**.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |State|State that you want to include in your model.|
    |Initial State|Option to enable this state as the initial state for your model. This field is automatically selected when you add the first state to your model.|

6.  Save the state and return to the Change Model form by selecting **Submit**.

7.  Add a transition between the available states by selecting the display/hide hierarchical lists icon \(\[Omitted image "display-hide-hierarchial-lists.png"\] Alt text:\) for the model state that you want to apply the transition to.

    1.  Select **New**.

        The Model State Transitions page is displayed.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Description|

        |From|State that the change request is moving from.|
        |To|State that the change request is moving to.|
        |Automatic Transition|Option for enabling automatic transition to the change request when the defined conditions are met. Selecting this option also helps prevent you from manually selecting the **State** field on the change request form.|

    3.  Select the form context menu icon \(\[Omitted image "form-context-menu.png"\] Alt text:\) and select **Save**.

    4.  Select **New** to add conditions for transition between states.

## What to do next

Attach a process with defined conditions that enable transition between change model states. See [Attach a process for Change model states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/attach-process-change-model.md).

Create change templates based on the change model. For more information, see [Create and propose a change template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/create-change-template.md).
