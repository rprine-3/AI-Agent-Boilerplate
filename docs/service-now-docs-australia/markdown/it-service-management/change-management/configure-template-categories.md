# Configure template categories

Create template categories and child categories to classify templates based on a change model, template usage, and organizational areas like software or security.

## Before you begin

The change template for which you want to create categories should already exist. For more information, see [Create and propose a change template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/create-change-template.md).

Role required: change\_manager

You must have a role configured with access to approve the templates for the change model.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Models** &gt; **Change Templates**.

2.  Select the template for which you want to create a category.

3.  Navigate to the **Category** tab.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  Provide the template name and a description.

6.  Create a child category by selecting a parent template in the **Parent** field.

7.  Determine the hierarchical order of the child category template by entering a value in the **Order** field.

8.  Select **Submit**.

9.  Add templates to the category.

    1.  In the **Template** tab, select **Edit**.

    2.  Move the desired templates from the Collection list to the Template list.

    3.  Select **Save**.


## Result

Categories and, if configured, child categories are created, and are available in the **Templates** menu on the Create a change request form. The child categories are displayed in the defined order, and the selected templates are available under each category.
