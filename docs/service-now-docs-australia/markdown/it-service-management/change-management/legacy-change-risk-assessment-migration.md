# Migrate from legacy change risk assessments

Users can migrate legacy change risk assessments to versions compatible with the new Change Risk Assessment table schema and logic.

## Before you begin

Few points to remember:

-   Customers with Change Management - Risk Assessment \[Legacy\] \(**com.snc.change.risk\_assessment**\) plugin already installed on their instances should only follow this task.
-   The Change Management - Risk Assessment \[Legacy\] \(**com.snc.change.risk\_assessment**\) plugin cannot be installed for customers who are on Kingston and later releases.
-   Migration guidance and best practice suggests that the migration should be performed on a development instance and not on a production instance.
-   The development instance must have the new Change Management - Risk Assessment \[com.snc.change\_management.risk\_assessment\] plugin installed.
-   All migration work must be captured in an update set, moved to a test instance, and then tested before moving them to a production instance.

Role required: itil\_admin

## About this task

The following legacy risk assessment components are migrated:

-   Risk assessment definition, questions, and question choices.
-   For multiple assessment conditions, the migration might result in the following one or more than one risk assessment records:
    -   If all the multiple assessment conditions are on the same table, then the migration results in only one risk assessment.
    -   If the multiple assessment conditions are on different tables, then the migration creates as many risk assessments as they pertain to different tables.

During migration, question choices with negative score values from the legacy assessment are excluded. Survey and Assessment V2 \(com.snc.assessment\_core\) does not support negative values in choice definitions. The business rules on the asmt\_metric\_definition table enforces this constraint by blocking any insert or update where the choice value is negative. The one exception is `-1`, which is a system-reserved value that Survey and Assessment V2 uses to record that a user did not answer a question when they submitted an assessment. The Change Risk Assessment migration excludes all negative score values, including `-1`, to prevent unanswered-question flags and other negative scores from being carried into the migrated assessment choice definitions.

**Important:** Review your legacy assessment question choices before migrating. Any choice with a negative score value, including choices used to represent unanswered or not-applicable responses, is not migrated to the new Change Risk Assessment. Recreate these choices manually in the migrated assessment using non-negative values, or enable the **Allow N/A** option on the assessment metric to capture unanswered responses.

## Procedure

1.  Create an update set and set it as the current set.

    For more information, see [Create and select an update set as the current set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/create-select-update-set.md).

2.  Navigate to **Change** &gt; **Risk Assessment \(legacy\)**.

3.  Open the legacy risk assessment that you want to migrate to a change risk assessment.

4.  Click the **Migrate to Risk Assessment** related link.

5.  Click **OK**.

6.  Repeat steps 4-5 for all the legacy risk assessment to be migrated.


## What to do next

After all the valid legacy risk assessments are migrated, reach out to the support team to run the following scripts:

```
disable_legacy_change_risk_assessment.js
```

Capture the results in the update set created and later mark the update set as closed complete. For more information, see [Mark an update set complete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/t_CompleteUpdateSets.md).

**Note:** The given procedure is a suggested practice. Alternatively, you can capture each migrated Change Risk Assessment in their own update set. You can also capture the results of disabling of the Change Management - Risk Assessment \[Legacy\] using `disable_legacy_change_risk_assessment.js` in a separate update set.

When you migrate a change risk assessment, the system maps records from legacy risk assessment to the new risk assessment tables.
