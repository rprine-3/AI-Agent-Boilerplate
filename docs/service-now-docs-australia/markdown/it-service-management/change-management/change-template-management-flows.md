# Change template management flows

Change template management flows trigger and manage steps for the template proposal, modification, and retirement processes.

Administrators can configure flows to trigger and manage the steps in the life cycle of a change template. These flows evaluate the predefined conditions and trigger requested actions to complete the modification or retirement actions for selected change templates.

The two types of flows are the STTRM Template Publish Approval flow and the STTRM Template Retire Approval flow.

-   The STTRM Template Publish Approval flow helps manage the template proposal and publishing actions in the application. The flow runs when you send a template in the Proposed state for review.
-   The STTRM Template Retire Approval flow helps manage template retirement actions. The flow runs when you retire templates and the selected templates move to the **Pending Retirement** state.


The approver for both of these flows are determined by the users and groups defined for template in the change model's Template Management section.
