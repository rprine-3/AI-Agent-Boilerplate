# Change flows

The Change Management Change flows provide a library of reusable actions and end-to-end implementations of the Change models provided in the base system.

Starting with the Yokohama release, the new base system flows replace the existing workflows for Change Management. However, you can continue to create custom workflows or use the existing ones. To migrate your existing workflows to flows, check the new base system flows available in Workflow Studio for guidance. For any new requirements, use flows.

You can use ServiceNow® Workflow Studio to create, operate, and troubleshoot flows. Workflow Studio is a single interface that provides:

-   Natural language descriptions.
-   Runtime information.
-   Consolidated configuration.

You can deactivate an out-of-box change flow directly after you copy it, without logging a support case. To activate the change flows in the base system, contact Support to request activation. For more information on the plugin activation, see

.

By default, these Change flows are provided:

|Flow|Description|

|Change - Cloud Infrastructure - Authorize|Process cloud infrastructure changes for approvals.|
|Change - Emergency - Authorize|Process an emergency change that is in authorize state and is not on hold.|
