</table>**Note:** If you install the Change Management - Core plugin \(com.snc.change\_management\), the Change Management - State Model plugin \(com.snc.change\_management.state\_model\) doesn't function as expected. You must not install Change Management - State Model plugin \(com.snc.change\_management.state\_model\) plugin if you install Change Management - Core plugin \(com.snc.change\_management\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
