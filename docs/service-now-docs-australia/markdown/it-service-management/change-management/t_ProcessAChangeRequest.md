# Process a change request

You can approve, implement, review, and close a change request.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, admin, sn\_change\_write, or change\_manager

As part of processing a change request, ensure that you have [detected any change conflicts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/t_RunManualConflictDetection.md) and [performed risk assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/t_AssessRisk.md)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Select a change request you like to work on.

3.  Approve or reject multiple change requests from the list view.

    To see all the approvals routed to you, navigate to **Self-service** &gt; **My Approvals**. Approvers with the `approval_user` role act only on the approval record.

4.  You can perform the following actions on a change request based on your role.

<table id="choicetable_yhp_ddv_tt"><tbody><tr><td id="d157537e126">

**Approve or reject a change request**

</td><td>

Open the approval record from the **Self-Service** &gt; **My Approvals** module or from the **Approvers** related list on the change request or **Reject** to reject it.The change request changes to the **Scheduled** state if it is approved or to **New** state if it is rejected.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d157537e159">

**Implement a change request**

</td><td>

Select **Implement** to put the change request to the Implement state.**Note:**

When you select **Implement**, the system automatically creates two change tasks:-   **Implement**: Represents the implementation work to be performed.
-   **Post-implementation testing**: Covers testing and validation after implementation.
The system creates theses tasks when the change request enters to **Implement** state. You can modify task assignments, dates and descriptions as needed. To cancel a task, set its state to **Cancelled**.

Tasks remain open until you close or cancel them. Canceling a task does not affect the parent change request.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d157537e203">

**Review a change request**

</td><td>

Select **Review** after reviewing the details on the change request. The change request is moved to the **Review** state. All open change tasks are set to **Canceled**.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d157537e224">

**Close a change request**

</td><td>

Select **Close** after entering the **Close code** and **Close notes** in the **Closure Information** section.The change request is closed.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d157537e248">

**Cancel a change request**

</td><td>

From the context menu, Select **Cancel Change**. Provide a reason for canceling the change and select **Save**.The change request is canceled and the reason for canceling the change is added to the **Work Notes** field.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:** Manually created change tasks are not automatically closed or cancelled when state is changed from Implement to Review. You must first close the change tasks and to close the change request.
