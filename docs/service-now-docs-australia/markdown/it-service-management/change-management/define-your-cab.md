# Create a CAB definition

A Change Advisory Board \(CAB\) definition is similar to a recurring meeting invitation. When you define a CAB definition, it determines the attributes that are associated with all CAB meetings generated from that definition.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_change\_cab.cab\_manager

## Procedure

For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).
