## About this task

The ITSM Roles plugin activates several related plugins such as Business Stakeholder \(com.snc\_business\_stakeholder\), ITSM Roles — Incident Management \(com.snc.itsm.roles.incident\_management\), ITSM Roles — Problem Management \(com.snc.itsm.roles.problem\_management\), ITSM Roles — Change Management \(com.snc.itsm.roles.change\_management\), and ITSM Roles — Request Management \(com.snc.service\_management.roles.request\_management\). The related plugins updates the security model and introduces roles for respective products.

With the introduction of the new roles, ITSM provides more control over the access that users have within the process.
