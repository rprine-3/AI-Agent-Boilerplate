# Create policy inputs

Policy inputs are variable sources that you can use while evaluating a decision to determine the approval action. You can create multiple policy inputs to evaluate the decision created, and also access the change request table and any table change request references.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or change manager

You can create multiple policy input types. By default, the **change\_request** policy input of type **Reference** is available for all change types. This policy input provides access to the change request table and to any table change request references. For a normal change policy, an extra **manager\_approved** policy input of type **True/false** is available.

To define additional policy inputs, perform the following steps:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Change Policy** &gt; **Change Approval Policies**.

2.  Create a change approval policy or open an existing policy.

    For more information, see [Create change approval policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/create-change-policy.md)

3.  In the **Policy inputs** tab, click **New** to create a record.

    The **Name** and **Application** fields are auto-populated.

4.  Click the reference lookup icon for the **Type** field and choose a Type value.

5.  Enter a name in the **Label** field.

    The column name for the new record is populated in the **Column Name** field automatically.

6.  Depending on the value of the **Type** field, you can configure the other parameters for the policy input.

7.  Click **Submit**.


## What to do next

After you create a policy input, reference it within a decision.
