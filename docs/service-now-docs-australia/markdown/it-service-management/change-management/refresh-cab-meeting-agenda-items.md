# Modify CAB meeting details

You can modify the agenda items for a specific CAB meeting.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, sn\_change\_read, sn\_change\_write, or sn\_change\_cab.cab\_manager

## About this task

After you update the CAB board or change request conditions, refresh the CAB meeting to apply the updates. If you add new board members or attendees to the meeting, they are notified via email invitations after the meeting is refreshed.

**Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).
