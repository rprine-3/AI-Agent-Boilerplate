# Components installed with ITSM Roles - Change Management

Several user roles are installed with the activation of the ITSM Roles — Change Management plugin \(com.snc.itsm.roles.change\_management\). Security ACLs to support the security model for Change Management and related functionality are also installed.

When you install the ITSM Roles — Change Management plugin \(com.snc.itsm.roles.change\_management\), the plugin updates the Security Access Control Lists \(ACLs\), integrating revised scripts, and other files to overhaul the security model for these applications.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
