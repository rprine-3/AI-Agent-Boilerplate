# Modify a template

Copy and modify change templates.

## Before you begin

The change model you want to modify must have been created. For more information, see [Create a Change model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/create-a-change-model.md).

Role required: change\_manager

You must have a role with the following access with regard to the change model to modify or retire a change template:

-   Access to read
-   Access to modify

## About this task

Before modifying a template, you can analyze the template usage by viewing the **Change Template Metrics** tab. View the change template usage trend and related statistical data by selecting **Closed Change count**.

You can modify only templates in the Draft state. To modify templates that are in the Proposed state or are already published, create a copy. If you want to discontinue the existing template after creating a modified copy, use the **Copy and retire** option.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Models** &gt; **Change Templates**.

2.  Select the template you want to modify.

3.  Either modify the change template directly or copy it and then modify it.

</td><td>

Select **Copy**.A template copy is created and the Previous template field displays the template from which the copy was created. The copied template is created in the **Draft** state.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Either save the template information for later approval or send it for approval immediately.

    -   To save the modifications but not send them for approval, select **Save**.
    -   To send the template for approval, select **Publish**.
    **Note:** In the **Approvers** tab, you can view the list of approvers who have been configured to review the modifications made to the template, and the details of proposed and reviewed modifications.

    After the modifications are approved, a new version of the change template is created. Change requests created from the modified change template reflects the modifications made.
