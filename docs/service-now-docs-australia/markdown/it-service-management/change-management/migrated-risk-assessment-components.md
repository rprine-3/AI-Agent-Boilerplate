# Migrated risk assessment components

When you migrate a change risk assessment, the system maps records from legacy risk assessment to the new risk assessment tables.

To create a functional risk assessment on the assessment framework, the system converts risk assessment records to the most logical equivalent assessment risk records. This may mean multiple assessment risk records are created from one legacy risk record.
