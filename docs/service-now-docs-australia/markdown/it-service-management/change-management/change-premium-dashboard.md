# Legacy: Change Premium dashboard

This dashboard uses Workbench widgets and other advanced Platform Analytics features to give you all the information about the Change process in one place.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Core UI Change Premium dashboard is deprecated. You can use Platform Analytics [Change Management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change.md) to view the information about the Change process in one place.
