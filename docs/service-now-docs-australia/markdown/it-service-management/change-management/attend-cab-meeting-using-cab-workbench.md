# CAB meeting attendance using the CAB workbench

View the details of a CAB meeting and its agenda by navigating to **Change** &gt; **Change Advisory Board** &gt; **CAB Workbench**. From the calendar, you can view the CAB meeting schedule for a day, week, or month. To view details of a meeting, select the meeting and then select **Open** in the pop-up window.

**Note:** If the system property **sn\_change\_cab.com.snc.change\_management.cab.use\_sow\_meeting** is set to true and you have the sn\_sow.sow\_user role, the CAB meeting opens in the CAB Workbench in Service Operations Workspace. If it is set to false, the meeting opens in the Core UI. For more information, see [Change Management properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/r_ChangeManagementProperties.md).

View the current agenda item. The timer displays the amount of time spent discussing the current meeting agenda item. The form area displays the details of the current agenda item that you have selected. When the current agenda item changes, the details on the form and the calendar change accordingly.

The form area does not display details of the current agenda item even when the current agenda item is changed to the next agenda item. **Note:** If you are one of the approvers for the agenda item, the **Approve** and **Reject** buttons appear below the timer.

You can click **Approve** or **Reject** as appropriate, enter your comments in the Confirmation pop-up window, and click **Approve** or **Reject**.
