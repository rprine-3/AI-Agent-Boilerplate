# Create predefined transition condition types

Create predefined transition conditions to reuse the conditions for your Change models.

## Before you begin

Role required: change\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Application** &gt; **Module** &gt; **Change Model Condition Types**.

    A list of transition conditions for Change requests appears.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Unique name for the condition type. This name is displayed in the **Requires** field on the Model State Transition Condition form.|
    |Description|Detailed description of the condition type.|
    |Condition Type|Type of condition that is either **condition** or **script**.|
    |Table name|Table name that the condition is based on.|
    |Condition \(Condition builder\)|Conditions that must be fulfilled for processing the transition.|
    |Condition \(Script\)|Script that must be fulfilled for processing the transition. If passed, it returns a value of **true**.|

4.  Select **Submit**.

5.  Open the **Change Model**, select the relevant **Model State** and either add or edit a Model State Transition that references the condition type.

    **Note:** Creating a condition type does not enable a transition on its own. To apply it, select the condition type in the **Requires** field of a model state transition condition.
