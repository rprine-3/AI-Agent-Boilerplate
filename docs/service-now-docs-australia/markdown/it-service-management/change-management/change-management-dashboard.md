# Legacy: Change Management dashboard

Use this dashboard to see the trends in change request resolution over time across different change request risks, ages, and priorities. Break down change requests over time according to the assignment groups you manage.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Core UI Change Management dashboard is deprecated. You can use Platform Analytics [Change Management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change.md) to view, and track the open changes.
