# Legacy: Change Velocity dashboard

Use this dashboard to track the average duration of change requests in the last 30 days.

**Important:**

Starting in Xanadu release, the Core UI Change Velocity dashboard is deprecated. You can use Platform Analytics [Change Management dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change.md) to view, and track the open changes.

The Change Velocity dashboard is divided into the following tabs for effective usage. The ServiceNow® Performance Analytics capability in the Change Velocity dashboard provides the following benefits:

-   The **Current Pipeline** tab provides insights into current change activity. The **Historical Pipeline** tab provides details on trends and patterns associated with the change management process flow. The **Process KPIs** tab represents a modern set of Change KPIs that are used to evaluate the change process.

-   The **Process Optimization** tab provides change activity assessments that are based on the state model. This capability is available only with an ITSM Enterprise subscription. For more information, see [Process Mining](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining.md).

-   **Top Change Success Performers**

    Performance of assignment groups in processing the change request with the highest performer on the top. For information on how the performance score is calculated, see [Success Score Calculation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/change-score-calculation.md).

-   **Average age of open changes**

    Average amount of time that the change request has been open.

-   **Average close time of changes**

    Average amount of time that it has taken to close the change request.

-   **Average implementation time of closed changes**
