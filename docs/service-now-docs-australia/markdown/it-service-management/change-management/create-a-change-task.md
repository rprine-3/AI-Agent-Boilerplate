# Create a change task

You can create change tasks for a change request. A change task is a piece of work related to the change request. For example, there can be tasks to plan the change, implement the change, and test, and review the work.

## Before you begin

Before creating a change task, confirm you have the required roles. If not, contact your administrator to request access.

Role required: itil, admin, or sn\_change\_write

**Note:**

If the change task form is read-only, confirm that you have a required role and that the change request is in an editable state. Editing is not available in certain states, such as **Closed**. For state-based restrictions, see [Legacy: State model and transitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/c_ChangeStateModel.md).

## About this task

Change tasks can be created manually or from a workflow. The **Change Tasks** related list is displayed by default and includes all manual and workflow-generated change tasks.

To edit existing tasks or create tasks, from the **Related Links** section, select the **Change Tasks** tab and then select **New**.

If the Change task related list is not visible, scroll down the change form or verify that your role has permission to view it. If the list is still not visible, contact your IT administrator to verify your permissions and form configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Select the change request to add a change task.

3.  In the **Related Links** section, select **Change Tasks** tab and then, select **New**.

4.  To associate an existing change task with the change request, open the change task record and update the **Change** field to the target change request and save the record.

    **Note:** The **New** button creates a change task and doesn't attach an existing change task. To carry tasks to the new change request, [Copy a change request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/copy-a-change-request.md)

5.  Fill in the fields, as appropriate.

</table>6.  To enter work notes for the change task, select the **Notes** tab.

7.  To record the reasons for closing a task, select the **Closure Information** tab and set the **Close code** and **Close notes** fields.

    Each change task is closed individually. The **Close code** applies to the current change task and not to other change tasks on the change request.

    **Important:**

    Close codes and close notes apply to individual change tasks only and do not affect other change tasks on the change request. Once you submit or close a change task, you cannot revert it to an earlier state, such as **Open** or **In Progress**.

8.  Select **Submit**.

    The change task is added to the change request. The assigned user receives a notification that a task was assigned to them.
