# Detect conflicts manually and review conflict details

Run conflict detection manually for a change request. Review the conflicts detected either automatically or manually and resolve them by changing the schedules.

## Before you begin

Before you can run conflict detection for a change request, the following information must be provided in the change record:

-   The configuration item in either the **Configuration item** field or in advanced mode the **Affected CIs** field.
-   The planned start date, provided in the **Planned start date** field.
-   The planned end date, in the **Planned end date** field.

**Note:** The conflict detection feature is unavailable if the **Exclude from conflict detection** check box in the Change Request form is selected. For more information, see [.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/t_RunManualConflictDetection.md)

For information about running conflict detection automatically, see [Enable automatic change conflict detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/t_RunAutomatedConflictDetection.md).

Prior to running conflict detection, consider the following scenarios:

-   **CMDB list size and relationship complexities**

    If you have a large organization with a large CMDB, conflict detection can take longer to complete.

-   **Inactive changes are not evaluated**

    Conflict detection does not evaluate inactive changes when determining conflicting changes.

-   **Advanced mode conflict checking is disabled by default**

    When you upgrade the application, advanced mode conflict checking is disabled by default and affected CIs are not considered during conflict detection. To evaluate all CIs, set the mode to **Advanced**.


Role required: itil or sn\_change\_write

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Select the change request.

3.  Select the **Conflicts** tab.

4.  Select **Check Conflicts**.

5.  When the conflict detection pop-up window is displayed, click **Close**.

    Conflicts appear in the Conflicts Detected list on the **Conflicts** tab. The **Conflict status** and **Conflict last run** fields on the change request record are also updated.

## Cancel conflict detection manually

Cancel any conflict detection jobs that are actively running for a change request if you want to make any modifications to the schedules. After modifying the schedules, you can rerun the check conflicts action again to identify potential conflicts.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Open the change request that you want to cancel conflict checking for.

3.  Click the **Conflicts** tab.

4.  Click **Check Conflicts**.

    The Checking conflicts progress status pop-up window appears.

5.  To cancel conflict detection, click **Cancel**.

    The active conflict detection job is canceled and all conflicts displayed in the Conflicts section are cleared. The **Conflict Status** field displays a **Not Run** status.

    **Note:** If you set conflict detection to run automatically or on a scheduled basis, the future executions of conflict detection against the same change request record are not canceled.


## Exclude change requests from conflict detection

Exclude change records from being displayed as a potential conflict in the conflict detection process.

### Before you begin

Role required: change\_manager

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Select an existing change request.

3.  In the form context menu, select **Configure** &gt; **** &gt; **Form layout**.

4.  Add the **Exclude from conflict detection** field to the change request form.

    For information on the procedure to add a new field to a form, see [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md).


### Result

The **Exclude from conflict detection** check box is added to the Change Request form. When the check box is selected in the change request form, the **Check conflicts** option is inactive, and the change request is excluded from the conflict detection process. The change request is also excluded from being displayed as a conflict when conflict detection is run on other change records.
