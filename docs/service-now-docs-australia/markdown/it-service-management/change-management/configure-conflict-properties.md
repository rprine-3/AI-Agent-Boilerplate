## Conflict detection properties

Conflict detection includes properties that determine how the conflict detection capability is executed.

Initiate properties without other settings by setting the value to Yes.

**Note:** You can determine the mechanism for conflict detection. You can choose between the Flow and Progress Worker options by updating the **change.conflict.useprogressworker** system property. It is set to false by default.
