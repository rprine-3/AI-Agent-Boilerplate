# Update the change request workflow

Update the change request workflow to reflect the addition of the **Complete** state.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Change Request – Normal workflow for the **Normal** type change request must be updated to progress the change request to **Complete** instead of **Review**.

In case of a change request of type **Normal**, in the **Assess** state, any user from the **Assignment group** can approve the change request. When the value of **Risk** is **Moderate** or **High**, a CAB approval is initiated in the **Authorization** state. In case the **Risk** is **Low**, an approval from the CAB team is not required. Instead, the manager of the assignment group can approve the change request.

**Note:** If the manager of the assignment group also happens to be the user who had approved the change request in the **Assess** state, the **Authorize** state is skipped and the state of the change request is set to **Scheduled**.

The functionality is available only for the new customers.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow** &gt; **Workflow Editor**.

2.  Select **Change Request – Normal** from the list of workflows.

3.  Select the **Checkout** option from the **Context** menu to create a new version of this workflow.

4.  Open the **Set Values** activity that transitions to the **End** activity and modify the following fields.
