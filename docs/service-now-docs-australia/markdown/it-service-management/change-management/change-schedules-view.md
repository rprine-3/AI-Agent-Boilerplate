# Change schedules view

The Change Schedules module provides a Gantt or timeline view of change requests based on criteria defined within a Change Schedule Definition.

The change schedule provides detailed insight to change requests that are included based on the change schedule definition. The change requests can include change timing, duration, related change tasks, blackout periods, and maintenance windows for any given date, week or month.

To view the Change Schedules page, you must activate Change Management - Change Schedule plugin \(com.snc.change\_management.soc\).

Change requests are represented by a span. The duration of the span is defined by the start and end date fields defined in the Change Schedule definition. The Change Schedules page allows conditions to be defined using the condition builder. The condition builder determines which change requests are displayed and sorted in a change schedule.

**Note:** To show the blackout and maintenance windows of the change in the calendar view, the **Configuration item** field for the change must be populated. The change schedule view is only able to display related Blackout and Maintenance windows for the primary CI \(Configuration item\) defined for each change request.

Option to do the following:-   Create new schedule: You can create a new schedule from a simplified wizard.
-   Edit a schedule: Allows the modification of change schedules you own and any changes made are saved to the related Change Schedule Definition record.
-   Copy a schedule: If you are the owner of the change schedule that you want to copy, then a copy of the change schedule is created. If you want to copy a change schedule that is owned by any other user, then you become the owner of the copied schedule and the new schedule is fully editable by you.
-   View schedule definition: You can view the change schedule definition and the related fields associated with it.
-   Delete: Allows users, who own a change schedule, to delete the schedule.

 **Note:**

-   A user who only possesses the ITIL role and is not the owner of a change schedule can only create a schedule, copy a schedule, or view an existing schedule definition.
-   You become the owner of any schedule that you create. The new schedule that you create appears in the Change Schedule page in a tile form under the **Your Schedules** tab.
