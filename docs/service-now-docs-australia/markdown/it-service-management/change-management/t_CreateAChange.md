# Create a change request

Create a change request to implement a controlled process for modifying approved and supported configuration items \(CIs\).

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, admin, or sn\_change\_write

## About this task

A change request records detailed information about the change. This includes the reason for the change, the priority, the risk, the type of change, and the change category.

If you use conflict detection, the planned start and end dates and the configuration item \(CI\) are required.

**Note:** Editing the field depends on the current state of the change request and the configured workflows.

-   **New:** The fields are editable.
-   **Authorized:** The fields are set to read only to prevent unintended changes after approval.
-   **Scheduled:** The notes and status fields are editable, and the description field is read-only.
-   **Implement and Review:** The description and planning fields are set to read-only. The activity and closure information fields are editable.

To modify fields after saving, verify that the change request is still in an editable state. If it has progressed to Authorized or a later state, you must either request a state change back to New, or create a change request with the corrected information.

## Procedure

1.  Create the change request with one of these options.

<table id="choicetable_agp_ckc_3t"><tbody><tr><td id="d194247e96">

**From the Change application**

</td><td>

You can create all three types of change from the **Change** application. This is the main entry point for creating a change request.1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Create New**.
2.  Select **Normal**, **Emergency**, or **Standard** changes.
 If you are an upgrade customer and willing to use change models, you must enable the change model properties. For information on change models and its properties, see [Change model management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/manage-change-models.md).

 When you enable the change model properties, you see the following tabs when you navigate to **All** &gt; **Change** &gt; **Create New**.

 -   **Models**: Shows all the available models available to select.
-   **Preapproved**: List of preapproved models to select.
-   **Pinned**: Models that you have pinned from the **Models** and **Preapproved** tabs.
-   **All**: All models are available to select.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d194247e192">

**From an incident or a problem**

</td><td>

As a user with the sn\_change\_write role, you can create a standard, normal, or an emergency change from an incident or a problem.1.  Open the incident or problem.
2.  Right-click the form header and select **Create Normal Change**, **Create Standard Change**, or **Create Emergency Change**.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d194247e219">

**From an existing change record**

</td><td>

If the administrator enabled the change request copy option, you can create a new change by copying an existing change record.1.  Open the change record that you want to copy.
2.  Select **Copy Change**.
 **Note:** If the create task workflow sets the **create\_from** field in the \[change\_task\] table to **workflow**, manually created tasks from the existing change record are copied.

Risk and compliance category

</td><td>

Dynamic category that groups the risk and compliance attributes relevant to the change.Categories are hierarchical. A category can have a parent category, so that a specific category nests under a broader one. For example, a category for changes that affect financial or payment systems can nest under a broader compliance category.

The base system includes example categories, such as Risk and Compliance, Financial Risk and Compliance, and SaaS/Cloud Security Compliance. You can deactivate these categories or add your own to match your organization's compliance requirements

**Note:**

-   For more information about dynamic categories, see [Dynamic Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-schema.md).
-   To configure the Risk and compliance category, see .


</td></tr><tr><td>

Risk and compliance attributes

</td><td>

Risk and compliance details for the change, entered as a JSON string of attribute name and value pairs. Use this field to record information such as whether an audit trail is required, whether the change requires downtime, the estimated number of impacted users, and the expected rollback time.An attribute that is defined under the `change_request/risk_and_compliance_attributes` dynamic namespace adheres to the type set on the dynamic attribute, such as `True/False`, `Integer`, `Decimal`, or `String`.

The attributes provided in the base system are examples. You can deactivate them or define the attributes that match the compliance requirements of your organization.

**Note:**

-   You can also read and update attribute values from scripts, including risk condition scripts and business rules. Use the dynamic schema scripting API to conditionally respond to attribute values or trigger downstream actions. For information about the scripting API, dynamic attributes, transient attributes, and configuration options, see [Dynamic Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-schema.md).
