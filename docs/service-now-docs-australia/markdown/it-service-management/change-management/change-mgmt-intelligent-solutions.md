# Predictive Intelligence for Change Management

The Predictive Intelligence for Change Management capability uses machine-learning algorithms to suggest standard templates, identify similar incidents, and enhance risk assessment for the change.

Predictive Intelligence for Change Management delivers the following benefits:

-   Enhanced change risk calculation using machine-learning algorithms to assess change risk.
-   Uses Predictive Intelligence clustering capability to identify and suggest Standard Change templates to create a change.

## Solution definitions for Predictive Intelligence for Change Management

The Solutions definitions for Predictive Intelligence for Change Management capability are available after you activate the following plugins:

-   Change Management - Risk Intelligence plugin \(com.snc.change\_management.ml.risk\)
-   Change Management - Standard Change Template Intelligence plugin \(com.snc.change\_management.ml.sctp\)

**Note:** Predictive intelligent for Change Management plugins can be requested through the Now Support Customer Service system.

For more information, see [Change Management plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/change-plugins.md).

Description

Risk for proposed change

</td><td>

Similarity and Categorization

</td><td>

Provides insight into the potential risk of the change activity and facilitates intelligent approval decisions. The info message puts all the risk related information to easily compare the returned value.This prediction helps in reducing approval friction and time. For example, when risk = low, you can use Change Approval Policies to automatically approve this low risk activity.

Standard change candidates

</td><td>

Clustering

</td><td>

Analyzes and suggests opportunities for Standard Change proposal templates that can be used for automatically creating a change. This solution uses similarity and clustering solution type to identify the common fields in the records and make it a template.
