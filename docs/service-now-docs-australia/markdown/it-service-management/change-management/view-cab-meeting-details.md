# View CAB meeting details

You can view the details of any past, scheduled, or in-progress CAB meeting.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, sn\_change\_cab.cab\_manager, sn\_change\_read, sn\_change\_write, or admin

## Procedure

1.  Use one of the following ways to navigate to the CAB meeting.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **Change** &gt; **Change Advisory Board** &gt; **All CAB Meetings** and open the specific CAB meeting to view.

**Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).
