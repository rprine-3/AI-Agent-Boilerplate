# Change success score

Use team historical data for insights into team performance. The score value helps you to determine how likely the team is to complete your change request without issues.

**Note:** The change success score feature is installed after you activate the Change Management - change success score plugin available with the ITSM Professional subscription only. Contact your account manager for more information.

The change success score can help you evaluate a team's success in handling prior change requests.

When the Change Management - Change success score plugin is activated, a **Change success score metrics \(Daily\)** performance analytic \(PA\) job is added. The PA job is a daily job that collects the first set of change success scores until the next job run time that is 02.00 UTC. After the first job run, a **Change Success Score** card \[Omitted image "change-score-card-icon.png"\] Alt text: Change Success Score icon icon appears next to the **Assignment group** field on the change request form. On a click of this icon, you can view the score card details of the assignment group.

Use the data on this dashboard to see trends in the resolution efficiency of a team over time based on the same parameters used to calculate the overall score. To view the trends of all the assignment groups, clear the selected element.

Navigate to **Change** &gt; **Change Analytics** to access the **Change Success Score**, **Change Type Success**, and **Change Model Success** dashboards.
