# Create an ACL

Create an access control rule \(ACL\) to avoid the **Needs review** field from being modified after it has been set.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin with elevated security

## About this task

The newly created UI Policy makes the **Needs review** field mandatory when a change request reaches the **Complete** state.

The subsequent configuration of the state model ensures that a value is required in the **Needs review** field before the change request can be saved in the **Complete** state. To avoid the **Needs review** value from being changed after it has been set, create access control level record \(ACL\) to make the field read-only.

## Procedure

1.  Open the **Change Request** form.

2.  Open the form context menu and select **Configure** &gt; **Security Rules**.

3.  Elevate your security role in the user menu that opens when you select your name in the header.

    Only administrators with elevated security roles can add ACLs.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  Enter the following values.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Type|Record|
    |Operation|Write|
    |Name \(first part\)|Change Request|
    |Name \(second part\)|Needs review|
    |Condition|\[State\] \[is\] \[Implement\]|

    \[Omitted image "NewStateTutNewACL1.png"\] Alt text: New change request ACL

6.  Select **Submit**.
