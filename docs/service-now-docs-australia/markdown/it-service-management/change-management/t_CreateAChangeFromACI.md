# Create a change request from a configuration item \(CI\)

Create a change request from a list of configuration items \(CIs\), or add selected CIs from a list to a change record.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, admin, or sn\_change\_write

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** and select a CIs class.

    For example, select **Servers** or **Service**.

    The list of CIs for the selected CI class displays.

2.  Select one or more CIs from the list.

3.  Select one of the following options from the Actions list.

<table id="choicetable_b3q_mzg_mw"><tbody><tr><td id="d339868e89">

**Add to existing Change Request**

</td><td>

Select this option to associate the CIs with an existing change request.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d339868e98">

</td><td>

    **Note:** CIs with a **Business Service** CI class are added to the **Impacted Services/CIs** related list on the change request. The remaining CIs are added to the **Affected CIs** related list.

    Depending on your selection, either an existing change requested is updated with the selected CIs or a new change request record is created with the selected CIs.

4.  Continue to create or modify the change record as required.
