# Applying CSDM guidelines to Change Management

Change Management lets you control every aspect of the IT change process from creation to approval. When you have accurate information, you can minimize risks to your business and avoid conflicts with scheduling. The goal of this product view is to help you to understand how Change Management key entities work with the core CSDM framework.

## Change Management

Change Management includes the following features:

-   Manage changes more quickly by using the Change Advisory Board \(CAB\) Workbench to schedule, plan, and manage CAB meetings from one interface.
-   The Change Management backlog analysis dashboard provides increased visibility into any changes.
-   Service Maps let you see the change impacts at-a-glance.
-   The change approval policies increase DevOps velocity and remove IT friction.

-   **[Change Management and CSDM tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/itsm-change-use-case.md)**  
Change Management manages and uses CSDM tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to Change Management.
-   **[Change Management use case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/itsm-change-use-case-example.md)**  
For ITSM, specifically incident and change, identifying the location of critical data can help reduce mean time to resolve incidents and eliminate outages caused by change.
-   **[Change Management considerations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/itsm-change-use-case-trouble.md)**  
Consider these points while implementing the CSDM framework.
