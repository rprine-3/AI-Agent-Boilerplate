# Approval with e-Signature for change requests

Use e-signatures to add an additional layer of verification and compliance to change approval workflows. e-signatures are supported in both Core UI and Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\).

e-signatures provide a secure, auditable method for approvers to verify their identity when approving change requests.

## Supported approval mechanisms

You can use e-signatures with any approval mechanism available in Change Management, including:

-   The **Ask for Approval** action in Flow Designer.
-   The **Approval - User** or **Approval - Group** activities in Workflow.
-   Change approval policies.

## Supported tables

By default, Approval with e-Signature supports the Change Request and Standard Change Proposal tables.

For more information, see [Approval with e-signature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/approval-with-e-signature.md).

## Requirements

Before you can use e-signatures with change approvals, verify the following requirements:

-   The e-signature platform plugin is activated on your instance. For activation instructions, see [Activate Approval with e-Signature plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/activate-approval-esignature.md).
-   Change approvals are configured for the relevant change models or change types using Flow Designer flows, legacy workflows, or change approval policies.
-   Approvers have the appropriate roles to approve change requests.
