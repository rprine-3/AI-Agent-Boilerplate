# Microsoft Exchange Server meeting management pre-built topics for ITSM Virtual Agent

ITSM Virtual Agent helps you manage meetings in Microsoft Exchange Server. Using the Manage Meetings EXS topic, you can schedule, reschedule, and cancel a meeting.

## Manage Meetings EXS

Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) is used to identify and trigger the meeting action that a user wants to perform. Users can schedule, reschedule, or cancel a meeting.

Requirements:

-   [Microsoft Exchange Server spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/msexchangeserver-spoke.md) \(sn\_exchange\_spoke\)
-   Email addresses for meeting attendees must be configured in the User \[sys\_user\] table to be added to meeting invites
-   Some topics can use the [Zoom spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/zoom-spoke.md) to add meeting links

**Note:** If these topics are duplicated in a different scope than ITSM Virtual Agent Conversations, script logic can be affected and cause errors. This topic must be duplicated in the ITSM Virtual Agent Conversations scope.
