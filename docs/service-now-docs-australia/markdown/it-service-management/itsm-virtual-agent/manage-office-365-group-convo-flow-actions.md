# Microsoft Office 365 Group pre-built topics for ITSM Virtual Agent

ITSM Virtual Agent helps you manage Microsoft Office 365 Groups using actions in conversation flows.

Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) is used to identify and trigger the Microsoft Office 365 Group action that a user wants to perform.

Requirement: [Microsoft Azure AD spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/set-up-azure.md) \(com.sn.azure\_ad.spoke\) plugin

**Note:** If the Microsoft Office 365 topics are duplicated in a different scope than ITSM VA Conversations, script logic can be affected and cause errors.
