# ITSM Virtual Agent pre-built actionable notifications

Send interactive messages to an employee through Virtual Agent, based on pending tasks or alerts. Deflect some of the most common ITSM incidents to ITSM Virtual Agent, reduce incident volume to Service Desk, and help employees discover ITSM Virtual Agent as a resolution channel.

## Actionable notifications

Actionable notifications are interactive messages that Virtual Agent sends to the end user when the user takes certain actions on non-conversational service channels. These notifications have buttons that enable the recipient to perform certain actions, such as adding a comment or requesting a live agent. When you create an actionable notification, you associate an action with a published Virtual Agent topic, a scriptable action, or a flow action that handles the action to be performed. For example, Virtual Agent can send a notification when an employee submits an incident through email or the ServiceNow® Service Portal, if there are any updates or actions needed from the employee. Employees can resolve the incident directly in the Virtual Agent conversation, without involving a live agent.

Admin or Virtual Agent admin \(virtual\_agent\_admin\) users activate notifications and the ITSM Virtual Agent Conversation topics.

To create your own custom notifications, see [Configuring Virtual Agent notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/configuring-va-notifications.md).
