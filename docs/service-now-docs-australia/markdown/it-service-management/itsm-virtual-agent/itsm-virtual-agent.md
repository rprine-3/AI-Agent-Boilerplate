## About ITSM Virtual Agent

ITSM Virtual Agent helps you automate employee workflows by addressing common IT-related queries immediately. At any time during a virtual conversation, a user can request to interact with a live IT technician.

ITSM Virtual Agent includes pre-built topic conversations that cover common IT interactions. These conversations run in the web chat client and are also available in supported ITSM Virtual Agent messaging integrations.

Conversations between Virtual Agent and the user accomplish an IT goal. The information exchanged during the conversation flow, such as user inputs and Virtual Agent responses, enables Virtual Agent to fulfill a request or help complete a task.

ITSM Virtual Agent integrates with ServiceNow® [Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integrationhub.md) and [Flow Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/flow-designer.md). Some topics may require specific spokes to be installed.

## Edge Encryption for ITSM Virtual Agent

Edge encryption provides you with direct control over your data security. Encryption and key management are performed on your intranet between your browser and your ServiceNow instance.

See [Exploring Edge Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_EdgeEncryptionOverview.md).

Because edge encryption is enabled on a proxy server on your side of the network, there is significant planning, network administration and management, and setup required. For more information, see [Planning for Edge Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_EdgeEncryptionPlanning.md).

To install edge encryption, see [Edge Encryption installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_InstallEdgeEncryptionProxy.md).

To configure edge encryption, see [Edge Encryption configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/edge-config.md).

**Note:** There are limitations when using edge encryption. For more information, see [Edge Encryption limitations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/edge-encryption-limitations.md).
