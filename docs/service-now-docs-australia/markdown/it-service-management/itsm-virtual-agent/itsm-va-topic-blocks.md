# Reusable ITSM Virtual Agent pre-built topic blocks

Reuse topic blocks to perform common functions in ITSM Virtual Agent conversations, such as creating an incident or performing a search.

Use the **Type** list on the Topics page in Virtual Agent Designer to sort by **Topic Blocks**. For detailed information about topic blocks, see [Maximizing code reuse with topic blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/topic-blocks-overview.md).

ITSM Virtual Agent provides the following pre-built topic blocks and templates.

**Note:** Many of these topic blocks are available with the Service Management Virtual Agent Topic Blocks plugin \(com.glideapp.cs.sm\_topic\_blocks\). For more information about plugins, see [ServiceNow Plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ServiceNowPlugins.md)
