# Setting up AI Search in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM

Intelligent query features enable you to quickly find the answers that you require. The Next Experience Unified Navigation search field enables you to search multiple record types and switch between global search results and results from the workspace applications that you can access.

For information about AI Search, see [AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/overview-ais.md).

The following configurations are added for the AI Search experience in Service Operations Workspace.

-   A search application configuration, \[AIS\]. For information about search application configurations, see [Search application configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/defining-search-app-cfgs-ais.md). To modify the card layout of the AI Search results, you can modify its EVAM definition, AI Search for Next Experience. Search for and add an EVAM configuration bundle. For information about the EVAM definition, see [Configuring EVAM definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/define-composite-dataset.md).
-   A search profile. For information about search profiles, see [AI search profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/defining-search-profiles-ais.md).

    **Note:**

    -   AI Search for Service Operations Workspace version 1.3 is compatible with the SR - PlatformX - Search - AI Search for Next Experience Bundle - v2.0. For all upgrade scenarios, use the Guided Setup for Zing to AI Search Migration module and ensure that the following conditions are met:

        -   New search sources should be indexed.
        -   The search profile should be published.

        For information about using Guided Setup for Zing to AI Search Migration, see [Configuring AI Search for Next Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configuring-ais-next-experience.md).

    -   Ensure that the search engine is set to AI Search. To set the AI Search, ensure that the **globalSearchDataConfigId** UX page property value is set to the sys\_id of the AI Search, `6fcaa8d770a45110f877edb72a2fbd2f`.
-   Genius results display the most relevant information and actions for a search query using Genius Result cards. The genius result cards appear alongside the regular search results. For more information about genius results, see [Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/genius-results-ais.md).
