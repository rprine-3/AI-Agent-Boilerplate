# Review and update a post incident report

Review a post incident report \(PIR\) using the **Post Incident Report** tab. A PIR helps you review and understand the cause of the major incident and the actions taken by the teams to resolve the incident. This helps prevent the issue in the future.

## Before you begin

The major incident must be in the **Resolved** state. For more information, see [Resolve and close a major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/resolve-close-mim-sow.md).

Role required:

-   For PIR review: sn\_incident\_read or sn\_incident\_write
-   For PIR update, generate and download: major\_incident\_manager, incident\_write \(added as co-contributors\) or admin

## About this task

Reviewing the post incident report \(PIR\) also provides an opportunity to evaluate the incident response process and identify areas for improvement. The PIR can be reviewed and updated during the review process before it's shared with stakeholders.

After you resolve a major incident, you must publish the PIR for the major incident and share it with the stakeholders within a specified time duration as defined in the SLA. You can configure the SLA by specifying the value in hours in the **PIR publish hours** \(**sn\_sow\_inc.pir.publish.hours**\) system property.

**Tip:** For guidelines on customizing the Post Incident Report layout and content, search the [ServiceNow Community](https://community.servicenow.com/community) for `customize post incident review report`.

The following events are captured in the timeline of the PIR:

-   Incident created
-   Incident proposed as major incident
-   Incident accepted as major incident
-   Incident resolved
-   Incident closed
-   Custom events
-   Incident task created
-   Incident task closed
