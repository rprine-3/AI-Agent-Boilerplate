# Configure logged in users metrics

Configure the display of the logged in users metrics for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for Investigation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cimaf.sn\_cimaf\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

2.  Select the required CI device, and verify the CMPivot entities and attributes.

    For more information, see [Verify a CMPivot entity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/verify-cmpivot-entity.md).

3.  Verify that the **LogonSession** CMPivot entity exists and has the attributes **LogonId**, **LogonType**, and **StartTime**.

4.  Verify that the **LoggedOnUser** CMPivot entity exists and has the attributes **Antecedent** and **Dependent**.

    **Note:** If either the **LogonSession** or **LoggedOnUser** CMPivot entities aren’t available, you must add them to the hardware inventory. For more information, see [Extend hardware inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/extend-hardware-entity.md).


## Result

The logged in users metrics is displayed on the **Investigation** tab of the incident record in Service Operations Workspace.
