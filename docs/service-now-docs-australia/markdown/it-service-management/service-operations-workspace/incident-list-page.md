# Configure the list page in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM

Configure the **fuzzyCount** property to modify how the number of records is displayed on the Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) list page. Configuring the **fuzzyCount** property helps improve the system performance.

## About this task

The input of the **fuzzyCount** property is JSON key value pair. The property applies to any new list component used across SOW pages where record count limit input for the component isn't defined.

The **fuzzyCount** property applies to all SOW list including related list and Multi Record Associator \(MRA\) list in the SOW records pages.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** &gt; **Configurations**.

2.  On the SOW Admin Center page, navigate to **Initial setup** &gt; **SOW properties**.

3.  On the SOW properties page, in the **Set display count to improve list loading** tile, select **Configure**.

    The **fuzzyCount** UX property page opens on a separate tab.

    Alternatively, you can also access the **fuzzyCount** UX property page by navigating to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Experiences**. From the list of UX applications, select **Service Operations Workspace** and then from the UX Page Properties related list, select the **fuzzyCount** property.

4.  On the UX Page Property page, edit the **Value** field.

You can also set the count of the records to be displayed for a specific table or record type such as incident.For example, if the incident has 14 records, if you configure the incident value in the property as 10 and default value as 20, the system displays the count of incident records as 10+ and for the non incident list, the count is displayed based on the default value defined in the property which is 20+.
