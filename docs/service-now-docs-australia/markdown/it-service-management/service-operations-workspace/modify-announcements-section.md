# Configure the Announcements section on the landing page

Customize an existing announcement or add an announcement for additional tables.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can customize how the Entity View Action Mapper \(EVAM\) component is configured for the **Announcements** section. While the data can be customized for the default landing page, the visual styling changes can be done only by creating a copy of the landing page. In the base system, announcements and the corresponding data sources are defined for the following tables:

-   Outage \[cmdb\_ci\_outage\]
-   Banner Announcement \[sys\_ux\_banner\_announcement\]
-   Incident \[incident\]

You can add announcements for additional tables by defining additional data sources in the EVAM definition.

2.  On the **Overview** tab, from the **Initial Setup** section, select the **Configure the landing page** option.

3.  On the Landing Page form, under **Tier 1** or **Tier 2** sections, select **Configure** next to the **Announcements** option.

        2.  Select the **sn\_sow.banner\_announcements\_config\_id** property.
        3.  On the System Property form, specify the sys\_id of the banner configuration as the property value.
8.  To configure how an announcement should be displayed for a data source, edit an EVAM view configuration and template by performing these steps.

    1.  Navigate to the EVAM View Config Bundle M2Ms related list and select the required configuration bundle.

    2.  On the EVAM View Config Bundle form, navigate to the EVAM View Configs related list and select a configuration for the required data source.
