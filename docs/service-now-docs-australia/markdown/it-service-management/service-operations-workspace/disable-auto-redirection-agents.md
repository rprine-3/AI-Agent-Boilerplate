# Disable auto-redirection for all agents to Service Operations Workspace

Verify that the agents aren't automatically redirected to Service Operations Workspace after logging in to the ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  From the **All** menu, navigate to sys\_homepage\_destination\_rule.list.

2.  Select the **SOW Landing Page** record.

3.  Clear the **Active** check box.

4.  Select **Update**.

5.  Clear the browser cache by using the following steps:

    1.  Enter `<instance-name>.service-now.com/cache.do` in the web browser.

    2.  Select **Clear Cache**.

        The browser page is refreshed.

    3.  Select **Clear All Browser Caches**.

        The browser page shows the `Unified Cache Cleared` message.

        **Note:**

        If the Homepage Destination Rules \[sys\_homepage\_destination\_rule\] table contains other records that redirect to SOW, use these steps to clear the **Active**  check box for each record.
