# ITSM voice interaction record page

The ITSM voice interaction record page provides a component that customers can use for integration with Contact Center as a Service \(CCaaS\) providers and an interface that agents can use to handle customer phone calls.

\[Omitted image "chat-hidden-ims.png"\] Alt text:

The ITSM voice interaction record page enables CCaaS providers to display native voice integrations in CRM Workspace. Using CCaaS call controls integrated in the page, agents can do the following:

-   Accept calls directly from the agent inbox.
-   Manage call transfers and conferences.
-   Place calls on hold and on mute.

For more information about the integration with CCaaS providers, see the following topics:

-   [OpenFrame configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md)

## Page structure

The ITSM voice interaction record page is made up of two different pages:

-   ITSM voice interaction record page
-   Interaction control page

The pages appear together and are visible to agents for phone interactions when the [OpenFrame configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md) is enabled.

The Interaction control page appears in the left panel and includes the following components:

-   [Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md): Enables CCaaS providers to display native voice integrations.
-   [Customer History component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md): Displays customer, consumer, or account history information, depending on the customer information provided on the interaction record.
-   [Live call transcript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md): Displays the text of the call transcript when a conversation record is present for the interaction.

    **Note:** Live call transcript requires additional configuration.


The CSM voice interaction record page includes the following components:

-   Interaction form
-   [Action bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md)
-   [contextual side panel component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md)

## Plugin

The CSM voice interaction record page template and page variant are included with the CSM Configurable Workspace application \(com.snc.uib.itsm\_agent\_workspace\).

The CSM voice interaction record page template and page variant are available to users when the Interaction Controls Component plugin \(com.app\_interaction\_control\) is installed.

The Interaction Controls Component plugin has the following dependencies:

-   com.app\_openframe\_store
-   com.sn\_component\_workspace\_openframe

## ITSM voice interaction record template

The ITSM voice interaction record template enables customers to create voice interaction record page variants and customize them as needed. This template includes customizable views for different CCaaS providers as well as real-time updates and notifications.

Record pages and page variants created with this template enable agents to manage phone calls with customers and external users and to display information that helps agents to resolve issues. Use this template to customize and extend ITSM functionality around phone interaction management. Additionally, you can configure a CCaaS provider to integrate features such as call transcript.

## ITSM voice interaction record page variant

The ITSM voice interaction record page variant is included with the ITSM Configurable Workspace plugin and has a dependency on the Interaction Controls Component plugin. This page variant is available for users with the interaction controls enabled. For more information, see [OpenFrame configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/itsm-native-voice-record-page.md).

This page variant includes the following settings.

    -   The **Enable interaction controls** field is enabled.
    -   The user belongs to the group selected in the **User Group** field.

 If all of these conditions are met, the system displays the CSM voice interaction record page variant.
