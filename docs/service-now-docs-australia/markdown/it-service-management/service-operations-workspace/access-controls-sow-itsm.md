# Access controls in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM

You can determine which users can access Service Operations Workspace for ITSM after logging in to the ServiceNow instance or access the Service Operations Workspace for ITSM landing page.

For a user, access to Service Operations Workspace for ITSM is based on the following criteria:

-   Is the redirection upon login enabled to the Service Operations Workspace landing page.
-   Does the user have the sn\_sow.sow\_user role to access SOW manually or when redirected upon login.

    **Note:**

    -   The itil role contains the sn\_sow.sow\_user role. But if the user has any custom or granular roles other than itil, then the sn\_sow.sow\_user role should be assigned to the user and the audiences should be updated with custom roles.
    -   Custom roles require updates to ACLs \(access control lists\) that restrict access to certain functionality.
-   First audience that the user belongs to.
