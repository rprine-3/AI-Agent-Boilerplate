# Digital End-User Experience and Service Observability UI experience on investigate tab

Based on the Configuration Item \(CI\) selected in the **Investigate** tab, the user criteria and rules defined in the **Investigate CI Experience Rules** \(**sn\_sow\_investigate\_ci\_ux\_rule**\) table, the Investigate tab displays the CI metrics in different UI experience dashboard for the different CI classes.

The following UI experiences dashboard are supported on the Investigate tab:

-   Default view: The CI metrics are display in default dashboard view on the tab.
-   Digital End-User Experience \(DEX\) view: The CI metrics are displayed in DEX dashboard view on the tab.
-   Service Observability \(SO\) view: The CI metrics are displayed in SO dashboard view on the tab. For more information, see [View overall service health](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/view-overall-service-health.md).

You can navigate to the Investigate **CI Experience Rules** \(**sn\_sow\_investigate\_ci\_ux\_rule**\) table to configure user criteria, CI conditions, and rule order. You may also choose to match CI extensions, including subclasses. These configurations determine which UI experience view appears on the investigate tab when a specific CI class is selected.

You can select the CI from the list of affected CIs or caller CIs associated with the incident record. The caller CIs are the CIs that are assigned to the caller.

The Investigate tab displays SO UI experience dashboard, if the selected CI matches the following conditions:

-   CI is cmdb\_ci\_service class.
-   CI is configured with SO data mapping. For more information, see [Create and manage data mappings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/create-and-manage-observability-data-mappings.md).
-   Matches SO related rule from the **Investigate CI Experience Rules** \(**sn\_sow\_investigate\_ci\_ux\_rule**\) table.

The selected CI is retrieved from the following tables:

-   task\_ci
-   task\_cmdb\_ci\_service
-   task\_service\_offering

The investigate tab displays SO dashboard containing vendor generated metrics from sources such as AWS, Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace and so on that are relevant to the service.

**Note:** The dashboard that appears on the Investigate tab is the same as the **Overview** dashboard in Service Observability. If the service has no data mapping, an empty state is displayed.
