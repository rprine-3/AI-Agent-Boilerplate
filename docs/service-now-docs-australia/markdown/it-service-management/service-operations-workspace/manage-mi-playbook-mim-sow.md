# Manage major incidents using the MI playbook

Manage major incidents using the MI playbook from the contextual side panel or the **Playbook** tab of an incident record page. This playbook provides a simple, concise, and task-oriented interface for managing the major incident process.

## Before you begin

The incident must be proposed as a major incident candidate. For more information, see [Propose a major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/propose-major-incident-sow.md).

The MI playbook must be assigned to Major Incident Management. For more information, see [Assign a playbook to Major Incident Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/assign-playbook-mim-sow.md).

Role required: major\_incident\_manager or admin

2.  Select the **Major Incident Playbooks** \(\[Omitted image "mim-playbook-icon.png"\] Alt text: Major incident playbook\) icon on a contextual side panel to launch the major incident playbook.

    You can also configure if the incident field information is copied automatically to the respective fields in a problem record using the **List of attributes \(comma-separated\) that will be copied from the incident to create a new problem** \(**com.snc.problem.create\_from\_incident.attributes**\) system property when a problem record is created.
