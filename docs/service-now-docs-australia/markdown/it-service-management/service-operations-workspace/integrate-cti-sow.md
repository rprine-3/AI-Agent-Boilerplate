# Enable Computer Telephony Integration providers to interact with the Service Operations Workspace

Enable an agent \(with the sn\_openframe\_user role\) to receive inbound calls and place outbound calls using the Computer Telephony Integration \(CTI\) interface.

## Before you begin

Enable the following plugins.

-   com.snc.notify
-   com.snc.cti
-   com.sn\_openframe

For more information about installing and enabling a plugin, see [Activate a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The CTI integration helps an agent call a user using the phone number in the user profile and contact cards. The ServiceNow application uses the OpenFrame API when an agent initiates a call. The OpenFrame API helps the ServiceNow AI Platform® communicate with the connectors, such as an Amazon connector, already configured in the application.

For more information about CTI integration, see [Integrating with Computer Telephony Integration \(CTI\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/cti-csm-integration.md).

For more information on the various OpenFrame APIs, see [openFrameAPI - Client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/c_openFrameAPI.md).

## Procedure

1.  From the **All** &gt; **sys\_properties.list**.

2.  Open the **sn\_sow.default\_call\_from\_contact\_page** property.

3.  In the **Value** field, specify `CTI`.

4.  Select **Update**.
