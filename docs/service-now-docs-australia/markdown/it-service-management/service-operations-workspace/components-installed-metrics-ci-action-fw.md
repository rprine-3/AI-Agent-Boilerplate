</table>**Note:** Deny unless ACLs are added to all the tables. The Deny unless ACLs restrict access for a non-authenticated user, such as a public role user. Without access, the user can't perform any actions on the tables related to the mentioned applications, such as reading, writing, deleting, creating, or accessing the report view.
