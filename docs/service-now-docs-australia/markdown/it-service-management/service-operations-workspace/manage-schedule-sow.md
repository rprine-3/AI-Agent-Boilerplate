# Manage your schedule using the Service Operations Workspace

Look up your schedule, create an event of custom event type, request time off for an on-call or work shift, or swap your shift with your peers using the calendar in Service Operations Workspace.

## Before you begin

-   If your system administrator has enabled the **sn\_uib\_agent\_sp.allow\_agent\_edit\_break** system property, you can edit the start and end time of your break time in a shift span.
-   If your system administrator has enabled the **sn\_uib\_agent\_sp.allow\_agent\_add\_remove\_break** system property, you can add or remove your break time in a shift span.

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.agent

## About this task

If you can work during the requested shift, you can also approve your peer's request for shift swap. When you request time off for an on-call shift, you can also propose an agent to cover the shift. You can also filter agents in the team calendar based on team member, location, skills, shift plan or events.

You can:

-   Swap shifts with agents that are within your assignment group.
-   Add attendees to the meeting or training event types.
-   Edit or delete meeting or training event types that you have created.
-   Edit or delete work event types if you're the logged-in user and if the event has been assigned to you.

**Note:**

-   If the agent's calendar in Workforce Optimization for ITSM is integrated with their Microsoft Outlook calendar, they can view their shifts, schedules, and events such as meetings, trainings, and time-off in your Microsoft Outlook calendar. For more information, see [Synchronize agent calendar in Workforce Optimization for ITSM with the Microsoft Outlook calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/workforce-optimization-for-it-service-management/synchronize-microsoft-outlook-wfo-itsm.md).
-   When you create an event of types meeting or training, the logged-in user will always be part of the attendees list and cannot be removed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  Click the Schedule icon.

    Access the schedule:

    -   View your schedule by clicking the **My Calendar** tab. Then, use the list \[Omitted image "lists\_icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon to select the schedule that you want to view by day, week, or month.
    -   View another agent's schedule by clicking the **Team Calendar** tab. Then, click an agent's schedule to see that agent's work and break times.
    **Note:** You can view the schedule for the primary assignment group and the on-call group you’re part of.

3.  Create an event of custom event type.

    You can create, edit, or delete events of custom event types that your system administrator has enabled for agent access.

    1.  Click **New** and select the name of the custom event type.
    2.  In the custom event type form, fill in the fields as required.
    3.  Click **Save**.
    To edit the event, select the event, and then the edit icon \(\[Omitted image "edit-icon.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon\) to make the necessary changes and save the event. To delete it, select the delete icon.
