# Create credential store for Password Reset in Service Operations Workspace

Create a password reset credential store record to configure access to your credential store server while a user is changing or resetting a password.

## About this task

In addition to host connection information, you can specify the password hints that users should see, restrictions on password reuse, the allowed number of failed reset attempts, and other settings.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** &gt; **Overview**.

2.  On the **Admin Center** page, do one of the following:

    -   In the **Overview** tab, select the **Configure** button in the **Service Desk Assisted Password Reset** card.
    -   In the **Configurations** tab, select **Service Desk Assisted Password Reset** card.
3.  On the **Credential stores** card, select **Configure**.

    The default credential store is displayed.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Type

</td><td>

Type of credential store that you are connecting to. A ServiceNow credential store type is a template that provides the required set of capabilities for a particular kind of credential store.Credential stores inherit the functionality of the credential store type.

Script include that generates a temporary password for use during the reset process.If you select the **Enforce history policy** check box, then you must specify a value for **Auto-generate password** that is compliant with the password policy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Child Alias

</td><td>

Child aliases are associated with the base alias. After creating a connection and credential alias, you can create a child alias to configure multiple connections for a password reset credential store.When a password reset request is made, the flow checks whether there are child alias connections at the process level. If the child alias is configured at the credential store level, the flow picks the aliases connections and proceeds with the request.

2.  In the **Password Reset Credential Store Parameters** related list, create a **password\_history\_limit**parameter.
