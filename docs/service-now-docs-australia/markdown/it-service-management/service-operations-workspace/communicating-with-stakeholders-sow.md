# Communicating with stakeholders about incidents and major incidents in SOW

Use the **Communicate** tab to create and manage all communications with stakeholders during the various phases of an incident or a major incident.

The **Communicate** tab contains the following options to create and manage communications:

-   **Group By**

    Group communication tasks the following ways:

    -   Communication plan – The communication tasks that are associated with a particular communication plan are grouped.
    -   Completion status - The communication tasks are grouped based on the completion status and due dates. You can choose to list the tasks from the following group sections:
        -   Overdue – Communication tasks with past due dates.
        -   Upcoming – Communications tasks with an upcoming due date.
        -   Completed – Communication tasks that are completed.
        -   Skipped – Communication tasks that are skipped.
-   **Filter by communication plan**

    Filter the communication task by a communication plan.

-   **Compose**

    Compose a communication message, such as an email, DEX Desktop Assistant, SMS, Microsoft Teams, or Slack message. For more information on DEX Desktop Assistant, see [Use DEX Desktop Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/use-dex-desktop-exp.md).

    **Note:**

    DEX Desktop Assistant is supported as a channel in Major Incident Management in SOW only if the following conditions are met:

    -   SOW must be version 7.0 or later.
    -   The instance must be on Yokohama release or later.
    -   DEX must be version 2.5.0 or later.
-   **Manage recipients**

    Add and manage recipients for a communications task. You can add a user role and a user in the recipient list. You can also access this option by selecting the **More actions** \(\[Omitted image "mim-more-action-icon.png"\] Alt text: More action icon\) icon on the communication task and then selecting **Manage recipients**.

-   **New Communication**

    Create a communication task. This option is available only to the following users:

    -   User with the major\_incident\_manager role
    -   User with both the ia\_admin and itil roles
-   **Manage announcements**

    Create and manage an announcement to broadcast messages for Service Portal users to keep them informed about the ongoing major incident.

-   **View Record**

    View detailed information about the incident communication task \(ICT\) record. Select the **More actions** \(\[Omitted image "mim-more-action-icon.png"\] Alt text: More action icon\) icon on the communication task and then select **View record**.

    From the ICT record, you can do the following actions:

    -   Initiate a call or chat from the collaborate tab on the side panel using the **Collaborate** \(\[Omitted image "mim-collaborate-icon.png"\] Alt text: Collaborate icon\) icon on the contextual side panel. For more information, see [Collaborate with stakeholders during a major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/collaborate-stakeholders-mim-sow.md).
    -   Add collaboration channels from the Communication Channel related list of the **Related records** tab.
    -   Add communication channels such as DEX Desktop Assistant from the Communication Channel related list of the **Related records** tab.
-   **Close**

    Close the communication task. Select the **More actions** \(\[Omitted image "mim-more-action-icon.png"\] Alt text: More action icon\) icon on the communication task and then select **Close**. The communication task is then moved to either the Completed or Skipped section of the **Communicate** tab based on the following scenarios:

    -   If a communication task has the **Frequency** field set to **Recurring** and at least one communication has been composed and sent, selecting **Close** moves the communication task to the Completed section.
    -   If a communication task has the **Frequency** field set to **One time** or **Recurring** and no communication has been composed and sent, selecting **Close** moves the communication task to the Skipped section.
-   **Start**

    Start the communication task with the **Pending** status. Select the **More actions** \(\[Omitted image "mim-more-action-icon.png"\] Alt text: More action icon\) icon on the communication task and then select **Start**.

-   **Snooze**

    Increase the **Due in** time for a communication task. Select the **More actions** \(\[Omitted image "mim-more-action-icon.png"\] Alt text: More action icon\) icon on the communication task and then select **Snooze**.
