\[Omitted image "sow-incident-tabs-header-new.gif"\] Alt text: Tabs of an incident record

## Overview tab

This tab displays the following information about an incident:

-   Summary
-   Impact
-   Cause
-   Resolution

From the Compose section, you can add comments and work notes for the incident.

The Overview tab displays the field information along with the field labels, including when you're in read mode.

For more information on the fields displayed on the **Overview** tab, see [View and update incident information on the Overview tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/view-update-inc-overview-tab.md).

You can customize the display of the information on the **Overview** tab. For more information, see [Customize the Overview tab for an incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/customize-the-incident-record-page.md).

## Investigation tab

This tab enables you to investigate any affected CIs with the ci\_computer or ci\_server class associated with the incidents. The tab displays the metrics information of the associated primary CI or any affected CI that is selected, which helps you to analyze and resolve the issue. You can use the various remedial actions on this tab to resolve the CI-related issues.

By default, the tab displays metrics information of the primary affected CI associated with the incident. But you can also select and view the information for any affected CI with the ci\_computer or ci\_server class that is associated with the incident. For information about how you can set up Investigation Framework, see [Setting up Investigation Framework in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/set-up-investigate.md).

**Note:**

-   The tab is visible only if the Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager \(MECM\) adapters are installed and configured.
-   The tab displays the metrics information for the CI only in the following conditions:
    -   Agent Client Collector or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager \(MECM\) is installed for the associated CI. This helps to retrieve the metrics data for the CI.
    -   The associated CI class is a CMDB CI computer.
-   This feature supports only the macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems.

You can also customize the display of the metrics information on this tab. For more information, see [Customize the Investigate tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/customize-the-incident-record-page.md).

For more information on the metrics displayed on this tab, see [Features of the Investigation tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/features-of-investigation-tab.md).

## Communicate tab

This tab displays all the communication tasks and options that enable you to communicate with the stakeholders in the various phases of an incident. This tab is available only if any of the following conditions are met:

-   For a major incident - The Major Incident Management \(sn-sow-mim\) plugin is active and configured in Admin Center, for Service Operations Workspace. For more information, see [Setting up Major Incident Management in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/setup-mim-sow.md).
-   For Incident – The Task Communications Management and Incident Communications Management applications are installed, active, and configured in the instance and you select the **New Communication** option from the **More Actions** \(\[Omitted image "mim-more-actions-top-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\) icon of the Incident record page. For more information, see [Task Communications Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/tcm-landing-page.md) and [Incident Communications Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-communications-management/c_IncidentAlertManagement.md).

## Post incident report tab

This tab enables you to generate, configure, publish, and export a post incident report for a major incident after it's resolved. The post incident report enables you to review the cause and resolution of the major incident and also identify potential process gaps. Based on this information, you can take preventive measures to avoid the issue in the future or to handle the major incident in a better way. This tab is available only if the following conditions are met:

-   Major Incident Management is active and configured in Admin Center for Service Operations Workspace. For more information, see [Setting up Major Incident Management in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/setup-mim-sow.md).
-   The major incident is in the **Resolved** state.

For more information on the features of the **Post incident report** tab, see [Review and update a post incident report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/review-update-pir-mim-sow.md).
