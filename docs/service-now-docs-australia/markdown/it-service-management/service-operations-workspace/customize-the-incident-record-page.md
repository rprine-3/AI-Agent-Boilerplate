## Customize the Overview tab for an incident

Modify the **Overview** tab of an incident record page to display the summary and other information of the incident for an agent.

### Before you begin

The demo data should be installed.

Role required: workspace\_admin, ui\_builder\_admin, or admin

### About this task

You can customize which fields are displayed on the various sections, such as Summary, Cause, and Resolution, in the **Overview** tab. Customize the fields by configuring the **SOW-Incident-Overview** view on the Incident form using the form layout or form design feature in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

**Note:** You must only configure the fields on the **SOW-Incident-Overview** view that are also available on the **Service Operation Workspace** view on the Incident form in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

For advanced customization of the **Overview** tab with SRP record, use the following procedure.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  From the Experiences list, select **Service Operations Workspace**.

3.  In the Pages and Variants section under **Record**, select **SRP Record**.

    **Note:** If you're on a version prior to 4.0, you must navigate from **Record SNC** in UI Builder to customize the **Overview** tab of an Incident record page.

4.  Under **Contents** in the **Body** level, select **Main Tab**.

    \[Omitted image "SRP\_Main\_tab\_SOW\_edit.png"\] Alt text: Callout for the location of the Main Tab option in SRP record.

6.  Under **Overview**, point to the **Incident Overview SNC** variant and select the options icon \(\[Omitted image "options-variant.png"\] Alt text: Options icon.\).

7.  **Note:** Before you customize the **Overview** tab, duplicate the Service Record Page \(SRP\) variant. If a scoped application is active, the original SRP is read-only. To duplicate the variant, go to the **Tabs** menu and select **Page Collections,** and then select **Duplicate** on the relevant variant record.

8.  Before making any changes, duplicate the SRP variant by performing the following steps:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Page Collections.**

    2.  Select **Duplicate** on the incident record page variant.

        Working on a duplicate allows you to make changes safely while the original SRP remains unchanged. You can use it as a backup if required.

9.  Select the duplicate variant icon \(\[Omitted image "duplicate-variant.png"\] Alt text: Duplicate variant icon.\).

    The Variant creation page is displayed.

10. Enter the Name as `Incident Overview SNC Copy`.

    3.  Select **Open records**, then select **Variant record**.

        The Incident Overview SNC record is displayed.

    4.  Edit the record, copy, and store the information from the **Screen Condition** field, then remove the information.

        You use the information from the **Screen Condition** field in the later steps.

    5.  Select **Save** and close the record.

    6.  Repeat steps 6 through 9.

        No error is displayed for the **Conditions** field.

    7.  Open the Incident Overview SNC record again.

    8.  Edit the record and paste the **Screen Condition** information copied previously.

    9.  Select **Save** and close the record.

12. On the Variant creation page, select the **Settings** tab.

    If the new copy is in a different application scope, select **Edit in original scope** before you start editing.

13. Edit the **Order** value to modify the display order of the variants,

    The variant with the lowest number is the default configuration.

14. Add the criteria to display a page or tab in **Variant conditions**.

15. Select **Save**.

16. Select the **Editor** tab to start editing the page components for customizing the **Overview** tab.

    1.  Select the **Body** level of the **Content** tree next to the main page area of UI Builder.
