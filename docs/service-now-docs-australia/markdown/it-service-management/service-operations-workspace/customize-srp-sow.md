# Add declarative actions on the standard record page

Add declarative actions on the Incident page and its tabs Service Operations Workspace using the Standard Record Page \(SRP\) to customize list actions, related list actions, and field decorators.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use this procedure to customize UX Add-on Event Mappings for the incident form. To view or update an existing incident, see [View and update incident information on the Overview tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/view-update-inc-overview-tab.md). For more information about creating declarative actions and how to use them, see [Declarative actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/migration-form-declarative-actions.md).

Along with the declarative actions customizations, the SRP or Standard Record Page also modifies the add-on events in the Incident records and the tabs inside the records.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_ux\_addon\_event\_mapping.list**.

2.  From the UX Add-on Event Mappings list, go to the required event mapping.

    You can add two types of declarative actions mappings.

    -   Declarative action mappings without using the parent macroponent. This option uses the controllers for the mappings.
    -   Declarative action mapping using the source element ID and the parent macroponent. This option doesn’t use the controllers.
    For example, to modify the form declarative action to create a change, go to the **Form Create Change task** for which the **Parent Macroponent** is empty. Similarly, you can add the declarative action for inline tabs inside an incident. For example, to add a declarative action to add a change request to the Related Records list, go to **SOW Related list Add Change Request** for which the **Parent Macroponent** is empty.

    **Note:** To add declarative action to page collection tabs such as Overview, add Handled events in the UI Builder. Map this event to the event in the UX Add-on Event Mappings list using the Source element ID.

3.  Add the following information to modify the action.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Source Component|The component emits the source event. For example, the Action bar.|
    |Source Declarative Action|Declarative actions used as the source event|
    |Controller|A controller that handles the target event. For example, Form.|
    |Target Event|Handled event that the mapping in **Target Payload mapping** targets|
    |Target Payload Mapping|The binding of the container and the type of the event|
