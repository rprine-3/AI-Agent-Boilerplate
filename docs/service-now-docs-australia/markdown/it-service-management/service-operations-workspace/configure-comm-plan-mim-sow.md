# Configure a communication plan in Major Incident Management

Configure a communication plan and tasks for effective communication with various stakeholders about the progress, milestones, and issues related to the different stages of a major incident record.

## Before you begin

The Major Incident Management plugin must be activated in Service Operations Workspace. For more information, see [Activate Major Incident Management in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/install-mim-sow.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** &gt; **Configurations**.

2.  On the Admin Center page, navigate to the configuration page for Major Incident Management through either the **Overview** tab or the **Configurations** tab.

    -   In the **Overview** tab, select **Configure** for Major Incident Management.
    -   In the **Configurations** tab, select **Major Incident Management**.
    The configuration page displays all configurable features in Major Incident Management. In the Communication Plan subsection of the Communications section, you can view the number of configured communication plans and active communication plans.

    -   **Delete**: Deletes the selected communications plan.
    -   **Deactivate**: Deactivates the selected active communications plan.
    -   **Copy**: Copies the communications plans along with the task information. This option helps when creating a communications plan using the data of an existing communication plan.
    In case if no communication plans exist, the **Create a communication plan** option is displayed.

4.  Select **New** to create a communication plan definition.
