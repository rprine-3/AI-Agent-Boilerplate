# Migrate the client action from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace for field decorators actions

Configure the client actions to migrate field decorators actions from ITSM Agent Workspace to Service Operations Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Declarative Actions** &gt; **Field Decorators**.

2.  Filter the records based for **Implemented As** is set as **Client action**.

3.  View the log in the failed record in the migration process and find the **sys\_Id** of the record from the list of **Related List Actions**.

4.  Select the failed record with the corresponding sys\_id.

5.  Right-click on the header, and select **Insert and Stay**.

6.  Clear the **Workspace** and **View** fields.

7.  Select the **Experience Restricted** check box.

8.  Update the value in the **Implemented as** field as `UXF Client Action`.

9.  In the **Action configuration** related list, select **Edit**, and then select **SOW Actions** from **Collection** to **Action configurations** list.

10. Select **Save** to save the **Action configurations** related list.

11. Select **Update**.

12. If specify client action key is **ITEM\_SELECTED** or **PREVIEW\_RECORD**, create CREATE\_NEW\_RECORD key with the payload mentioned below in the code block in the sys\_declarative\_action\_payload\_definition table.

    This step is performed only once.

    ```
    { 
    
                "route": "record", 
    
                "fields": { 
    
                    "table": "{{table}}", 
    
                    "sysId": "-1" 
    
                }, 
    
                "params": { 
    
                    "query": "{{query}}", 
    
                    "parentTable": "{{parentTable}}", 
    
                    "parentRecordSysId": "{{parentRecordSysId}}" 
    
                }, 
    
                "parent_table": "{{parentTable}}", 
    
                "additional_data": { 
    
                    "query": "{{query}}" 
    
                } 
    
            } 
    ```

13. Modify the client action created for **ITEM\_SELECTED** and **PREVIEW\_RECORD** declarative actions records.

    When you modify the client action, then the payload Map in action Attributes should be transformed based on the payload.

    The following tables are used in the migration process:

    -   sys\_ux\_m2m\_action\_assignment\_action\_config
    -   sys\_declarative\_action\_payload\_definition
    **Note:** The **ITEM\_SELECTED** and **PREVIEW\_RECORD** actions function in the ITSM Agent Workspace but not in SOW. Therefore, a new action payload named "CREATE\_NEW\_RECORD" Is introduced in SOW. While there could be other action payloads that might not function properly, the base system client actions for List continue to work effectively in SOW post-migration.
