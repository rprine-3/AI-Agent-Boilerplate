# Recommendation rules for an incident in Service Operations Workspace

Recommendations for an incident are based on rules defined in Recommendation Framework.

Recommendation Framework is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. Recommended Actions for ITSM feature provides the latest experience for this functionality. To get the advanced version, you must install the Advanced Recommended actions for ITSM \(com.snc.uib.sow\_itsm\_ra\_advanced\) plugin and you must procure ITSM Pro package subscription.

**Note:** The best practice to get the advanced version is to install the Task Intelligence for ITSM \(com.snc.itsm\_ml\_task\) plugin and procure the ITSM Pro package subscription. For more information, see [Exploring Recommended Actions for ITSM in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/exploring-recommended-actions-for-itsm-in-service-operations-workspace.md).

For each recommendation rule to work, install the relevant plugin that installs the corresponding solution definition. Based on this solution definition, the recommendation rule predicts values or records for an incident.

For information about the plugins and the corresponding solution definitions, see .
