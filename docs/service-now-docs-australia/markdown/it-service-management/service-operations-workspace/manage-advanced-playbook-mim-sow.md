# Manage major incidents using the Advanced MI playbook

Manage a major incident using the Advanced MI playbook that's available on the contextual side panel or the **Playbook** tab of an incident record page. This playbook provides a similar interface to the MI playbook but has advanced, configurable capabilities for communication and collaboration steps.

## Before you begin

The incident must be proposed as a major incident candidate. For more information, see [Propose a major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/propose-major-incident-sow.md).

The Advanced MI playbook must be assigned to Major Incident Management. For more information, see [Assign a playbook to Major Incident Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/assign-playbook-mim-sow.md).

Role required: major\_incident\_manager or admin

## About this task

The Advanced MI playbook in Service Operations Workspace provides a guided approach to the entire major incident process. It provides a way to visualize business process workflows for major incidents in a simple, concise, and task-oriented view interface.

## Procedure

1.  Open an incident record that has been proposed as a major incident candidate.

2.  Select the **Major Incident Playbooks** \(\[Omitted image "mim-playbook-icon.png"\] Alt text: Major incident playbook\) icon on a contextual side panel to launch the major incident playbook.

    The Major Incident Playbook panel opens on the side panel. The panel includes the following tabs:

    -   Current
    -   History
3.  On the **Current** tab, select **Advanced MI playbook**.

    You can view the major incident process steps and your progress along the following steps:

    -   Review Situation
    -   Adhoc Communications &amp; Collaborations
    -   Resolve
    -   Create problem
    -   Post Incident Review

4.  Review the incident information and then promote the major incident.

    1.  Select **Review Situation**.

    2.  Review the incident information.

    3.  Select **Promote** to promote the incident to a major incident based on the incident information.

            -   Collaboration – All the collaboration records that you create using the Incident Communications plan related list from the **Related record**s tab are displayed in this section.

    2.  Select the one of the following options for unplanned communications and collaboration.

        -   For adhoc communications, you can do the following actions:
            -   Select **Compose** to compose a communication message, such as email or SMS. For more information, see [Compose communications for incidents and major incidents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/compose-communication-mim-sow.md).
            -   Select the **More actions** \(\[Omitted image "mim-more-action-icon.png"\] Alt text: More action icon\) icon for a communication task and then select **Manage Recipients** to add or manage the recipient lists for the communication task.

        -   For adhoc collaboration, you can do the following actions:
            -   Start a call - Select **Start** on a collaboration record to start a call with the stakeholders. For more information, see [Collaborate with stakeholders during a major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/collaborate-stakeholders-mim-sow.md).
            -   Start a chat – Select **Open discussion** to start a chat. For more information, see [Collaborate with stakeholders during a major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/collaborate-stakeholders-mim-sow.md).
6.  Select **Resolve**.

    For information on how to resolve a major incident, see, [Resolve and close a major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/resolve-close-mim-sow.md).

7.  Select **Create Problem**.

    **Note:** This section is visible in the playbook only if:

    -   The incident doesn’t have a problem record associated with it.
    -   The Problem Management Best Practice - Madrid - State Model \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\) plugin is activated on the instance.
    -   The **Create problem from major incident** flow is inactive on the instance. This flow is shipped as part of the base system in the **Inactive** status. Once activated, it creates a problem record automatically when an incident is promoted to a major incident.
    You can also configure if the incident field information is copied automatically to the respective fields in a problem record using the **List of attributes \(comma-separated\) that will be copied from the incident to create a new problem** \(**com.snc.problem.create\_from\_incident.attributes**\) system property when a problem record is created. For more information, see [Create a problem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/problem-management/create-a-problem-v2.md).

    A problem record is created automatically. You can select **View Problem** to view the problem record on a separate tab.

8.  Mark the post incident review as complete.

    1.  Select **Post Incident Review**.

    2.  Select **Mark Complete** to end the major incident process in the **Playbook** side panel.

        You can then continue work on the post incident report review from the **Post Incident Report** tab on the Incident record page. For more information, see [Review and update a post incident report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/review-update-pir-mim-sow.md).
