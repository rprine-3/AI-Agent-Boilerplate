# Types of landing pages in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM

Landing pages provide an agent with quick visibility into the work assigned, announcements, upcoming tasks, and so on.

Following landing pages are available by default for the Service Operations Workspace ITSM Applications \(sn\_sow\_itsm\_cont\) application.

-   Tier 1 landing page
-   Tier 2 landing page

Other landing pages are available if you have the corresponding plugins installed, for example, Service Operations Workspace ITOM Apps \(sn\_sow\_itom\_cont\).

**Important:**

-   A user's access to the landing page is based on the audience associated with that page. Configure the audiences with the required service desk groups and the users that are part of these service desk groups can then access the landing page. For information about audiences, see [Learn about audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/add-audiences.md).
-   When multiple audiences are available for the landing page, the audience with the least order is considered.
