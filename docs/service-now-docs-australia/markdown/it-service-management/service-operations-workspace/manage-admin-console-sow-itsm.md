# Manage configurations in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM

From a single page, quickly access and manage the customizations in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) for ITSM, access additional plugins that extend the Service Operations Workspace for ITSM capabilities, and access ServiceNow help.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sow\_itsm\_admin.sow\_admin\_user, admin, change\_manager

## About this task

The Admin Center consists of the following tabs:

-   **Overview**: Provides access to all customizations available in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM.
-   **Configurations**: Provides access to page-related customizations available in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM. For example, the landing page, incident record page, and modern change management page.
-   **Learning**: Provides access to learning resources to assist the admins in gaining a deeper understanding of SOW configuration. These resources are designed to provide users with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively configure and manage ITSM.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace Admin Center** &gt; **Overview**.

2.  If not already installed, from the **Configure ITSM Core** section, install applications such as Incident Management.

3.  Select any of the following options.

</td><td>

1.  On the **Overview** tab, from the **Initial setup** section, select the **Configure** option.
2.  Select **SOW Properties** and then configure any of the following options:
    -   Email notification redirection to SOW: Configure the email notifications to redirect the users to the Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) view instead of Classic UI16. For more information, see [Email notification redirection for incident and major incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/email-notif-redirt-inci-major-inci.md).
    -   Set display count to improve list loading: Configure the fuzzyCount property to modify how the number of records is displayed on the Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) list page. Configuring the fuzzyCount property helps improve the system performance. For more information, see [Configure the list page in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/incident-list-page.md).
    -   Reference field auto-load behavior: Use the option to configure the **Reference search on click ** \(**ref\_search\_on\_click**\) UX page property. When the property is set to false, selecting empty reference fields such as Configuration item, Service offering, and Service or when user starts typing input on the reference fields displays only the recent selection values instead of automatic searching and displaying the results of all the field values available in the system.
    -   Hide contextual side panel for specific table and tab combinations: Allows admins to define specific table and tab pairs in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) where the page default contextual side panel is hidden, prioritizing the embedded contextual side panel within the tab content instead. For more information, see [Hide contextual side panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/hide-contextual-side-panel-sow.md).
