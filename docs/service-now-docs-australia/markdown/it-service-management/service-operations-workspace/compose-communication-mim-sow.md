# Compose communications for incidents and major incidents

Compose communication messages for incidents and major incidents using communication channels such as email and SMS.

## About this task

The **Communicate** tab displays the list of communication tasks with various options that are used to maintain communications with the stakeholders for an incident. For each communication task, you can view the following information:

-   Communication plan - Name of the communication plan.
-   Communication task – Name of the communication task.
-   Status – Status of the communication task.
-   Channels – Communication channel of the task, such as DEX Desktop Assistant, email or SMS.
-   Past due – Time duration since the due date has passed. This information is applicable for communication tasks that have a past due date in the overdue section.
-   Due in – Duration of time left until the due date.

## Before you begin

You must configure the communication plans and tasks in one of the following ways:

-   For major incidents, you must configure communication plans and tasks for Major Incident Management in Admin Center. For more information, see [Configure a communication plan in Major Incident Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/configure-comm-plan-mim-sow.md).
-   For incidents, you must activate and then configure communication plans and tasks in Task Communications Management. For more information, see [Task Communications Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/tcm-landing-page.md).

Role required: major\_incident\_manager, ia\_admin, itil, or admin

## Procedure

    The **Communicate** tab displays the list of communication tasks based on the communications configured for major incidents or incidents.

2.  Select the communication task where you want to compose the communication message.

    **Note:** Select the communication task based on the due dates to avoid breaching of any due date for communications. For example, communication tasks from the Overdue section.

        -   SMS
        -   SMS notification
        -   Sidebar discussion
        -   Microsoft Teams notification
        -   Slack
        -   Slack notifications
    -   For major incident SMS communications, you can select or change the SMS templates with any of the following user roles:
        -   major\_incident\_manager
        -   sn\_incident\_write user who has the required communication related roles
        -   ITIL user to whom the major incident is assigned

    **Note:**

    -   Depending on the channel selected on the communication task, options such as email or SMS are displayed.
    -   SMS communication is sent to the recipient only if the recipient has a phone number linked to the recipient record.
    -   For all supported channels such as email, SMS, or DEX Desktop Assistant, Major Incident Management allows notification to be sent to all users \(employees\) in the affected locations. You can use the demo recipient list available in the base system as part of the installed demo data installed. The affected locations list can be accessed from the Affected locations related list in the **Related records** tab of a major incident record.
