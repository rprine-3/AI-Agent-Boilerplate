# Configure the experts On-call panel for an incident

Configure the **Experts on-call** panel for an incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

To configure the Experts On-call panel, ensure that you have added an implementation for the **sn\_sow\_on\_call.ExpertsOnCallTabConfig** extension point.

-   Incident table extension point implementation is added by default. To customize it, edit the script to include **ExpertsOnCallTabConfigForIncident**.
