You can customize the JSON value to provide a variety of options. For example, use this method to create a knowledge article directly from the new tab menu. For more information about knowledge article creation, go to [Knowledge Management in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/knowledge-articles-sow.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Experiences**.

2.  From the list of UX applications, select **Service Operations Workspace**.

3.  On the UX Application form, from the UX Page Properties related list, select the **chrome\_tab** property.

4.  On the UX Page Property page, when the **Type** field is set to **json**, edit the **Value** field, for example, to add or delete routes or tables.

    To add a new option, for example, to create a knowledge article, add a new JSON object inside the **newTabMenu** object. Provide the name and the action performed when you select the option as a key-value pair inside the **newTabMenu** object. Following is an example for creating a problem.

    ```
    "label": { 
    
    "translatable": true, 
    
    "message": "New Problem" 
    
    }, 
    
    "routeInfo": { 
    
    "route": "record", 
    
    "fields": { 
    
    "table": "problem", 
    
    "sysId": "-1" 
    
    }, 
    
    "multiInstField": "sysId" 
    
    }, 
    
    "condition": { 
    
    "tableDescription": { 
    
    "table": "problem", 
    
    "canCreate": true 
    
    } 
    
    } 
    
    }, 
    ```

5.  Click **Update**.
