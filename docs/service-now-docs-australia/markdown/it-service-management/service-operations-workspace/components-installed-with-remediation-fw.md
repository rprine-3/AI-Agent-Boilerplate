</table>**Note:** Deny unless ACLs are added to all the tables. The Deny unless ACLs restrict access for a non-authenticated user, such as a public role user. Without access, the user can't perform any actions on the tables related to the mentioned applications, such as reading, writing, deleting, creating, or accessing the report view. For more information on Deny-Unless ACLs and enhanced security model adoption features, see [Deny-Unless ACL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/acl-denial-behavior.md) and [Features of enhanced security model adoption for incident tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/comp-instal-itsm-enhanced-sec-features.md).
