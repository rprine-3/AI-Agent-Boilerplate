# Configure processes metrics

Configure the top processes by CPU and top processes by memory metrics for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for Investigation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cimaf.sn\_cimaf\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

2.  Create a MECM script with the name `GetProcess`.

    For more information, see [Create a script in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/create-mecm-script.md).

3.  Provide the following code in the script block.

    ```
    Param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
    [string]$orderBy,
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
    [string]$top
    )
    
    $processes = get-process
    
    $Total = 0;
    ForEach ($process in $processes) {
        $Total += $process.cpu;
    }
    
    $processes | Sort-Object $orderBy -Descending | select processname,id,ws,cpu -First $top | select processname,id, @{l="mem"; e={$_.ws}}, @{l="cpu"; e={($_.cpu / $Total) * 100}};
    
    ```

4.  Retrieve and copy the script GUID.

5.  Open the MECM Adapter Configuration \[sn\_mecm\_adapter\_config\] table.

    The MECM Adapter Configuration table displays the list of adapter configurations.

6.  From the list of configurations, select and edit **Running processes - CPU%**.

7.  In the **Action input** field, add the script GUID.

    \[Omitted image "edit-cpu-config.png"\] Alt text: Edit running processes CPU

8.  Click **Save**.

9.  From the list of configurations, select and edit **Running processes - MEM**.

10. In the **Action input** field, add the script GUID.

11. Click **Save**.


## Result

The top processes by CPU and top processes by memory metrics are displayed on the **Investigation** tab of the incident record in Service Operations Workspace.
