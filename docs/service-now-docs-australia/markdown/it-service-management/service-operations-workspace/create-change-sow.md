<table id="table_v3g_jqy_2wb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Configuration item

</td><td>

Configuration item \(CI\) that the change applies to. You can associate any type of CI with a change request, including service offerings. It also provides detailed access to SLA and availability requirements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service offering

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service

</td><td>

The business service that you want to make available for the change request.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

The category of the change, for example, **Hardware**,  **Network**, **Software**, **Other**, **DevOps**, and so on.**Note:** The section to **Add DevOps data** \(step 8 in this procedure\) is enabled only when the category is selected as **DevOps**. For DevOps models, the category is automatically set to DevOps.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Affected CIs

</td><td>

Associate CIs with a single change request.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Propose mass CI update

</td><td>

Apply the same update to a set of CIs for a specific CI class.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Propose single change

</td><td>

Propose a change to one CI from your list of affected CIs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Refresh impact services

</td><td>

When you refresh impacted services, the Impacted Services/CIs, Business Applications, and Service Offerings related lists get updated based on the affected CIs. The records in each of the related list are unique even though the impact can be from a single affected CI.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

Group assigned to the change.You can populate the **Assignment group** field automatically based on the support group available for the respective configuration item \(CI\). If the CI does not have any change group, then the field gets populated with the change group available for service offerings. The business rule **Populate Assignment Group based on CI/SO** triggers the functionality when an incident, problem, or change request is created or updated and when the **Assignment group** and the **Assigned to** field is empty. The following properties identify the field whose value populates the **Assignment group** field:

-   **com.snc.change\_request.ci\_assignment\_group.field\_name**: This change property identifies which CI field populates the **Assignment group** field.
-   **com.snc.change\_request.service\_offering\_assignment\_group.field\_name**: This change property identifies which service offering field populates the **Assignment group** field.
**Note:** The default value for the properties is support group for incident or problem and change group for change request respectively. The business rule **Populate Assignment Group based on CI/SO** is shipped as part of the development plugin ITSM CSDM Best Practice – Quebec plugin \(com.snc.best\_practice.itsm\_csdm.quebec\) and is available only for the new customers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assigned to

</td><td>

User assigned to the change request. If an assignment rule applies, the change is automatically assigned to the appropriate user or group.
