# Configure the theme for Service Operations Workspace for ITSM

Configure the visual experience in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM for your users, helping to update the look and feel to be more like your brand.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Install the Theme Builder store application.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Plugins**.

    2.  Search for the Theme Builder \(sn\_theme\_builder\) application and install it.

2.  Create a theme using Theme Builder by referring to [Create a theme with Theme Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/tb-create-theme.md).

    Polaris is the default theme for Next Experience, and this theme cannot be copied. So, we must create a theme and publish it for use.

3.  Use the experience preview to preview the theme in the workspace.

4.  Select **Apply theme** form the drop-down in the top-right corner.

    Theme is deployed at the instance level.

5.  Select **View issues** to review accessibility issues if the theme does not meet accessibility requirements.

    For example, issues with contrast between colors and text for backgrounds and buttons.

6.  Select **Apply**.
