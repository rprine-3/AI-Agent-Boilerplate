# On-call support for an incident in Service Operations Workspace

You can identify available on-call members of a support group and contact them to resolve an issue.

## On-call support for an incident

Based on support groups associated with all services and CIs of the incident, the **Experts on-call** panel displays three on-call recommendations in the following order:

-   Support group associated with the primary service, that is, the **Service** field.
-   Top support group of impacted services from the Impacted Services/CIs related list.
-   Support group associated with the primary configuration item, that is, the **Configuration item** field.
-   Top support group of affected CIs from the Affected CIs related list.
-   Assignment group of an agent, that is, the **Assignment group** field.

For each of these fields, on-call information such as shift names and on-call members is displayed. For each on-call member, you can view the contact information.
