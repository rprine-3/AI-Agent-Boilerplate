Use filter criteria to drive Change Request date range

</td><td>

Option to choose a time range for the planned start and end date from **Change Request additional condition** instead of selecting specific dates based on meeting schedule.

**Note:** If you select **the Use filter criteria to drive Change Request date range** field in a cab meeting, the **Change Requests starting after** and the **Change Requests starting on or before** fields are turned off for the meeting, and therefore ignored. The change request additional conditions drive the date range.

</td><td>

Check box to mark each pre-approved change request as **Complete** in the CAB meeting agenda. **Note:** Pre-approved changes are automatically marked as complete so that approvers do not have to review them. The pre-approved changes are visible in the CAB Workbench, and can be discussed if necessary.
