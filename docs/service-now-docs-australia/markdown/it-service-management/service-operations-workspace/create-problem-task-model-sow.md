# Create a problem task model in Service Operations Workspace

Create custom Problem Management models with states and transitions tailored to your use cases.

## Before you begin

See considerations for enabling Problem Management models at [Problem Management models in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/problem-mgmt-models-sow.md).

Enable the system property **com.snc.problem\_management.models.enabled**. For more information, see [Enable Problem Management models in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/enable-problem-mgmt-models-sow.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the Problem Task Models table in one of the following ways.

    -   In the navigation filter, enter `prb_task_model.list`.
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Problem** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Problem Task Models**.

        **Note:** For more information about enabling menu items for Problem Management models, see [Enable or disable an application menu or module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/t_EnDisableAppMenuOrMod.md).

2.  Create a task model.

    1.  Select **New**.

    2.  On the Problem Task Model form, fill in the fields.

3.  Choose the states for your custom model by selecting **Save** from the form context menu icon \(\[Omitted image "form-context-menu.png"\] Alt text: Form context menu icon.\).

    3.  Select **Submit** for each state you choose.

4.  Apply a transition to each model state by selecting the display/hide hierarchical lists icon \(\[Omitted image "display-hide-hierarchial-lists.png"\] Alt text: Display/hide hierarchical lists icon.\).
