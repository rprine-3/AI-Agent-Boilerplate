|Concept|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Products|Represents the hardware or software for which releases are built. A product can be linked with a Business Service in the CMDB to link it with other ITIL processes.|
|Releases|Bundles all the work done \(projects, epics, stories, enhancements, defects, problems, incidents, and so on\) for products or services together and ensures that these work items are built, tested, and deployed on non-production and/or production environments.|
|Release Phases|Represents the planned phases within a release, which are used to group the tasks required to carry out the release. For example, gathering requirements, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.|
|Release Tasks|Represents any of the tasks required to implement a feature of a product.|
