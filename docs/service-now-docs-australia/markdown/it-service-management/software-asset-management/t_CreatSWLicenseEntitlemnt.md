# Software license entitlements for the legacy Software Asset Management plugin

Software entitlements enable you to define the people or machines to which a specific, purchased software license is assigned.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset

## About this task

Asset managers allocate a license to entitle a user or machine to use the license. For example, a company purchases a software license for 100 rights. The software entitlement specifies the 100 employees or machines that are rightfully assigned a license. If the ServiceNow Discovery tool is used and it finds the software installed on 200 machines, the asset manager can identify the employees or computers that have the software installed without a license. The asset manager can ask users to remove the software from their computers.

Built-in rules prevent entitling more licenses than have been purchased. License entitlements use specific software license asset tags. In addition to the mandatory asset tag, an individual person and a specific configuration item can be assigned.

The benefits of using software entitlements include the following.

-   If the overall license entitlement is exceeded, the asset manager can rapidly address the problem and return to compliant status by either removing unauthorized software or ordering more licenses.
-   If the license entitlement is not being used completely, the asset manager can respond by lowering the number of licenses purchased in the future.
