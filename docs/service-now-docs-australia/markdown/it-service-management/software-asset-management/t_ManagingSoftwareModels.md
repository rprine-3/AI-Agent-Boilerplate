# Manage software models using the legacy Software Asset Management plugin

The legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin uses software models to manage licenses, specifically in software counters and license restrictions, and to track upgrade and downgrade licenses.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam or model\_manager

## About this task

Create software models for all of the software your organization wants to monitor. Software models can also be imported from another source such as the Discovery application.

**Note:** Software does not create configuration items. If the discovery tool you use supports and finds ISO information, details such as ISO ID and ISO serial number are added to the Software Model form for compliance purposes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Software Models**.

    Users with the model\_manager role can navigate to **Product Catalog** &gt; **Product Model** &gt; **Software Models**, but cannot administer all aspects of software models.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Complete the form.

<table id="table_nr2_nd1_y4"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Display name

</td><td>

\[Read-only\] Name of the model. A system property called **glide.cmdb\_model.display\_name.shorten** controls how software model display names are generated. Administrators can configure the property.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Manufacturer

</td><td>

The company that built the model.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

The manufacturer-assigned name of the model or an abstract name specified by the model manager, such as Field Agent Laptop.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

General

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short description

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Asset tracking strategy

</td><td>

The process the model should be tracked by. Choose from the following:-   **Leave to Category**: model is transparent and the asset class is defined solely by the category.
-   **Create Consumable Asset**: model forces the asset class to be consumable, regardless of what the category defines as the asset class.
-   **Don't create assets**: model blocks asset instantiation, regardless of what the category defines as the asset class.

</td><td>

The method for purchasing the model. Options are **Both**, **Buy**, and **Lease**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Cost

</td><td>

The cost a single unit of the model.

</td><td>

The depreciation scheme for the model.

</td></tr><tr><td>
