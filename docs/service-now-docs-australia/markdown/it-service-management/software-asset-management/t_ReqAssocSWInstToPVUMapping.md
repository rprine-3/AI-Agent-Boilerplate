# Validate legacy IBM PVU Process Pack requirements for associating software installations with PVU mappings

Meet the recommended requirements to ensure that you receive the highest quality results with PVU mapping.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Use a discovery tool, such as ServiceNow Discovery, to identify hardware and populate the configuration management database \(CMDB\) with the configuration items you want to manage with IBM PVU licensing.

2.  Use a discovery tool, such as ServiceNow Discovery, to identify software installations.

    Check that the added CPU information is correct.

3.  [Activate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/t_ActivatingTheIBMPVUProcessPack.md) the Software Asset Management plugin - IBM PVU Process Pack plugin.

    This also activates the Software Asset Management plugin if it is not already active.

4.  [Refresh processor definitions.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/t_RefreshProcessorDefinitions.md)

5.  Ensure that the [software models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/t_ManagingSoftwareModels.md) you want to manage with IBM PVU licensing have the correct license type: **Per installation - IBM PVU**.

6.  [Create software counters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/t_UseSWCountersCalcIBMPVULice.md) to calculate IBM PVU licenses.

7.  Count licenses to determine compliance with IBM PVU guidelines.
