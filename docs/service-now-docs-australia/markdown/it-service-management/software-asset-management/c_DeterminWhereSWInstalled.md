# Determine where software is installed using the legacy Software Asset Management plugin

When using the legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin to determine where your software is installed, you must keep the following points in mind.

-   The software instance no longer contains discovered information. The information previously went to the Software Instance \[cmdb\_software\_instance\] table, but now goes to the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table. Because the table has changed, you must change your transform maps to point to the new table.
-   Models identified by a discovery tool are linked to software models.
-   Use grouping to obtain more specific information from a software counter.
-   Software installations link a computer with a software model \(via a discovery model\).

A discovery tool places the data it obtains into the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table. All of the information can be seen in the Software Installations list and the individual Software Installation forms. When a record is created, the system analyzes the Discovery Model table and identifies five key points.
