Software Counter Details

</td><td>

Shows every entitlement, software install, and software usage for the software. The related list also shows the Workstation and User, if applicable, for each software counter detail. A software asset manager can, for example, identify people who are using the license but are not entitled. The software can then be uninstalled from machines that are not in compliance or people can be entitled a license to meet compliance rules.
