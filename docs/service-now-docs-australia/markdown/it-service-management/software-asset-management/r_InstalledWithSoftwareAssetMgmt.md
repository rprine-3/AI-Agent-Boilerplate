# Installed with the legacy Software Asset Management plugin

A number of tables, properties, user roles, script includes, client scripts, UI policies, and business rules are installed with the legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin.

**Note:** Demo data is available with the legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin.

## Tables

The legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin adds the following tables.

<table id="table_sdt_dxt_hq"><thead><tr><th>

Table

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Processor Definition \[cmdb\_processor\_definition\]

</td><td>

Describes a computer in terms of the attributes IBM uses for its PVU licensing model. If they are all identical in terms of the attributes used for PVU licensing, a row can be associated with one or more discovered computers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Processor Mapping \[sam\_processor\_mapping\]

</td><td>

Encodes the information specified by the IBM [Table of Processor Value Units per core](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and is used in matching a computer's processor definition to a PVU cost for that computer. Each row in this table is a mapping between a set of processors and the associated PVU cost \(per core\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Counter \[sam\_sw\_counter\]

</td><td>

Configures license counting options for software models.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Counter Compliance Violations \[sam\_sw\_counter\_violation\]

</td><td>

Stores records of software counter compliance issues that are due to violations other than installs exceeding rights, such as:-   Maximum CPU/user count exceeded, based on model limits.
-   Maximum or minimum rights rules not followed, based on model limits.
-   Options installed on a server with a license that does not support options \(Oracle\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Counter Detail \[sam\_sw\_counter\_detail\]

</td><td>

Reconciles a software installation or usage with its corresponding software license and entitlement. The software counting logic automatically generates and maintains these records.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Counter History \[sam\_sw\_counter\_history\]

</td><td>

Stores read-only copies of software counter records, which the system generates automatically each time a software counter finishes counting licenses.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Counter Result \[sam\_sw\_counter\_result\]

</td><td>

Records all software counter results. Organizes the results based on the Grouping field \(such as Company, Department, or Location\) on the Software Counter record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Counter Summary \[sam\_sw\_counter\_summary\]

</td><td>

Aggregates all the software counter details for a given allocation state, a given group, and a given software counter. The software counting logic automatically generates and maintains these records.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Discovery Model \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_discovery\_model\]

</td><td>

Stores a unique and definitive list of all software found by a discovery tool.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\]

</td><td>

Associates software discovery models and the hardware on which they are installed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software Usage \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_usage\]

</td><td>

Associates software discovery models and the hardware that uses the models. ServiceNow Discovery does not populate the Software Usage \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_usage\] table. Use a third-party tool to add information about software assets to the Software Usage table.
