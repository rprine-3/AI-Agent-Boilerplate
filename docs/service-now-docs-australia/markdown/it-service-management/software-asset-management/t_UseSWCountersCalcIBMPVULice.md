# Use software counters with the legacy IBM PVU Process Pack

To calculate IBM PVU licenses through the legacy IBM PVU Process Pack, you can create a software counter with the IBM PVU license type. For a given PVU software package, you only need to create the counter once and then it can be reused.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam

## About this task

Processor definitions are searched as licenses are counted. If a processor definition is found, but no PVU mapping link exists for the processor, the system automatically does the following to obtain a PVU mapping link.

-   Pre-filtering based on processor name.
-   Advanced filtering based on PVU mapping records' condition field.
-   If no exact match is found, the most expensive mapping is used to increase the chance of being compliant.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Reconciliation** &gt; **Software Counters**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a **Name**.

4.  Select a **Software Model**.

5.  Select a level of adherence to the license in the **Enforce to** field.
