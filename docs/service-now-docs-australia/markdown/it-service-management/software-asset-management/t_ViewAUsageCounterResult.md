# View usage counter results for the legacy Software Asset Management plugin

Usage counters for the legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin track licenses based on how often those licenses are actually used either by a workstation or a user.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam

## About this task

A usage counter tracks a license based on how often the license is actually used either by a workstation or a user. For example, an asset manager can use a usage counter to determine who is actually using the software they have been entitled. If an individual is not using the software at all or very infrequently, the software can be uninstalled and given to an individual who will use it more often. If you have a way of capturing information, for example a proxy server or gateway, you can capture the IP address and the name of the user accessing the license. The captured data can be added directly into the Software Usages list.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Software Usages**.

2.  Click the **Display Name** in the row containing the software and user to check.

3.  View the **Software Usage** form \(see table\).

    All fields on the form are read-only.
