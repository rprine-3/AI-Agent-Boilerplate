# Scan software installations with the system scheduler

The legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin adds a scheduled job for scanning software installations named **SAM License Counters** in **System Scheduler** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

The **SAM License Counters** job occurs at 2:00am \(local time\) every morning. The job queries the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table and captures any installations that have not been scanned in the past 7 days.
