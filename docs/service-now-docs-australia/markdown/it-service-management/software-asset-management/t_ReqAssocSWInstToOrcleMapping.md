# Validate legacy Oracle Process Pack requirements for associating software installations with Oracle mappings

Meet the recommended requirements to ensure that you receive the highest quality results with Oracle mapping.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Use a discovery tool \(such as ServiceNow Discovery\) to identify software installations.

    Check that the added CPU information is correct.

2.  [Activate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/t_ActivateSWAssetMgmtOraclProcPac.md) the legacy Software Asset Management - Oracle Process Pack \(com.snc.sam.oracle.pp\) plugin.

    This also activates the legacy Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugin if it is not already active.

3.  Refresh processor definitions by navigating to **Software Asset** &gt; **System** and clicking **Refresh Processor Definitions**.

4.  Ensure that the software models that you want to manage with Oracle licensing are set up accurately.

    See [Creating a software model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/t_ManagingSoftwareModels.md).

5.  [Create a software license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/t_CreateAnOracleSoftwareLicense.md) for your Oracle software.

    Ensure that the license is given the correct license metric.

    The **License metric** \(metric\_type\) field on the Software License table is a reference field to the License Calculation table.

6.  [Create a software counter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/software-asset-management/c_CreatingAnOracleSoftwareCounter.md) to calculate Oracle licenses with the matching license type.

7.  Count licenses to determine compliance with Oracle guidelines.
