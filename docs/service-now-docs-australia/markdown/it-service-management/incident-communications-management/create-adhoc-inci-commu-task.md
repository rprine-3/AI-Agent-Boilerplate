# Create adhoc incident communication task from Incident Communications Management

Create an adhoc incident communication task while you are working on the communication plan. The communication task helps you to specify the mode of communication \(channel\) and the frequency at which the communication must be carried out.

## Before you begin

Role required: major\_incident\_manager, ia\_admin, or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident Communications Management** &gt; **Open**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Open the incident communication plan for which you want to create the communication task.

3.  In the Incident Communication Tasks related list and click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
