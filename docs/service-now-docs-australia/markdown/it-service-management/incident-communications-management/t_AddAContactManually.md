# Add a user as a contact

Add a user to a communication plan if you have not added the user earlier in the contact. You can assign a communication task to the user to resolve an issue.

## Before you begin

Role required: ia\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident Communications Management** &gt; **Open**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Open an incident communications plan record.

3.  Select the **Users** related list and then select **New**.
