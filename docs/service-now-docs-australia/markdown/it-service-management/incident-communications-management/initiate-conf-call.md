# Initiate conference call on incident communication task

Initiate a conference call and include all the required stakeholders to discuss on the resolution of the incident and the communication task.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_comm\_management.comm\_plan\_manager or sn\_comm\_management.comm\_plan\_admin

Activate the Notify plugin \(com.snc.notify\), configure the Twilio account, configure the **com.snc.iam.notify\_number** property and create a default provider selector. You can also create a provider selector on the Incident Communication Task table \[incident\_alert\_task\]. The provider selector specifies the Notify group containing the Notify phone numbers or conference provider to make outgoing calls.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident** &gt; **All**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Open an incident record.

3.  From the Incident Communication Plan related list, open the incident communication plan.

4.  From the Incident Communication Tasks related list, open the incident communication task.

5.  In the related link, click **Initiate Conference Call**.

6.  Select the conference bridge number and the participants for the conference call and click **Start Call**.
