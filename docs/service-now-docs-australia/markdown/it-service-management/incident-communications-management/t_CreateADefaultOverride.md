# Create a default override

Create a default override to specify user or group for a contact definition of an incident communication plan. It helps you to set multiple conditions based on which a user or a group is considered as a contact.

## Before you begin

Role required: ia\_admin or admin

## About this task

The Default overrides related list is available only if you select **Default override** as the value of the **Source** field in the Contact definition form.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident Communications Management** &gt; **Contact Administration** &gt; **Contact Definitions**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Open the contact definition record.

3.  In the Default override section, click **New**.
