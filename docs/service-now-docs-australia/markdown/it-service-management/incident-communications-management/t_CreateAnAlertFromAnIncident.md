# Create adhoc incident communication plan from incident

Create an adhoc incident communication plan from an incident when an issue related to the incident is not considered earlier. The incident automatically populates the required information in the adhoc communication plan, saving you time and effort.

## Before you begin

Role required: major\_incident\_manager, ia\_admin, or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Incident** &gt; **Open**.

    **Note:** If the UI16 module link redirection feature is enabled in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) and the UI16 module supports the redirect configuration, navigating through UI16 paths automatically redirects you to the equivalent list or record pages in SOW instead of displaying the UI16 forms or lists. For more information, see [Redirect UI16 module links to Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/redirect-ui16-module-links-sow.md).

2.  Open an existing incident.

3.  Click the Incident Communication Plans related list.

4.  Click **New**.

    The original incident becomes the source incident of this communication plan.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.
