-   **Support for reflow**

The Service Dashboard and Log Viewer component was updated to support reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [\[Placeholder link text to key bundle-platux.auto-reflow\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) for details.

[Event Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=event-management-rn&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) highlights:

-   Investigate alerts more effectively in Service Operations Workspace and Express List with alert simplifications created by Now Assist using generative AI. Utilize brief alert descriptions and actionable alert data to enable quick alert triaging and effective analysis, which can lead to reduced resolution time.
-   Get started faster with alert clustering in Event Management by using predefined tags mapped from alerts and based on information contained in tag sources.
-   Configure an Express List view and assign it to users and user groups to ensure that they focus on specific services, priorities, or alerts.
-   Streamline the triage process and perform more effective root cause analysis by viewing data on repeated alerts, similar alerts, and incidents over the last 30 days in the Express List Alert Preview pane. These alert trends enable you to gain a deeper understanding of alert patterns and distinguish between noise and emerging issues.
-   Ensure that the connector's ownership and execution of rules is on a team level. This way, you can maintain consistency and hierarchy while offering flexibility and customization options for your teams.
-   Shorten your testing cycle by creating a stream of events from your production environment to your non-production environment where you can enable direct testing and evaluation of event rules, event field mappings, alert management rules, and alert correlation, without having to change your production environment.

 [Agent Client Collector](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=agent-client-collector-rn&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) highlights:

-   Use your configuration data files to provide the instance data directly to an agent.
-   Continuously discover the resources in the Kubernetes clusters and ensure that changes in the resources are updated in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

 [Health Log Analytics](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=health-log-analytics-rn&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) highlights:

-   Request Health Log Analytics scaling through the Now Support catalog.
