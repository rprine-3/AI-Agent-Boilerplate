# Combined Service Portal release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Service Portal from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Service Portal release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Service Portal to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Washington DC

</td><td>

After upgrading, you must specify the tables from which guest users can access data for any public widgets that accept the table input parameter. By default in the Washington DC release, public widgets that accept the table input parameter can't access and return data from any tables for guest users. If you added the **glide.service\_portal.widget.table\_allow\_list** or **glide.service\_portal.widget.allow\_list** system properties before upgrading, the values of these properties will be migrated to the Public Table Allow List for widgets after upgrading. For more information, see [Configure widget security](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-widget-security&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 Additionally, field-level read ACLs are enforced for filter conditions in Simple List widget instances by default. A new system property, **glide.service\_portal.enable\_acls\_for\_encoded\_query\_in\_list**, enforces these ACLs regardless of whether the **Enforce field-level Read ACLs on Filter query terms** option is selected for Simple List widget instances. To use the **Enforce field-level Read ACLs on Filter query terms** option, change the value of **glide.service\_portal.enable\_acls\_for\_encoded\_query\_in\_list** to false. For more information, see [Simple List widget](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=simple-list-widget&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 If a user previously selected a user consent preference for user experience analytics for portals different from the rest of the platform, the preference selected for the platform is also used for portals in the Washington DC release. For example, if users opted out of tracking for portals but opted in to tracking for the rest of the platform in the Vancouver release, user experience analytics for portals are tracked for them in the Washington DC release. Users can update their selection from the user profile page in portals at any time.

</td><td>

-   **[Critical notifications aren't automatically dismissed](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=properties-service-portal&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Show critical notifications tagged with the `sn-sticky-notification` HTML class attribute until you specifically dismiss them even when automatic dismissal is enabled for non-critical notifications with the **glide.service-portal.notification\_timeout.seconds** system property.

Previously, changes to your user consent selection to track user experience analytics in other platform interfaces weren’t honored in portals and vice versa. This choice is now stored centrally with the user consent management \(UCM\) capability used by the rest of the platform so a change for one interface is honored for all interfaces. For more information about user consent management, see [User privacy, tracking, and consent](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=user-exp-analytics-track-options&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) in the Usage Insights documentation.
