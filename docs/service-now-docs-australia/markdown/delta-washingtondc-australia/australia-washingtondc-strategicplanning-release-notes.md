Starting with v4.0.2, you can access the Strategic Portfolio Management \(SPM\) Pro-licensed features only in Strategic Planning Workspace. If you have been using Portfolio Planning Workspace to access SPM Pro-licensed features, such as Goals, Product Feedback, and Hybrid Portfolio Planning, you must now install Strategic Planning to access these features. For more information on the features that can be accessed only in Strategic Planning Workspace, see [Exploring Portfolio Planning in Strategic Planning](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=alignment-planner-workspace&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 If you’re upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.1.2 and previously had customized the List view or the Hierarchy view of the Goals page using the Personalization side panel, the user interface enhancements done in v4.1.2 may not appear. In this case, you must delete your user preference records. For more information on how to delete user preferences made using the Personalization side panel, see [KB1642037](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1642037).

After upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.3.2, run the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job. This scheduled job migrates the existing values in the **Review frequency** and **Breakdown interval** fields to the **Check-in frequency** field in the target records. For more information on how these values are migrated for targets with different values, see [Target breakdowns migration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=target-breakdowns-migration-spw&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

After upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.7.0, the following changes apply to user preferences:

-   Custom view settings previously saved under user preferences will be cleared. You must reapply these changes and create views as needed. For instructions, see [Create a portfolio plan view in Strategic Planning](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-portfolio-plan-view-spw&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) and [Create a free-form roadmap view in Strategic Planning](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-free-form-roadmap-view-spw&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
-   Customizations made to the Timeline and Kanban views in the **Roadmap** tab, and the Kanban view in the **Prioritization** tab at the portfolio plan level, will be copied to the Default view of the portfolio plan. Similarly, any customizations made to the Timeline and Kanban views in the free-form roadmap will also be copied to the Default view of the free-form roadmap.

After upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.8.0, the existing **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields will appear as **Investment type \(Deprecated\)** and **Investment class \(Deprecated\)** respectively across the Planning page including in the Prioritization and Roadmap views and in the Scenario Planning page. The values from these deprecated fields will be automatically copied to the new **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields.

 If you previously applied filters or personalized your view using the deprecated fields, you must update those configurations to use the new **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields across the workspace—including in the Prioritization and Roadmap views on the Planning page, as well as in the Scenario Planning page.

    -   Updating actuals for a target has been simplified with an enhanced UI:
        -   In the Check-in actuals window on the **Progress** tab of the target’s side panel, update the actual value of any time period or breakdown.
        -   In the **Progress** tab of the target’s side panel, view the trend of the target’s progress in a line or bar graph. You can also edit the planned target and view the check-in history of the target actuals.

    -   On the Target form, use the **Baseline reference** field to compare future target performance with the actual value that was achieved in the last year or before the target was created.
    -   Add targets to a new goal using the **Save and add target** option on the Goal modal. Also, you can use the **Save and add new target** option to add more targets for the goal.

For Agile teams managing non-agile work items such as incidents and change tasks, this integration bridges the gap by automatically creating a dedicated Space and Board in CWM. Agile work is seamlessly brought over via Connected Work, while EAP sprints are reflected directly in CWM’s Sprint planning view, thus enabling unified planning across work types. Teams can plan work for their sprints and update work status directly from the CWM Board, with performance reports in EAP dynamically reflecting these changes. This integration enables teams to manage their full scope of work from a single, connected workspace.

You can now reference any ServiceNow application record and Docs will automatically reflect the latest updates from those records. For example, if you add a reference to a Project record, the reference will show the latest field information of the project in Docs without requiring manual edits. Clicking the project reference opens up the project form so that you can view the full details of the project record and make any necessary changes. Dynamic linking also enables adding references to a particular field of a record, such as Assigned to of an Incident record.
