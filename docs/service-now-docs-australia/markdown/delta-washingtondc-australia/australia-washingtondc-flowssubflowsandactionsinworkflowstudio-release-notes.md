# Combined Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

After upgrading, users who previously had the fd\_read\_operations role will now see only basic execution details such as the run state and duration. This restriction prevents users with this role from seeing sensitive information in execution details. To provide read access to all execution details such as input configuration and runtime values, grant the user the new role fd\_read\_operations\_all.

An earlier version of the save as you go feature was released and withdrawn from the Washington DC release. If you're upgrading from the Washington DC release, you might have manually turned off the save as you go features by setting a system property. To restore the save as you go features, see [Restore save as you go functionality](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=restore-save-as-you-go-functionality&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

-   Removed the system property com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.iteration.lastn that was used to specify the number of loop iterations that a flow would generate execution details for. To report on all iterations of a loop, create a flow execution settings record for the flow instead. For more information about flow execution settings, see [Flow execution settings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=flow-execution-settings&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
-   The user preference for flow authors to include draft actions in the list of available actions has been removed. To see a custom action during flow design, publish the action.
