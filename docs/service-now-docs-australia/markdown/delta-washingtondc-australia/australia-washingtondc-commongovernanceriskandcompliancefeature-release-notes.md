-   **[System-generated recommendations for Workspace issue management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=issues-in-workspace&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Use system-generated recommendations for a remediation task that is related to an issue. User responses are recorded in the action history of the remediation task.
    -   Use system-generated recommendations that are listed on the **Details** tab of an issue. You can refer to the top three recommendations when assigning an issue in the **Assigned to** field.

-   **[Management method in issue grouping](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=issue-grouping-in-workspaces&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Group and manage issues from a parent issue, or manage child issues independently using the group issue management method. When you select the Management method as **Manage parent**, the child issues inherit the values of the **State**, **Response**, and **Explanation** fields from the parent issue. When **Manage child** is selected, the child issue maintains its own **State**, **Response**, and **Explanation** fields individually.

As a part of this feature, the following two new fields were added on the issue record in the Issue grouping section:

    -   **Group level**: Identifies whether an issue is a child, parent, or a standalone issue.
    -   **Management method**: Indicates whether the issue is managed from a parent issue or as an individual child issue.
-   **[Confidentiality and inheritance enhancements in issue grouping](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=confidential-records&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Streamline the issue grouping process with the following enhancements:

    -   Add confidential child issues only under a confidential parent issue.
    -   Add nonconfidential child issues under a confidential or nonconfidential parent issue.
    -   Change a confidential parent issue to nonconfidential. This action will remove all confidential child issues under the parent issue, making them standalone issues after you save the record.

**Note:** When you change a nonconfidential child issue to confidential, which is under a nonconfidential parent issue, this action removes the child issue from the nonconfidential parent issue. The child issue becomes a standalone issue and no longer linked to the parent issue.

-   **[GRC Licensing Overview dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-licensing-summary-dashboard&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the self-service GRC Licensing Overview dashboard to track license usage trends and next month's projected usage based on role allocation. You can see the monthly aggregated counts of license consumption across different product families including Integrated Risk Management, Business Continuity Management, and Privacy Management. The following infrastructure enhancements were made:

    -   Expanded the unique user usage table capacity from 9 months to 12 months.
    -   License consumption details are archived for five years.
    -   Aggregated monthly counts of license usage are stored.
-   **[Introducing GRC Employee role](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-common-roles&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Install the new GRC Employee User application and assign the GRC Employee role to your employees. The users with the GRC Employee role can perform the following activities from the Employee Center:

    -   Read and acknowledge organizational policies.
    -   Report risk events and issues.
    -   Request policy exceptions.
    -   Report a compliance case to the Compliance team.
    -   Raise inquiries and requests to the Compliance team.
**Note:** This update is only applicable to customers who are entitled to and have installed the GRC Employee User application. For more details, review the entitlement on the subscription dashboard or contact ServiceNow.

-   **[Lite operator role enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-common-roles&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The sn\_audit.reader and sn\_audit.approver roles were added as Lite Operator roles. These new roles are available to all customers.

The following Operator roles are reclassified as Lite Operator roles when GRC Employee User application and GRC Business User Lite applications are installed:

    -   sn\_grc.business\_user
    -   sn\_risk\_advanced.ara\_assessor
    -   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.authorization\_official
    -   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.reader
    -   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.executive\_read
**Note:** This reclassification is only applicable to customers who are entitled to and have installed the GRC Employee User application. For more details, review the entitlement on the subscription dashboard or contact ServiceNow.

-   **[Entity filter deletion or modification warning](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=what-is-an-entity-filter&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Avoid the unintended consequences of deleting or modifying an entity filter with a warning message. This message includes an impact analysis of the affected entity, risk, and control records.

-   **[Document designer integration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-audit-word-based-templates&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can update and add content using Microsoft 365 for ServiceNow Reporting now integrated with the Document designer application to insert data and reports into a Microsoft Word document.

-   **[Role attribution to licensing mapping tab](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-licensing-summary-dashboard&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Role attribution to licensing mapping tab on the GRC Licensing Overview dashboard to understand how licensing applies to roles and users. This tab helps you with the following:

    -   Identify the license treatment for all the default GRC roles.
    -   Determine the license treatment of a specific user based on their assigned roles.
    -   Determine the license treatment for a specific combination of roles.
-   **[Map stakeholders in entity](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=entities-in-risk-ws&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Stakeholders related list in the entity form to define stakeholders with customizable roles relevant to single and composite entities. This feature enables effective team involvement in risk assessments and risk assessment projects. You can add persona, group, and users in the stakeholder list.

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ai-native-sku-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.

-   **[GRC notification redirection](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=email-notification-redirection&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading GRC to version 22.0.x, notification links in GRC applications automatically route you to the appropriate workspace view based on your persona and access permissions. If you don't have workspace access, links default to the classic view.

-   **[Monitor my tasks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-my-tasks-in-ws&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading GRC to version 22.0.1, the Tasks page loads faster with performance improvements. Task counts display first as an at-a-glance summary, followed by detailed task lists that load progressively. Task data refreshes at regular intervals to keep information current. These improvements provide better scalability for users with high task volumes across multiple task sources.
