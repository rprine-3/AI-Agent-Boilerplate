</td><td>

-   **[Scale Health Log Analytics to support increased log ingestion](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-scale-request&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Stream log data to Health Log Analytics in a scalable, more stable way by using the advanced ServiceNow infrastructure. The new architecture leverages queueing technology in IT Operations Management Cloud Services for authentication and log ingestion.

The Health Log Analytics AI engine has been enhanced to scale dynamically in response to increased log ingestion by your organization.

You can switch to the new infrastructure by submitting a scaling request through the Now Support catalog or via your ServiceNow account manager.

-   **[Enjoy a significantly faster log streaming rate with the Lighting gRPC client for MID Server communication with the ServiceNow instance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-configuration-preferences&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Increase log streaming speeds to Health Log Analytics by up to six times through the Lightning gRPC client, which enhances MID Server communication with your ServiceNow instance. Note that the Lightning gRPC client requires manual configuration to activate.

-   **[Stream system logs from Glide to Health Log Analytics](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-glide-syslog&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Glide Syslog data input to stream log messages from the System Log table \(Glide Syslog\) in Glide to the Health Log Analytics AI engine \(Occultus\).

**Note:** Only a single Glide Syslog data input can exist in the system. This data input doesn't run on a MID Server.

-   **[Pull data from Splunk regularly using the Splunk Polling data input](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-splunk-polling&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Make your data workflows more consistent and productive by fetching data consistently over time using the Splunk Polling data input, which sends recurring queries \(polls\) to Splunk. Handling most configurations on the HLA side means you need minimal additional stakeholder involvement, which enables swift integration with your existing Splunk setup. This enhancement accelerates proofs of concept \(POCs\) and enables faster iterations using real data.

-   **[Use your Splunk data input to ingest preprocessed data from Splunk](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-splunk&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Ingest data from Splunk in a preprocessed, structured format using your existing Splunk data input.

-   **[Integrate with log data connectors from the Integrations Launchpad](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-setup-integrations&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Take advantage of the Integrations Launchpad's unified interface for convenient integration with log data connectors that feed raw log data from external sources into your instance. You set up log data connectors for HLA from the Event Management Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM. In this release, the Integrations Launchpad enables integration with the following connectors: Elasticsearch, ServiceNow System Logs, UDP, and TCP.

-   **[Use Cribl and Edge Delta data inputs to streamline HLA data ingestion with tools handling large log volumes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-setup-manual&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use dedicated data inputs to facilitate data ingestion from Cribl or Edge Delta when using these tools to handle large volumes of log data from multiple sources before sending it to HLA.

-   **[Configure log data integrations from the Integrations Launchpad](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-setup-integrations&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 36.0.19, benefit from additional log data integrations for Splunk TCP/UDP, Splunk Poller, MID Server, Apache Kafka, Microsoft Azure Log Analytics, and REST API that can be easily set up through the Integrations Launchpad.

-   **[Set up an Amazon Data Firehose integration for real-time log data streaming from multiple sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-firehose&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 36.0.19, leverage an integration for streaming log data from Amazon Data Firehose directly to the collector service in ITOM Gateway, where it is queued and then processed by Health Log Analytics. This integration doesn't run on a MID Server and can be configured from the Integrations Launchpad.

-   **[Facilitate Cribl log data ingestion by Health Log Analytics using the Cribl integration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-cribl&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 37.0.15, use the Cribl log data integration to streamline Health Log Analytics data ingestion with Cribl. If your organization uses Cribl for filtering and routing large volumes of log data from various sources, the log format received by HLA is distinct from other types. The Cribl integration enables HLA to detect and separate transport headers from inner log messages in this format, forwarding only the inner message to the source type structure for processing. You can configure the Cribl integration conveniently through the Integrations Launchpad.


-   **[Leverage additional information available on the integration's Overview screen](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-overview-tab&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 37.0.15, take advantage of extra information presented on the Overview screen. The screen now displays the ITOM Gateway in the log processing pipeline and the log streaming rate per minute, aligning it with the metrics for the MID Server and the HLA Engine. The Overview screen also shows the source time of the last processed log.


-   **[Export source types to an update set by log source](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-export-sourcetypes-by-source&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, export all source types related to one or more selected log sources to an update set together. You can then import the update set to the target environment.


-   **[Map log data to service instances and components for alerts in context](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-map-business-context&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, map your logs to service instances and components so that Health Log Analytics can generate alerts in the correct context. Contextualizing your log data is especially important when the integration processes logs from multiple service instances and components.


-   **[Display Integrations Launchpad from the ITOM AIOps configuration center](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=itom-aiops-conf-center&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, open the Integrations Launchpad from ITOM AIOps configuration center. The ITOM AIOps configuration center is a centralized workspace that enables you to configure and manage AIOps features from a single place.


-   **[Set up a GCP PubSub integration from the Integrations Launchpad](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-gcp-pubsub&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, set up an integration from the Integrations Launchpad for receiving log messages that were published to a Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) Pub/Sub topic and streaming them to your ServiceNow instance.


-   **[Set up a Microsoft Azure Event Hubs integration from the Integrations Launchpad](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-event-hubs&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, set up an integration from the Integrations Launchpad for streaming events from Microsoft Azure Event Hubs to your ServiceNow instance.


-   **[Set up an Edge Delta TCP or REST integration from the Integrations Launchpad](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-edgedelta-tcp&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, set up an integration from the Integrations Launchpad to enable Health Log Analytics to process Edge Delta log messages streaming into your ServiceNow instance over the TCP transport protocol or via REST.


-   **[Monitor ServiceNow instance logs with the ServiceNow Log Export data input](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-log-export&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, set up a data input for monitoring ServiceNow instance node logs from both Java code and JavaScript in Health Log Analytics.

-   **Lucene used in Elasticsearch library**

Lucene may appear on vulnerability scans but is not exploitable. Lucene is included in the Health Log Analytics project for the Elasticsearch Data Input. The Elasticsearch library has a transitive dependency on Lucene. However, the Elasticsearch version used has its own safeguards and cannot be exploited in any way.

-   **[Component-based alert grouping is deprecated](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-op-log-analytics-alert-types&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 36.0.19, the adoption of a streamlined two-tier alert model, Log Analytics Group to Single Alert, has replaced component-based alert groups, which have been removed. This model aligns alert representation with the service-level anomalies identified by Health Log Analytics, rather than individual host CIs. The update improves alert visibility, simplifies correlation, and enhances overall alert management efficiency.
