-   **[Admin Center changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-admin-console-sow-itsm&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Migrate your ITSM Agent Workspace features to Service Operations Workspace by using the on-screen utility without having to rebuild these features. This migration includes customizations done on ITSM Agent Workspace for various forms, UI actions, and lists.
    -   Configure the availability and order of the contextual side panel tabs in record pages.
    -   Configure modern Change Management features from the Service Operations Workspace Admin Center to increase change efficiency, accelerate change approvals, drive data-driven risk analysis, and leverage DevOps data for change automation.
    -   Configure the visibility settings of the **Overview** tab for each problem record state.
    -   Configure the visibility settings of the **Overview** tab in the incident record page for tier 1 agents from the Incident record section of Incident Management in Admin Center.
    -   Configure Service Desk assisted Password Reset to accomplish the following tasks:
        -   Assign the password reset service desk role to the user.
        -   Create a credential store record to configure access to your credential store server while a user is changing or resetting a password.
        -   Configure the verification methods for the service desk process.
        -   Configure the password policies.
    -   Starting in version 6.1, you can do the following actions from the SOW Admin Center:
        -   Configure Interaction Management in SOW.
        -   Browse through a collection of SOW learning resources to help users understand more about SOW configuration.
-   **[Granular roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-in-sow&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure the user access for various record pages in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM by using the following granular roles, and the user’s access to these record pages is based on the role assigned.

    -   Incident: sn\_incident\_read and sn\_incident\_write
    -   Request: sn\_request\_read, sn\_request\_write
    -   Problem: sn\_problem\_read, sn\_problem\_write
    -   Change: sn\_change\_read and sn\_change\_write
Because these granular roles inherit the sn\_sow.sow\_home and sn\_sow.sow\_list roles, the users with the granular roles can access the Service Operations Workspace for ITSM home and list pages.

**Note:** When upgrading to Xanadu, the email\_composer user role is added to the users along with the respective granular roles. The time to add the role depends on the number of users having the granular roles for write function and impacts the overall instance upgrade time. Adding the email\_composer user role ensures that the granular write users have access to the email templates in SOW.

-   **[Interaction record page enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-interactions&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

View the requester's details, their assets, recent interactions, and related links from the Opened for card. This centralized access point provides an agent with a comprehensive overview to efficiently manage the requester's information.

To streamline the workflow and maintain focus on interactions, a modal-based interface for record association is implemented for the interaction record in Service Operations Workspace. This interface simplifies the workflow by automatically suggesting tables that are frequently associated with Interactions, including the change, incident, knowledge, problem, and request. This enhancement is designed to streamline operations and enhance user efficiency.

Starting in version 6.1, view all available metrics of the requester’s assets that are collected through the Digital End-User Experience \(DEX\) architecture from the interaction record.

    -   Search and filter the configuration items \(CI\) that are based on the configuration class when you add the affected CIs to an incident record.
    -   When an agent reports a knowledge gap from an incident record, the success message that contains the created knowledge feedback task record link is displayed. You can select the link to open the knowledge feedback task record on a separate tab to provide the information and create an article for the knowledge gap.
    -   For issues related to Password Reset, you can now select **Password Reset** as the incident category. After this category is set and the incident record is saved, you can resolve the incident by using the Reset password UI action. For more information on Password Reset, see [Password Reset in SOW](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-password-reset-sow&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Introduction of Granular Admin roles in SOW](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-in-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following granular admin roles are introduced in SOW:

    -   sn\_sow\_admin.sn\_sow\_admin: Provides access to SOW Admin Center page for SOW configurations. Admins can use the role to configure SOW features and maintain organizational policies.
    -   sn\_sow\_inc\_sn\_incident\_sow\_admin: Provides access to SOW Admin Center pages for configurations related to Incident Management features.
    -   sn\_sow\_mim.sn\_mim\_sow\_admin: Provides access to the SOW Admin Center pages for configurations related to Major Incident Management \(MIM\) features.
    -   sn\_sow\_on\_call.sn\_on\_call\_sow\_admin: Provides access to the SOW Admin Center pages for On-Call Scheduling configurations.
    -   sn\_sow\_problem.sn\_problem\_sow\_admin: Provides access to the SOW Admin Center pages for Problem Management configurations.
-   **[View conflicts in the change request form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-change-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The improved schedule and conflicts section added in the change request form displays the scheduling conflicts for a change request.

-   **[UI16 links to SOW redirection behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-admin-console-sow-itsm&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Improve the fulfiller experience by redirecting UI16 module links such as forms and lists to the equivalent SOW experience. The UI16 module link redirection behavior is supported for all the applications in SOW when the system property **sn\_sow\_itsm\_admin.experience\_redirection\_enabled.sow** is set to `true`.

For new instances, this redirection configuration is automatically available in the base system. For upgrade instances, administrators can configure the redirection behavior from the SOW Admin Center. You can enable this feature for the UI16 links and user groups or specifically for a custom table. You can also enable this feature for specific user groups or all user groups within the custom table or applications in SOW.

-   **[Mapping granular admin roles with SOW granular roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-in-sow&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Using granular admin roles, provide full administrative access to the configuration and property pages for the applications in SOW without requiring the administrator \(admin\) role. These granular admin roles are mapped with ACLs and contain the corresponding existing SOW granular roles.

-   **[UX property to hide contextual side panel](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-admin-console-sow-itsm&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Hide contextual side panel for specific table and tab combination option from the SOW Properties section in the SOW Admin Center to configure the hide **ContextualSidebar** UX page property. This property enables you to define the table with tab combination for which the default primary contextual side panel must be hidden, prioritizing the embedded contextual side panel within the tab instead.

-   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

-   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) for details.

-   **Resize text**

Starting in version 6.1, text size can be increased to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality for Incident Management and Password Reset in SOW.
