Manage your documents and work papers with Audit Management as cloud files. This capability addresses specific use cases for the engagement and audit task records in the Audit Workspace. Link the cloud files to any GRC record and share a single cloud file with multiple records.

-   **[Create a Cloud file configuration on engagements and audit tasks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=document-access-configuration&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[Generate an audit report for an engagement using Microsoft Word template](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-audit-report&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Audit Workspace to generate audit reports for an engagement using Microsoft Word template to collaborate with your auditors in an effortless and user-friendly manner. You can manage the generated report as a cloud file either on cloud \(Microsoft SharePoint\) or as a sys\_attachment that is attached to the engagement record.

-   **[Cloud document management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-cloud-docs-using-onedrive-int&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Upload documents from your local computer as cloud files and link them to any record in ServiceNow. You can upload files to a predefined folder path and location.

-   **[User role enhancements in Audit Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_RolesInstallWAudit&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following roles have been added:

    -   Use the Audit approver \(sn\_audit.approver\) role to approve an engagement and audit plan. Anyone with this role can be a part of an approver list. This role is also classified as a lite operator role.
    -   Use the Audit reader \(sn\_audit.reader\) role to view the audit-related entities, such as engagements, plans, observations, and audit tasks. Anyone with this role has exclusive read access to all the entities in the Audit Management application. This role is also classified as a lite operator role.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Matrix report in the Audit Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=matrix-report-audit-ws&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Analyze relationships between different variables by using a Matrix report that presents data in a structured format. Assess and document risks and the internal controls designed to mitigate those risks through the Risk and Controls Matrix.

-   **[Entity Based Access for Audit Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_Engagements&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Entity-based access enables you to create configurations for entities, entity classes, and entity types. When a user is qualified based on these configurations and has the minimum required roles, they can access to the following tables:

    -   Engagement
    -   Test Plan
    -   Control Test
    -   Observation
    -   Control to Engagement
    -   Test Plan to Engagement
    -   Risk to Engagement
    -   Issue to Engagement
    -   Entity to Engagement

</td><td>

-   **Audit Period Start and End Dates [\[Placeholder link text to key t\_CreateEngagement\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_CreateEngagement&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Set audit period start and end dates directly on Engagement records to focus audits on specific time-frames. The system displays only indicator results that fall within your defined audit period, keeping the audit time-frame separate from the overall engagement time-frame. This helps you audit past or future periods without affecting the broader engagement timeline.

-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key unified-content-management\_0\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=unified-content-management_0&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify the installation of pre-configured content packs with the new Unified content management icon in the Audit Workspace. Content Accelerator includes the Digital Operational Resilience Act \(DORA\) content pack, offering citations and authority documents for DORA compliance. Audit shared manager and Audit WS supervisor roles can access Content Accelerator.

-   **[Enhancement to evidence request](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=evidence-request&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create evidence response directly in one step. This bypasses the step involved in creation of evidence request and collection details. Evidence response is enhanced with additional data of source and context. To leverage evidence capabilities, feature roles have been introduced:

    -   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_reader
    -   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_requester
    -   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_responder
    -   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_admin
-   **[Integration with ITAM](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=solutions-gallery&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Leverage Audit Management support as an ITAM customer through dedicated feature roles. A lightweight version of the Audit Management workspace is available, which includes the following features:

    -   On the Audit Management home page, you can track **Timeline**, **Engagements**, **Tracking**, **Create evidence request**, and **.**
    -   The lightweight Audit Management also includes the key capabilities, such as Engagement, Entity Scoping, Activities, and Evidence when Advanced Core is installed.

-   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

-   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%. This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
