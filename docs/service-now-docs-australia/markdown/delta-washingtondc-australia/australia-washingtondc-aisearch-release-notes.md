# Combined AI Search release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for AI Search from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family AI Search release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading AI Search to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

[Washington DC Patch 9](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=washingtondc-patch-9&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US):

-   After you upgrade to Washington DC Patch 9 from an earlier release, make knowledge block content searchable by reindexing all your indexed sources that include knowledge articles. For details on reindexing, see [Index or reindex an indexed source](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) or [Index or reindex multiple indexed sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-multiple-sources-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 Washington DC:

-   When you upgrade to Washington DC, AI Search automatically updates your existing Genius Result configurations to use the new [AI Search Genius Result Configuration form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=genius-result-cfg-form-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) fields. This update procedure makes the following changes:
    -   Removes existing **Genius result answer type** field values.
    -   Migrates **Genius result logic** field values to the new **AI Search request processor** and **AI Search response processor** fields as appropriate.
-   After you upgrade your instance to Washington DC, AI Search retains the value that you previously set for the **Boolean search operator to use when a search query includes multiple terms** \(**glide.ais.query.search\_operator**\) system property. To gain the benefits of the new enhanced query mode for multi-term searches, set this system property's value to **AND then OR 2+ key terms**. For details on AI Search system properties, see [AI Search system properties](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=system-properties-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
-   Starting in Washington DC, the User \[sys\_user\] table defaults to sorting indexed records by their sys\_created\_on dates instead of sorting them by their sys\_updated\_on dates. This change requires reindexing of the User table indexed source for AI Search, which can be time-consuming. When you upgrade to Washington DC from a previous family release, AI Search does not automatically reindex the User table indexed source. If you need to be able to search the latest configuration for user records, you can [manually reindex](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) the User table indexed source, which may take some time. Otherwise, AI Search will reindex individual User table records as they're updated until all records have been reindexed.

[Xanadu Patch 3](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=xanadu-patch-3&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US):

-   After you upgrade to Xanadu Patch 3 from an earlier release, make knowledge block content searchable by reindexing all your indexed sources that include knowledge articles. For details on reindexing, see [Index or reindex an indexed source](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) or [Index or reindex multiple indexed sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-multiple-sources-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 Xanadu:

 After you upgrade to Xanadu from an earlier release, perform the following steps to add the Dashboards, data visualizations, and KPIs navigation tabs to global search results in AI Search for Next Experience:

1.  Update the AI Search for Next Experience ServiceNow Store application to version 4 or later. For update instructions, see [Update an application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_InstallUpdates&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
2.  Commit the update set provided in the [AI Search for Next Experience 4.0 PAR tables update sets \(KB1644544\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1644544) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. To learn more about update sets, see [System update sets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=system-update-sets&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

Washington DC

</td><td>

-   **\([Washington DC Patch 9](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=washingtondc-patch-9&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)\) [Knowledge block content indexing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

When you index knowledge articles for search, AI Search now includes content from knowledge blocks to improve search recall.

-   **[__AND then OR 2+ key terms__ option for multi-term search queries](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=system-properties-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Improve search performance for queries with two search terms using the new **AND then OR 2+ key terms** value for the **Boolean search operator to use when a search query includes multiple terms** \(**glide.ais.query.search\_operator**\) system property. When this value is set, AI Search only performs [automatic query resubmission](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-query-resubmission-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) if the search query includes more than two search terms after stop words are removed. **AND then OR 2+ key terms** is the default value for instances zBooted in Washington DC.

-   **[Natural Language Query Genius Results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=genius-result-nlq-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Surface relevant search results from large source tables by adding Natural Language Query \(NLQ\) Genius Results to your AI Search applications. NLQ Genius Results interpret your searches using plain language to find source tables with relevant results. The NLQ Genius Result answer card displays the suggested source tables, combining results from Analytics Overview and CMDB table queries. You can preview records from each suggested table directly from the Genius Result answer card.

-   **[Semantic vector search](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=semantic-search-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Find results that match the meaning and intent of your search terms. Semantic vector search is an alternate search mode that overrides the default lexical search mode. Now Assist in Virtual Agent uses semantic vector search to retrieve Catalog Items and topics. Now Assist in AI Search uses semantic vector search to find cached answers for Now Assist Q&amp;A Genius Results.

-   **\([Xanadu Patch 3](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=xanadu-patch-3&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)\) [Knowledge block content indexing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

When you index knowledge articles for search, AI Search now includes content from knowledge blocks to improve search recall.

-   **[NLQ Genius Results support searching for multiple CMDB tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=genius-result-nlq-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

When your search includes terms that could match multiple CMDB tables, NLQ Genius Result answers display a drop-down list of potential CMDB table matches for each affected term. Use these drop-down lists to select the CMDB tables that you want to surface information for.

-   **[Middle dot support for Japanese](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=international-language-support-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Increase search precision for Japanese phrases that include nakaguro \(中黒, middle dot\) characters. When indexing Japanese text or searching in Japanese, AI Search preserves individual terms separated by a nakaguro instead of merging them into a single term.

-   **[Synonym matching and expansion retains terms defined as stop words](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=synonyms-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

When evaluating synonym matches and expansions, AI Search retains search query terms defined as stop words. This behavior helps ensure that synonym matches return consistent results no matter which version of a synonym a user searches for.

-   **[Field changes on AI Search Genius Result Configuration form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=genius-result-cfg-form-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

When displaying reference field values as facet refinement filters, AI Search uses field value translations for the search user's language if available. If no translations are available for the user's language, AI Search uses translations for the system language.

-   **[Late binding security implementation preserves correct click rank search signals](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=content-security-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

When late binding security removes inaccessible results, click rank search signals correctly reflect the final result ordering.

-   **[Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-multi-content-qna-genius-results&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have Now Assist in AI Search installed, Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results are supported in global and workspace search. Activating Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results in global or workspace search profiles overrides all other Genius Result configurations, so that global and workspace searches only display Genius Result answers from Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results. Virtual Agent topic citations from Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Result answers in global or workspace search open the selected topic in the Now Assist panel so the user can continue their conversation on that topic.

-   **[Search Suggestions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=search-suggestions-overview&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Search administrators with the ais\_admin granular admin role can access all Search Suggestions tables. Assign search administrators this role to eliminate needless propagation of full admin access.

-   **[Consumer-grade search experience for search portals](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=viewing-search-results-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The search results page for search portals has been revised to offer a more intuitive and consistent experience. Navigation tabs have been replaced with source facet buckets. All search results now open in a new browser tab, preserving your search in the existing browser tab. Facet buckets now show minimum search result counts, reflecting results removed by late binding content security. Search terms are no longer highlighted in search results.

-   **[Consumer-grade search experience for global search and workspace search](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-ais-next-experience-app&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The search results page for global search and workspace search has been revised to offer a more intuitive and consistent experience. Navigation tabs have been replaced with source facet buckets. All search results now open in a new browser tab, preserving your search in the existing browser tab. Facet buckets now show minimum search result counts, reflecting results removed by late binding content security. A new **glide.ui.ais.show\_all\_facets** system property enables you to display facets from all sources when no source is selected. \(The default behavior is to hide facets until a source is selected.\) Search terms are no longer highlighted in search results.

-   **[Sort facet buckets alphabetically](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-facet-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
