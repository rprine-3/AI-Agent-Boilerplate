Xanadu

</td><td>

-   Service Exchange 2.x.x that is being released with the Xanadu release does not support migration of the Service Exchange \(Legacy\) versions. If you are using a Service Exchange \(Legacy\) version, before you upgrade to the Xanadu release, you must follow instructions in the [Service Exchange for Providers \(Legacy\) - Migration Utility \(KB1499823\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1499823) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to migrate your configuration data.
-   If you are upgrading from version 1.x.x of Service Exchange, follow the steps listed in [Upgrade Guide - Service Exchange for Providers and Consumers application \(v2.x.x release - KB1700387\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1700387) to migrate your Service Exchange applications.
-   Due to the introduction of mismatched version support, new entitlements cannot be activated until both the consumers and providers upgrade to the Xanadu release. Older active entitlements will continue to work but new ones cannot be activated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   When using Service Exchange for Providers and Service Exchange for Consumers in a single instance, you must upgrade both applications simultaneously to the same version to maintain compatibility.
-   The Service Exchange Global Script Include is automatically installed or updated when you install the Service Exchange application on the following platform versions:
    -   Washington DC Patch 9
    -   Xanadu Patch 4
    -   Yokohama
-   Service Exchange 2.x.x, which was first released with the Xanadu release, does not support migration of Service Exchange \(Legacy\) versions. If you are using a Service Exchange \(Legacy\) version, before you upgrade to the Yokohama release, you must follow instructions in the [Service Exchange for Providers \(Legacy\) - Migration Utility \[KB1499823\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1499823) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to migrate your configuration data.
-   If you are upgrading from Service Exchange version 1.x.x, follow the steps in [Upgrade Guide - Service Exchange for Providers and Consumers application \(v2.x.x release\) \[KB1700387\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1700387) to migrate your Service Exchange applications.
-   Due to the introduction of mismatched version support, new entitlements cannot be activated until both the consumers and providers upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.x.x. Older active entitlements will continue to work but new ones cannot be activated.
-   If you upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.0.55 with Sales Customer Relationship Management plug-in version 1.0.4 before upgrading the platform to the Yokohama release, the new Deny ACLs will not be installed. To ensure the Deny ACLs get installed, after upgrading to Yokohama, you must click Repair to reinstall the Service Exchange application.

Between your current release family and Australia, new features were introduced for Service Exchange.

Washington DC

</td><td>

-   **[Error handling through Transport Diagnostics](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-error-log&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track errors on recent transactions, provide the connection status, run the health checks, and provide recommendations.

-   **[Support for variable sets for remote record producers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-variable-sets&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use variable sets and multi-row variable sets with remote record producers to create a collection of variables that can be reused across multiple catalog items.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[Service Exchange mismatched version support](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-mismatch-version&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Providers and consumers can run different versions of the Service Exchange applications without affecting their ability to exchange data. Providers can adopt new features without coordinating their application upgrades with their consumers.

-   **[Configuration revisions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-config-revision&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Providers can develop and deploy new versions or revisions of entitlements with updated functionality to compatible consumers without affecting consumers who have not updated their application. Consumers can therefore use older revisions of entitlements including remote task definitions, remote record producers, and foundation data sync offerings while deploying new revisions.

-   **[Consumer pre-flows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-conf-consumer-flow&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Consumers can control data synchronization with their providers by associating a flow with a Service Exchange remote record producer and run consumer-defined processes, such as approvals, before a task is synchronized to their provider.

-   **[Integration with Sales Customer Relationship Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-omt-intg&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Providers can enable customers to quickly order entitled Sales Customer Relationship Management product offerings from their service catalog by publishing them as remote record producers on consumer instances.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Remote Catalog Item Client Scripts](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-add-scripts-to-rrp&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Provider: Perform more complex tasks and gain better control over the completeness and correctness of catalog requests from the consumer by including catalog client scripts, UI Policy scripts, and other common scripts that consumers can choose to include for Remote Catalog items.

-   **[Copy From Service Catalog Item to Remote Catalog Item](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-copy-catalog-as-rrp&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Providers: Eliminate the need to re-create catalog items manually in the Service Exchange remote catalog by copying single and multiple catalog items through the UI to remote record producers that can be synchronized to the consumer instance.

-   **[Transform Mapping Assist](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-tmt-exploring&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Providers: Streamline the transformation mapping process and reduce errors by generating transform mappings between provider and consumer tables automatically using the Transform Mapping Assist feature that leverages the NOW large language model \(LLM\).

-   **[Consumer Variable Sets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-bridge-v2-consumer-variables&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Consumers: Manage requested content and flow better by adding additional variables to add customization to your remote record producers.
