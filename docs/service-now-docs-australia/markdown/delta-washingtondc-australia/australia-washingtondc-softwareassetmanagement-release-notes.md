# Combined Software Asset Management release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Software Asset Management from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Software Asset Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Software Asset Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Release notes

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Washington DC

</td><td>

After upgrading to Washington DC, you must redo all your customizations related to Adobe and Microsoft 365 integrations with your ServiceNow instance because the functionalities of these integrations are moved to the Software Asset Management – SaaS License Management store application.

-   If you’ve customized an impacted file, the upgrade process skips the file and indicates a conflict. You must manually resolve the conflict and ensure that the old existing file is deleted.
-   If you haven't customized an impacted file, the file gets deleted as part of the upgrade, and a file with a new sys\_id is created.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

After upgrading to the Microsoft Entra ID spoke 4.3 version, the **Microsoft Azure AD - Download Group Membership** directory job isn't executed for existing Microsoft Entra ID SSO or Directory integrations. This directory job also isn't created for new Microsoft Entra ID SSO or Directory integrations. Instead, the **Microsoft Azure AD - Download Groups** directory job downloads all groups and group memberships configured on Microsoft Entra ID.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

Starting from the Yokohama release, all the reconciliation script includes are being moved from the family release to the Software Asset Management store application \(com.sn\_itam\_samp\). When upgrading to Yokohama, if you have made customizations to reconciliation script includes, you must move your customizations to the new script includes. The old script includes will be deprecated.

 When upgrading to Yokohama Patch 1 with the Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 2.1.0 store application installed, you must delete the entitlements for the existing CrowdStrike integration profiles. Then, create new entitlements for various CrowdStrike products, such as CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection and CrowdStrike Falcon Discover, based on their license metrics. These metrics include the Reserved Hourly Average Sensor and Sensor Subscription, which are found under the CrowdStrike License Metric Group.

-   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the Draft state, create new integration profiles and delete the existing ones.
-   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the Published state, their state changes to Draft.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

Starting from the Zurich release, the following workflows are migrated to Flow Designer as flows:

-   Reclamation workflow
-   Procurement Process Flow - Auto allocation enabled

When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the workflows were customized. If you haven't customized the workflows before the upgrade, the fix script deactivates the legacy workflows from the instance and deploys the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. If you have customized the impacted workflows in the previous release, the fix script doesn’t deploy the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. You can view and access the impacted workflows in the instance after the upgrade. However, the deprecated workflows are considered as custom code and ServiceNow doesn’t support those workflows.

 Starting from the Zurich release, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is moved from the family release to the Software Asset Workspace store application. After upgrading to Zurich, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is inactivated and the Software Asset Workspace store application \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is enabled in the instance.

 When upgrading to the Software Asset Management – SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) version 16.0.6 or later in the Zurich release, verify that the Software Asset Workspace store app \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is updated to version 9.0.4.

-   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

-   **Reflow**

The configurable workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%. This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
