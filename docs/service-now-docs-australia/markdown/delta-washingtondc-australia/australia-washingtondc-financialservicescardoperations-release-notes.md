During the upgrade to Yokohama, the Financial Services Card Operations plugin reparents the Card Disputes Transaction table \[sn\_bom\_credit\_card\_disputes\_transaction\] to the Financial Task table \[sn\_bom\_task\] in Financial Services Operations Core.

 Reparenting leverages the benefits and advancements of ServiceNow® Financial Services Operations Core while preserving the functionality of existing applications.

**Note:** If your instance uses the Card Disputes Transaction table \[sn\_bom\_credit\_card\_disputes\_transaction\] and it contains a large amount of data, you may experience increased upgrade times.
