-   **[Keyboard shortcuts](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=next-experience-keyboard-shortcuts&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Forty keyboard shortcuts are now available to help you navigate across configurable workspace pages faster and more effectively without a mouse device.

Shortcuts are contextual to the page that you're on and to the operating system that you're using. View the keyboard shortcuts that are available to you on a particular page through the keyboard shortcut modal. You can open the modal by selecting **Keyboard shortcuts** from the Next Experience User Preferences menu, or by using a keyboard shortcut \(**Control + /** for Windows or **Command + /** for macOS\).

This enhancement helps non-mouse and keyboard-only users or users with mobility issues and cognitive impairments to reduce the time required to complete various tasks.

Previously, a limited number of keyboard shortcuts were available when the **Enable special keyboard shortcuts** Next Experience user preference was turned on. Those shortcuts are included in the new keyboard shortcut framework and are accessible via the new modal. See [Configure Next Experience accessibility preferences](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=next-experience-accessibility-preferences&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) for additional information.
