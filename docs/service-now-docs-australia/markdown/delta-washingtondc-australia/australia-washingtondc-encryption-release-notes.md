# Combined Encryption release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Encryption from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Encryption release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Encryption to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

For the GlideEncrypter API, NIST 800-131A Rev 2 has recommended against using the Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption. The following changes are taking place in the Zurich release with the official removal of 3DES encryption for GlideEncrypter.

-   The GlideEncrypter API defaults to using the Key Management Framework \(KMF\) based algorithm, Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\), for encryption and decryption operations for upgraded instances only.
-   For instances created with the Zurich release or later, this API isn’t supported.
-   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

 In the Zurich release, Column Level Encryption has received a required upgrade to Key Management Framework Column Level Encryption \(KMF-CLE\) due to the platform-wide deprecation of 3DES. For more information about this upgrade, see KB1700704.
