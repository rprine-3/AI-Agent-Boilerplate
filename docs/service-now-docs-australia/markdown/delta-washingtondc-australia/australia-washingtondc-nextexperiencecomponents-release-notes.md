The following accessibility enhancements were made to the Next Experience Components in the Washington DC release.

-   **Support for magnification software and screen readers**

The following Next Experience Components were updated to match programmatic labels to visual labels. This enhancement provides improved support for ZoomText \(a type of magnification software\) and other types of Assistive Technology \(for example, screen readers\).

This enhancement supports users with cognitive and physical disabilities, such as low vision or mobility limitations, who use the ServiceNow platform.

    -   Agent chat \[sn-agent-chat\]
    -   Agent inbox \[sn-agent-inbox\]
    -   Canvas tabs \[sn-canvas-tabs\]
    -   Chat input \[sn-chat-input\]
    -   Chat mention suggestion \[sn-chat-mention-suggestion\]
    -   Checklist \[now-checklist\]
    -   Date time calendar \[now-date-time-calendar\]
    -   Document viewer \[sn-document-viewer\]
    -   Drag and drop \[sn-drag-and-drop\]
    -   Field select \[sn-record-field-list-reorder-list\]
    -   List selector \[sn-list-selector\]
    -   Notification setting popover content \[notification-setting-popover-content\]
    -   Presence popover content \[sn-presence-popover-content\]
-   **Support for reflow**

The following components were updated to support reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) for details.

    -   Timeseries visualization \[now-vis-timeseries-wrapper\]
-   **Support for speech-to-text**

The following Next Experience Components were updated to match visual labels to their accessible labels. If the accessible label is different from the visual label, speech-to-text software can't identify and activate the interactive element. Matched visual and accessible labels enable speech-to-text software, such as Dragon Naturally Speaking, to identify these components in the user interface rather than doing a slow grid-based navigation offered by the speech-to-text assistant technologies.
