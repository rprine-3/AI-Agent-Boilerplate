If you used attribute characteristics in the Standard Price Adjustment matrix in the initial release of the Sales Customer Relationship Management applications, and you're upgrading to the May 2024 release of Sales Customer Relationship Management applications, you must run a scheduled job that corrects the format of the automatically generated **Code** values. Run the **Schedule job to modify code field on characteristic records that contain special characters** on demand job to replace any character that is not a letter \(a-z, A-Z\), a number \(0-9\), an underscore \(\_\), or a dollar sign \($\) with an underscore \(\_\). This job corrects the **Code** value so that it doesn’t start or end with an underscore, doesn’t begin with a digit, and contains no consecutive underscores.

If you’re using the extension point **sn\_csm\_pricing.PricingAdjustmentsExtensionPoint** for pricing adjustments, change the default pricing plan \(introduced in the November 2024 release\) after upgrading. The pricing plan steps for the Configuration Component Price Adjustment and Standard Price Adjustment matrices are not applicable. As pricing admin or manager, remove the steps for these matrices from the default pricing plan.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Pricing** &gt; **Pricing Plans**.
2.  Select the published Default Pricing Plan.
3.  Select **Copy**.
4.  In the pricing plan copy, go to the Pricing Plan steps related list.
5.  Select the rows for the Apply configuration component adjustments step \(Sequence 50\) and the Apply contextual adjustments step \(Sequence 60\) and select **Delete** in the Actions on selected rows menu.
6.  Select **Update**.
7.  Publish the pricing plan copy.

After upgrading to the May 2025 release of Sales Customer Relationship Management applications, you must run a scheduled job that automatically enables the **Allow multiple configurations** option when your catalog admin creates product offerings with an associated product specification. This job is called **Scheduled job with an upgrade script to set 'allow\_multiple\_configurations' to true on an Offering**. When multiple product offering configurations are allowed in configurable opportunities, quotes, or orders, agents can create multiple instances of a child product offering and define custom configurations for each offering instance.

**Note:** The **Allow multiple configurations** option is always enabled \(set to true\) for all product offerings that have an associated product specification. However, if the product specification has a child hierarchy, this option is honored only for orders placed through the TMF APIs. For specifications without a hierarchy, the flag is honored across all ordering channels.

 The May 2025 release provides a default pricing plan that includes a new step, Apply Renewal Adjustment. If you've been using a custom pricing plan from an earlier release, review the default pricing plan, which is in a Retired state after upgrading to the May 2025 release. Determine whether you want to publish the default plan or customize the default pricing plan for your needs and then publish the custom plan to be used.

Pricing Management v15.0.0 provides a default pricing plan that includes new steps to support pricing strategies introduced in this release. If you're using a custom pricing plan from an earlier release, review the default pricing plan, which is in a Retired state after you upgrade. Determine whether you want to publish the default plan or customize the default pricing plan for your needs. The default plan contains new steps for calculating net pricing and roll-up values for configurable products in quotes and orders: Net Price Calculation, Line Rollup, and Header Rollup steps. This pricing functionality existed in previous releases for quotes and orders but wasn’t included in the default pricing plan. To retain this previous functionality for quotes and orders, you must add the Net Price Calculation, Line Rollup, and Header Rollup steps in your custom pricing plan before you publish it for use.

 If you used the legacy product configurator previously and want to use the CPQ Configurator, after upgrading set the **sn\_prd\_pm.enable\_advanced\_configuration** system property to true. When set to true, this property enables the CPQ Configurator.

 If you want to use AI Search for product catalog searches, before upgrading install Now Assist for Sales Force Automation \(SFA\), which includes the plugins needed for AI Search functionality. After upgrading, complete various steps to implement AI Search. These steps include running a scheduled job to set up AI Search and enabling AI Search in the product catalog interface by setting the **enable\_ai\_search\_in\_catalog** system property to true. For details on these configuration steps, see [Configuring AI Search for product catalog search](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-ai-search-prod-catalog&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

Pricing Management v16.0.0 provides a default pricing plan that includes changes to support pricing strategies introduced in this release. If you have been using a custom pricing plan from an earlier release, after upgrading to Pricing Management v16.0.0, the default pricing plan is in a Retired state. Determine whether you want to publish the default pricing plan for use or customize it.

-   **[Pricing extensions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=extension-points-som-pricing&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Override the default pricing logic so that you can use pricing from external systems or define custom pricing logic needed for your business.

-   **[Cost books](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-cost-books&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create cost books that define unit costs for product offerings. Your sales agents use this information in the Quote Management application to view unit costs for products and cost margins when creating quotes.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[Location-based transactions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-location-transaction&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable agents to specify a service location in the product catalog UI and display only the eligible products for that location when they’re adding products to opportunities, quotes, and orders. Agents can create line items for the specified location, as well as copy line items to multiple service or installation locations in the same opportunity, quote, or order. Set up eligibility rules to filter the product catalog, catalog categories, or product offerings by service location.

-   **[Control cascading quantity values in child product offerings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=som-activate-cascade-quantity&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Control how quantity values on top-level product offerings are cascaded to child lines.

-   **[Product offer eligibility](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=product-catalog-managment&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use business rules to filter the product catalog, product categories, and product offerings dynamically, displaying only eligible product offerings for a customer in the product catalog. Define the business rules using product eligibility matrices. If you're using sales agreements, the product catalog displays only the eligible product offers set in the sales agreement.

The November 2024 release provides the following:

    -   Version 2 of product eligibility matrices: Supports eligibility rules based on transaction line attributes along with document header attributes.
    -   System-defined context variables for service locations: Service City, Service State, Service Country, and Service Zip context variables are available to specify service locations in the product eligibility and pricing matrices.
-   **[Product offer bundling with product specifications](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=som-offer-bundles-with-specs&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Support bundling of offers that have an associated product specification or specification hierarchy. For example, you can create a product offer that has an associated product specification and indicate whether to inherit the characteristics from the child specifications in addition to the parent specification.


-   **[Configurable pricing plan](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-pricing-plan&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define the sequence of steps in which pricing rules and calculations are applied. The November 2024 release provides a default pricing plan. You can customize the default plan by copying it and then adding new steps, modifying existing steps, changing the sequence of steps, and adding conditions for running an existing step.

-   **[Subscription revenue metrics](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=som-subscription-pricing&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

View system-calculated recurring revenue amounts for product and service subscriptions in opportunities and quotes. These amounts help sales agents and sales managers assess the financial value of monthly and annual subscriptions.

-   **[Sales Agreement price lists](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=pricing-management&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you're using the Sales Agreement feature, a published sales agreement price list is generated automatically when a sales agent creates a sales agreement from a completed quote. The sales agreement price list reflects the final unit price for each product captured in the sales agreement and is valid for the start and end dates specified for the agreement. To learn more about sales agreements, see [Sales Agreement Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sales-agreement-mgmt&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

The November 2024 release supports hierarchical price lists and multiple price lists for a sales agreement. Hierarchical price lists enable agents to negotiate different pricing for an offer depending on whether it is sold in the context of a bundle or parent offer or as a standalone product. If multiple price lists exist for a sales agreement, the default price list used is based on currency and the sales agreement. Agents can select from different options, products, and characteristics within a configurable bundle or product, which determines what is available as part of the sales agreement and resulting order.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Product offering recommendations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=product-catalog-managment&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Provide sales agents with offer recommendations for upselling or cross-selling additional products in quotes. Product catalog admins create the offer recommendations for sellable products. Sales agents can view the recommendations when adding products to quotes from the product catalog or when reviewing the lines items for a quote.

-   **[Product catalog and product configurator in the Business Portal for Order Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=order-mgt-create-an-order-using-customer-portal&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable customers to view the product catalog and order products using the product configurator in the Business Portal for Order Management.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Create configurable offerings and blueprints](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=som-create-configurable-prod-offerings&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable product catalog admins to generate blueprints for configurable products using the CPQ Configurator. A blueprint contains the product attributes, product relationships, product and pricing rules, and child products that control the structure of a configurable product offering. It also contains configuration rules, such as inclusion, exclusion, and determination. Blueprints drive the agent and customer experience when configurable products are added using the configurator. Catalog admins can review and update an offering blueprint in the CPQ Configurator, then publish the product offering to the product catalog.

-   **[AI Search queries in the product catalog interface](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-ai-search-prod-catalog&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable semantic search features that agents and customers can use in the product catalog to find relevant product offerings. Users can search by product offer attributes, characteristics, and child offerings, and also view auto-complete suggestions. AI Search supports queries with synonyms, multi-languages, Boolean operators, and auto-correction \(typo handling\). Product catalog admins can configure stop words, synonyms, and rules that control the search results displayed.

-   **[Complex characteristics](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=som-product-config-add-characteristics&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Product Catalog Management Core v13.0, enable product catalog admins to define product and specification characteristics using an object-based structure that supports the following data types: integer, decimal, date and date time, and data arrays. For example, product catalog admins can use these new data types to define characteristics for communication products, such as routing characteristics, that have nested levels of characteristics and characteristic options. These complex characteristics can then be used to define conditions for setting decomposition, attribute propagation, and compatibility rules.

    -   Agents can view and select the complex characteristics available for configurable product offerings when creating opportunities, quotes, and orders. Complex attributes are displayed as separate nodes in the product hierarchy tree of the legacy product configurator interface.
    -   Fulfillment agents can perform fulfillment tasks that capture complex characteristic data for new or MACD orders.
    -   Customers can view and select complex characteristics when using the Business Portal to order configurable products.
**Note:**  Complex characteristics aren’t supported in the CPQ Configurator.


-   **[Derived product pricing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-related-product-pricing&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define dynamic product pricing relationships between products, where the price for a product is derived from the price of another product or transaction-level values, such as the total quote value or annual contract value \(ACV\). When sales or order agents add the product to a quote or order, they can see how the product price is derived in real time.

-   **[Price and quantity ramps](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=defining-products-with-ramps&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable product catalog admins to identify configurable product offerings for which pricing ramps can be created. These product offerings must also have the recurring pricing method. Sales agents create price ramps for quote lines that define and schedule pricing and quantity changes as product deals evolve over a given time period.

-   **[Product pricing changes related to MACD activities](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=net-pricing-sp-contracts&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Support different price bases, such as original prices, fresh prices, or zero prices, used to calculate pricing for products during MACD activities.

-   **[Cost-based attribute adjustments](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-cost-attribute-adjustment&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable pricing admins or managers to set different product costs based on product attributes, such as model or size, by using cost book-specific or product offering-based adjustments for cost book lines. Previously, only a single cost amount was captured for a product offering, even if the product had different attributes that affected the product cost. These adjustments determine the base product cost used to calculate profit margins for sales agents when they create quotes for customers.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Product families](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=product-catalog-managment&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create product families to provide hierarchical classification similar to category trees. For example, you can use product families to roll up or aggregate measurable items, such as revenue forecasts for reporting or business insights.


-   **[Support manual pricing adjustments in the Sales CRM Pricing API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sales-crm-pricing-api&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Pass manual pricing adjustments as part of a pricing request payload using the Pricing API. External systems can include adjustment values directly in a pricing run, rather than fetch manual adjustments from the pricing database when running pricing calculations.

-   **[Support external IDs in the Sales CRM Pricing API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sales-crm-pricing-api&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Submit pricing requests that use custom external IDs or codes to reference objects from external systems, such as product offerings, price lists, and cost books. Set a request-level flag that indicates external IDs are to be used for these objects rather than sys\_ids. For additional information, see [External ID support in Sales CRM Pricing API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=external-ids-pricingapi&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Renewal pricing for products with price and quantity ramps](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=defining-products-with-ramps&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Calculate renewal pricing for products with price and quantity ramps, using per year, per term, and price only uplift calculation methods.

-   **[Derived pricing support for sold products](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-related-product-pricing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Use the `DerivedProductPriceExtensionPoint` extension to determine whether a source line for a quote or sold product and a target line are pairs.
    -   Use the `getAccountLevelDerivedPricedProductsLookupData(pricingEngineContext)` method to control the records scanned by the pricing engine to determine account-level derived prices for sold products.
    -   The pricing engine does the following:
        -   Displays a message indicating when a change to a source product affects the price of a derived product.
        -   Checks product offerings and excludes product offerings with child offerings from derived pricing.
-   **[Multi-attribute pricing rules](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=som-create-pricing-adjustment&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Display attribute-based pricing on transaction lines, where the offer price is determined by the combination of attributes, by setting up attribute-based pricing for product offerings based on multiple, combined attributes using the Attribute Adjustment matrix.

-   **[Blended pricing support for contract renewals](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=pricing-management&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable sales agents to apply automatically calculated blended unit prices for renewals, based on the existing product price and the renewal uplift required. Blended pricing is used in upsell and down-sell scenarios and in contract line consolidation.
