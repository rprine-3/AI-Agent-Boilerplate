For the latest MID Server system requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US). The minimum JRE version supported is 11.0.9 and the recommended version is 11.0.16.1.

 If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to ensure that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

-   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
-   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.

 All MID Server host machines require access to the download site at `install.service-now.com` to enable auto-upgrades. For additional details, read how the system manages [MID Server upgrades](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 Only one Windows MID Server service is permitted per executable path. Upgraded Windows MID Servers that have multiple services pointing to the same installation folder can’t start. See [MID Server fails to start](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-startup-fails&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[ITOM Infra Services Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=itom-infra-srv-wrksp-mid&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The workspace provides real-time monitoring, proactive alerts, automation of common tasks, and centralized diagnostics to reduce downtime and support tickets.

-   **[MID Guardian Agent](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-guardian&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The MID Guardian Agent is an advanced AI feature within the MID Server ecosystem/ITOM Infra Services workspace, designed to proactively assist users in diagnosing and resolving issues related to configuration, connectivity, upgrades, and operations. By intelligently analyzing logs, signals, and runtime behaviors, it offers guided troubleshooting steps, automated fixes, and predictive insights. This significantly reduces Mean Time to Repair \(MTTR\) and enhances the reliability and operational efficiency of the MID server.

-   **[MID Server Password2 global policy change](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-module-access-policy&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new "Reject" default behavior of the module access policies \(MAPs\) to help prevent any unauthorized access, unless explicitly declared in MAP records. All required MAPs for internal access are provided. Auto-generated MAPs are provided for external access.

-   **[MID Server unique logged-in users](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_SetupMIDServerRole&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use unique logged in users for each MID Server. See [\(KB1552863\) MID Server Unique Logged In User](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1552863) for more information.

-   **[Improved wrapper configuration override](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable the debug logs at the dist-upgrade wrapper level and test the changes by modifying the configuration with **upgrade-wrapper-override.conf**. For example, the default timeout may not be long enough for certain JVM level commands. You can increase the timeout with **upgrade-wrapper-override.conf** for the dist-upgrade wrapper configuration.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[MID Server supports and requires a minimum JRE version 17](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The MID Server is compiled using Java 17 and is incompatible with any Java version below 17 for runtime execution. The MID Server is bundled with version 17.0.12 and the minimum JRE version supported is 17.0.10. See the [MID Server JRE Minimum Version Requirement Update to JRE 17 Starting from Yokohama Release \[KB1704368\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704368) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base for information about required procedures before upgrading the instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Smart Workload Manager in clusters](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_ConfigureAMIDServerCluster&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

MID Servers in a cluster now assign jobs based on the true load, using a variety of criteria. The smart workload manager continuously evaluates the queue size, execution time, CPU usage, and buffer size. The manager then assigns tasks to ensure that no server is overloaded.

-   **[Enhancements to MID Server logging and JFR](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerTroubleshooting&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

MID Server logging has been improved with log backups that are preserved in a compressed format on local host with option to fetch to the instance. You can enable JFR logs every four hours and backup JFR files for a set time.

-   **[MID Server has improved performance during heavy discovery load](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

MID Servers no longer have performance degradation due to script include cache misses when using large amounts of worker threads.

MID Server now supports PowerShell 7, while maintaining backward compatibility with PowerShell 5.1. This update enhances security, accelerates onboarding, and reduces deployment blockers through improved runtime detection and comprehensive test coverage.

-   **[Configure the MID Server for CyberArk CCP](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_ConfigureTheMIDServerForCyberArkCCP&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

MID Server's CyberArk integration adds a REST-based CCP option alongside the existing AIM SDK method, providing flexible, interchangeable integration choices. This additional option can reduce dependency overhead and enables you to choose between the AIM SDK and REST-based approaches according to your requirements.

-   **[Smart Workload Manager in clusters](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_ConfigureAMIDServerCluster&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

MID Servers in a cluster now assign jobs based on the true load, using a variety of criteria. The smart workload manager continuously evaluates the queue size, execution time, CPU usage, and buffer size. The manager then assigns tasks to ensure that no server is overloaded.

-   **[MID Server is bundled with Java Runtime Environment 21](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

MID Server comes bundled with Java Runtime Environment version 21.0.7 and requires a minimum JRE version 17.0.10. The installer automatically configures Java 21.0.7 to run in your environment. If you have installed your own JRE, see the **Important information for upgrading MID Server to Australia** section to ensure your JRE is compatible.
