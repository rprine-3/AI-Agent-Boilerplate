# Combined Authentication release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Authentication from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Authentication release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Authentication to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Continuous Authentication](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ca-homepage&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Continuous Authentication to require step-up authentication or re-authentication to the users before allowing access to sensitive or high-privilege information.

-   **[OAuth Grant Types for MID Server](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oauth-outbound&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Authorization code, resource owner password credential, SAML bearer, and JWT bearer OAuth grant types of OAuth for outbound integration requests through the MID Server. Personal Auth is also supported through the MID server. MID Servers facilitate communication and data movement between a single ServiceNow® instance and external applications, data sources, and services.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Machine Identity Console](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=machine-identity-console&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Manage your inbound integration with ServiceNow's Machine Identity Console. Inbound integration in Machine Identity Console provides a simplified configuration experience for your inbound integrations.

-   **[Multi-factor Authentication dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mfa-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new MFA Dashboard to understand insights such as MFA user enrollment, privileged admins who haven't opted in to MFA, and compliance. You can verify that all users have MFA enabled for enhanced security with the help of the MFA Dashboard.

-   **[Multi-factor Authentication Guided Setup](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mfa-guided-setup&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new MFA Guided setup to configure multi-factor Authentication \(MFA\) for users who currently log in to ServiceNow with only a user name and password. This update enhances security by guiding administrators through the MFA setup process and verifying that all users are protected with an additional layer of authentication.


-   **[Attributes for OIDC](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=idp-attributes-oidc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Identity Provider \(IDP\) Attributes received from the OIDC response from the Identity Provider as a filter criteria for authentication.

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Authentication factors for AI voice service](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=authentication-factors&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable caller access to AI voice agents by configuring the required identification and authentication factors.

-   **[Web Embeddables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=web-embeddables&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Secure the web embeddables feature for authenticating the ServiceNow®'s web components that are used in third-party portals.

-   **[Granular admin roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=granular-admin-roles&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The granular admin role enables developers and administrators to complete administrative configuration tasks for Authentication without requiring the full admin role.

    -   Display of active SAML and OIDC Identity Providers \(IdPs\) on the ServiceNow platform and portal login pages.
    -   Assign users to specific groups during SAML and OIDC auto-provisioning.
    -   Set up OIDC with the same well-known URL. The OIDC configurations can use the same well-known URL of the IdPs for multiple SSO records.
    -   Display login failure reasons to the users who logged out of ServiceNow due to session expiry or other reasons. Use the login link on the external logout page to again log in to ServiceNow in case of successful logout.
    -   Display of a generic error message for unsuccessful single log out.
    -   Enhanced email notifications for SAML certificate and Encryption Key store update.

    -   You can provide a JSON Web Key Set \(JWKS\) URL to automatically manage and update the public key for JSON Web Tokens \(JWT\) signature validation.
    -   You can request OAuth tokens using the JWT grant type signed with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm \(ES\) signing algorithms, including ES256, ES384, and ES512, for inbound JSON Web Tokens \(JWT\). It also supports RS256, RS384, RS512, HS256, HS384, and HS512.
    -   You can customize the JWT ID \(JTI\) claim name in both inbound OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) and JWT Bearer flows.

Following are the OAuth enhancements:

    -   Use **Opaque** or **JWT** token option for your inbound integration endpoints.
    -   Use the **Allow access only to APIs in selected scope** option to enable access to the APIs that are explicitly listed in the selected scopes for your inbound integrations.
    -   Use the OAuth Entity Resource tab for outbound integrations to configure resource parameters so they flow into the OAuth token request and are reflected in the token from your OAuth provider.
