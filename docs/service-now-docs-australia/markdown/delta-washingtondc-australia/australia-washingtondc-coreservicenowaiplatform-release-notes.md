# Combined Core ServiceNow AI Platform release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Core ServiceNow AI Platform from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Core ServiceNow AI Platform release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Core ServiceNow AI Platform to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Washington DC

</td><td>

Previously, if a transaction was canceled, certain auditable operations were not being recorded. This behavior of missing audit records is because the platform executes some operations between the record change and is canceled before audit creation. But now, audits are created immediately after the record is changed, reducing the chance of a canceled transaction aborting the operation before the audit is recorded. To facilitate this update, audits are now recorded in the same thread as the transaction. Earlier audits were created in a background thread.

 This change redefines the default value of the `glide.db.audit.lazy` property from true to false. Ideally, this property is not defined in the Properties table, which means that the majority of instances start using the new default value and behavior with the Washington DC release. On some instances, this property may have been inserted with the value set to true, which means that these instances won’t be able to use this change to audit behavior. Delete this property to leverage this update.
