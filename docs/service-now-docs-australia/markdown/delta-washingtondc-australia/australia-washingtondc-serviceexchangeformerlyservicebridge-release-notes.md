## Important information for upgrading Service Exchange \(formerly Service Bridge\) to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

**Important:** Do not upgrade your ServiceNow® instance to the Australia release if you rely on Service Exchange. A known RPS issue prevents Service Exchange from functioning correctly. Proceed with the upgrade only after Australia Patch 1 becomes available.

-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x, which was first released with the Xanadu release, doesn’t support migration of Service Exchange \(Legacy\) versions.

Service Exchange \(Legacy\) version: Before you upgrade to the Australia release, consult the [Service Exchange for Providers \(Legacy\) - Migration Utility \[KB1499823\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1499823) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your configuration data.

-   Service Exchange version 1.x.x: When upgrading, consult the [Upgrade Guide - Service Exchange for Providers and Consumers application \(v2.x.x release\) \[KB1700387\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1700387) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your Service Exchange applications.
-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x: New entitlements that require the latest compatibility version cannot be activated until both consumers and providers upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.x.x. New entitlements configured with a lower compatibility version can be activated. Older active entitlements continue to work but new ones can’t be activated.
-   When using Service Exchange for Providers and Service Exchange for Consumers in a single instance, you must upgrade both applications simultaneously to the same version to maintain compatibility. If the versions diverge, a scan check will report version mismatches and the Health Dashboard will show a version mismatch issue. After upgrading, run and validate the post‑upgrade scan suite to identify and resolve any post‑upgrade issues.
-   If you have upgraded to Service Exchange version 2.0.55 before upgrading the platform to the Australia release and your instance has Sales Customer Relationship Management plug-in version 1.0.4 installed, the new Deny ACLs aren't installed. After upgrading to the Australia release, select Repair to reinstall the Service Exchange application to ensure Deny ACLs are installed.
-   When you install the Service Exchange application, the Service Exchange Global script include is automatically installed or updated on the following platform versions:
    -   Yokohama
    -   Zurich
    -   Australia

Detect problems early, understand connection status, and resolve issues efficiently with the Service Exchange center, a centralized interface that provides real-time visibility into scan check issues, connection health and statuses, and access to all Service Exchange scan suites. Service Exchange admins can access their respective centers through the Provider and Consumer center links in the navigation menu.
