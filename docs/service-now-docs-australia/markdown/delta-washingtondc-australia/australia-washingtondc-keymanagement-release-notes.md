# Combined Key Management release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Key Management from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Key Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Key Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

-   In pre-Zurich releases, the GlideEncrypter API used the three-key Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption standard, which [NIST 800-131A Rev 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf) has recommended against using after 2023. The following changes are taking place in the Australia release in preparation for a full deprecation of GlideEncrypter/3DES in the future:
    -   New Australia instances can’t use GlideEncrypter. All base system scripts have been changed to use alternative encryption processes.
    -   if you’re upgrading your Australia instances, you can still GlideEncrypter, which has been updated to use AES256-GCM encryption via the Key Management Framework.
    -   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

GlideDigest has been updated to allow creation and verification of message digests using the SHA512 cryptographic hash function.

-   **Offline key exchange to share module keys between instances**

Admins can share module keys between instances offline to facilitate instance clones between on-premise instances using KMF.

-   **[Sign and verify JSON web tokens \(JWT\) through KMFCryptoOperation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=KMFCryptoOperationBothAPI&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The signing and verification processes for JWTs are now integrated as operation types in the existing KMFCryptoOperation class.

-   **Centralized Crypto Management console**

Use the new Crypto Management Console to streamline and track the certificate management lifecycle. The new console scans your instance for certificates and displays their details in a central location,

-   **Clone and restore support for on-premise instances**

Support for cloning and restoring on-premise instances. Support has also been added from migrating a commercial instance to on-premise instances, and vice-versa.

-   **Certificate Revocation List \(CRL\) validation support**
