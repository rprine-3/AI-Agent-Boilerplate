-   **[Explore](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-sandboxes&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

View the total, available, and allocated sandboxes in your instance by using the Sandbox Management home dashboard. The dashboard also displays information about each sandbox, including the status, data utilization, owner, when the sandbox was last accessed, and when the sandbox was allocated.

-   **[Using sandbox templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-sandbox-template&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable your delegated developers to reuse the data so that they can test their changes without manually inputting the data every time.

-   **[Create a Data Generation Profile](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-data-generation-profile&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable your customers to generate the data for testing within the context of developer sandboxes, but also independently of sandboxes.

**Note:** Developer Sandboxes can't copy all the instance data. Data generation profiles enable a statistical sampling of data from selected tables with curated mappings to populate the sandbox with the data needed for building an application.

-   **[Allocate a sandbox](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=allocating-sandboxes&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Allocate the sandboxes that were created to your development teams.

-   **[Retire sandboxes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=retire-sandboxes&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Retire outdated sandboxes to make room for the new sandboxes in your instance.

-   **[Automatically backed up update sets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dev-sbx-clone-upgrade-info&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you install Developer Sandboxes on an instance after Zurich Patch 5, update sets are automatically backed up when the instance is upgraded.

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[New granular roles for administration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dsb-installed-with&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Several new granular roles enable developers to complete administrative and configuration tasks without requiring the full admin role.

-   **[Support for separate indices for AI Search](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-sandboxes&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

AI Search \(AIS\) now maintains separate indices for each sandbox environment, ensuring development activities that rely on AIS are correctly supported.

**Note:** The AIS integration with Developer Sandboxes is supported only on non-production environments.

-   **[Upgrade enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dev-sbx-clone-upgrade-info&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After an upgrade, Developer Sandboxes now recreates the sandboxes on an instance and automatically backs up update sets to the base instance.

-   **[Queuing for successive sandbox creation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=allocating-sandboxes&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

To improve performance, Developer Sandboxes has implemented queuing when multiple sandboxes are created in succession.

-   **[SSO support for vanity URLs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dev-sbx-general-guidelines&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Instances with vanity URLs can now support Single Sign-On \(SSO\).

-   **[Schema change for shared tables isolates the table](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dsb-installed-with&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

To ensure configuration consistency, if you make a schema change, such as adding a column, to a shared table, the table now becomes an isolated table on the sandbox that initiated the schema change.

-   **[New vibe coding documentation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vibe-coding-landing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Documentation is now available that introduces vibe coding, which is a natural language approach to application development in ServiceNow, including how to get started, when to use it, and how it fits within the broader suite of AI-powered development tools.
