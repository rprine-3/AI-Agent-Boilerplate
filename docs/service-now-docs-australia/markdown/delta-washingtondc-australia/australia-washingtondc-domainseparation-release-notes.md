## How to use this page

-   **[Post-Production Domain Separation Activation Utility](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=post-prod-domain-sep-utility&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Begin using domain separation on a live environment with the guided Post-Production Domain Separation Activation Utility.

-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key delete-by-domain\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=delete-by-domain&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Domain Admins may now delete by domain to efficiently manage domains and reduce storage overhead. The tool also includes data recovery and retention, enabling rollbacks and retention policy setting.

-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key domain-job-manger\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=domain-job-manger&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Changes to the domain table are now queued sequentially and batched into a single background job. This helps simplify domain table updates. Users are notified when a job needs to be delayed as well when a job needs to start.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[AI Agent for Domain Visibility Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=domain-sep-aia&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new AI agent to manage domain visibility through natural language conversations. Domain administrators can ask the agent to query visibility by user, validate that visibility is not redundant or oversized, and take direct actions to add or remove visibility settings. The agent supports end-to-end workflows so administrators can complete multistage visibility management tasks without leaving the conversational interface. Install the Domain Separation AI Agent plugin to enable this capability.

-   **[Global Domain Upgraded Process Overrides Report](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_view-upgraded-overriden-domains&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

System and domain administrators can now track and review process overrides that are affected by global process upgrades. A new admin dashboard provides a comprehensive list of impacted overrides with filtering and sorting by date and process type. Use the scriptable API to build custom integrations or automations on top of the override tracking data.

-   **[Domain Visibility Performance Improvements for Large MSPs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_ViewDomainRelationships&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Domain visibility queries now complete in under one second on average — a 70% reduction from the previous 3.2 second average for large instances. A new query optimization replaces multiple OR conditions with a single IN clause on the domain ID for instances that exceed the configured domain collection size threshold. All 785 Domain Separation customers benefit from faster queries, with the greatest impact for the 20 customers operating 10,000 or more domains.
