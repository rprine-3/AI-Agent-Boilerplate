-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Yokohama Patch 5, Now Assist usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: Now Assist Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).

-   **[Automated obligation extraction](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmpro-na-reminder-agentic-wf&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the manage contract repository agentic workflow to automatically identify and capture key contractual obligations from signed contracts and create obligation records in the contract repository. The AI agent in the manage contract repository agentic workflow uses the Now Assist Contract obligation extraction skill to extract key contractual obligations from contracts.

-   **[Using contract playbook to review AI-extracted obligations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmpro-na-review-obligations&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Review extracted obligations in the contract playbook, with options to edit, approve, or reject each obligation. Approved obligations are added as obligation records in the contract repository while rejected obligations are deactivated.

-   **[Contract obligation extraction skill in Now Assist in Contract Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cncore-conf-obligation-extraction&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure and map use cases for obligation extraction skill in the Now Assist Admin console to automatically extract key contractual obligations from signed contracts. The AI agent in the manage contract repository agentic workflow uses the Now Assist Contract obligation extraction skill to extract key contractual obligations from contracts.

-   **[Conversational contract search and insights Workflow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmpro-agentic-use-conv-search&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Contract documents are often complex and stored across multiple formats and repositories, making keyword-based search inefficient and error-prone. The new Now Assist powered conversational search feature enables you to search contract documents using natural language and dialogue-driven queries.

The conversational search feature does not support searching within contract documents that are scanned PDFs.

-   **[Some Now Assist skills are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill is turned on automatically \(the skill was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[Now LLM LTS support for Contract Management Pro](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-llm-model-updates&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Review AI results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmpro-na-review-ai&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the playbook within a contract repository record to review the metadata extracted by the AI agents in the Manage contract repository agentic workflow. You can make necessary changes to the extracted information, and submit it to update the contract repository. If the contract end date is available, the **Review contract reminders** tab appears in the playbook, enabling you to review and update the AI-calculated contract reminder date and specify recipients for contract renewal or terminations.

-   ****
-   **[Select large language models for use cases in Now Assist in Contract Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmpro-na-manage-llm&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Select a large language models \(LLM\) provider at for a contract analysis or metadata extraction use case. The selected LLM is applicable only for the specific use case and overrides the LLM selected for Now Assist in Contract Management skills.


-   **[Manage contract repository agentic workflow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmpro-na-reminder-agentic-wf&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Manage contract repository agentic workflow to improve productivity by autonomously creating milestone reminders for the notice period of contract renewals or the notice period for termination of contract renewals.

    |Agentic workflows|Description|
    |-----------------|-----------|
    |Manage contract repository|Uses AI agents to retrieve contract details such as renewal notice period, termination notice period, or auto-renewal clause information, and determine the average lead time for similar contracts to create contract milestone reminders for the notice period of contract renewals or the notice period for termination of contract renewals.|
