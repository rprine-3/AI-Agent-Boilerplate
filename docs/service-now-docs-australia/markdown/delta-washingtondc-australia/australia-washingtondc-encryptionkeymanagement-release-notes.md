Washington DC

</td><td>

If you upgrade your instance to Washington DC but don’t upgrade your MID Server, Secrets Management authentication fails. Avoid authentication failures by upgrading your MID Server to Washington DC. If you can’t upgrade, you must turn off authentication until MID Server is upgraded to Washington DC to avoid authentication failures.

 For details on MID Server upgrades, see [MID Server upgrades](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   The GlideEncrypter API uses the three-key Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption standard which [NIST 800-131A Rev 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf) has recommended against using after 2023. The following changes are taking place in the Yokohama release in preparation for a full deprecation of GlideEncrypter/3DES in the future.
    -   New Yokohama instances can’t use GlideEncrypter. All base system scripts have been changed to use alternative encryption processes.
    -   if you’re upgrading your Yokohama instances, you can still use 3DES, but you can also disable 3DES usage with a system property.
    -   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

-   In previous releases, the GlideEncrypter API used the three-key Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption standard, which [NIST 800-131A Rev 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf) has recommended against using after 2023. The following changes are taking place in the Zurich release in preparation for a full deprecation of GlideEncrypter/3DES in the future:
    -   New Zurich instances can’t use GlideEncrypter. All base system scripts have been changed to use alternative encryption processes.
    -   if you’re upgrading your Zurich instances, you can still GlideEncrypter, which has been updated to use AES256-GCM encryption via the Key Management Framework.
    -   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

Washington DC

</td><td>

-   **[PostgreSQL database support](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dare-overview&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Support the PostgreSQL databases for primary, secondary, read replica, gateway \(shard\), and Logical Corruption Protection \(LCP\) databases for cloud encryption. LCP databases are a variant of the read replica database.

-   **[Trusted timestamps within the Code Signing framework](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=code-signing-landing&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

View when a signature is issued by using timestamped Key Management Framework \(KMF\) Signature \[sn\_kmf\_record\_signature\] records.

-   **[Reusable key for agent-to-agent credential sharing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=client-access-secret-landing&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure client-side asymmetric key pairs for API authentication. With the reusable key feature, every conceptual cryptographic module has only one active conceptual key at any point, generated on the client side and wrapped with its respective public key.

-   **[Simplified process for 3DES deprecation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=check-3des&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Remove GlideEncrypter by using the guidance from the improved user interface for 3DES deprecation. Within the critical update app in Security Center, you can find information about the full and partial deprecation of 3DES, and view all impacted legacy password2 fields before deprecating 3DES.

-   **[Property-driven multi-layer caller inspection for Code Signing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=code-sign-properties&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Increase the number of caller layers to be validated during the ECC queue notarization to improve security. Starting in Washington DC, the number of validated caller layers is driven by a system property.

-   **[Switch between ServiceNow Root of Trust \(ROT\) and your own ROT](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=change-rot-overview&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Switch between ServiceNow Root of Trust \(ROT\) and your own ROT.

-   **[Changes to Code Signing requirements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=code-signing-landing&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

As a part of improving security around Root of Trust, signing of script and attachments records can only be done on your trusted non-production instance or using the standalone signing tool. The exception is notarization, which can still be performed in the protected production instance.

-   **[Enhancement requests for the Code Signing Standalone signing tool](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sa-code-signing-tool&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Updates to Code Signing enable your administrators to work with keystores, signature records, and records to be signed outside of the local system.

-   **[Improved activation process for Code Signing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-code-signing&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Activate Code signing with a new UI page that is designed to streamline the activation process.

-   **[Download All Button for Multiple Attachments is available when Edge Encryption is enabled](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_EdgeEncryptionOverview&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

</td><td>

-   **[Updates to GlideEncrypter functionality](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=glideencrypter-deprecation&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The GlideEncrypter API has been updated to use AES256-GCM encryption via the Key Management Framework. If needed, your instance can be changed to use legacy 3DES encryption, but this task can only be done by ServiceNow support.

-   **[Disable GlideEncrypter on your instance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=check-3des&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

GlideEncrypter can be enabled or turned off using the **glide.security.glideencrypter.allow** system property. This property is unavailable on new Zurich instances, but administrators with the security\_admin role can edit this property in upgraded instances. When this system property is set to **false**, users see this error when attempting to run GlideEncrypter.
