    -   For fraud disputes where the Special Condition Indicator is 2, 3, 4, or 7: ask whether the cardholder claims they were deceived into sending non-fiat currency or an NFT to a fraudulent recipient.
    -   For consumer disputes filed under RC 13.3 \(Not as Described\) involving a non-fiat currency or NFT purchase: ask whether the cardholder has evidence that the merchant guaranteed or promised the asset would increase in value.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Visa Resolve Online \(VROL\) version 26.1 updates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=visa-spoke&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Updated the dispute questionnaire provided through the Dispute Rules Content Pack for Visa to align with Visa Resolve Online \(VROL\) release 26.1 revision changes.

-   **[Updated chargeback eligibility rules for Visa reason codes 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, and 13.4](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispute-rules-content-pack-for-visa-landing-page-1&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The chargeback eligibility rules for eight Visa reason codes have been updated to reflect Visa Chargeback Guide v1.1. The rules engine evaluates disputes automatically against the updated criteria; no manual configuration is required. Disputes that do not meet the updated eligibility criteria are flagged as ineligible before submission.

-   **[Updated dispute intake questionnaire for fraud disputes involving non-fiat currency and NFTs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispute-rules-content-pack-for-visa-landing-page-1&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The fraud dispute intake questionnaire now includes a conditional question for disputes involving non-fiat currency or NFT transactions, such as cryptocurrency and digital token purchases. When the transaction is identified as a digital asset purchase, dispute agents and cardholders are asked to confirm whether the cardholder claims they were deceived into sending the asset to a fraudulent recipient. The question is shown only when relevant and is cleared automatically when it does not apply. This supports accurate eligibility evaluation without requiring agents to manually identify digital asset transaction types.

-   **[Updated dispute intake questionnaire for RC 13.3 \(Not as Described\) disputes involving non-fiat currency and NFTs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispute-rules-content-pack-for-visa-landing-page-1&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The consumer dispute intake questionnaire for RC 13.3 now includes an additional question for disputes involving non-fiat currency or NFT purchases. After confirming whether the asset received matched the description at the time of purchase, dispute agents and cardholders are asked whether there is evidence that the merchant guaranteed or promised the asset would increase in value. This question determines whether a specific dispute right applies, and appears only after the preceding NFT description question is answered.
