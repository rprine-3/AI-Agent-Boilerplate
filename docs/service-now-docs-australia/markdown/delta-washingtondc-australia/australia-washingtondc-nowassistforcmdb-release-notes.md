-   **[View CI details on CI forms](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-skill-ci-form-help&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The skill answers your questions on CI classes and attributes to help you work in CI forms, dashboards, home pages, and other views on the workspace. You can submit similar queries on the Explore CI view.

-   **[CMDB searches can include relationships](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-awf-search&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Search queries can depend on relationships between CIs and can span multiple tables. For example, you might ask: "Search for servers that depend on databases - only Linux servers running Redhat".


-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Zurich Patch 5, Now Assist usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: Now Assist Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).


-   **[Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The skills are automatically available to appropriate role users for the application, such as ITIL roles on incident forms or change forms. This change simply activates the skill and does not touch the roles that may be needed to use the skill. The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills and agentic workflows are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Zurich Patch 4\): Any previously unconfigured skill, agent, or agentic workflow is turned on automatically \(the AI asset was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills and agentic workflows that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[New role required for the Create configuration item agentic workflow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-awf-ci-creator&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The sn\_cmdb\_admin role is now required to use the Create configuration item agentic workflow \(was sn\_cmdb\_editor\).

-   ****
-   **[Create a CI](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-awf-ci-creator&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Verbal interaction with this feature has improved. Occasionally, you might need to create a CI manually. To help you, the CI creator agentic workflow accepts your natural language request and verifies that it understands which class the new CI should belong to. The workflow then checks Identification and Reconciliation engine \(IRE\) rules to determine the required attributes for the CI and requests that information. After you provide sufficient data, the workflow ensures that the proposed CI includes the attributes that you requested, complies with IRE rules, and is not a duplicate. The workflow then creates the CI.

-   **[Get advice on CMDB governance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-awf-governance&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

To help users understand the value of each step in the process, responses now include richer context. The CMDB Governance agentic workflow supports administrators and service owners by improving CMDB data governance. Before starting in on each governance task, the workflow presents the reasons for the task to help you better understand the importance and benefits of the activity. The objective is to ensure that CMDB data is accurate and complete so that users can trust the data.

-   **[Search the CMDB](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-awf-search&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Verbal interaction with this feature has improved. Users can now select the CI inline when multiple CIs are returned as matches. A summary of the CI now appears in the conversation. The CMDB search agentic workflow enables you to search for CIs by specifying any of several attributes of the CI of interest. The workflow accepts your natural language request, verifies your search goal, and then generates a keyword search, a single-table search with dot walks, or a multi-table search, depending on the information that you provided. The workflow can infer CI relationship data to generate an appropriate query.

-   **[Summarize CI data](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-agent-ci-summarizer&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Verbal interaction with this feature has improved. You can now view a concise summary of the key CI data by selecting the CI on a CI form, in a workspace page, or on any list view. The summary can include discovery data, ownership, and key related items such as open incidents, alerts, problems, upcoming change requests, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the summary lists the service instances that the CI is part of.

-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key now-assist-cmdb-mng-dupe-cis-skill\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-cmdb-mng-dupe-cis-skill&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Resolve de-duplication tasks with support from the Now Assist Manage duplicate CIs skill. CMDB administrators follow step-by-step guidance to perform remediation, and can preview remediation results before applying a template.

-   **[Diagnose failed SGC import sets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-sgc-diagnose&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Verbal interaction with this feature has improved. You can now diagnose a failed import set that is associated with a Service Graph Connector to get a summary of the errors and recommendations for resolving the issues.
