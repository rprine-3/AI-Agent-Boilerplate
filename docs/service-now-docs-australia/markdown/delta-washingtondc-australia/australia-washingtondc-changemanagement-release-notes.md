# Combined Change Management release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Change Management from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Change Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Change Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

As part of the update to use Flow instead of Progress Workers for conflict detection, the Conflict Checker Progress UI Formatter record references a new UI macro, change\_conflict\_worker\_progress\_gate. This macro checks the **change.conflict.useprogressworker** system property to determine the conflict detection mechanism and then displays the corresponding UI macro to work with either Progress Workers or the Change Management Worker table. For more information, see [Conflict detection](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ConflictDetection&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[User role for service desk agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-cm-itsm-roles&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

With the sn\_service\_desk\_agent user role, increase operational efficiency by streamlining the process of asking about, gathering, and verifying information, as well as delivering quick resolutions. This role is designed for tier 1 service desk agents and is accessible when the ITSM Roles plugin \(com.snc.itsm.roles\) installed.

The sn\_service\_desk\_agent role includes the following roles:

    -   sn\_incident\_write
    -   sn\_problem\_write
    -   sn\_change\_write
    -   sn\_request\_write
    -   tracked\_file\_reader
Additionally, with the installation of the **ITSM Gen AI** \(**com.sn.itsm.gen.ai**\) plugin, the knowledge\_user and now\_assist\_panel\_user roles are integrated within the sn\_service\_desk\_agent role.

The sn\_service\_desk\_agent user role can be used starting with Service Operations Workspace version 6.1.

-   **[Change model Type field](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_CreateAChange&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

A new **Model** option has been added to the change model Type field to help users identify a change that is controlled by a change model. **Model** is the default if a Type has not been set for the change request of a certain change model.

-   **[No default Risk value for change requests](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_CreateAChange&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

There is no longer a default value for the Risk field on the Change Request table. The Risk value is set to **-- None --** until the risk is evaluated for the change request. This change ensures that no risk value is pre-assigned, allowing for a more accurate assessment before advancing the change

-   **[Mandatory field transition condition](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-a-change-model&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Ensure mandatory fields are completed before advancing through states for a change request, as defined by the Change Model. This feature enables change managers to mandate the completion of required fields before states can progress according to the Change Model.

-   **[Deny-unless ACLs on core tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=features-itsm-enhanced-security-change&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Prevent unauthorized access to change\_request and change\_task tables using deny-unless ACLs. The deny-unless ACLs restrict access on these tables for a non-authenticated user to perform actions such as read, write, delete, or create.

This feature is available for new or zBoot customers with the installation of the ITSM Enhanced Security Features \(com.snc.itsm.enhanced\_security\) plugin. Existing or upgrade customers must test and evaluate in their sub production instance before installing the plugin and implementing the security change in their production instance.

-   **[Control opening of CAB meetings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=attend-cab-meeting-using-cab-workbench&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Control the opening of a CAB meeting from the CAB Meeting calendar in the CAB Meeting workbench in Service Operations Workspace or in the Core UI through the **sn\_change\_cab.com.snc.change\_management.cab.use\_sow\_meeting** system property. For more information, see [Change Management properties](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_ChangeManagementProperties&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Track conflict detection](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ConflictDetection&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track the progress of conflict detection using the Change - Conflict Detection flow \(that runs as a system user\) and the Change Management Worker table instead of Progress Workers. You can choose between the Flow and Progress Worker options by updating the **change.conflict.useprogressworker** system property.

A new UI formatter **change\_conflict\_worker\_progress\_gate.xml** has been introduced to the change request form to replace the existing **change\_request\_conflict\_progress.xml**. This update supports the **change.conflict.useprogressworker** system property when you upgrade to Zurich. The new formatter displays the same Conflict tab but selects the macro version to render the form according to the value of the new system property.

-   **[Define the maximum records for conflict detection](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-conflict-properties&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Limit the maximum number of conflict records that can be generated for each conflict type when conflict detection runs through the **change.conflict.max\_count** system property; create this system property if it is not already present.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Granular admin role](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-cm-itsm-roles&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Assign the single feature-specific granular sn\_change\_admin role to users to grant permission to configure Change Management features and system properties. This role replaces the previous general admin and ITIL roles. The sn\_change\_admin role includes the sn\_change\_writer, change\_manager, and sn\_change\_cab.cab\_manager roles.

-   **[Exclude change request records from conflict check](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-conflict-properties&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Exclude change requests from the conflict check process by setting the **Exclude from conflict detection** field to true. This setting also means that the change record is not displayed as a conflicting change when conflict checker is run on other change records.

-   **[Create change templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-change-template&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Control mandatory and read-only fields for change models by configuring change templates and defining template field policies. Change templates provide baseline standardization for common changes, making changes easier to create as well as driving a higher standard of change and compliance. Similar to the concepts used for existing standard change templates, templates used for change models can be proposed, reviewed, versioned, or retired.

-   **[Enhanced data model for change templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=change-data-model&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the enhanced data model that supports better categorization and role-based access for change templates for all change models automatically. This feature is optional for newly created standard changes.

This data model does not impact the existing standard change catalog and migration of these standard changes is not required.

-   **Reflow for Create a change request page**

The Create a change request page now supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages.
