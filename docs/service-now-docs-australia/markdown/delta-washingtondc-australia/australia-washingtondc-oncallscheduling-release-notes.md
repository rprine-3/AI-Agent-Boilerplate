# Combined On-Call Scheduling release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for On-Call Scheduling from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family On-Call Scheduling release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading On-Call Scheduling to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Starting from the Zurich release, On-Call Scheduling uses subflows, not workflows. You must transition from workflows to subflows, because the workflows are considered as legacy workflows. For existing users in Zurich, your current workflows continue to be supported. However, for new users, the On-Call Scheduling plugin installations on Zurich and later instances only use subflows.

 Maintain, build, and modify your own custom on-call scheduling flows in Workflow Studio with subflows for new instances. The following subflows are available for configuration:

-   **[Configure preferences for a user group](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-group-prefs-oncall&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Select a preferred start day of the week for a group, using the **First day of the week** field. Previously, this setting was available only system-wide.

-   **[Enable users to subscribe to the On-Call calendar](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=enable-subscribe-calendar-oncall&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Add custom on-call notification channels](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=custom-on-call-channel-integration&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Increase the flexibility in communication by adding and configuring service providers as on-call notification channels. You must configure the communication channel by using the On-call communication channel configuration \[on\_call\_comunication\_channel\_config\] table. After you configure the channel, you can select the new channel. This feature is applicable only after the subflows are configured and used.

-   **[Customize the on-call notification message and keywords](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-oncall-communication-channel&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Customize an on-call notification message and response keywords that are sent to the user and user groups as per your preferences. You can customize the message and keywords by using the On-call communication channel configuration \[on\_call\_communication\_channel\_config\] tables.

-   **[Send the on-call escalation notifications when the configured record fields are modified](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-trigger-rule-oncall&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Send the on-call escalation notifications when the configured record fields are modified. On-call trigger rules have the following enhancements:

    -   Configure the changes to fields as a triggering condition to run trigger rules. For example, changes to the **Priority** field for an incident can be configured as a trigger condition.
    -   Configure the group or team level trigger rules, or you can configure the global trigger rules that aren’t associated with a user group.
    -   If the assignment group is auto-populated when an incident is created, you can still configure the on-call trigger rules to run and send the escalation notifications.

-   **[Monthly roster rotation for an on-call schedule](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-update-schedule-oncall&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify shift management by configuring a monthly roster rotation for an on-call schedule. This option is available only for the 2024 schedule engine.

-   **[Granular role for on-call schedule configurations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-assigning-oncall&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure on-call schedule features using the granular and specific role, sn\_on\_call\_admin. It contains sn\_trigger\_table\_cfg\_read and sn\_trigger\_table\_cfg\_write roles.

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[On-Call Scheduling new schedule engine](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oncall-schedule-engine&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new 2024 schedule engine offers a more efficient and improved experience for managing your schedules and shifts. On-Call Scheduling supports an automatic upgrade to the new schedule engine.

-   **[On-Call Scheduling new schedule engine](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oncall-schedule-engine&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new schedule engine introduces the following enhancement:

    -   Shift support to resolve gaps resulting from member placement.
    -   Resolve daily rotation gaps, caused by adding or removing members, holiday schedules, or extra time.
    -   Verifies user continuity based of the last on-call member from the previous schedule.
    -   Improved performance by reducing the time required to add, remove, or move members.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Email redirection behavior for links in major on-call schedule email notification](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-update-schedule-oncall&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

In all major on-call schedule or shift email notifications, you can now decide where the links to an on-call schedule or shift record are redirected. Instead of an on-call schedule or shift record automatically opening in the classic UI16 interface in On-Call Scheduling, the record can be opened in SOW. The on-call schedule or shift record link in an email notification opens in SOW only if the following conditions are met:

    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect**\) property is set to `true`.
    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification for On-call scheduling** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect.on\_call**\) property is set to `true`.
    -   You have the sn\_sow\_user role.
The ITSM Notifications Redirection \(com.snc.itsm.notifications\_redirection\) plugin is installed and activated automatically to support this behavior.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Performance improvements in subflows for on-call notifications](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=on-call-new-trigger-engine&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following performance enhancements are available for on-call notifications when subflows are used:

    -   On-call notifications are sent to multiple channels such as SMS or email simultaneously instead of sending it sequentially.
    -   When the **com.snc.on\_call\_rotation.new\_trigger\_engine** property is set to true, the on-call subflows are processed via the Flow runner queue. The on-call subflows that are marked as High priority are processed faster via a Flow runner queue especially when multiple events are triggered at the same time and are in the process queue.
    -   Reminder notifications are also sent to users when the instance is upgrading.
-   **[Enhanced on-call trigger rules to support subflows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=on-call-scheduling-subflows-overview&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The on-call trigger rules form is enhanced to trigger a subflow when the trigger rule is executed. You can enable and select a specific subflow for a trigger rule.
