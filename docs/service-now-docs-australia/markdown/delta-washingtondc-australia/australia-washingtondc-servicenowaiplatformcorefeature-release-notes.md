The dynamic schema application framework has been revised in the Zurich release. If you implemented dynamic schema in Xanadu or Yokohama, the application is automatically migrated to a new framework as part of the upgrade to the Zurich release. For details on the migration, see the [Dynamic Schema Zurich Migration Guide \[KB2146133\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2146133) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

The dynamic schema application framework was revised in the Zurich release. If you implemented dynamic schema in the Xanadu or Yokohama releases, the application is automatically migrated to a new framework as part of the upgrade to releases starting with the Zurich release. For details on the migration and steps you might need to perform, see the [Dynamic Schema Zurich Migration Guide \[KB2146133\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2146133) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

 The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform®. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. Refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) for additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings. For more information about granular read-only security options, see [Configuring read-only security options](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=read-only-option&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).
