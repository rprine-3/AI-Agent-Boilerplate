-   **[Resolve a security incident](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-sir-resolve-incident-ai-workflow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Help enhance incident resolution plan generation by adding your existing runbooks to the AI runbooks section within the Security incident resolution plan skill. The existing runbooks provide additional context to the skill.


-   **[Role configuration required for agentic workflows and AI agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=aia-role-masking&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Agentic workflows and AI agents included with Now Assist applications require additional security configuration. If you select **Users with selected roles** for your user access security controls for an agentic workflow or AI agent, you must add the installed roles, or they won't execute. Data access settings must also include these roles. See the documentation for the agentic workflow or AI agent for the specific roles you must add. After the roles are configured, users must have the specified role to invoke the agentic workflow or AI agent.

-   **[Explore Security incident quality assessment](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-sir-quality-assessment&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use generative AI to create a quality assessment report of a security incident. The reports are generated using a predefined, natural language rule set. The report provides an overall assessment summary followed by the detailed assessment for all the rules.


-   **[Generate SIR Shift Handover Report](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-incidents-shifthandover-ai-agent&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The AI agent helps add security incident details to a shift handover report. The agent populates the different sections of the shift handover with appropriate content by identifying the relevant details from the security incident. The AI agent can fetch details of the security incident and identify if the analyst has access to the shift handover record. The AI agent can generate content for each section of the shift handover record and asks for analysts feedback on the content. The AI agent refines the content based on the feedback and saves the content to the records on approval.


-   **[Use agentic workflows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-now-assist-ai-agents-sir&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The analyze security operations metrics agentic workflow helps security managers to analyze their teams' performance.

    -   Generate metrics for Security Incident Response \(SIR\) records for case volume, mean time to assign \(MTTA\), and mean time to resolve \(MTTR\) for a date range of your choosing.
    -   Request suggestions for how to improve MTTR, MTTA, and volume based on your metrics.
-   **[Enhancements to correlation insights in Now Assist for Security Incident Response](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generating-insights-for-now-assist-for-security&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can generate and view results for correlation insights in the Security Incident Response Workspace.

    -   Correlation insights aren’t limited to the primary configuration item \(CI\) or affected users associated with a security incident. You can base your correlation insights on any CI or affected user for a security incident.
    -   You can generate correlation insights from the **Investigation** tab for a security incident in any state in the Security Incident Response Workspace.
    -   You can generate insights for multiple items simultaneously for Associated Observables, Configuration items, and Affected Users.
    -   Results are displayed in a modeless dialog that you can size and move.
-   **[Using the security incident resolution agentic workflow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-sir-resolve-incident-ai-workflow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the security incident resolution agentic workflow to close your security incidents. Analysts can chat with AI agents in natural language to resolve the security incidents. The AI agent analyzes the incident details, existing runbooks, Knowledge articles, and past similar security incidents as inputs, and provides a resolution plan. The AI agent also assists the analysts to resolve the security incident.
