Ensure that you upgrade any of the following currently installed Microsoft Software Installers \(MSIs\) by downloading the RPA applications:

-   RPA Desktop Design Studio
-   Attended Robot
-   Unattended Robot
-   Unattended Robot Login Agent

For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=download-installer-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 The following upgrade steps are applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Washington DC.

 Based on the number of records in the application file table, you could experience a potential delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or before to Washington DC.

 Before upgrading RPA Hub to Washington DC, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 After you upgrade to the Washington DC, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

 Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from bot process to bot process configuration. If you upgrade to the Utah version without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

</td><td>

-   **[Embedded Task Automation in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=embedded-task-auto-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Trigger attended bot processes, also known as attended automations, from the ServiceNow forms, playbooks, workspaces, and so on.

To trigger this bot process from the ServiceNow form, select the **Enable Embedded Task Automation** check box in the Attended Bot Process form. After enabling this check box, two additional tabs, Process Field Parameters and Attended Configuration, are available on the Bot Process form. For more information about the Bot Process form, see [Bot Process form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=bot-process-form&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

On the Process Field Parameters tab, create dynamic parameters that are used in the bot process. Process field parameters are used for setting a value or getting the value of a field on a particular form. For more information about creating process field parameters, see [Create a process field parameter in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-process-field-param-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US). You can also create a parameter from the Field Parameter Mappings tab by selecting the **Create parameter** button from the Attended Configurations menu. For more information, see [Map a table field to a bot process field parameter in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-field-param-mapping-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

In the RPA Hub workspace, create an attended configuration record. For more information about creating an attended configuration record, see [Create an attended configuration record in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-attended-config-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

On the Field Parameter Mappings tab, map the form fields to the process field parameters that are used in the automations. This process enables an easy data flow during the execution of a bot process. For more information about mapping field parameters, see [Map a table field to a bot process field parameter in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-field-param-mapping-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

Activate the attended configuration record to trigger the attended bot process. For more information, see [Activate an attended configuration record in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=activate-attend-config-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[New components for Embedded Task Automation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=forms_sn_rpa_studio&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following four new components are added to the new **Forms** section in RPA Desktop Design Studio. These components are available under the new ServiceNow category in the Toolbox pane.

    -   **AttendedConfigurations** component: Segregate the execution of the automations in a single automation project and call the respective logic according to the action invoked. For more information, see [Use the AttendedConfigurations component](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-attended-configurations-forms&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   **GetProcessFieldParameters** component: Fetch the values of the ServiceNow form fields associated in the Field Parameter Mapping of the corresponding attended configuration record in RPA Hub. For more information, see [Use the GetProcessFieldParameters component](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-get-process-field-param-forms&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   **GetRecordContextID** component: Fetch the current record sys\_id of the ServiceNow form, from where the automation is triggered. For more information, see [Use the GetRecordContextID component](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-get-record-context-id-forms&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   **SetProcessFieldParameters** component: Update the values of the ServiceNow form fields associated in the Field Parameter Mapping of the corresponding attended configuration record in RPA Hub. For more information, see [Use the SetProcessFieldParameters component](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-set-process-field-param-forms&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
-   **[External credential vault in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=external-credentials-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

In RPA Hub, you can retrieve robot credentials, application credentials, or Time-based One-time Password \(TOTP\) seeds from the external credential vault.

Create an external credential vault record in RPA Hub to register your external credential vault for further usage by the robot. For more information, see [Create an external credential vault record in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-ext-cred-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

A new **External Credential** check box is available in the credential set form, an application credential form, and a TOTP authenticator form. If this check box is selected, the credentials or TOTP seed is fetched from a configured external credential vault. If the check box is selected in the TOTP authenticator form, the seed is fetched from a configured external credential vault. For more information about these forms, see [Create a credential set within a bot process](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-credential-set-botprocess&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US), [Create an application credential set in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-application-credential&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US), and [Create a TOTP authenticator in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=map-totp-credential-set-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

If the application credential record has the **External Credential** check box enabled, then the **SetApplicationCredential** component in RPA Desktop Design Studio doesn’t set the credentials and displays an error. For more information about the **SetApplicationCredential** component, see [Use the SetApplicationCredential component](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-credentials-setappcredential&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

Use the steps listed in the [Steps to configure an external credential vault in RPA Hub](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-ext-cred-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) topic to guide you through all the tasks of configuring an external credential vault in RPA Hub.

-   **[Storage of process execution data in flat files](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=bot-process-form&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

In RPA Hub, you can configure the output type as flat files for the execution logs that are generated on the robot machine.

On the Bot Process form, select an output type of the execution log file from the **Output Type** field from the Log Settings section. This field appears when the **Track Execution Logs** option is selected and when the **Robot Machine** is selected from the **Storage** field.

The location of the flat files is `Users\<Userprofile>\ServiceNow RPA Logs\.executionlogs\{InstanceName}\.archive\{ProcessJob number}` in the machine on which you have installed the attended or unattended robot.

If the size of the flat file exceeds 10 MB, it splits into multiple flat files with the log sequence appended to the file names until it executes the automation. A flat file doesn't log the data of input or output ports in a component or method that you have selected as **Mark Data as Sensitive** in the RPA Desktop Design Studio.

-   **[New Workflow Studio Actions and Subflow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=rpa-hub-actions&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Invoke the following new actions and subflow in Workflow Studio:

    -   **Change Life Cycle Stage Status of a Bot Process** Action to modify the life cycle stage status of a bot process that is not retired.
    -   **Stop Process** Action and **Stop Process** subflow to stop a bot process. If the robot pool option is enabled for the bot process, it stops all the robots assigned to the pool. If Graceful Stop is enabled, it provides a capability for robots to exit the automation smoothly. Graceful Stop is not applicable for bot processes with the robot pool option enabled.
-   **[Wait for any screen method at the Universal App Connector level](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-the-wait-for-any-screen-method&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

In RPA Desktop Design Studio, the **WaitForAnyScreen** method appears in the **Object Explorer** pane when you double-click the **Universal App connector** object under the **Global Objects** pane.

The **WaitForAnyScreen** method finds an application screen within a specified duration, and then you can enable it to pass the control to another method. You can set up multiple application screens that appear in an order on the method, and the **WaitForAnyScreen** method tries to find a screen starting from the first application screen by matching the screen match rules. If the method doesn't find a screen, it tries to find the next screen in the order. However, if the method finds a screen, it completes execution and doesn't proceed to the screens next in the order. If the method doesn't find any screen within the specified duration, you may optionally enable it to pass the control to another component through the **ELSE** port.

-   **[SetPassword Method](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=connectors-chrome-methods&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

In RPA Desktop Design Studio, the **SetPassword** method automates securely entering a password in the password field of a web-based, Java, or Windows application. It accepts the password as a **SECURE STRING** type and then enters it in the password field.

-   **[SimulateMouseEvent Method](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=connectors-chrome-methods&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

In the RPA Desktop Design Studio, the **SimulateMouseEvent** method automates simulating a mouse event on an element on a web-based application. For example, automate the right-click mouse event on a button to open a context menu. The screen element on which the mouse event occurs must priorly have the mouse event defined in the HTML. The method supports a list of mouse events and mouse button types.

-   **[IEnumerable data type port in connectors](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=table-connector&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The **IEnumerable** input data type enables methods to accept arrays, array lists, and lists. This input data type port is available in multiple connectors.

-   **[Universal App connector supports Shadow DOM elements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-uac&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The **XPath** and the **CssSelector** locators in the Universal App connector shows the full XPath and CSS path with the Shadow DOM elements, if a web application uses Shadow DOM.
