# Combined Financial Services Operations Core release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Financial Services Operations Core from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Financial Services Operations Core release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Financial Services Operations Core to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

<table class="custom-rows"><thead><tr><th class="filter">

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Washington DC

</td><td>

During the upgrade to Washington DC, the Financial Services Operations Core plugin reparents the following tables:

**Note:** You may experience a longer time for the upgrade to complete if your upgraded instance has a large number of records.

-   The Service Definition \[sn\_bom\_service\_definition\] table extends from the Service Definition \[sn\_case\_type\_selection\] table instead of the Request Definition \[sn\_ind\_request\_definition.
-   The Financial task \[sn\_bom\_task\] table extends from the Customer Service Task \[sn\_customerservice\_task\] table instead of the Global Task \[task\] table.
-   The Policy Participant \[sn\_bom\_policy\_participant\] table extends from the Sold Product Related Party \[sn\_install\_base\_sold\_product\_related\_party\] table.

Reparenting enables leveraging of the benefits and advancements introduced by ServiceNow® Customer Service Management \(CSM\) while preserving the functionality of existing applications.

-   **[Payment card application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=payment-card-application&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Store the details of physical payment cards across the entire card life cycle, from issuance to servicing. You can also store tokenized values for sensitive data, such as the primary account number \(PAN\).

-   **[Deny-Unless ACL](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acl-denial-behavior&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Deny-Unless access control lists \(ACLs\) on FSO tables for non-authenticated users, such as users with public roles. With this minimum-security setting, only your authenticated users can read, write, delete, or create actions on these tables. For more information about the Deny-Unless ACLs, see the [Deny-Unless ACL](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acl-denial-behavior&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) topic in the ServiceNow® Platform Security documentation.

</td><td>

-   The FSO tables `sn_bom_m2m_service_definition_user_criteria` and `sn_bom_m2m_service_definition_customer_condition` are deprecated. If you're on an upgraded instance, you can continue to reference these tables, but they're no longer maintained. Use `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria` and `sn_csm_case_types_service_customer_criteria` instead. For more information, see [Banking tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=fso-core-banking-tables&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).
-   The **Show in Interceptor** field \(`show_in_interceptor`\) on the `sn_bom_service_definition` table is deprecated. Use agent criteria in the `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria` table to control which service definitions appear in the case type selector.

User criteria mappings control the visibility of new service definitions. To hide a service definition, map it to the **No User** user criteria. To make it visible, map it to the **Users with sn\_bom.service\_definition\_read** user criteria. Both user criteria records are predefined in Financial Services Operations Core.

For more information, see [Components installed with case types](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-definitions-components&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Case creation enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-service-definitions&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The FSO interceptor is replaced with the Customer Service Management Product Service select version of the case type selector. This enhancement enables customer service agents to easily create new case records by selecting the appropriate case type from a list of available services. For details, see the [Service type selector for Financial Services Operations](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1638995) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Case type selector](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=csm-case-type-select-modals&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Filter service definitions using the case type selector in FSO with the predefined CSM implementation. For upgraded instances, existing agent criteria and customer condition data is automatically migrated from the deprecated FSO tables to the CSM tables during upgrade. No manual migration is required.

To configure agent criteria or customer conditions for the case type selector, use the following CSM tables:

    -   `sn_csm_case_types_service_user_criteria`: for agent criteria
    -   `sn_csm_case_types_service_customer_criteria`: for customer conditions
