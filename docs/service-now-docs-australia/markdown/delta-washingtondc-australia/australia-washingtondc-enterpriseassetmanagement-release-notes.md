# Combined Enterprise Asset Management release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Enterprise Asset Management from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Enterprise Asset Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Enterprise Asset Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Washington DC

</td><td>

After you upgrade to Washington DC, the model\_component field isn't available in the Enterprise asset \[sn\_ent\_asset\] table. Instead, a new model\_component\_id field is available in the Asset \[alm\_asset\] table. The ENT - Migrate to new model component script moves the existing model\_component field data to the model\_component\_id field.

 Note the following upgrade scenarios for the Total Cost of Ownership \(TCO\) of assets:

-   Upgrade works for all Enterprise Asset Management flow tasks
-   You must have task rate cards for each workflow task.
-   The TCO upgrade populates the **Asset** and **Expense category** fields on expense lines corresponding to each task.
-   Expense category is populated based on the expense lines and the source of the expense line.
-   You need to populate the TCO benchmark cost and the TCO benchmark threshold field on all existing models manually or using the bulk import functionality.
-   TCO upgrade populates following fields on asset forms:
    -   **Asset end of useful life**: The created date plus the useful life in months.
    -   **Asset first used date**: The created date.
    -   **Asset TCO**: The aggregated sum of all the expense lines related to the asset. For simple assets, Asset TCO is the aggregated sum of expense lines under it. For complex assets, Asset TCO is the aggregated sum of expense lines of the parent as well as its child assets.

Starting with Zurich release, a new menu, Asset put away, has been added to the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar. When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar was customized and takes the necessary action.

-   If the navigation bar wasn’t customized before the upgrade, a new Asset put away icon \(\[Omitted image "image.asset-putaway-icon-ma"\] Alt text: Asset put away icon\) is included in the navigation bar
-   If the navigation bar was customized before the upgrade, two navigation bars appear: Customized old IT Asset Management and IT Asset Management. The new icon appears in the IT Asset Management navigation bar.

-   **[Drop off and receive assets at a stockroom by using the ServiceNow Mobile Agent application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-dropoff-mobile-agent&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Return the assets that you have in your personal stockroom to a different stockroom by creating a Drop off task using the ServiceNow® Mobile Agent application. The asset manager of the destination stockroom receives the assets that you dropped off through a Receive task. The asset manager then verifies the received assets and closes the Drop off task using the Mobile Agent application.

**Note:** Starting with the Xanadu release, you could create Drop off and Receive tasks in the Enterprise Asset Workspace. However, now you can also use the Mobile Agent application for the same purpose.

-   **[Receive shipment assets at a stockroom through the streamlined and unified receiving process](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stockroom-receiving-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

    -   Enterprise Asset Workspace
    -   OT Asset Workspace
    -   Medical Asset Workspace
    -   Facility Asset Workspace
This standardized receiving process reduces the time spent on receiving assets. By requiring each asset to be assigned a unique identiﬁer when received at the stockroom, the quality of asset data also improves.

You can receive assets in bulk by using a template. Additionally, you can view the results and validation comments in the staging table. During this process, the system handles existing assets, creates new ones as needed, and performs comprehensive validations.

-   **[Track asset movement from the receiving bay to an aisle-space in the stockroom](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-inventory-by-putting-away-asset-eam&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Enhanced and unified enterprise asset inventory auditing experience](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=audit-eam-assetinventory&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Streamline and improve your inventory auditing experience with the enhanced and unified enterprise asset inventory process:

    -   Initiate a single audit that covers both hardware and enterprise assets assigned to a specific location or stockroom, eliminating the need to switch between multiple workspaces.
    -   Include consumable assets in the inventory audit to avoid asset shrinkage and ensure that inventory data remains accurate.
    -   The ServiceNow Agent app features selectable audit results, enabling you to view a real-time list of all scanned assets.
    -   When new assets are identified during the single scan audit, essential information is collected in real time through the ServiceNow Agent app to initiate asset creation.
    -   Scanned asset locations are automatically updated to reflect their precise aisle, space, or sub location during the audit, supporting the accuracy and quality of inventory records.

-   **[Multiple assets and asset groups in a work order](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-eam-work-order-task&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

A work order and work order task can now be created for asset groups in addition to individual assets. Additionally, the sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager role can add more assets to tasks while they're in the draft stage. When technicians start the task, they can take action on all included assets. The Deploy Asset, Swap Asset, and Remove Asset actions within work order tasks support multiple assets and asset groups.

-   **[Shutdown and Startup work types](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-eam-work-order-task&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The **Shutdown** and **Startup** work types available in the work order tasks enable you to manage asset shutdown and restart tasks.

-   **[Multiple calibration playbooks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=complete-eam-work-order&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

When a calibration work order is created for multiple assets or an asset group, the system generates a separate calibration playbook for each asset in the Affected assets list.

-   **[Multiple condition lines](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=perform-condition-assessment-webui&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

When an asset condition work order is created for multiple assets or an asset group, the system generates a separate condition line for each asset in the Affected assets list. All condition lines must be evaluated before the work order can be completed.

-   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

-   **Reflow**

The configurable workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%. This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
