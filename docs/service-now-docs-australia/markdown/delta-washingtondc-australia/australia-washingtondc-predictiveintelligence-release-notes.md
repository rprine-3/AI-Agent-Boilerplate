# Combined Predictive Intelligence release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Predictive Intelligence from Washington DC to Australia. Predictive Intelligence was previously called Agent Intelligence.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Predictive Intelligence release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Predictive Intelligence to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

<table class="custom-rows"><thead><tr><th class="filter">

Washington DC

</td><td>

If you’re upgrading to Washington DC, you won't be able to create new regression solutions. If you have existing solutions, they will still be supported and you will be able to train and modify them, but you won't be able to create new ones.

 The changes to the similarity and clustering solutions apply to all instances that are on Washington DC.

-   **[Model Explainability](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-explainability&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Learn which classes contribute most to your model's predictions by optionally adding Model Explainability to Workflow Classification solutions. Model Explainability provides a new tab labeled **Feature Importance** where you can run an analysis of each class's contribution to the overall prediction.

-   **[Leverage new advanced options for classification solutions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-advanced-settings-ml-solutions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US), from Yokohama Patch 4.**
    -   [Configure include only top N labels](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-only-top-n-labels&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Limit the classification model to use only the top most frequent labels. You can choose a number as the limit.
    -   [Minimum records needed for label to include it](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-minimum-records-needed-label&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **Pre-trained models for [similarity](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-similarity-solution&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) and [clustering](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-clustering-solution&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) solutions**

With the new pre-trained models, you won't need your own word corpus when creating new solutions.

**Important:** With the Washington DC release, clustering and similarity models use Workflow solutions. When existing solutions with a word corpus are retrained after upgrading, they become Workflow solutions, and the **Word Corpus** field is no longer visible on the form.
