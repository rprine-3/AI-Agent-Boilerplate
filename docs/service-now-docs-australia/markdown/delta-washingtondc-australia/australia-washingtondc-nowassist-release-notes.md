 The Zurich release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow® AI Platform. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back-end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. If you have custom client scripts that modify ServiceNow® ‑owned read‑only fields using `g_form.setValue()` or `g_form.clearValue()`, refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122). This article provides additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings.

 The existing Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) will be updated to replace the 'admin' role with specific, purpose-driven granular roles within scripts or security attributes. As part of this update, the `getRoles()` API will be replaced with the `hasRole()` API for authorization purposes. Additionally, all references to the 'admin' role in the code will be substituted with the new feature-specific granular roles for authorization use cases. Read [https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html) to learn more.
