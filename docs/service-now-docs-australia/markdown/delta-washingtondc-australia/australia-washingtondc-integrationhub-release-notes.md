Washington DC

</td><td>

-   **[Stream Connect for Apache Kafka Enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-apache-kafka&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Use Stream Connect Message Replication to replicate data between your local Apache Kafka environment and ServiceNow. With Stream Connect Message Replication, you no longer need a third-party replicator and can manage message replications from your ServiceNow instance.
    -   Use Stream Connect Message Replication to enable a MID Server to create the access certificates required to connect to the Hermes Messaging Service. The MID Server can automatically generate the necessary certificates, so you don't need to configure them manually.
    -   Send messages with an updated [Kafka Producer step](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=kafka-producer-action-designer&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US). Select a topic from a drop-down list and configure values for the message header.
-   **[OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oauth-2-credentials&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Connect with an on-premise third-party OAuth authorization server that resides behind a firewall through a MID Server that sends the request for an OAuth token on behalf of your ServiceNow instance. You can use this functionality when you create an application registry for a third-party OAuth provider and in the form, set the Grant type as Client Credentials.

-   **Increased security in code signing with multi-layer caller inspection**

The code signing feature has been enhanced with multi-layer caller inspection of records. Multiple layers can call each other before a record or entity can update the ECC queue table. Now, each layer must have a valid certificate and validated before the MID server accesses the record or entity. The ServiceNow platform provides a property that enables you to inspect three caller layers by default.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **Now Assist in Conversational Spokes**

Use Now Assist in Conversational Spokes to utilize the conversational ability of Integration Hub Spoke actions. Now Assist in Conversational Spokes offers generative AI capabilities to make spoke actions conversational. With this, you can perform business actions and automate business workflows through conversational interface.

Install Now Assist for Conversational Spokes plugin and start utilizing the conversational ability of the Look up User spoke action in Microsoft Active Directory v2 spoke. You can call this action from a conversational interface like Now Assist.


-   **[Send and receive messages in an Avro format with Stream Connect](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=schema-management&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Import and create Avro schemas to store in the Stream Connect Schemas \[stream\_connect\_schema\] table. Stream Connect producers and consumers use the schemas to convert plain-text JSON messages into an Avro binary format and back. Using an Avro format can reduce the size of the payload and simplify your integration to your local Apache Kafka instance.

-   **[Track incoming requests for SOAP and REST APIs, and URL Export](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=integrationhub-usage-dashboard&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

View the data egress details in the enhanced Usage dashboard. Using the dashboard, you can track the data egress usage per source over time. This information is presented in a line chart and, if needed, you can view the amount of data transfer by source on any given date within the specified date range. The dashboard retrieves data from the Data Egress Count table \[data\_egress\_count\].

-   **[Enable parallel loading in custom \(load by script\) type data sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=custom-type-data-source&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use a script to partition data into smaller sections, then load the sections in parallel. Parallel loading can enable your integrations to finish faster and reduce the impact on other tasks.

-   **[CyberArk credential storage integration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_CyberArkCredStorageIntegrate&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) Use the CyberArk Digital Vault to store and access your OAuth 2.0 credentials**

Use the ServiceNow® MID Server to access your OAuth 2.0 credentials stored on the CyberArk Digital Vault. The MID Server uses this information to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens for client credentials grant type that are then used to make REST API calls to the third-party server.

-   **[Make outbound REST and SOAP calls through a MID Server using mTLS](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mtls-mid-server&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Store mTLS password and certificate information on the instance, in a vault, or in a configuration file. The MID Server uses this information to make outbound REST and SOAP calls with the mTLS protocol.

-   **[Use the Personal Authentication dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=personal-auth-dashboard&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use your personal credentials to connect to third-party integrations. View, authenticate, revoke, and renew your personal authentications through a simplified, consolidated interface.

-   **[Enhancements to the external trigger endpoints](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-endpt-oauth2&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate an endpoint for webhooks in the third-party applications that support [OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-endpt-oauth2&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US). The endpoint enables webhooks to connect with your ServiceNow instance.

Generate the endpoints by updating the base system external event sources on your ServiceNow instance. After that, you can configure the endpoint on the third-party application and enable it to send a webhook to the ServiceNow instance to execute a flow. Based on the authentication type that the third-party system supports, you can generate a hash, secret, or token, or add roles or a user to the external event source. Finally, you generate the endpoint that you can use on the third-party system webhook.

-   **[Automatically generate a JSON payload for the JSON Builder step](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=json-build-step-action-designer&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enter a JSON payload into the step's script editor to automatically de-serialize the payload into structured input.

-   **[Enhanced OpenAPI step](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=open-api-step-action-designer&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Choose to import an OpenAPI specification or a Postman Collection of a third-party outbound REST web service for building an integration. The OpenAPI step is now enhanced to support Postman API collections and is renamed as **OpenAPI/Postman step**.
