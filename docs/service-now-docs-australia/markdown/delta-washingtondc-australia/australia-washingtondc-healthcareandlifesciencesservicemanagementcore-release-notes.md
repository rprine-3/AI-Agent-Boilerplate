# Combined Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Washington DC

</td><td>

During the upgrade to Washington DC, the Healthcare sold product \[sn\_hcls\_sold\_product\] parent table changes to Install base item \[sn\_install\_base\_item\] for the following tables:

-   Member Plan \[sn\_hcls\_member\_plan\]
-   Medication \[sn\_hcls\_medication\]
-   Immunization \[sn\_hcls\_immunization\]
-   Enrolled Program \[sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program\]
-   Enrolled Program Service \[sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program\_service\]

 In addition, the following tables have had their parent tables removed and are standalone tables:

-   Healthcare Organization\[sn\_hcls\_organization\]
-   Healthcare Location\[sn\_hcls\_location\]
-   Practitioner Location\[sn\_hcls\_practitioner\_facility\]

This reparenting enables customers to use the organizations and location tables for a broader set of use cases.

 Existing data is migrated in the following manner so that existing functionality isn’t impacted:

1.  Reference of location field in sn\_hcls\_immunization updated to use cmn\_location.
2.  All data is moved from Healthcare Sold Product to Install Base Item tables.
3.  Rows in the affected Install Base Item are populated based on the source\_task value from the Healthcare Sold Product.
4.  The state of sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program and sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program\_service are copied from hcls\_state.
5.  All data moves to the standalone tables of Healthcare Organization, Healthcare Location, and Practitioner Location.
    1.  The script creates records in the Business Location table for existing records in the Healthcare Organization table to form a 1:1 reference.
    2.  Records that refer to a service organization are updated with a reference to the appropriate business location.
    3.  Any practitioner who has a record in the practitioner location will have a record created in the Service Organization Member table with the appropriate business location.
    4.  Records that contain healthcare location data will contain the parent service organization of that healthcare location.

**Note:** You may experience a longer time for the upgrade to complete if your upgraded instance has a large number of records.

The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform®. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. Refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) for additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings. For more information about granular read-only security options, see [Configuring read-only security options](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=read-only-option&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

 If you have the feature administrator role you can now complete tasks that were initially reserved for users with the broader administrator role.

-   **[EMR Help enhanced for HCLS case creation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=submitting-cases-from-emr-systems&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The EMR Help application has been enhanced to provide requesters with the capability to create additional HCLS cases. For more information on the EMR Help application, see [Exploring EMR Help](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=emr-help&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Data model further aligned with Customer Service Management \(CSM\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hcls-serv-mgmt-core&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following updates have been made to the data model to take advantage of the core CSM install base item capabilities to track internal and external items:

    -   The following tables now extend Install Base Item instead of Healthcare sold product:
        -   Member Plan \[sn\_hcls\_member\_plan\]
        -   Medication \[sn\_hcls\_medication\]
        -   Immunization \[sn\_hcls\_immunization\]
        -   Enrolled Program \[sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program\]
        -   Enrolled Program Service \[sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program\_service\]
    -   This update impacts the following columns:
        -   The hcls\_state field under table Enrolled Program and Enrolled Program Service tables has been deprecated and the state field from the Install Base table is used going forward. Data is moved from hcls\_state field to state field.
        -   The parent column now refers to the parent install base item to ensure that proper parent-child relation is maintained.
        -   The source\_task column under the Enrolled Program and Enrolled Program Service tables is now tracked using the affected install base item m:m table.
-   **[Healthcare locations and organizations realigned for multi-industry cases](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hcls-serv-mgmt-core&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   The Healthcare Organization \[sn\_hcls\_organization\] table is now a standalone table and no longer extends Service Organization.
        -   In some cases, custom tables might have a reference to a Company/Service Organization that can contain the value of a healthcare organization. In scenarios where custom columns refer to Service Organization and have Healthcare Organization data, reach out to [Now Support](https://support.servicenow.com/now) for the migration script.
        -   Parent field now refers to Healthcare organization.
    -   Healthcare Location \[sn\_hcls\_location\] table is now a standalone table and no longer extends Service Organization.
        -   Healthcare Cases, Install Base records, and Sold Product records can no longer be created for Healthcare Locations. For existing records of these types, the Healthcare Location value is replaced by the service organization value of the associated Healthcare Organization as a Healthcare location is always associated with a Healthcare Organization.
        -   Service\_organization\_parent field data has been cloned to the parent location field. Parent location is used going forward.
        -   Parent field data has been cloned to the organization field. Organization is used going forward.
    -   Practitioner Location \[sn\_hcls\_practitioner\_facility\] table is a standalone table and no longer extends Service Organization Member.
        -   In instances where a mapping exists between a healthcare location and a practitioner, the mapping is updated to be between the healthcare organization \(of the associated healthcare location\) and that practitioner because Healthcare Location is now a standalone table and no longer extends the Business Location table.
        -   Service\_organization field data has been cloned to location field. Location is used going forward.
