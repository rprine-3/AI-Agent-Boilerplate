-   **[Experience improved expiration settings of Soft PIN](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=password-reset-global-properties&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Give your users the experience of secured Soft PIN enrollment. While enrolling for the Soft PIN verification, they can view the number of days in which the Soft PIN expires. While resetting the Soft PIN, users view the rules that their Soft PIN must comply with. Also, users get email and ServiceNow® Virtual Agent notifications when their passwords are about to expire.

As a Password Reset administrator, you can configure the Soft PIN expiration settings such as setting the number of days when the passwords expire, the frequency of sending password expiration reminder emails, and history policies on Soft PIN.

These settings are enabled by default even if you've upgraded Password Reset from the previous version.

-   **View the security score for your Password Reset processes**

View the security score for your Password Reset processes. Based on the score, you get notifications for potential configuration improvements to the processes.

While creating the Password Reset process, view security scores for the process. If you see any deviations between the maximum attainable and current scores, you get an email with an actionable list of recommendations to improve the configuration. You get informative messages indicating whether the process configuration is ideal.

Evaluate configurations for identification and verification steps. If your configurations are less secure, get process-wise actionable suggestions on how to improve the strength.

**Note:** Starting Washington DC, the Self-Service or the Service Desk Password Reset Experience is restricted for security\_admin users. Only a user with the `security_admin` role can set the password of another `security_admin` user using the sys\_user record to further enhance the security.
