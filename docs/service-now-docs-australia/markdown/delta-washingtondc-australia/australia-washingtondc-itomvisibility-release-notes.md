# Combined ITOM Visibility release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for ITOM Visibility from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family ITOM Visibility release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading ITOM Visibility to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

3DES support is planned for permanent removal from the MID Server for MID Servers with SSH-based Discovery or SSH-based integrations. For more information, see [3DES deprecation in SSH from Xanadu \[KB1644950\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1644950).

 After upgrading to Yokohama, a Fix Script named "Add Explicit Public SNMP Credential" might create a public SNMP credential in Production instances. This could lead to unnecessary records via Discovery. The Fix Script is present in Yokohama instances, including OOB. Before applying the upgrade of Discovery core, Yokohama version, verify the fix script behavior in a sandbox environment. Remove the public SNMP credentials if not required.

By providing a JSON map with keys such as `resources`, `mappings`, and `mappings_oob`, you can instruct Cloud Native Operations for Visibility to retrieve additional information. If one of these keys exists and the system finds a change, it patches the ConfigMap and restarts the Informer.

-   **[View the OpenShift version in the Cluster version field on the Kubernetes Cluster CI](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cnov-deploy-install&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 3.9.0 \(Informer version 2.3.0\), see the OpenShift version and the Kubernetes Cluster version in one place. OpenShift operates on top of Kubernetes, so there's an OpenShift version and a Kubernetes Cluster version. By installing the Informer with the **--set openShift=true** flag, the system adds the OpenShift version number to the **cluster\_version** field on the Kubernetes Cluster CI in addition to the Kubernetes Cluster version.

-   **[Use Service Fingerprints to refine the selection of application service candidates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-serv-suggest&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Experience more accurate name suggestions for application service candidates based on Service Fingerprints in Service Mapping Plus store version 1.15.0.

-   **[Limits in Service Mapping](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=components-installed-with-service-mapping&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Limits in Service Mapping prevent the disabling or deletion of jobs scheduled for the Checkpoint Reaper or the Service Model's Blob Reaper.

-   **[Limits in tag-based Service Mapping](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=components-installed-with-service-mapping-plus&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Name updates in Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=red-hat-virtualization-discovery&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Name updates starting with Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns version 1.28.0:

    -   The RHV cloud provider has been changed to oVirt
    -   The RHV MID Server capability has been changed to oVirt
    -   The label for the \[cmdb\_ci\_rhv\_ldc\] datacenter type has been changed from RHV LDC to oVirt LDC

-   **[Benefit from an updated, curated selection of application service candidates in Service Mapping](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sm-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have ITOM Content Service installed, you can view an enhanced selection of Application Service Candidates \(ASCs\) that provides more accurate and useful information, with an automatic filter applied to hide irrelevant and non-essential components.

-   **[Automate your certificate workflows using Keyfactor EJBCA and ACME](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=automate-certificates-ejbca-acme&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version XX of Certificate Inventory and Management, you can automate the life cycle of requesting, renewing, and revoking your certificates by integrating the Keyfactor EJBCA certificate authority with the ACME automated certificate management environment. Predefining your routing policies enables automated completion of the fields in your Certificate Signing Request \(CSR\) and provides a secure environment for an automated flow of certificates.

-   **[Discover a Root Certificate from a Browser](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=discover-root-certificate-browser&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Standard Discovery collects information about the certificates stored in your servers. You can also discover root certificates stored outside your servers and connect them to your certificate chain.

-   **[Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acc-kubernetes-visibility-landing-page&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

KVA performs continuous discovery to detect changes on resources in a Kubernetes cluster and updates the CMDB with the latest data.

Starting with KVA version 3.11.0, and Informer version 2.5.0, absent namespace CIs aren’t deleted automatically. Create a scheduled job to remove them.

Starting with KVA version 3.11.0, and Informer version 2.5.0, map application services based on traffic connections between the workloads in Kubernetes, by using istio and linked service meshes or the DaemonSet service.

-   **[Prevent credential exposure by updating HTTP Classify behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-an-http-classifier&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The HTTP Classify probe no longer attempts credentials over the HTTP protocol by default. This change enhances security by helping prevent potential exposure of credentials over unencrypted connections. To override this behavior, a new MID Server property, **mid.http\_classy.allow\_credentials\_over\_http**, has been introduced. Enabling this setting might expose credentials to man-in-the-middle \(MitM\) attacks. Therefore, it’s strongly recommended to keep this property set to false and use HTTPS whenever possible.

-   **[Automated Certificate Renewal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=automated-certificate-renewal&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version 3.8.2, Certificate Inventory and Management introduces automated renewal capabilities. Administrators can set certificates to renew automatically, either when creating the certificate or by applying the setting to an existing one. The system also enables you to define the renewal window by specifying the number of days before expiration that the process should begin.
