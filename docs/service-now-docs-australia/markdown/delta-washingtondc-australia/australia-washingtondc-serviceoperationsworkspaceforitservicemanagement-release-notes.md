-   **[Using Universal Request in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-ur-sow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the ServiceNow® Universal Request application to create requests and connect with other departments and services to assist with request resolution. You can map the various departmental ticket states and activity streams into a unified and simplified experience for your employees and agents.

-   **[On-Call Scheduling in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=on-call-scheduling-in-sow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Schedules menu to access the ServiceNow® On-Call Scheduling application from the home page. Agents can use the Schedules menu to view their schedules, request absence and set their notification preference. A Group Manager can use the schedules icon to manage schedules and requests, set escalation trigger rules and policies, and create delivery channels for notification preferences.

Use the teams icon to access the teams record. Agents can use the Teams menu to view their team's on-call schedules and a Group Manager can set escalation trigger rules, escalation policies, and team preferences.

Starting in version 5.0, you can select a preferred shift from the Share calendar drop-down list and subscribe to the calendar. This option is available for Agents and Shift managers who are part of the respective group.

-   **[Landing page configurations using Admin Center](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-admin-console-sow-itsm&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 5.0, you can configure the following options for the landing page:

    -   Display or hide various sections.
    -   On the landing page, collapse the list view for donuts cards by default, which reduces the page load time, and expand the list view by selecting any donut card.
-   **[Quick access to the record information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sow-ui-landing-page&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 5.0, get quick access to the record information.

    -   From the list view that opens by selecting a donut area on the landing page, access the record information for the following records:

        -   Incident
        -   Problem
        -   Interaction
        -   Change
        -   Request
**Note:** You can preview and update the record information in the workspace view.

    -   From any record page, copy the record page URL to easily access the record and share it with other agents and other stakeholders if required.
-   **[Problem Management in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=problem-sow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 5.0, problem coordinators can:

    -   Manage problems and problem tasks through their life cycle.
    -   Share problem workarounds or fixes with related incidents.
    -   Create known error articles to help deflect incidents.
**Note:**

    -   If you aren't using the base problem life cycle, you must continue to use the classic experience to manage problems or problem tasks through their life cycle.
    -   The base problem life cycle is included with the Problem Management  Best Practice - Madrid - State Model \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\) plugin. Use the Problem Management Migration Utility [store application](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/d03b7539dbbb3300f21e7ffdbf9619a8) to enable this plugin and migrate your records to the base problem life cycle.
    -   Known error articles are enabled by the Problem Management Best Practice - Madrid - Knowledge Integration \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.knowledge\) plugin.
-   **[Incident record page enhancements in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-update-inc-overview-tab&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 5.0, the incident record page has enhancements that maintain parity and bring the features from the classic UI16 to the workspace view. These enhancements reduce the efforts of agents to increase their productivity. With the enhancements, agents can:

    -   Copy the page URL to the clipboard to quickly share the link to other agents or stakeholders.
    -   Preview the records of the reference key fields on the same page, or open the record in a separate tab.
    -   Update the incident information in the Summary section and Impact summary section of the **Overview** tab.
    -   Preview caller information from the caller card on the Record information side panel.
    -   View the assets, recent interaction, and incident information that are specific to the caller.
    -   The incident information such as priority, state, configuration item and opened, is moved from the header of the incident record page to the Summary section of the **Overview** tab to increase the workspace view area.
-   **[Major incident management in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mim-in-sow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 5.0, Major Incident Management in Service Operations Workspace enables you to manage the entire major incident life cycle in the following ways:

    -   Propose, promote, create, and manage major incidents.
    -   View the number of impacted callers and their locations on the world map.
    -   Identify and create a major incident automatically based on major incident trigger rules.
    -   Communicate with the business stakeholders and end users by sending status updates and notifications to inform them about the impact and progress of the major incident.
    -   Collaborate with the business stakeholders to discuss the issues and help with resolving the major incident.
    -   Resolve major incidents.
-   **[Major incident configurations in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=setup-mim-sow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

    -   Assign playbooks to manage major incident process.
    -   Assign a Major Incident Manager role to users for managing major incidents.

    -   Configure timelines for generating post incident reports.
-   **[Playbook integration with major incident management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-mi-playbook-sow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 5.0, major incident playbooks in Major Incident Management provide a way to visualize the entire major incident process in a task-oriented view. The major incident playbooks leverage communication, collaboration, and core major incident process capabilities. These capabilities help to quickly identify key areas that require attention, as well as manage and resolve major incidents. The following two playbooks are available in the base system:

    -   MI playbook
    -   Advanced MI playbook
-   **[Review and publish post incident report in Major Incident Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=review-update-pir-mim-sow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 5.0, review the post incident report for a major incident to evaluate the incident response process and identify the process gaps for improvements. Reviewing the report helps you analyze the incident and to understand what can be done to avoid a similar incident or issue in the future. A post incident report is created automatically after a major incident is resolved. Use the Post incident report tab on a major incident record to generate, edit, review, and publish the report in PDF.
