# Combined Data Management release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Data Management from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Data Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Data Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

A data management policy record is automatically created for each table that is configured with an archive rule or a table cleaner rule prior to the upgrade.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   After upgrading a self-hosted instance to Yokohama, the sys\_physical\_table\_stats table doesn't display the latest data for table size, with the sample\_period\_start column showing dates prior to the upgrade. To see the correct table size, you can set the com.glide.stats.storage\_disk\_usage.information\_schema system property to true, which allows the statsGatherer job to use the information schema to generate the required database statistics.

-   A data management policy record is automatically created for each table that is configured with an archive rule or a table cleaner rule prior to the upgrade.
