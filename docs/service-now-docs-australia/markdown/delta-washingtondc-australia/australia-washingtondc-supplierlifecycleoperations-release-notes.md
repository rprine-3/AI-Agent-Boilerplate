# Combined Supplier Lifecycle Operations release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Supplier Lifecycle Operations from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Supplier Lifecycle Operations release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Supplier Lifecycle Operations to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Washington DC

</td><td>

After upgrading from the Vancouver release to the Washington DC release, you will see only the Source-to-Pay Workspace on the **All** navigation tab. You don't have to do anything if you choose to continue to use the Source-to-Pay Workspace.

 However, you will see both the Source-to-Pay Workspace and Supplier Manager Workspace on the **Workspaces** tab. If you want to use the Supplier Manager Workspace instead of the default Source-to-Pay Workspace, ensure that you run the `fixscript_migrate_workspace_to_smw.xml` fix script after upgrading to the Washington DC release. You can download the `fixscript_migrate_workspace_to_smw.xml` file from the ServiceNow Store.

 If you want to revert to using the Source-to-Pay Workspace, run the `fixscript_migrate_workspace_to_s2p.xml` fix script. You can download the `fixscript_migrate_workspace_to_smw.xml` file from the ServiceNow Store. For more information about how to run a fix script, see [Run fix scripts](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_RunFixScripts&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 After you upgrade to Washington DC, you must review all the post-upgrade tasks and complete them as needed. For more information, see [Post-upgrade tasks for Supplier Lifecycle Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=post-upgrade-tasks-slo&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Offboard a supplier from the Procurement Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=offboard-supplier&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The supplier offboarding playbook has been introduced that enables you to do the following:

    -   Create a supplier offboarding case to offboard a supplier.
    -   Create a Due Diligence request if the GRC: Third-party Risk Due Diligence Request \[com.sn\_tprm\_onboarding\] plugin is installed.
    -   Displays a list of pending supplier cases and tasks.
    -   Ability to check contract and invoices.
    -   Maintain communication with the internal stakeholders and the supplier throughout the offboarding process.
-   **[Supplier Lifecycle Management integration framework](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=slo-int-framework&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Supplier Lifecycle Operations \(SLO\) integration framework enables you to exchange supplier data with any third-party ERP system. The SLO integration framework facilitates inbound and outbound integration with third-party applications and ERP systems.

-   **[Configure due dates for tasks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-task-due-date&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure due dates for different task types so that the **Due date** field is auto-populated when you create tasks.

-   **[Complete a risk assessment from the Supplier Collaboration Portal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=complete-risk-assessments&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

View supplier risk assessment details from the My active items widget in the Supplier Collaboration Portal. In the My active items widget, the Risk Assessments tile shows assessments only if you've installed the Third-party Risk Management \[com.sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt\] plugin. Select the **Risk Assessments** tile to open the Assessment Summary page, which displays a list of risk assessments for a supplier and for an engagement.

-   **[View risk assessment details in Source-to-Pay Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=supp-ws-details-page&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

A new **Risk** tab has been added on the Supplier record page in the Source-to-Pay Workspace. The Risk tab displays supplier risk assessment details, such as third-party name and process information, summary reports, risk intelligence scores, and tracking data for issues and tasks. The **Risk** tab is displayed only if you have installed the Third-party Risk Management \[com.sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt\] and GRC: Vendor Risk Management Workspace \(com.sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt\_workspace\) plugins.

-   **[Assign tasks to internal users](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-new-task-for-supp-case&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Organization Tax Details table](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-supp-mgmt&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Restructured Supplier Task table](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=supplier-task-table-restructure&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Supplier Task table architecture has been restructured. Starting with the Washington DC release, the Supplier Task \[sn\_slm\_task\] table extends the Service Task \[sn\_spend\_sdc\_service\_task\] table.

**Note:**

You can experience a longer upgrade time if you’re upgrading from Vancouver or an older release to Washington DC or any latest release. This delay is due to a mandatory script that runs for restructuring the Supplier Task \[sn\_slm\_task\] table and the duration of upgrade depends on the number of records in this table.

-   **[Risk Assessments for Supplier Lifecycle Operations plugin introduced](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-playbooks-onboard-supp&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

A new plugin, Risk Assessments for Supplier Lifecycle Operations \(com.snc.sn\_supplier\_tprm\) has been added that provides an integration with third-party risk assessment application to conduct risk assessments when onboarding new suppliers using the Supplier onboarding playbook.

-   **[Using the supplier onboarding playbook to onboard suppliers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-playbooks-onboard-supp&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Supplier onboarding playbook now includes a new Perform risk assessment playbook that triggers two different flows to conduct supplier risk assessments, depending on the plugins that you have installed:

    -   If you have installed only the Risk Assessments Integration for Supplier Lifecycle Operations \[com.snc.sn\_supplier\_tprm\] plugin, the Perform risk assessment playbook triggers the flow that includes activities to verify the eligibility of the supplier by creating risk assessments.
    -   If you have installed both the Risk Assessments for Supplier Lifecycle Operations \[com.snc.sn\_supplier\_tprm\] and GRC: Third-party Risk Due Diligence Request \[com.sn\_tprm\_onboarding\] plugins, the Perform risk assessment playbook triggers the flow that includes activities to create a due diligence request, complete Inherent Risk Questionnaire \(IRQ\) assessments, and conduct risk assessments for a third-party or an engagement.
-   **[Create a case on behalf of a supplier from the Procurement Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-new-supplier-case&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can experience a longer upgrade time if you’re upgrading from Vancouver or an older release to Washington DC or any latest release.
