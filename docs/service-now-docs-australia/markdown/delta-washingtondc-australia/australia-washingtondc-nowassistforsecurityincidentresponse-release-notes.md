For more information about required applications for Now Assist for Security Incident Response, see [Supporting information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=supporting-information-now-assist-security-incident&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

 **Note:**

Upgrading the Now Assist plugins activate any designated skills that were previously untouched by the customer.

-   If you have the plugins installed but never touched the configuration \(never activated the skill nor adjusted associated roles\) of a skill, any Default On skill will be activated on a per skill basis upon upgrading.
-   If you have previously toggled a skill from active and then back to inactive or have updated any roles for that skill, that skill remains inactive upon upgrading.
-   You maintain full control over deactivating individual skills at any time after activation.

 Starting with version 2.0.1, the name of the Now Assist for Security Operations application in ServiceNow® Store and in your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance has changed to Now Assist for Security Incident Response. You must upgrade to version 2.0.1 to access the following features:

-   Generate resolution notes in the Now Assist context menu.
-   Generate correlation insights for a security incident investigation from the Now Assist panel.

 The AI Search application must be enabled so that the recommended actions skill works for security incidents. To verify that AI Search is enabled on your instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Status**. Contact support if the page indicates that AI Search is not enabled.

-   **[Role configuration required for agentic workflows and AI agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=aia-role-masking&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Agentic workflows and AI agents included with Now Assist applications require additional security configuration. If you select **Users with selected roles** for your user access security controls for an agentic workflow or AI agent, you must add the installed roles, or they will not execute. Data access settings must also include these roles. See the documentation for the agentic workflow or AI agent for the specific roles you must add.

-   **[Some Now Assist skills are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill is turned on automatically \(the skill was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[Generate a quality assessment report](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-sir-quality-assessment&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use generative AI to create a quality assessment report of a security incident. The reports are generated using a predefined, natural language rule set. The report provides an overall assessment summary followed by the detailed assessment for all the rules.


-   **[Generate SIR Shift Handover Report](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=add-incidents-shifthandover-ai-agent&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The AI Agent helps add security incident details to a shift handover report. The agent populates the different sections of the shift handover with appropriate content by identifying the relevant details from the security incident. The AI agent can fetch details of the security incident and identify if the analyst has access to the shift handover record. The AI agent can generate content for each section of the shift handover record and asks for analysts feedback on the content. The AI agent refines the content based on the feedback and saves the content to the records on approval.

-   ****

-   **[Use agentic workflows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-now-assist-ai-agents-sir&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Analyze security operations metrics agentic workflow enables security managers to analyze their teams' performance.

    -   Generate metrics for Security Incident Response \(SIR\) records for case volume, mean time to assign \(MTTA\), and mean time to resolve \(MTTR\) for a date range of your choosing.
    -   Request suggestions for how to improve MTTR, MTTA, and volume based on your metrics.
-   **[Enhancements to correlation insights in Now Assist for Security Incident Response](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generating-insights-for-now-assist-for-security&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can generate and view results for correlation insights in the Security Incident Response Workspace.

    -   Correlation insights are not limited to the primary configuration item \(CI\) or affected users associated with a security incident. You can base your correlation insights on any CI or affected user for a security incident.
    -   You can generate correlation insights from the **Investigation** tab for a security incident in any state in the Security Incident Response Workspace.
    -   You can generate insights for multiple items simultaneously for Associated Observables, Configuration items, and Affected Users.
    -   Results are displayed in a modeless dialog that you can size and move.
-   **[Using Security incident resolution agentic workflow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-sir-resolve-incident-ai-workflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Security incident resolution agentic workflow to close your security incidents. Analysts can chat with the AI agents in natural language to resolve the security incidents. The AI agent analyzes the incident details, existing runbooks, knowledge articles, and past similar security incidents as inputs, and provides a resolution plan. The AI agent also assists the analysts to resolve the security incident.


-   **[Using Security Incident Response AI agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-now-assist-ai-agents-sir&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Yokohama Patch 1: Use the Close security incident use case to close your security incidents:

    -   Analysts can chat with the AI agents in natural language to close the security incidents. The AI agent can cancel the associated response tasks, generate resolution notes, close code, or close notes and post incident analysis \(PIA\) during incident closure. Analysts can provide feedback on the content and the AI agent can refine the content​ based on the feedback.
    -   Analysts can also close false positive security incidents with minimal user intervention.
-   **[Yokohama Early Availability](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-security-incident-landing&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   [Generate correlation insights](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-correlation-insights-now-assist-for-security&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)

Generate correlation insights to connect current security incidents to past events. You can identify the affected users, configuration items \(CI\)s, or observables \(IP addresses and file hashes\) from existing incidents and records to help you more quickly triage your new security incidents. Correlation insights are supported in Workspace, the Core UI, and from the Now Assist panel.

    -   Enhancements to [closure \(resolution\) notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-closure-notes-si-now-assist-sec-incident&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) and [post incident analysis](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-pia-report-now-assist-security-incident&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) generation

Generate resolution notes from the Close the security incident modal or the Now Assist context menu on a security incident record \(SIR\). You can also generate resolution notes from the Now Assist panel. If you choose the Now Assist context menu, you have the following options to help you refine the generated text:

        -   **Shorten**: Select the text to remove details.
        -   **Elaborate**: Generate more details about the context of a security incident.
**Note:** Generating resolution notes is supported in Workspace and Core UI. Generating a post incident analysis is supported from the Close the security incident modal in Workspace.
