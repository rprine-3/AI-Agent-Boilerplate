Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[Exclusion Framework in Dynamic Translation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dyn-translation-exclusion-framework&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Exclusion Framework enables you to prevent machine translation of certain words and terms. You can specify words, such as official product names, that you want to shield from the translation process. You can also input regex to prevent translation of patterns such as sys ids.

-   **[The flows used by default Translator Configurations are upgraded to v4](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=migrate-v4-dynamic-translation&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

With the Xanadu Patch 3 release, the flows used by default translator configurations are automatically upgraded to v4. If you want to use v4 flows and APIs with customized translator configurations, you must migrate them manually. The previous v3 is still supported.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Exclusion Framework in Dynamic Translation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dyn-translation-exclusion-framework&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Preserve text such as product names or technical terms during machine translation. With Exclusion Framework, you can specify words and patterns that shouldn't be translated.

-   **[The APIs used by default Translator Configurations are upgraded to v4](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=migrate-v3-dynamic-translation&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The APIs used by default translator configurations are automatically upgraded to v4. If you want to use v4 APIs with customized translator configurations, you must migrate them manually. The previous v3 is still supported.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Test Exclusion Rule](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dyn-translation-test-exclusion-rule&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new Test Exclusion Rule module to check your exclusion pattern in Exclusion Framework of Dynamic Translation. You can manually test either exact matches or pattern \(regex\) matches. See what your exclusion pattern matches when translating your input into target languages. When you are satisfied with your exclusion pattern, you can create an exclusion rule based on it with just one step.
