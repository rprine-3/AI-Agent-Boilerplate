# Combined Problem Management release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Problem Management from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Problem Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

-   **[Initial support for Problem Management models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=problem-mgmt-models&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Introduction of Problem Management models, beginning with one default problem model \(General\) and two default problem task models \(Root cause analysis and General\).

The default models are equivalent to the base life cycle in the Washington DC release. This initial support allows for the creation of custom models to tailor additional scenarios for specific use cases.

**Note:**

If you are using Service Operations Workspace 5.x and you enable Problem Management models, you will manage problems and problem tasks in the classic UI16 experience, rather than in Service Operations Workspace.

Service Operations Workspace 6.x is based on the Xanadu release and it supports Problem Management models.

-   **[User role for service desk agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=prob-roles-instld-itsm-roles&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

With the sn\_service\_desk\_agent user role, increase operational efficiency by streamlining the process of asking about, gathering, and verifying information, as well as delivering quick resolutions. This role is designed for tier 1 service desk agents and is accessible when the ITSM Roles plugin \(com.snc.itsm.roles\) installed.

The sn\_service\_desk\_agent role includes the following roles:

    -   sn\_incident\_write
    -   sn\_problem\_write
    -   sn\_change\_write
    -   sn\_request\_write
    -   tracked\_file\_reader
Additionally, with the installation of the **ITSM Gen AI** \(**com.sn.itsm.gen.ai**\) plugin, the knowledge\_user and now\_assist\_panel\_user roles are integrated within the sn\_service\_desk\_agent role.

The sn\_service\_desk\_agent user role can be used starting with Service Operations Workspace version 6.1.

-   **[Problem Models for Streamlined Problem Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=problem-mgmt-models&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Problem Management models are used to simplify management of problems and problem tasks. These models provide an efficient way to configure state transitions and define conditions to move from one state to another.

This functionality is enabled out of the base system for new or zBoot customers.

Additional flexibility for the workflow of a problem task analyst.

-   **[Email notification redirection behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-notifcations-sow-itsm&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

When users select the problem record link in their email notifications, they can be redirected to the problem record in Service Operations Workspace instead of the classic UI16 experience. The ITSM Notifications Redirection \(com.snc.itsm.notifications\_redirection\) plugin is installed and activated automatically to support this behavior.

-   **[Known error articles available by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-known-error-from-problem&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Problem Knowledge Integration is activated by default for new customers.

-   **[Problem Management Migration Utility](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=migration-utility&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Xanadu base problem files list is updated so the Problem Management Migration Utility can detect customizations.
