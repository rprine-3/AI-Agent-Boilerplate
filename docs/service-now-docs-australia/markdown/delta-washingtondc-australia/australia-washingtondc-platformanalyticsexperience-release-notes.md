# Combined Platform Analytics experience release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Platform Analytics experience from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Platform Analytics experience release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Platform Analytics experience to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

New customers: The Platform Analytics experience is automatically available on the ServiceNow AI Platform. It offers an intuitive interface to help you better understand and utilize your data.

 Upgrading customers: If you are currently using Core UI responsive dashboards, you will continue to have access without any disruption. Consider transitioning to the Platform Analytics experience to take full advantage of the new capabilities.

Yokohama

</td><td>

If you had previously migrated your analytics assets to Platform Analytics, assets that were in compatibility mode but are newly supported in Yokohama are migrated automatically.

Zurich

On upgrade, any homepages on your instance that have been opened are migrated to Core UI dashboards, which are visible in the dashboard library. For more information, see [Homepage deprecation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=homepage-deprecation-help-tool&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

 Simple lists are all converted to the new List element on upgrade.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

After upgrading, only admins can create Core UI analytics objects: reports, Performance Analytics widgets, responsive dashboards, and interactive filters. Other users can still view and edit Core UI objects but can create only Platform Analytics objects, such as data visualizations.

 When upgrading, the published status on all Core UI reports changes to **false**, making them unpublished.

 After upgrading, the Analytics Hub isn't available. Links to the Analytics Hub are redirected to KPI Details.

As an analytics manager, view usage statistics in the data visualization library. Those statistics include the number of reports, data visualizations that aren't used in any dashboards, and the number of data visualizations not viewed for more than six months.

-   **[Get recommendations to review problematic analytics resources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=pa-library-recommendations&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

As an analytics manager, view recommendations for which artifacts you should fix or delete in the Dashboard, Data Visualization, and Indicator libraries.

Reflow is supported for low-vision users. The following changes were made to provide this support:

-   The view mode of the Platform Analytics dashboard editor and the Visualization designer support reflow.
-   All charts: At 400% zoom, if the legend is originally in any position other than the top or the bottom, it is moved to the bottom.
-   Bubble chart: XY zoom is enabled by default during reflow at 400% zoom.
-   Donut and pie charts: Range labels are shown as legends by default at 400% zoom.
-   Gauge chart: Range labels can be shown as a legend instead. At 400% zoom, this option is enabled automatically.
-   GeoMap: Zoom controls are persistent during reflow at 200%+ zoom.
-   Pivot Table: Row headers and footers and the first column unfreeze by default during reflow at 400% zoom.
-   Time Series and bar charts: New configuration option to show the specific data point in the tooltip instead of all data points. A single data point is shown by default during reflow at 400% zoom. Also, these charts do not show points with no data.
-   Date filters: During reflow, the date picker is not available in the configuration panel. Instead, you can select the start and end date and time from the Select a date range menu. Also, all components are stacked vertically.
-   Multi-select filters: Checkbox groups with a horizontal layout reflow to a vertical layout when zoomed.
-   True/false filters: Popovers and the Clear, Cancel, and Apply buttons are removed during reflow at 400% zoom.

 Other accessibility changes include:

-   Data tables can be shown for all relevant visualizations, to aid screen readers. These data tables break down the proportion of values by percentage.
-   All charts: The “More options” menu now includes the chart title.
-   Indicator Scorecard: Keyboard navigation to expand and collapse rows and speech output are now supported.
