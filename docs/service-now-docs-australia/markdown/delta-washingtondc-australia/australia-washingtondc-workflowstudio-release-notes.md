Deprecated the system property com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.iteration.lastn that specifies the number of loop iterations that a flow generates execution details for. This property only applies to flows created prior to the Washington DC release. New flows only generate execution details for the first and last iterations of a loop. To report on all iterations of a loop, create a flow execution settings record for the flow instead. For more information about flow execution settings, see [Flow execution settings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=flow-execution-settings&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
