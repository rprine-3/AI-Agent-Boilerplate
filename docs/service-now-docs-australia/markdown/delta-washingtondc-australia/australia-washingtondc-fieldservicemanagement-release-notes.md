Enhance scheduling accuracy and performance with [Schedule Optimization](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=schedule-optimization-engine&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)

    -   View comprehensive details for all optimization runs to quickly identify issues. Access standardized information about run status, included tasks and qualifiers, unassigned tasks with explanations, and the objectives and constraints applied during each optimization.
    -   Manage integrations more easily by configuring options to enable or disable third-party map providers beyond the default provider.
    -   Leverage all available trainers to reduce processing time and accelerate end-to-end scheduling for high-volume scenarios by splitting qualifiers into non-overlapping sets and running multiple optimization jobs in parallel.
    -   Improve scheduling accuracy by introducing a **Window End Buffer Duration** field on the Work Order task record that enables you to configure a buffer duration that extends optimization beyond the defined window end so tasks are retained in the schedule.
    -   Ensure only relevant tasks are processed by removing intraday events that don't meet specified criteria from both scheduled and prioritized optimization runs.
    -   Improve optimization control by applying matching rules to intraday events by accessing them in the **Table** field on Matching Rules.
    -   Reduce processing time for high-volume scheduling by splitting qualifiers into non-overlapping groups to run multiple optimization jobs in parallel across available trainers. View how qualifiers are grouped using the **Job Distribution** column in both batch and intraday runs.

Use [Appointment Booking](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=appointment-booking-administer&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) to perform the following tasks:

    -   Ensure better alignment with your operations by defining advanced lead time and cut-off logic through APIs or extension points. You can implement a custom script through an extension point based on job type, time of day, and day of week.
    -   Accommodate emergencies or priorities even if the capacity or appointment slots are full by enabling overbooking of appointments.
    -   Configure appointment slots to consider the holiday settings for a territory and display the available slots accordingly.
    -   Ensure guaranteed appointment slots by configuring availability checks to be performed at the time of slot retrieval so that any slot displayed is assured to be bookable without needing further capacity validation during the appointment booking.
    -   Ensure an accurate calculation of the duration for a task while booking an appointment by defining work and travel duration either in the appointment schedule configuration or in the schedule override configuration.
    -   Determine appointment availability using territory and demand channel mapping when contact or location details are not provided.
    -   Consider task dependencies while booking or rescheduling appointments and display the slots for the successor tasks after the estimated completion time including the defined lag time for the predecessor task.
-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ai-native-sku-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[SLAs in Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-dispatcher-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The SLAs breached query on the Dispatcher Dashboard in Dispatcher Workspace has been updated to look at the SLAs that are associated with the work order tasks only instead of the work orders and work order tasks. The SLA breached counter on the task cards is also static, instead of real time. For more information on changing the SLA timer on task cards, see the Enable the **SLA timer on work order task cards** property on [Configure settings for Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-workspce-settings&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Assignment groups and territories in Dispatcher Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-dispatcher-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

You must save the default assignment groups or territories in Dispatcher Workspace to load when you open Dispatcher Workspace. If you don’t have the defaults saved, then you must select the assignment groups or territories to appear every time you open Dispatcher Workspace. This change is made to improve the performance of Dispatcher Workspace. For more information on saving the default assignment groups, see the Groups section on the **General** tab on [Enable Dispatcher Workspace settings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispatcher-wrkspc-settings&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

-   **Reflow**

The Dispatcher Workspace and Workforce Optimization for Field Service workspace support reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

In addition, the following pages were updated to support reflow:

    -   Territory planning
    -   Service location
    -   Geography
    -   Agent recommendation
This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
