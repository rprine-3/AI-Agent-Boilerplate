-   **[Request a clone in Clone Admin Console](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-ui-request-clone&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The app features a simplified clone request page with guidance and explanations for how various settings affect your clone. The new request page also features a scheduling tool to help prevent timing conflicts between the automatic rescheduling of clones and infrastructure maintenance windows.

-   **[Guidance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Clone-UI&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Learn how some clone options may affect your clone time with added information and guidance.

-   **[On-demand backup option](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-ui-request-clone&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use a fresh backup as part of your clone. This option can be useful if you want to include newly published changes in your clone and you don’t want to wait for the next nightly backup.

-   **[Clone Logs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Clone-UI&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

See the **Show Logs** link that is added to display the Clone Logs on the Clone Status page when selected.

-   **[Recurring clones](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Clone-UI&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create recurring clones using the clone frequency options on the clone request page. The clone frequencies are **Weekly**, **Every two weeks**, and **Every four weeks**.

**Note:** Each occurrence is created as a separate clone request. If changes are required, you must change the individual clone requests that are created.

-   **[Target instance modal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-ui-request-clone&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Add an instance or select an existing instance without leaving the page using the **add an instance** option in the **clone request target instance** field.

-   **[Use the same backup as another clone](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-ui-request-clone&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the same backup as another clone when selecting a backup option. If the backup no longer exists, it triggers an on-demand backup instead.

-   **[Clone storage](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-ui-request-clone&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Legacy clones and new clones are stored separately. Clones requested via the Clone Admin Console are stored on a new table and displayed within the new console.  Legacy clones aren't shown in the console. Clones initiated via the legacy Request Clone page are stored on the legacy Clone History table.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[Target instance modal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-ui-request-clone&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Request a clone to copy the data from a production instance to a non-production instance or to copy the data between non-production instances. You can request a clone without leaving the form by using the **add an instance** option in the **clone request target instance** field.

-   **[Using the same backup from another clone](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Clone-UI&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the backup from another clone when you're selecting a backup option for a faster backup process. If the backup no longer exists, it triggers an on-demand backup instead.

-   **[Clone storage](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Clone-UI&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Legacy clones and new clones are stored separately. Clones that you request via the Clone Admin Console are stored on a new table and displayed within the new console.  Legacy clones aren't shown in the Clone Admin Console. Clones that you initiate via the legacy Request Clone page are stored on the legacy Clone History table.

Create an additional clone request even if there’s already a future clone for that target. This feature helps with the limitation where you can't submit another clone until all existing requests have been canceled.

-   **[Clone summary](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_StartAClone&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Help prevent clone conflicts with the Clone summary, which highlights clones that are scheduled in the next 30 days that involve the same target instance.

-   **[Updated authentication model](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-target-instance&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
