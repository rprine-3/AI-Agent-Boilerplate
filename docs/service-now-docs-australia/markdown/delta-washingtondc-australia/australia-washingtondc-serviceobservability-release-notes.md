-   **[Create and manage mappings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-and-manage-observability-data-mappings&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Map services in the CMDB Workspace to the data from a connected application performance monitoring \(APM\) data source. Service Observability supports Dynatrace and New Relic. This mapping lets you view metrics from entities deep within your system, like a database or host, that might be affecting the health of a service.

Starting in version 1.7.3, metrics from Datadog are supported.

Starting in version 1.7.3, you can map Business Services and Service Offerings to APM data. Service Offerings are not available in Xanadu.

Use the Overview tab to view rate, error, and duration \(RED\) metrics from the APM related to a service. You can also view related open alerts, incidents, and change requests from the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) to help identify possible causes and blast radius.

-   **[View service health metrics](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-service-health-metrics&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

View the extended health metrics for a service on the new **Observability** tab when issues are found on the **Overview** tab. In addition to the extended health metrics, you can view host and database metrics related to the service based on the configured data mappings.

-   **[Customize dashboard templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=customize-service-observability-dashboards&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 1.6.4, customize the templates used to display dashboards in the **Overview** and **Observability** tabs.
