If you are a VRM user upgrading to TPRM, when upgrading to Vancouver or later from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. This means upgrading from Utah to Vancouver, Vancouver to Washington DC, and so on. If the scripts do not run in the correct order, it can result in data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

 For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

Starting with the Vancouver release, if you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM, from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. This means upgrading from one release to the next rather than skipping to the latest release. Not running scripts in the correct order can result in data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

 For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

 For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 20.2.4, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

If you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Vancouver or a later release from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Utah to Vancouver, Vancouver to Washington DC, and so on. If the scripts don’t run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn’t reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM and the differences between the Smart and Classic Assessment engines, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 21.0.3, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column.

Validation reports include real-world field labels, rule expressions, and record identifiers. You can cross-reference validation errors using a downloadable Excel master template that mirrors the CSV structure, making it easier to locate and address issues. Additional enhancements include support for “Not applicable” values, enforcement of file size limits, and clearer error messages for malformed data.

If you have the Third-party risk assessor \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\] or Third-party risk manager \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager\] role, you can enable third-party and engagement contacts to review and update responses only if necessary by pre-populating questionnaires for engagements and entities with responses from completed questionnaires that are associated with the same third party. The attachment, duration, and signature type responses are excluded. This feature also helps ensure data consistency and accuracy.

-   **[Microsoft Excel questionnaire template](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-excel-template-support&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Streamline the due diligence process by enabling third-party and engagement contacts to respond to questionnaires using a Microsoft Excel template by downloading the questionnaire as a template, completing it according to the included instructions, and importing the final version into the Third-party portal. This feature update enhances flexibility by enabling third-party and engagement contacts to provide information outside the third-party portal. Third-party risk assessors \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\] and Third-party risk managers \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager\] can access this feature and respond to questionnaires on behalf of Third-party and engagement contacts through the Vendor Management Workspace.

Include this information when the legal name of a third party differs from its commonly recognized name, or when you need to record multiple identification codes like a EUID, LEI, or Country code. When supply chain, assessment, or contract records are associated with a third party or third-party engagement using the EUID code type, all relevant fields will be automatically populated.

-   **[Function types for ICT third-party service providers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-create-new-function-form&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have the third-party assessor role \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\], help ensure compliance with DORA regulations by using Business capability as an additional function type for function records in the digital resilience third-party registers within the Vendor Management Workspace.

The Advanced Response Automation for Smart Assessments plugin automatically fills in assessment responses based on prior data or logic, streamlining and standardizing the assessment process.

-   **Feature-specific administrator role enhancements**

Starting with version 21.1.x, if you have a feature admin role you can now complete tasks that were initially reserved for users with the broader administrator role.

    -   Assign sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.external\_assessment\_responder to users who need access to the third-party portal and to complete assessments.

**Note:** Administrator privileges no longer grant access to TPRM features. Users must be assigned an appropriate feature-specific role to access relevant functionality.

Starting with version 21.1.x, Fourth-party assessments are now supported after you enable the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property.

-   **[Enhanced contract records for Digital Resilience Third-party Information Register in Vendor Management Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-drtp-reg-contract&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have the third-party assessor role \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\], you can now associate multiple entities with a single contract record. This association indicates that all entities have signed the contract and are providing services that are associated with the contract. You can also configure contracts that are based on the supply chain and assessment, upload contract records, and generate reports in Microsoft Excel. To better track these entities and help ensure compliance with Digital Operational Resilience Management \(DORA\) regulations, related lists have been added to the existing contract records, and existing fields have been reorganized for better usability.

-   **[Simplified third-party element process](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-workflow-in-workspace&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.1, third‑party elements are now linked to a single third party and can no longer be shared across third parties. Scoring rollups calculate results from element‑level assessments rather than entity records.


 -   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ai-native-sku-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
