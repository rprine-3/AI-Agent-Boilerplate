-   **[Digital Portfolio Management Workspace homepage](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-explore-landing&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   See all your solution cards, ordered by severity, on the redesigned DPM Workspace homepage.
    -   Log in to DPM for the first time to see auto-generated solution cards based on your user name in certain tables. After your first login, you're encouraged to personalize your DPM homepage.

**Note:** With the sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin role, you can update the homepage solutions table to tailor the solution cards that users see at the first login to the DPM Workspace \(before personalization\).

-   **[Personalize the Digital Portfolio Management Workspace homepage](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-personalize-homepage&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Add or remove solution cards to personalize your DPM homepage. You can also adjust the Needs attention thresholds for each solution to see which needs the most attention. The severity levels are good, moderate, or severe.
    -   Your personalized list of solutions is kept in the **dpm\_home\_page\_item** table so that they're displayed every time you log in. This table updates each time you personalize your homepage.
-   **[Digital Portfolio Management homepage default solution cards](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-oob-solution-card-fields&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the following system properties to improve the overall DPM performance and enable the number of solutions cards to display on your homepage.

<table><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

**dpm.homepage.cmdb\_ci\_business\_app\_limit** for business applications.

</td><td>

250

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>You can add and remove solution cards in any combination, but the total solution cards can’t exceed 1000 on the DPM homepage.

**Note:** With the sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin role, you can change the system property limits to more than 1000 solutions on the DPM homepage. However, raising the limit may negatively impact system performance.

-   **[Configure the Digital Portfolio Management experience](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-configure-experience&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

As a user with the sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin role, you can:

    -   Configure the user experience by showing or hiding the available item types in DPM:
        -   Services
        -   Technical services
        -   Business services
        -   Application services
        -   Service offerings
        -   Business applications
    -   Update the available item types table to hide or show solution types on the DPM homepage and in the personal portfolios. Examples of solution types are **cmdb\_ci\_service** and **cmdb\_ci\_business\_app**.

**Note:** When a solution type is hidden, that solution is omitted from the following areas of DPM:

        -   The auto-generated solution card results.
        -   The personalization options of add and remove items.
        -   The set status conditions when updating thresholds.
        -   The page filters.
-   **[View business application details](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-business-apps-details&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

See all the application services for the business application in a KPI group breakdown list on the Run tab. The list shows up to 10 application services but you can page through to see more. The list shows the KPIs from the lowest ordered KPI group mapped \(or inherited\) by the business application.

-   **[Copy a KPI group to create a new KPI group in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-copy-kpi-group&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create a new KPI group by copying an existing KPI group in DPM. All the records and mappings of the KPI group are copied as well. After you copy the KPI group, you can modify all aspects of it so the new group best fits your needs.

-   **[Configure Digital Portfolio Management to integrate with Process Optimization](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-setup-po&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Process Mining in DPM to see the status of KPIs on your solutions, and to adjust as needed. DPM for Process Mining comes with project templates to mine data for incidents, problems, changes, and requests. With the sn\_dpm.dpm\_admin role, enable Process Mining in DPM:

    -   Install the ITSM Process Mining Content Pack from the ServiceNow® Store, and
    -   Set the system property **sn\_dpm.enable.po.dpm** to `true`.

-   **[Use the Admin Center in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-admin-center&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the DPM Admin Center guided walk-through to set up your DPM Workspace. The Admin Center guides you to identify data in your instance that’s ready to view in DPM. Use the provided suggestions to set up and configure the DPM Workspace for that instance. For example, if planning data isn’t used in the instance, then the DPM Admin Center guides you on how to hide the Plan tab. The DPM Admin Center also provides links to appropriate tables to create or edit services, applications, and portfolios. Here are more tasks a DPM administrator can do with the DPM Admin Center.

    -   Use workflows to identify and set up solutions \(services, service offerings, business applications, and application services\). The guided walk-through includes insights into each solution's data readiness for DPM.
    -   Access the settings pages to configure the DPM Workspace using the provided system properties.
    -   Configure solution page headers and the General info section of the Info tab.
    -   Map KPI groups to solutions to view metrics in the DPM Workspace.
    -   Use links to helpful resources.
    -   Refer to common question links to aid implementation.
    -   Follow the prompts for more setup tasks.
-   **[View relationship maps in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-view-relationship-map&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the ServiceNow platform Unified Map to see a more holistic and comprehensive view of your service and application relationships. The Unified Map replaces the custom DPM relationship map, but you still access the Unified Map in the context of the DPM Workspace. For more information on the platform map, see [Unified Map](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace-unified-map&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Update KPIs in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-kpi-descriptions&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Update the description of a KPI indicator that's provided by the base system. The KPI indicators on solution records come from Performance Analytics \(PA\). In the DPM Workspace, you can select a tooltip on a solution indicator card to see a description that clarifies the indicator data. Even though the descriptions come with the base system, administrators can update the descriptions to accommodate the organization.
    -   With the June 2024 release and after, the **KPI latest score** system property is set to true for new and zBoot customers.
-   **[Work with Needs attention panels in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-needs-attn-panels&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Added problem \(PRB\) records to the Needs attention attributes so that you can identify problems on the following solutions.
        -   Services and service offerings. Problems are related to the service offering via the service offering record on the form, impacted services related list, and on the affected CIs related list. Problems are then rolled up to the parent service and should be deduplicated at the parent service level.
        -   Business applications. Problems are related to the application service via the configuration item field on the form. Problems are then rolled up from the application service to the business application and should be deduplicated at the parent service level.
        -   Application services. Problems are related to the application service via the configuration item field on the form.
    -   Updated the team logic in the DPM Contacts tab for each solution. When you select the Contacts icon \(\[Omitted image "image.contacts"\] Alt text: Contacts icon.\) next to the Needs attention panel, the Teams tab includes multiple teams that support the record. The multiple team assignment is an existing platform feature that was added to Service Portfolio Management so the teams can be viewed in the DPM Workspace. For more information on the platform feature, see [Teams related list](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=teams-related-list&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Use the Admin Center in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-admin-center&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the added Troubleshoot tab on the DPM Admin Center landing page to help you recalculate availability results and indicators for service offerings. You select a specific time period for the recalculation and then you can check the progress in the event log.

-   **[Configure personal portfolio solution cards in the DPM Admin Center](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-configure-solution-cards&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure the fields that are displayed on the personal portfolio solution cards in the DPM Workspace. Solution cards display information about the four main types of solutions \(service, service offering, business application, and application service\). This configuration determines the fields that are displayed on each solution card.

-   **[View relationships of business applications and application services in the DPM Admin Center](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-view-related-records&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

See all incidents, problems, and changes that are related to your business applications and application services. You can view the data in these areas:

    -   The DPM Admin Center
    -   In the DPM Workspace, in the Needs attention panels and in the life-cycle tabs that present key performance indicator \(KPI\) data.
-   **[KPI groups in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-configure-kpi&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Added the ability to select the spark lines \(time series chart\) for a KPI indicator to open its details.

-   **[Update KPIs in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-kpi-descriptions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Added an Active flag so that you can hide KPIs in a KPI group from the DPM Workspace. The Active flag is available for all KPIs so that you can hide an individual KPI even when it's part of a larger KPI group.

-   **[View application service details](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-app-service-details&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Expanded the DPM data model so that when an incident, problem, or change is in the application service's Impacted services or Affected CIs related list, the updates roll up to the related business application. You can see the impacts in the related business application's KPIs and Needs attention panels\). For more information, see [Work with Needs attention panels in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-needs-attn-panels&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Work with lists in Digital Portfolio Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dpm-list-modules&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the updated logic in the list address bar to copy the link of any list item to share that list with others. The list address includes a unique list ID for every list item. This updated logic applies wherever lists are used in the DPM Workspace:

    -   In the list module \(for both provided lists and created lists\).
    -   In the DPM Admin Center.

-   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

-   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
