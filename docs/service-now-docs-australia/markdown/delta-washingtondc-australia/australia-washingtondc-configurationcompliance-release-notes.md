    -   Host Vulnerability Backfill Integration
    -   Test Results Backfill Integration
    -   Host Test Results Backfill Integration
    -   Issues Backfill Integration
The \[is\_ignored\] column is deprecated for the Host Test Results and Test Results Integrations. This column was replaced by the \[is\_result\_ignored\] column.

Source severity is mapped to the Priority column on the Test Results \[sn\_vulc\_result\] table.

Resource type filters are on the Test Results, Issues, and Host Test Results configuration tabs on the Wiz Configuration page. You can add any of the resource types listed.

**Note:**

If you configure resource types on the Resource Type Configuration tab, and you choose to configure parameters on the integration instance records, your configurations on integration instance take precedence over your settings on the Resource Type Configuration tab. See [Identify Wiz Resource types](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=wiz-assets-resources-tab&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

Additional attributes imported from Wiz that are not stored in the Discovered items \[sn\_sec\_cmn\_src\_ci\] table are stamped with `Asset Attributes` in this table.

Test results from the Host misconfiguration integration are classified as result type 'host\_misconfiguration'.

Data for resources that have the validated\_at\_runtime flag set to 'yes' is imported and populated on detections.

The is\_ignored column is deprecated on the Host Test Results and Test Results Integrations. This column was replaced by the is\_result\_ignored column.

The CMDB internet-facing field on the discovered item is mapped to Limited Internet Exposure on findings.

Column length for the descriptions in the Host Vulnerability import table has been increased.

-   **[Qualys parameter to ignore passed test results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Qualys-cc-Integration&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Compliance test uniqueness key](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cc-tenable-compliance-test-uniqueness-key&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can now configure which identifier the system uses to uniquely match incoming Tenable compliance test records. Previously, compliance tests were identified by the check\_id field, which caused records to be overwritten when multiple tests shared the same control identifier. You can now select the identifier that best matches how your Tenable data is structured \(**compliance\_control\_id**, **check\_id**, or **compliance\_functional\_id**\), ensuring test records are accurately preserved during ingestion.

-   **[Qualys parameter to ignore passed test results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Qualys-cc-Integration&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with v15.2.5 of Configuration Compliance, the ignore\_passed\_result integration instance parameter for the Qualys Integration for Security Operations has been added.

This parameter is set to `false` by default so that passed test results imported by Qualys are not ignored.

Set the parameter to **true** to ignore passed test results on import.

**Note:** If activated, this parameter does not impact closure of the test results. For example, if you activate the parameter, and a failed test result from a previous import has since passed, it will be closed correctly.

-   **[AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=aws-integration-for-security-exposure-management-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management supports integrations with the following AWS services:

    -   AWS Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continuously scans EC2 instances, ECR container images, and Lambda functions for software vulnerabilities \(CVEs\) and unintended network exposure. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Inspector imports host and container vulnerability findings from AWS Inspector.
    -   AWS Security Hub is a security service that is used to centralize and update security checks across AWS accounts. It provides a unified view of security alerts and compliance status by integrating with various AWS services. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Security Hub imports host, container vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations from AWS Security Hub.
-   **[Optimized Tenable.io Compliance Results ingestion](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tenableIntegration&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with v 6.1.3, the Tenable.io Compliance Results Integration is replaced by the Tenable.io Fixed Compliance Results Integration and Tenable.io Open Compliance Results Integration. Compliance results are now imported based on their status, optimizing ingestion performance and scalability for environments with large volumes of compliance data while keeping remediation and compliance tracking aligned with the current state of findings.

-   **[Qualys Integration – API enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_QualysVulnIntegration&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Qualys Vulnerability Integration has been upgraded to support newer Qualys API versions across Host Detection, Host List, Knowledgebase, PC Controls, PC Policies, and PCRS integrations. The integrations now ingest additional data fields, including vulnerability detection source, authentication privilege status, active status for controls and policies, and cloud metadata, giving you better visibility into your vulnerability and compliance data. Use the new `posture_api_version` integration instance parameter to choose between the default v2.0 APIs or the newer v5.0 streaming APIs for the PCRS Policy Host and PCRS Test Results integrations.

-   **[Unified Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ms-defender-sem&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender Threat and Vulnerability Management \(MS TVM\) plugins are now consolidated into a single plugin: Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management. This consolidation deprecates the standalone Microsoft Defender for Cloud plugin. The unified plugin also introduces container image vulnerability ingestion from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, creating Container Vulnerable Items on your instance. A guided migration path is available to transfer existing data from the deprecated applications to the unified plugin.

-   **[Remediation task rule execution mode](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sem-grouping-multiple-findings-remediation-tasks-processing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can now choose how remediation task rules are evaluated during ingestion. The new Match First execution mode evaluates rules sequentially and applies only the first matching rule, assigning each finding to exactly one remediation task. The default Match All mode continues to evaluate all applicable rules.

-   **[Test result and remediation task state transitions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-findings-state-transition&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhancements to policy audits for Security Posture Control verify that retired assets are not evaluated by activated policies. If the state of an asset transitions from **Retired** back to **Active**, it is included in the next policy evaluation.

-   **[Non-zero risk score for passed test results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cc-rollupcalc-example&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The risk score is calculated for passed test results to determine how much risk is mitigated.

-   **[Deprecated the privilege to delete a test result for the Admin role](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-config-compliance&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

As an admin with the sn\_vulc.admin role, you can’t delete a test result. This privilege is now given to the sn\_vulc.delete granular role.


-   **[Updates to the Risk Score calculation for a Remediation Task](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=v11create-rollup-calc&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The average risk score of all the test results in a Remediation Task is considered for the risk score calculation of a Remediation task.

Compliance results are now imported based on their status, optimizing ingestion performance and scalability for environments with large volumes of compliance data while keeping remediation and compliance tracking aligned with the current state of findings.

-   **[Configure Test Result Granularity](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cc-tenable-tr-granularity&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with v15.6.1, you can configure the granularity of Tenable Configuration Test Results \(CTRs\) to split results into unique findings. For example, if a database has five instances, the system generates five distinct test results, one per instance, providing improved visibility into individual patching efforts.

-   **[Configure Test Result Granularity](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cc-qualys-tr-granularity&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with v15.4.3, you can configure the granularity of Qualys Configuration Test Results \(CTR\) in configuration compliance and split CTRs into unique findings. For example, if a database has five instances, the system generates five distinct test results, one per instance, providing improved visibility into individual patching efforts.

-   **[Configure maximum rows in related lists](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vr-max-rows-rel-list&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

To improve readability and performance, you can now limit the number of rows shown in related lists on forms by setting the system property **sn\_vul\_cmn.related\_list.set\_max\_row**.

-   **[Improved state management for remediation tasks and vulnerable items](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vr-rt-states&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

State management logic for roll down of state from remediation tasks \(RTs\) to findings and roll up of state from findings to RTs has been refined across all modules. Updates improve accuracy by handling mixed item states \(a combination of Deferred and Closed\), supporting closure of tasks in sub-states like In-Review, and reopening tasks based on the Assigned To field. The update also improves handling of False Positive state transitions based on scanner results as source of truth. These enhancements reduce manual effort, clarify task ownership, and streamline remediation workflows.
