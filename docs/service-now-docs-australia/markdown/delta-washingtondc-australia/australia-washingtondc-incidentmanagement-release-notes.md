-   **[User role for read and write access to incident tasks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-incident&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Provide more read and write operation privileges in an incident task record to an agent with the sn\_incident\_task\_assigned\_user role. You must install and activate the ITSM Roles plugin \(com.snc.itsm.roles\) to use the base system ACLs related to this role.

-   **[User role for service desk agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=inci-roles-instld-itsm-roles&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

With the sn\_service\_desk\_agent user role, increase the operational efficiency by streamlining the process of asking about, gathering, and verifying information, as well as delivering quick resolutions. This role is designed for tier 1 service desk agents and is accessible when the ITSM Roles plugin \(com.snc.itsm.roles\) installed.

The sn\_service\_desk\_agent role includes the following user roles:

    -   sn\_incident\_write
    -   sn\_problem\_write
    -   sn\_change\_write
    -   sn\_request\_write
    -   tracked\_file\_reader
Additionally, with the installation of the ITSM Gen AI \(com.sn.itsm.gen.ai\) plugin, the knowledge\_user, and now\_assist\_panel\_user roles are integrated within the sn\_service\_desk\_agent role.

The sn\_service\_desk\_agent role can be used starting with SOW version 6.1.

-   **[Enhanced security model adoption for incident tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=activate-itsm-enhanced-security-inci-mangmnt&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Help prevent unauthorized access to incident-related tables using Deny-Unless ACLs. A Deny-Unless authentication ACL restricts access for a non-authenticated user, such as a public role user. Without access, the user can't perform any actions on incident-related tables, including reading, writing, deleting, creating, or accessing the report view.

This feature is activated automatically and applicable on the following incident-related tables:

    -   kb\_template\_incident\_kcs\_articl
    -   kb\_template\_incident\_kcs\_template
Additionally, this feature is available on the following incident-related tables of new or zBoot instances after installing the ITSM Enhanced Security Features \(com.snc.itsm.enhanced\_security\) plugin:

    -   incident
    -   incident\_task
    -   task\_ci
    -   task outage
The ITSM Enhanced Security Features \(com.snc.itsm.enhanced\_security\) plugin can be installed and activated by an admin via a support request. Existing or upgrade users must test and evaluate the results in their non-production instance, and then install the plugin and implement the security change in their production instance.

For more information, see [Deny-Unless ACL](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acl-denial-behavior&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Introduction of granular admin roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=req-itsm-roles-inci-mgmt&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure all the incident, major incident, task outage and related communication features for both UI16 and SOW using the following granular admin roles:

    -   sn\_incident\_admin: Configure all Incident Management features including incident management properties.
    -   sn\_mim\_admin: Configure all Major Incident Management features including major incident properties and trigger rules.
    -   sn\_tcm\_admin: Configure all Task Communications Management features including communication plans and tasks.
    -   sn\_iam\_admin: Configure all Incident Communications Management features including creating, editing, or canceling incident communication plan, communication task, and managing contact information. Additionally, this role can administrate all Incident Communications Management capabilities."
    -   sn\_contact\_admin: Configure all Contact Management features including creating and editing contact definitions, contact responsibilities, configuration of MI users, recipient lists, and groups.
    -   sn\_task\_outage\_admin: Configure all Task Outage features including the mapping between the Task \[task\] table and the Outage \[cmdb\_ci\_outage\] table.
-   **[Form channel for response templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=working-incident-record-form&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The form channel is added to the Need more information and Schedule meeting response templates. The channel enables you to access the response templates from the incident record, copy the response templates texts to the clipboard from the incident form to be shared in the work notes, comments or other communication channels.

-   **[Email notification link redirection behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_ViewIncidentNotification&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

In email notifications, you can now decide where the links to an incident record are redirected. Instead of an incident record automatically opening in the classic UI16 interface in Incident Management, the incident record can be opened in SOW. The incident record link in an email notification opens in SOW only if the following conditions are met:

    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect**\) system property is set to true.
    -   The user selecting the incident record link has the sn\_sow.sow\_user role.
The ITSM Notifications Redirection \(com.snc.itsm.notifications\_redirection\) plugin is installed and activated automatically to support this behavior.

To ensure consistency, the email notification template is updated to send the notification from SOW in the same format as sent from classic UI16 interface. Also, the template theme is updated to match the Next Experience theme.

</td><td>

-   **[Email redirection behavior for major incident email notification links](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=email-notif-redirt-inci-major-inci&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

In major incident email notifications, you can now decide where the links to a major incident record are redirected. Instead of a major incident record automatically opening in the classic UI16 interface in Major Incident Management, the record can be opened in SOW. The major incident record link in an email notification opens in SOW only if the following conditions are met:

    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect**\) property is set to `true`. Setting this property to true enables the email redirection behavior for all tables including major incident.
    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification for Major Incident Management** \(**sn\_major\_inc\_mgmt.sow\_email\_notification\_redirect.mim**\) property is set to `true`.
    -   You have the sn\_sow\_user role.
The ITSM Notifications Redirection \(com.snc.itsm.notifications\_redirection\) plugin is installed and activated automatically to support this behavior.

-   **[Email redirection behavior for incident email notification links](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=email-notif-redirt-inci-major-inci&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

In incident email notifications, you can now decide where the links to an incident record are redirected. Instead of an incident record automatically opening in the classic UI16 interface in Incident Management, the record can be opened in SOW. The incident record link in an email notification opens in SOW only if you have the sn\_sow\_user role and any of the following conditions are met:

    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect**\) property is set to `true`. Setting this property to true enables the email redirection behavior for all tables including incident.
    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification for Incident Management** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect.incident**\) property is set to `true`. You can create this property if you want to enable or restrict the email redirection behavior specifically for the incident table. This property, if created and set, overrides the **Redirect SOW Email notification** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect**\) base system property.
The ITSM Notifications Redirection \(com.snc.itsm.notifications\_redirection\) plugin is installed and activated automatically to support this behavior.

To ensure consistency, the email notification templates for incident tasks are also updated to send the notification from Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) in the same format as sent from classic UI16 interface similar to incident. Also, the template theme is updated to match the Next Experience theme.

-   **[Incident and problem workflow changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=incident-management-properties&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

When a problem is fixed and the **Share fix** option is triggered, the event is added to the **Work notes \(Private\)** field instead of the **Additional comments \(Customer visible\)** field for the incident associated with the problem record.

This feature is available in the base system for the new customers. For existing or upgrade customers, admin must set the **Communicate problem workaround to incident worknotes** \(**com.snc.incident.communicate\_prb\_workaround\_to\_inc\_worknotes**\) system property to `true` to enable the feature.

-   **[Changes in the reopening incident behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=reopening-incident&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable the agents with incident write access, callers, requesters, or **Opened by** end users to reopen a resolved incident. Both the caller and the requester can view and use the **Reopen** option on the incident classic UI16 form and the Portal UIs, such as Service Portal and Employee Service Center \(ESC\) portal.

An agent can view and use the **Reopen** option on the incident classic UI16 form to reopen any incident that is assigned to them or to other agents. However, on the Portal UI, an agent can only view and use the **Reopen** option to reopen an incident if it’s assigned to them.

-   **[Sorting CIs in incident forms](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-an-incident&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The search performance of the available CIs for the **Configuration item** field on an incident form is enhanced to promote a clean UI and quick loading and sorting of the CIs. The search results that list the CIs are sorted alphabetically by CI name instead of by CI class and then CI name. The **ref\_ac\_order\_by=sys\_class\_name** attribute is removed from the default attributes on the **cmdb\_ci** field of the Task \[task\] table, which increases the performance of the field.

This change is applicable to new and existing users using the default attributes. You can use the **Override attributes** option to restrict this change for any required child tables that extend to the **cmdb\_ci** field of the Task \[task\] table.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Incident task record behavior changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-incident-task&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

When an incident task is closed, you can no longer edit the field values in the incident task form. Disabling the fields helps prevent any further updates or modifications to closed incident tasks, reducing audit risks.

-   **[Incident and problem workflow changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=working-incident-record-form&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

When a problem record is linked to an incident or multiple incidents, the incident and problem workflow has the following enhancements:

    -   When a fix or workaround is shared from the problem record, an event is added in the activity stream of the incident record as work notes. The event includes a brief description of the provided fix or workaround and a link to the problem record.
    -   When a Known Error \(KE\) article is linked to the problem record, an event is added in the activity stream of the incident record as work notes. The event includes the links to the problem record and the KE article.
