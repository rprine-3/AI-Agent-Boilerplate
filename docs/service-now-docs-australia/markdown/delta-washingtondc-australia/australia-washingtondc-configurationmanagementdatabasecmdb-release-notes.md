# Combined Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

<table class="custom-rows"><thead><tr><th class="filter">

Release

</th><th>

Release notes

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Washington DC

</td><td>

-   The column **product\_instance\_id** has been added to the base Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] table to support the new product instance identifier \(PID\), which enables the lookup and linking of any pre-existing related assets, CIs, and Install Base Items \(IBI\). For more information about the impact of that change during upgrade and how to minimize that impact, see the [Upgrade impact of CMDB\_CI schema changes for Washington release \[KB1534035\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB1534035) knowledge base article.
-   If you enable CMDB 360 for the first time after upgrading to the Washington DC release, to enable the capture of CMDB 360 data for CIs from non-CMDB classes \(classes not derived from the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class\) you must set the **glide.identification\_engine.multisource\_non\_cmdb\_ci\_enabled** system property to true.
-   If you have been using the legacy Data Certification application on Core UI, then any associated definitions won’t be available in the new implementation of Data Certification in CMDB Workspace. After upgrading to the Washington DC release and to CMDB Workspace version 6.0, you can convert definitions created in the legacy Data Certification application into draft Data Manager Certification policies in CMDB Workspace. For more information, see [.](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=convert-data-cert-definitions&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   Before the upgrade to Xanadu, the ‘Updated CIs’ and ‘Updated application services’ trend lines in the Recent CI activity and Recent application services activities tiles on the Management view in CMDB Workspace, might not have accurately reflected on changes in your system. After upgrading to Xanadu and to versions 5.5, 6.2, or 7.2 of CMDB Workspace, those trend lines will reflect on the more accurate detection of updated CIs and updated application services.
-   CMDB Health:

If either the **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Compliance Processor** or **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Score Calculation** dashboard job is active, that job is deactivated during the upgrade to Xanadu. After the upgrade is complete, you can reactivate those jobs to resume health reports for CI relationships. The active state of all other CMDB Health dashboard jobs is retained.

Any failure threshold for a KPI or metric that is greater than 100,000, is set to 100,000 during upgrade. This upper limit is enforced to avoid excessive processing when a large number of CIs are failing the specified metric tests.

-   Bookmarks for the CI dashboard no longer work after an upgrade to Xanadu. A `Page not found` error message appears. To see CMDB Health reports for a CI, open the CI form in CMDB Workspace.
-   The legacy Application Service Dashboard on Core UI isn't supported in the Xanadu release. After upgrading, you can still access that legacy dashboard by using a previously created bookmark. You can also instead access the Application Services dashboard in CMDB Workspace from the Application services tile in the Insights view in CMDB Workspace.
-   The CMDB Integrations Dashboard on Core UI isn't supported in the Xanadu release. After upgrading, you can still access that legacy dashboard by using a previously-created bookmark.
-   All records that exist in the CMDB Health Result \[cmdb\_health\_result\] table before an update to Xanadu Patch 5, are deleted during the upgrade.

To access a legacy dashboard on an upgraded instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Dashboards** and then search for the dashboard.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

Three new indexes \(parent, type\), \(child, type\), and \(child, parent, type, port\) are added to the CI Relationship \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\] table to improve the performance of Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) querying this table. This change is likely to increase upgrade time. For more information about the impact of this change during upgrade and to learn how to minimize that impact, see [Increased Yokohama Upgrade Time due to cmdb\_rel\_ci index additions \[KB1703367\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB1703367).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

Due to the removal of the **Design** value for the operational status attribute in a CI, after an upgrade, you must review all CIs that have the discovery source attribute set to **Manual via IRE**. Review the operational status attribute of those CIs and set it to a supported value in CMDB for your environment. For example, you can set the attribute to **Non-Operational**. For more information about the operational status values, see [Tangible/physical life cycle](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=csdm-lifecycle-hardware&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

 On an upgraded Zurich instance, to configure the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with the necessary permissions to perform some CMDB Workspace tasks, you must manually run the scheduled job **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles**. This scheduled job modifies the user roles as follows:

-   Updates the itil user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role, and updates the itil\_admin user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
-   If those permissions don't exist, updates the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with create, update, and delete access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class. For more information about the **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles** scheduled job, see [Remove sn\_cmdb\_admin from itil\_admin and sn\_cmdb\_editor from itil, and then add create/update/delete access to cmdb\_ci table for sn\_cmdb\_admin / sn\_cmdb\_editor \[KB2290506\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB2290506).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

Due to changes in the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] table, if you're upgrading to Australia, you might experience an increased upgrade time. To learn more about this change and reducing its impact, see the [Increased Australia Upgrade Time due to cmdb\_ci composite index addition \[KB2588894\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2588894) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

 If you're upgrading from Xanadu or Yokohama directly to the Australia release, you must run the **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles** scheduled job to correctly configure some user roles, such as CMDB Admin and CMDB Editor. For more information about this scheduled job and its use, see the [CMDB Zurich release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/zurich-release-notes/page/release-notes/now-platform-capabilities/cmdb-rn.html).

 The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform®. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. Refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) for additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings. For more information about granular read-only security options, see [Configuring read-only security options](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=read-only-option&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

The Service Graph Workspace is specifically organized to help CMDB administrators, data owners, and analysts work with the CMDB. You can search the CMDB in Service Graph Workspace without having detailed knowledge of the CMDB data model by using contexts that are mapped to CI classes as navigation.
    -   Configure de-duplication remediation processes for related tables to turn off automated workflows, such as ignoring errors and skipping business rules, that might block referenced duplicate CIs from updating to the main CI. Skipping automated workflows for related tables enables de-duplication tasks, which would otherwise fail, to complete successfully. For more information, see [Effects on related tables \(such as Change\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=de-duplication-tasks&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) and [Turn off workflows of related tables during remediation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dedup-ci-disable-workflow&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).
-   **[Dynamic IRE](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dynamic-ire&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Dynamic IRE to accurately identify CIs across multiple data sources, and by so, minimize duplicate CIs. Dynamic IRE is applicable only to the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class and its descending class, using a dynamic identification process which eliminates the need to manually create and maintain identification rules.

-   **[Simplify resolving de-duplication tasks by using a Now Assist for CMDB skill](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=reconcile-dup-task&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the De-duplication task resolution assistant skill in the Duplicate CI Remediator to use preselected remediation options instead of manually making selections. An AI agent preselects the options to resolve the task, such as the choice of the main CI. Then, before initiating the remediation, you can review all suggested options with supported reasoning.

To use the De-duplication task resolution assistant skill, you must install the Now Assist for CMDB version v3.0.

-   **[Quick start tests for CMDB](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=quick-start-tests-cmdb&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Run quick start tests after upgrades and deployments of new applications or integrations to verify that CMDB works as expected. If you customized CMDB, copy the quick start tests and configure them for your customizations.

        -   Remediate de-duplication tasks consistently and in bulk by creating libraries of de-duplication templates.
        -   Remediate de-duplication tasks in a central location, the De-duplication dashboard. Remediate multiple de-duplication tasks in a single operation by running one or more templates. Track progress as templates run and review the remediation results.
        -   See statistics and potential problem areas related to duplicate CIs in your CMDB by examining the De-duplication insights pane.
    -   [CMDB 360 experience in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb360-exp-cmdb-workspace&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US): Limit the scope of data in the Coverage tile in the CMDB 360 dashboard to only CMDB classes by using the **sn\_cmdb\_ws.ms.calculate\_cmdb\_only** system property. For more information, see [Components related to CMDB 360](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=components-multisource-cmdb&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
-   **[CMDB Health support of dot-walking when selecting a recommended field](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_MakingAFieldRecommended&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Identify recommended fields that aren't populated in reference tables by selecting a field from a referenced table for the CMDB Health recommended metric by using dot-walking and directly interacting with the CMDB Recommended Fields \[cmdb\_recommended\_fields\] table.

-   **[Capturing CMDB 360 data for non-CMDB classes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=multisource-cmdb&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable the capture of CMDB 360 data for CIs from non-CMDB classes \(classes not derived from the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class\) by setting the value of the **glide.identification\_engine.multisource\_non\_cmdb\_ci\_enabled** system property to true.

-   **[Access changes for the sn\_cmdb\_editor and sn\_cmdb\_admin user roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-cmdb-workspace&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Starting with Xanadu Patch 9 \(zbooted or upgraded\), access has been reduced for the sn\_cmdb\_editor \(CMDB Editor\) and the sn\_cmdb\_admin \(CMDB Admin\) user roles which are used in [CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US). The sn\_cmdb\_editor and sn\_cmdb\_admin user roles no longer have create, update, or delete access to records in the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class.
    -   Starting with Xanadu Patch 10 \(zbooted or upgraded\), you must manually run the scheduled job '**Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles** to configure the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with the permissions that are necessary for performing some CMDB Workspace tasks.

This scheduled job modifies user roles as follows:

        -   Updates the itil user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role, and updates the itil\_admin user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
        -   If those permissions don't exist, updates the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with create, update, and delete access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class. For more information about the 'Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles' scheduled job, see [Remove sn\_cmdb\_admin from itil\_admin and sn\_cmdb\_editor from itil, and then add create/update/delete access to cmdb\_ci table for sn\_cmdb\_admin / sn\_cmdb\_editor \[KB2290506\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB2290506).
-   **[CMDB Health](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_CMDBHealth&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Configuring and using CMDB Health is simplified by the removal of some concepts such as overall health scores.
    -   Sections on the CMDB Health Dashboard reporting on compliant CIs are clearly separated from report sections for non-compliant CIs that require your attention.
    -   Failure thresholds for KPIs and metrics enforce an upper limit of 100,000 to avoid excessive processing when a large number of CIs fail the specified metric tests.
    -   The CMDB Health Dashboard still shows non-compliance data that was gathered even if the process is stopped due to excessive failures so you can fix the specific failures already detected.
    -   CI health reporting is integrated into CI forms in CMDB Workspace.
-   **[CMDB Workspace store app](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   [CMDB 360](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb360-exp-cmdb-workspace&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US):
        -   Manage performance by filtering the data included in Coverage charts in the CMDB 360 dashboard in CMDB Workspace by principal class setting or by whether tables are within the CMDB hierarchy.
        -   Manage the scope of data processed by CMDB 360 by setting a maximum threshold for the number of multisource records per class and tracking those classes that exceed that threshold in a table so that those classes are excluded from future CMDB 360 calculations. You can override this exclusion to include selected classes even if they exceed the threshold.
    -   [Data Certification](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-cert-exp-cmdb-workspace&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)

When reviewing Data Certification tasks in CMDB Workspace, use a single click to select all the records associated with a task, to certify or fail the certification in bulk.

    -   [CI timeline in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)

When a CI timeline on the CI details pane in CMDB Workspace fails to load, the error message that appears now includes a link that you can select to go to the CI timeline in the base system.

-   **[CSDM and the CMDB Data Foundations Dashboards](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=csdm-cmdb-foundations-dashboards&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Limit the performance impact of some of the CMDB and CSDM metrics such as the **CIs Processed via IRE** and **Business Application with Application Service Relationship** by adjusting the settings for triggering the system to automatically deactivate those metrics.
    -   Identify current and non-current metric data by viewing the **Updated** column in the list views of CMDB.
    -   Access the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard from the [Management view in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace-mangmnt-view&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
-   **[Select a parent class in an IRE identification rule](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_CreateCIIdentificationRule&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Avoid the unnecessary creation of a duplicate CI by setting the **Search On Table** field in an identification rule to one of the parent classes of the current class. When Identification and Reconciliation \(IRE\) identifies a CI in a parent class that matches a CI in the payload, IRE updates that CI with the details from the payload without creating a duplicate CI.

-   **[Improved migration and ongoing sync of CSDM life-cycle data](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=csdm-life-cycle-standard-values&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The one-time operation aligns CSDM life-cycle values in asset and CI tables. After the initial alignment, business rules can run on regular schedules to ensure that life-cycle values for the asset, CI, and IBI tables remain aligned. Using standard life-cycle values significantly improves data accuracy to help optimize value for many ServiceNow AI Platform applications.

-   **[Application Services dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=app-service-dashboard&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Internal queries on the Application Services dashboard that filters for application services now checks not only for all the records in the Application Service \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_auto\] class, but for those records in which the value of **Service classification** is **Application Service**.

This scheduled job modifies user roles as follows:

        -   Updates the itil user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role, and updates the itil\_admin user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
        -   If those permissions don't exist, updates the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with create, update, and delete access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class. For more information about the 'Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles' scheduled job, see [Remove sn\_cmdb\_admin from itil\_admin and sn\_cmdb\_editor from itil, and then add create/update/delete access to cmdb\_ci table for sn\_cmdb\_admin / sn\_cmdb\_editor \[KB2290506\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB2290506).
-   **[CMDB Workspace v6.3](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Apply the filters that were previously available only to the coverage charts to all charts in the Discovery sources tile in the CMDB 360 dashboard. For example, you can filter out non-CMDB tables or include records only from principal classes. For more information, see [CMDB 360 experience in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb360-exp-cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Use a condition builder or a custom script to narrow down the list of de-duplication tasks that are assigned to a template. For more information, see [Create a de-duplication template](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=workspc-dedup-create-template&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Use the new **Allow empty field values** option to allow or disallow certification of empty value fields when creating a certification policy type in CMDB Data Manager. For more information, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
-   **[CMDB Workspace v6.4](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can now use dot-walking when setting assignments for the User Field or User Group Field options for CMDB Data Manager policies \(such as Certification\). Also, when converting legacy certification schedules into Data Manager Certification policies, existing dot-walking settings are preserved. For more information, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[CMDB Workspace v7.4](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

In the CMDB Workspace version 7.4, you can now do the following tasks:

    -   Manually create a CI in CMDB Workspace that complies with its class identification rule and other class requirements, and is tested for uniqueness in CMDB, to help ensure that the CI is valid and maintains the integrity of CMDB. For more information, see [Create a CI manually in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-ci-manual-cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Set the CMDB Health dashboard to use the legacy methods to calculate the completeness, correctness, and compliance KPIs. That legacy calculation method relies on settings of proportional weights of metrics within the aggregated score of KPIs and was used up until the Washington DC release. By default, those weights aren’t used in the calculations of KPI scores.

Also, the CMDB Health dashboard now shows the overall score, which by default, is a simple average of the aggregated scores of the completeness, correctness, and compliance KPIs.

-   **[CMDB Workspace v7.5](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

In the CMDB Workspace version 7.5, you can now do the following tasks:

    -   Delete CMDB Data Manager retirement definitions in CMDB Workspace \(other than the cmdb\_ci retirement definition\). For more information, see [Delete a CMDB Data Manager retirement definition](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-manage-ret-def-wrkspc&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Configure a CMDB Data Manager certification policy to disallow reviewers, to update fields' value while reviewing CIs in a certification task. Administrators can clear the **Allow updates to field values** option to prevent reviewers from updating non-compliant field values into compliance, resulting in rejecting those CIs. For more information, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Schedule a de-duplication template for daily, weekly, monthly, or periodic runs for continuous remediation of duplicate CIs. For more information, see [Schedule a de-duplication template](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=workspc-dedup-schedule-template&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Receive notifications from CMDB Data Manager about certification and attestation tasks, that are incomplete or overdue. For more information, see [Components related to CMDB Data Manager](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=components-cmdb-data-manager&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Review and process tasks of your direct reports and of members of any user group that you manage. For more information about accessing these tasks in CMDB Data Manager, see [My Work view in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace-govern-view&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

The Technical Service Offerings with Support Group or Change Group report now includes data that meets the **sys\_class \_name = offering** parameter.

-   **[Table label changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-tables-details&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following table labels have changed:

    -   The label for the cmdb\_ci\_service\_auto table is now Service Instance instead of Application Service.
    -   The label for the cmdb\_ci\_service\_technical table is now Technology management service instead of Technical service.
-   **[Class descriptions showing in the user interface](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-tables-details&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

    -   On the Published policy tile on the Data Manager policies page, the policies list view now shows the scheduled job that is associated with the policy and the user that the policy runs as.

For more information, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   Instead of the system automatically setting the **run as** attribute of the scheduled certification and attestation jobs to be the user that authored the policy, you can now set a specific user that adheres to the policies and regulations in the organization. Configure the default values for the run as user and user accounts available for run as assignees for auditing purposes when it’s important to know who initiated the changes.

For more information, see [Components related to CMDB Data Manager](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=components-cmdb-data-manager&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   For certification and attestation policy tasks, choose how to assign tasks in cases where a specified task assignment field is empty for a target CI. Specify a user or a user group to assign such tasks to, or create the tasks without assigning them. An administrator can later review and assign those tasks.

For more information, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

For more information, see [Create a CI manually in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-ci-manual-cmdb-workspace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   The itil user role now contains the sn\_cmdb\_user user role and no longer contains the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role. As a result, the following functions that were accessible to itil users now require the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role:
        -   Create and delete the operations that are related to CMDB 360 queries.
        -   Access the CMDB Retirement Definitions module by navigating to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CMDB Retirement Definitions**.
        -   Access the Create CI quick link on the Home view of CMDB Workspace.
-   **[Containment in the itil user role](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-cmdb-workspace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

In zBooted instances, the itil user role no longer contains the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role and the itil\_admin user role no longer contains the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role. However, the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles now have full \(create, update, delete\) access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class.

-   **[Constraints when deleting a CMDB Data Manager retirement definition](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-delete-ret-def-wrkspc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The same constraints that exist when deleting a retirement definition in CMDB Workspace now apply when directly accessing the CMDB Retirement Custom Definitions \[cmdb\_retirement\_custom\_definitions\] table:

    -   The retirement definition that you want to delete must be in an inactive mode \(**Active** = **false**\).
    -   The retirement definition for the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class can't be deleted.
-   **[Prioritize using IRE identification rules for uniquely identifying CIs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ire&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure the system to prioritize the use of IRE identification rules to uniquely identify CIs in a payload, instead of using the **source\_name** and **source\_native\_key** fields.

Access to CMDB tables is no longer restricted to users with elevated privileges. Instead, for improved security, users with access privileges that are trimmed to CMDB features can complete any administrative or end-user CMDB task:

    -   CMDB tables that required the admin or itil\_admin roles are now also accessible to the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
    -   CMDB tables that required the itil role are now also accessible to the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role.
For more information, see the [CMDB Granular Role EPIC changes \[KB0561055\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0561055) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   **[Automatically generate de-duplication tasks for lookup and related tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=id-detect-dup-ci&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure IRE to automatically generate de-duplication tasks for specific lookup or related tables during the identification process. You can then process those de-duplication tasks to remediate any duplications.

-   **[Remediate duplicate related items in lookup tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=id-detect-dup-ci&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure IRE to create de-duplication tasks for duplicate related items in a lookup table, detected during a lookup-based identification. Sort which duplicates do or don't require remediation by configuring the system property **glide.identification\_engine.lookup\_match.create\_duplicate\_task\_ci.enabled**. For more information, see [Detecting duplicate CIs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=id-detect-dup-ci&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Domain separation for key CMDB tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_DomainSeparationSetup&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following tables now support domain separation on instances which are configured with domain separation:

    -   Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\]
    -   Printer Instance \[cmdb\_print\_queue\_instance\]
    -   Software Instance \[cmdb\_software\_instance\]
    -   Client Access \[samp\_client\_access\]
    -   Oracle Options \[samp\_oracle\_options\]
Domain separation can help protect sensitive information by supporting domain-specific data segregation.

For more information about domain separation and how to activate it, see [Setup and administration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_DomainSeparationSetup&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Execution modes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=query-builder-engine-execution-mode&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The CMDB Query Builder expanded its support for various types of query structures that can run in V2 engine mode. Also, the performance of running queries in V2 mode is improved. Query structures that aren't supported include related list conditions, NOT operators combined with filters, certain Service Mapping relationships, and OR operators unless explicitly enabled by the **glide.cmdb.query.or\_execution\_mode** system property.

-   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1 Level AA conformance.

-   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to the monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for the details.

-   Access reduced for the sn\_cmdb\_editor \(CMDB Editor\) and the sn\_cmdb\_admin \(CMDB Admin\) user roles in [CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US). Starting with Washington DC Patch 10, the sn\_cmdb\_editor and sn\_cmdb\_admin user roles no longer have create, update, or delete access to records in the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class.
-   Use CMDB Data Manager in CMDB Workspace to administer and manage policies and tasks, and manage retirement definitions and exclusion lists. You can also view analytics about ongoing CMDB Data Manager processes to detect any potential problems that require your attention.
-   Remediate de-duplication tasks consistently and in bulk by creating libraries of de-duplication templates in CMDB Workspace.
-   Focus on CMDB classes by limiting the scope of data in the Coverage tile in the CMDB 360 dashboard in CMDB Workspace.
-   Identify fields that aren't populated in reference tables by designating them as recommended so they are tracked by the recommended metric in the completeness CMDB Health KPI.

    -   Starting with Yokohama Patch 6, you can configure the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with the necessary permissions to perform some CMDB Workspace tasks by manually running a scheduled job.
-   Manually create a configuration item \(CI\) in CMDB Workspace that is verified by the Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) and is unique within CMDB. Creating a CI using the IRE identification rules helps to maintain the integrity of CMDB.
-   Use the Now Assist for CMDB CI summarization skill to see a comprehensive summary for a CI, with details such as discovery and related incidents, directly on the configuration item \(CI\) form. Use the manage duplicate CIs skill for step-by-step guidance on how to use de-duplication templates to de-duplicate CIs.
-   The Configuration item summarizer AI agent accepts the sys\_id of a CI and returns a full summary of Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) data for the CI. The agent isn’t typically used as a standalone agent and any use case can access it.
-   View the various counts, such as the number of CIs and the number of CI types, for the CIs that are connected to the home node in Unified Map.
-   Apply filters that were previously available only to the coverage charts in the CMDB 360 dashboard in CMDB Workspace to all charts in the Discovery sources tile.
-   Use a condition builder or a custom script to restrict the list of de-duplication tasks that are assigned to a de-duplication template when de-duplicating CIs.

-   Users with CMDB related roles can perform all CMDB functions as access to CMDB tables is no longer restricted to users with elevated privileges.
-   Switch into using the Service Graph Workspace instead of CMDB Workspace. The Service Graph Workspace provides access to data such as company, location, user and CMDB. The new workspace is specifically organized to help CMDB administrators, data owners, and analysts work efficiently with the CMDB.
-   Simplify duplicate CI remediation by using the Now Assist for CMDB remediation option in the Duplicate CI Remediator, and using the automatically-filled remediation options.
-   Use Dynamic Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) that eliminates the need for manually-created identification rules and reduces incorrect detection of duplicate CIs in the CMDB.
-   Protect sensitive information with domain separation that supports key CMDB tables such as the Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\] table.
