# Combined Instance Data Replication release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Instance Data Replication from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Instance Data Replication release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

Improve the performance and processing efficiency of Instance Data Replication \(IDR\) by upgrading your replication sets to V2, which uses the Hermes Messaging Service. For details, see [Upgrading legacy replication sets to V2 in Instance Data Replication](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=upgrading-legacy-replication-sets-v2&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 Log rotation is automatically enabled for the Replication Payload Error \[idr\_replication\_payload\_error\] table after the upgrade. By default, the log rotation schedule is comprised of seven shards, with five days for each shard. All log entries in this table created before the upgrade are automatically truncated.
