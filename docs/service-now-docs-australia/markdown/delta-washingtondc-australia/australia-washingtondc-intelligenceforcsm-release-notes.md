-   **Support for reflow**

The following components were updated to support reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.

Version 28.0.0 of Recommended Actions:

    -   sn-template-modal-worknotes
    -   sn-component-attach-article-guidance
    -   sn-next-best-action-list-connected
    -   sn-guidance-experience-list-connected
Version 25.1.0 of Guided Decisions:

    -   sn-guided-decision-card
    -   sn-guided-decision-playbook-card
This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
