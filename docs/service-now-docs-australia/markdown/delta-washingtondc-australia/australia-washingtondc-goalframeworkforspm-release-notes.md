After upgrading to Goal Framework for SPM v2.3.0, run the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job. This scheduled job migrates the existing values in the **Review frequency** and **Breakdown interval** fields to the **Check-in frequency** field in the target records. For more information on how these values are migrated for targets with different values, see [Target breakdowns migration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=target-breakdowns-migration&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Goal/Target Relationship](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=associating-primary-goal&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track how current and future work contribute to meeting a primary or non-primary target by associating the target with work items. When you create a primary goal or target relationship with an item that already has a primary relationship, the existing association becomes a non-primary and a new primary relationship is created.

-   **[Enhancements to Target breakdowns](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=target-breakdowns-gf&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

For cumulative targets with the breakdown interval set to Quarterly and Yearly, the Target values are populated automatically for each quarterly and yearly breakdown respectively. For example, for a cumulative target created to achieve $10M in the year 2024, the target breakdowns Q1-24, Q2-24, Q3-24, and Q4-24 are created with the Target values $2.5M, $5M, $7.5M, and $10M respectively.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[Enhanced target breakdowns](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=target-breakdowns-gf&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create Daily, Weekly, or Monthly target breakdowns according to how often you want to update and track the progress of the target. The target breakdowns are created based on the value selected in the **Check-in frequency** field. For example, if you select **Monthly** in the **Check-in frequency** field for a target spanning a year, then 12 monthly target breakdowns are created.

-   **[Define targets at multiple organizational levels](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=goal-framework&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define targets across multiple organizational levels with the **Assigned entity type** and **Assigned entity** fields in the target form. This enables targets created at higher levels \(for example, Company\) to be directly assigned to lower levels \(for example, Business Unit, Department\), eliminating redundant subgoal creation, and streamlining overall goal management.
