</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

Ask questions directly in the Now Assist panel to receive immediate AI-driven guidance without leaving UI Builder.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Create event-driven UI interactions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=uib-ui-interactions&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Trigger UI interactions directly from events in UI Builder, allowing you to link event-driven behavior to reusable interaction logic with the following benefits:

    -   Define an interaction once and apply it across multiple events and pages so UI components such as modals don't have to be associated directly with the page anymore.
    -   Connect events to interactions without additional scripting.
    -   Centralize logic for consistent updates and fewer errors.
    -   Previously, Declarative Actions using UXF Client Actions required manual wiring on each page leading to complexity and upgrade risks. UI Interactions replace this with reusable, declarative event mapping.
-   **Update an existing UI interaction flow \(link to edit topic\)**

As of UI Builder version 29.2, the UI interaction diagram editor now supports in-place editing, giving you more flexibility when modifying existing interactions without rebuilding downstream flows.

    -   Insert new steps, If/Else logic, or And branches anywhere in an existing diagram.
    -   Swap the outgoing event on a step to change which event continues the flow.
    -   Delete events and their downstream steps directly from the diagram.
    -   View which toolbox items are unavailable for a specific location, with guidance on why.
