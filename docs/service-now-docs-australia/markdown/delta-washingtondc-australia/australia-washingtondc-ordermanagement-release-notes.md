# Combined Order Management release notes for upgrades from Washington DC to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Order Management from Washington DC to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Order Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Washington DC to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Order Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Washington DC

</td><td>

New features introduced in this Washington DC release aren’t supported in earlier releases of Order Management for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology.

 Starting with the Washington DC release, the **Monthly Recurring Charges** \(MRC\) and the **Non Recurring Charges** \(NRC\) set for product offerings and product attribute characteristics are stored in the Pricing data model in price lists and price list lines, rather than the Product Offering data model. If you want to upgrade your pricing information to use price lists after upgrading to Washington DC, see the [Price Management Plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_pricing\) uptake for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology customers upgrading to Washington \[KB1585863\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1585863) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

 After upgrading to the Washington DC release, a fix script runs automatically to deactivate certain telecommunications list records that are no longer needed to resume the capture of an unfinished order. For more information on these records and using the former order capture process if needed, see the [Deprecating Telco List for Order Capture \[KB1586538\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1586538) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

 After upgrading to the Washington DC, review the reconfiguration workarounds for working on new change orders or orders with disconnect, suspend, or resume actions while using the product configurator. For details, see the [Order line reconfiguration issues in Washington when using Order Capture UI \[KB1585976\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1585976) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Xanadu

</td><td>

Features introduced in the Xanadu release aren't supported in earlier releases of Order Management.

 If you’re upgrading from Order Management for Telecommunications and Media version 6.0 or earlier:

-   Starting with the  Washington DC release, the  Monthly Recurring Charges  \(MRC\) and the  Non-Recurring Charges  \(NRC\) for product offerings and product attribute characteristics are no longer stored in the product offering data model. Instead, the MRC and NRC are stored in the Pricing data model in price lists and price list lines. If you want to upgrade your pricing information to use price lists after upgrading to  Washington DC, see the  [Price Management Plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_pricing\) uptake for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology customers upgrading to Washington \[KB1585863\] ](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1585863) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
-   After upgrading to the  Xanadu release, a fix script runs automatically to deactivate certain telecommunications list records that are no longer needed to resume the capture of an unfinished order. For more information on these records and using the former order capture process, see the  [Deprecating Telco List for Order Capture \[KB1586538\] ](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1586538) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

 If you’re an upgrade customer who uses the **contract start date** and **contract end date** fields and has records, you can migrate those records to the latest data model by running the **Migrate data from deprecated contract fields to new fields on Order and Order Lines** scheduled job. This scheduled job must be manually executed by navigating to **System Definitions** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**. For more information on scheduled jobs, see [Scheduled jobs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ScheduledJobs&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

Washington DC

</td><td>

After order capture, enable agents to enrich orders with additional order information before starting order fulfillment to avoid fallouts. This enrichment process triggers workflows that create the enrichment-related order tasks for applicable orders and order line items.

Starting with the Washington DC release, Order Management uses the Pricing data model rather than the Product Offering data model to store pricing charges in price lists and price list lines. With this change, you can now specify either a **Monthly Recurring Charge** \(MRC\) or a **Non Recurring Charge** \(NRC\) for a product or order line, but not both.

-   **[Enhancements to the ServiceNow TMF APIs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=api-rest&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following ServiceNow TMF APIs have been updated to support consumer orders that can be fulfilled in Order Management for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology:
