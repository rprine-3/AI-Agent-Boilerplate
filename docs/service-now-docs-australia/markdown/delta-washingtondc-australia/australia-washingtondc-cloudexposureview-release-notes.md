-   **[Enhancements to the Wiz Vulnerability Response Integration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vr-wiz-exploring-host-cf&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   The Universally Unique Identifier \(UUID\) that identifies detections for the Wiz Host Vulnerability integration will be mapped to a detection key.

**Note:** This enhancement is supported for new customers only.

For existing customers, the detection key for the Wiz Host Vulnerability integration is created using the combination of vulnerability, asset\_id, and proof.

    -   Added the source\_id column to the Container Image Finding table \(sn\_vul\_container\_image\_findings\) and mapped the id attribute from the Wiz import to this field on findings records.

**Note:** Perform a full import after upgrading to view the enhancement on container image findings, container image, and container image vulnerabilities records.

    -   The image repository name format for new and existing discovered container images has been updated to align with the discovery format. The supported format is registry/repository. A separate finding is created for a repository present in each registry.
    -   Appended all repositories that are associated with an image to the Repository field on the Discovered Container Image \[sn\_vul\_container\_image\] table, which can help you see images from specific repositories.
    -   You can configure the **First** parameter for the Wiz Asset Integration to help you resolve 504 errors. You can reduce the page size if you are having memory issues or generating errors. The default value is 500.
    -   The default integration instance parameter for configuring finding keys for the Container Vulnerability Integration includes src\_ci, vulnerability, package, image\_layer, and image\_repository.
-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key bundle-security.vr-cloud-security-exploring\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vr-cloud-security-exploring&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Cloud Exposure View module provides a single location for cloud security teams to monitor and act on all their cloud-related security findings from multiple vendors across their cloud environments.

    -   Configure widgets that display interactive visualizations and filter assets by category for findings, assets, and exceptions.
    -   View panels with links on a single page that direct you to the following detailed lists:
        -   Needs Attention
        -   Cloud resources with active findings
        -   Top Accounts/Assets by Risk
        -   Toxic combinations
        -   Compliance scores
    -   View aggregated security data imported from third-party vendors.
