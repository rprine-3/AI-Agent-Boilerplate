Washington DC

</td><td>

-   **[Recursive summarization for large inputs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=enable-recursive-summarization&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US)**

Large language models \(LLMs\) have a maximum number of tokens per request. Recursive summarization breaks down large inputs into smaller pieces, summarizes those pieces, and then recombines them to make the original call. This process prevents important context from being lost when submitting requests to the LLM, which can result in more accurate responses with fewer hallucinations.

</td><td>

-   **[Directions for generative AI updates for Generative AI Controller](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=reference-for-generative-ai-controller&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The prompts, which are the instructions to the large language model \(LLM\), for all four capabilities \(Generic Prompt, Generate Content, Summarization, and Sentiment Analysis\), semantic filtering, and recursive summarization have been updated.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Yokohama Patch 5, Now Assist usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: Now Assist Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).

-   **[Some Now Assist skills are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill is turned on automatically \(the skill was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   ****

-   **[Configure Data Privacy and Data Discovery to protect the personally identifying information \(PII\) of your users.](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-now-assist-data-privacy&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generative AI Controller has changed to use the Data Privacy application instead of the Sensitive Data Handler to help anonymize PII. The process for choosing what gets anonymized and how has shifted to different tables and forms that your administrator must configure for your organization.

-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Zurich Patch 5, Now Assist usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date.

-   **[Direct action calls removed from Generative AI Controller](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skill-kit-landing&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Zurich Patch 5, the Generative AI Controller \(GAIC\) no longer supports direct action calls in order to support the security requirements that all AI capabilities be protected by Access Control Lists \(ACLs\). To create custom generative AI functionality, use Now Assist Skill Kit instead.

    -   Configure actions in the Generative AI Controller
    -   Generate Content to create AI-generated text responses
    -   QnA to answer user questions
    -   Summarize to shorten long or complex text
    -   Generic Prompt to generate ideas or content on any topic
    -   Sentiment Analysis to identify the sentiment of user input
For more information, refer to [KB KB2716977: Generative AI Controller actions are no longer avaliable for custom workflows](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=6460540047ee7a9048cb2920326d4302&id=kb_article_view).
