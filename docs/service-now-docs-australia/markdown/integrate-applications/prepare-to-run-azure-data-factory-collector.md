# Prepare to run the Azure Data Factory collector

Set up Azure data assets, authentication, and permissions before running the collector.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The collector uses Azure Service Principal for authentication. You must register an application, obtain Azure IDs, and grant subscription-level access. You can also prepare datasets for lineage harvesting.

## Procedure

1.  Register an application in Azure Active Directory and create credentials.

    See [Register application and create client secret](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/prepare-to-run-azure-data-factory-collector.md).

2.  Obtain required Azure IDs.

    See [Obtain subscription and tenant IDs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/prepare-to-run-azure-data-factory-collector.md).

3.  Grant Service Principal access to Data Factory data assets.

    See [Grant Service Principal access to Data Factory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/prepare-to-run-azure-data-factory-collector.md).

4.  Prepare datasets for lineage harvesting.

    See [Prepare to harvest lineage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/prepare-to-run-azure-data-factory-collector.md).
