# ServiceNow Otto for Zero Copy Connector ERP data query skill

Use the ERP data query skill in ServiceNow Otto for Zero Copy Connector to identify SAP objects such as tables, BAPI, and OData endpoints.

## ERP data query overview

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

The ERP data query skill helps you identify SAP objects that can then be used to query the required data. For example, use ERP data query to obtain an OData endpoint.

This skill can help you create new ERP models and model operations more quickly by automating the identification of correct SAP data sources. The skill also reduces the need for deep technical knowledge and manually looking up information.

The sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_ai\_user role is required to work with generative AI and agentic AI in Otto for ZCC.
