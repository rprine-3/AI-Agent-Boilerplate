# Record an automation

Record an automation by using the recorder option in the RPA Desktop Design Studio application. The actions that you perform on the application elements can be saved as an automation flow to the automation project.

## Before you begin

You must do the following actions before you start recording an automation with the recorder for the first time:

-   Install and enable the ServiceNow RPA Chrome extension to your Google Chrome browser. For more information on adding the RPA Google Chrome extension, see [Add the ServiceNow RPA Chrome extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/add-google-chrome-extension-rpa.md).
-   Install and enable the ServiceNow RPA Edge extension to your Microsoft Edge browser. For more information on adding the RPA Edge extension, see [Add the ServiceNow RPA Edge extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/add-servicenow-edge-extension.md).
-   Ensure that the option **Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites that you visit** to **On all sites** is enabled in the Site access pane of the ServiceNow RPA Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browser extensions.
-   Enable Java Access Bridge from your Windows machine. For more information on how to enable Java Access Bridge, see [Enabling and Testing Java Access Bridge](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/access/enable_and_test.html).

Ensure to configure the following settings and tasks before you record a web application:

-   Set the zoom level of the browser to 100%.
-   Close the developer tools of the browser.
-   Wait for the web page to load completely to the browser.

## Procedure

1.  Select **Launch recorder** from the toolbar of the **Design** tab.

    The RPA Desktop Design Studio window is minimized and the recorder panel is launched.

2.  Open the application that you want to record and select the **Start recording** icon \(\[Omitted image "start-recording-icon.png"\] Alt text: Start recording icon\).

3.  Point to the element where you want to perform an action.

    The default action that is related to the type of element is displayed.

    For example, if you point to the **Save** button in Notepad++, the element type is displayed as &lt;button&gt; and the default action for this item is **Click**.
