# Use the Confirm component

Set a confirmation message that is shown in a dialog box requiring user inputs by using the Confirm component in the RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## About this task

The Confirm component is used as part of an Attended Robot automation. Use this component to request a confirmation from the user as a response to a user action. For example, request user inputs on whether the user wants to save a file.

To configure the properties, see [Properties of Confirm components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/Properties-general-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **General** &gt; **MessageBox**.

2.  Drag the Confirm component to the Design surface.

3.  To provide inputs to the parameters, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).
