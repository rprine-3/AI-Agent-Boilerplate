# Associate a bot process to a bot process configuration record

Select a bot process configuration record to associate it with a bot process. This action creates a bot process record in RPA Hub.

## Before you begin

Create a package. For more information, see [Create a package to assign to a bot process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-package.md).

Create a robot. For more information, see [Robots in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/robots-rpa-hub.md).

Configure the related system property to view the activity stream. For more information, see [Display an activity stream for bot processes and robots in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/display-activity-stream-sys-property-rpahub.md).

Before you can access a bot process, ensure that the RPA business user \(sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_business\_user\), RPA developer \(sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer\), or the RPA support user \(sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_support\_user\) are in the Managed by Group list.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## About this task

A bot process is a predefined sequence of actions that a robot follows to accomplish a specific task or achieve a particular goal.

A bot process configuration record contains the bot process settings. The bot process configuration record is mapped to a bot process record. It is a one to one mapping. You can only select one bot process record to associate with a bot process configuration record. You can't edit a bot process configuration record that is associated with a bot process.

When you retire a bot process record, you can't associate the related bot process configuration record to other bot processes.

You can create a bot process configuration record in two ways. The first way is when you create and save a bot process configuration record.

The second way is when you move an update set from a lower environment to a higher environment, an orphan bot process configuration record is created. After you select the **Assign Configuration** button and its record, the bot process record that is associated to the bot process configuration is created.

For more information about migrating your metadata from a lower environment to a higher environment, see [Migrating your data from a lower environment to a higher environment in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/migrate-data-rpa-hub.md).

Track Execution Logs

</td><td>

Option to enable the tracking of process execution logs.After you enable this check box, the logs are captured when an automation is executed by either an attended or an unattended robot. These logs help in understanding the errors and the end-to-end logging of automation execution.

If process jobs are purged, then the corresponding execution logs are purged.

By using the Attach feature in RPA Desktop Design Studio, these execution logs can be used to replay the automation to understand where the automation has failed. For example, at which component the automation has failed or details of the inputs passed to that component.

**Note:** The **Attach** feature doesn't support Flat file output type.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Synchronize Execution Logs \(seconds\)

</td><td>

Frequency, in seconds, for execution logs to synchronize.This field appears only when the **Track Execution Logs** option is selected.

If you select **Robot Machine** in the **Storage** field, then this field is hidden.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Storage

</td><td>

**Note:** This field appears only when the **Track Execution Logs** option is selected.

 Storage location options for the execution logs:

-   **Instance**: Only error information is logged in the execution log, on the instance.

If you select **Instance**, then the value for the **Log Level** field is set to Error and it can't be edited.

-   **Robot Machine**: The log files are stored in the robot machine where the automation is executed.

If you select **Robot Machine**, then you can view two options to select from the **Log Level** field - **Error** or **Verbose**.

To view the end-to-end execution logs of all the components, select **Robot Machine** from the **Storage** field and then select **Verbose** from the **Log Level** field.

For optimum utilization of disk space in the robot machine, the existing logs are purged, based on the **sn\_rpa\_fdn.purge\_client\_logs** system property setting.


 If you select **Robot Machine**, then

-   **Synchronize Execution Logs** field is hidden.
-   The execution logs are stored in the machine on which the attended or unattended robot is installed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Output Type

</td><td>

Output type of the execution log file. This log file is generated during the robot execution on the machine. There are two types of output:-   **DB File**: Default value. It's a lite database file that stores the process job metadata and the process automation execution details. After the process job completion, you can attach the DB file using the **Attach** option in the RPA Desktop Design Studio project to replay the automation on the design surface.
-   **Flat File**: It's a file format that stores the process job metadata and the process automation execution details in plain text. It stores the execution data in a JSON format.

This **Output Type** field appears when the **Track Execution Logs** option is selected and when the **Robot Machine** is selected from the **Storage** field.

If a bot process, with Flat File as the Output Type, is triggered, then the execution log file is added to the process job folder in .txt format in the given locations. Similarly, for DB output type you will view .db format in the given locations.

The location of both the flat files and the DB files is in the machine on which the attended or unattended robot is installed.

-   During execution: `Users\<Userprofile>\ServiceNow RPA Logs\.executionlogs\{InstanceName}\{ProcessJob number}`.

For example, `Users\john.smith\ServiceNow RPA Logs\.executionlogs\{InstanceName}\PJB0001165`.

-   After execution is complete: `Users\<Userprofile>\ServiceNow RPA Logs\.executionlogs\{InstanceName}\.archive\{ProcessJob number}`.

For example: `Users\john.smith\ServiceNow RPA Logs\.executionlogs\{InstanceName}\.archive\PJB0001165`.


The content in the flat files is in JSON format. The following image gives the content structure.

When you choose the **Flat File** option to store the execution logs, two flat files are generated and stored in the locations given.

-   `ExecutionJobMetadata.txt`: Contains information on the process job such as the Process ID, Robot ID, and the log level. The image shows the structure of the content in the file.

\[Omitted image "execution-metadata.png"\] Alt text: Execution metadata.

-   File name in the format `ddMMMyyyy HHmmss.txt` \(For example, `28Dec2023 125036.txt`\): Contains the execution log entries. For example, the file gives the name of the Activity, component execution start and end time, duration, and the result in boolean, if applicable.

The flat files follow the rules on data purging set in the **sn\_rpa\_fdn.purge\_client\_logs** system property. For more information about the system property, see [Configure RPA Hub properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/rpahub-sys-properties.md).

**Important:** In RPA Desktop Design Studio, if you mark one or more input or output ports of one or more components or methods in an automation as **Mark Data as Sensitive**, the flat file does not log the execution data of its corresponding process job. Instead, in the JSON file the data corresponding to the port appears as **SENSITIVE**. The following image gives an example.

\[Omitted image "flat-file-sensitive.png"\] Alt text: Port indicated as sensitive.

For more information about marking an input or output port as **Mark Data as Sensitive**, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md)

Since the actual data for the execution logs contain abundant data, the required data is only preserved. The content in text file is JSON type.​

To modify the value of this field for an existing bot process, ensure that the associated bot process is **In Maintenance** state.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Log Level

</td><td>

Select a log level to capture:-   **Error**-

Only error information is stored during automation execution.

-   **Verbose**-

Error information and end-to-end component execution logs, such as inputs and outputs and execution steps with timestamps are stored during automation execution. When you select **Verbose**, the flat files record details of the execution of all components in the automation. If the size of the flat file exceeds 10 MB while the process job executes, the flat file continues to split into multiple flat files with the log sequence appended in the file-naming convention until it executes the complete automation. The naming conventions of such files are `<timestamp>_<LogSequence>`.

This option appears only when Robot machine is selected as storage type.


This field appears only when the **Track Execution Logs** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Track Automation Logs

</td><td>

Track automation logs that are generated by the robot. The robot logs the automation execution in automation logs. The logs help the RPA users to track the automation progress.For more information about viewing the automation logs, see [View automation logs in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/view-automation-logs-rpa.md).

To view automation logs of a bot process, in RPA Desktop Design Studio, use the Log component in the associated automation and populate the required details.

For more information about the Log component, see [Use the Log component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-general-log.md).

This field appears only when the **Enable Robot Pool** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allocation Type

</td><td>

Robots that you can allocate based on the Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) of the work items or the percentage of efficiency gain. Select the allocation type:

-   **SLA Based**: Allocation of robots from the pool based on the SLA of the work item. The work items are sorted and prioritized based on the SLA.

If you select the allocation type as SLA Based, ensure that the work items must contain a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\).

-   **Percentage Reduction**: Allocation of robots from the pool based on the efficiency percentage.

The default value is SLA Based.

This field appears only when **Enable Robot Pool** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Percentage Reduction

</td><td>

This field appears only when **Percentage Reduction** is selected from the **Allocation Type** field.Reduce the total execution time of a bot process by allocating more robots by a selected percentage.

For example, if there are 100 work items assigned to a bot process. It might take 100 minutes to execute the bot process. If you want to reduce that time to 75 minutes, you define a value 25 in this field.

After you provide a value in this field, multiple robots are allocated to distribute the work load. Thus, the automation performs faster by that percentage.

The default value is 25.

Robots are allocated to distribute the workload, based on the percentage you select:

-   If you select a value from 5 to 50, 2 robots are allocated.
-   If you select 55, 60, or 65, 3 robots are allocated.
-   If you select 70 or 75, 4 robots are allocated.
-   If you select 80, 6 robots are allocated.
-   If you select 85, 7 robots are allocated.
