# RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface

Learn about the RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface.

## RPA Desktop Design Studio home

With the RPA Desktop Design Studio home page, you can create and open your automation projects, review your work on these projects, and access resources that help you design automations. The default home page of the RPA Desktop Design Studio is shown in the following example.

Create automations, activities, and automation logic additions from text instructions and preview options using the Now Assist for RPA Hub. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/rpa-now-assist-studio.md).

\[Omitted image "rpa-studio-home.png"\] Alt text: Home page of RPA Desktop Design Studio.

When you launch the RPA Desktop Design Studio for the first time, you view a welcome screen to take a quick tour of the desktop studio and learn more about its features. To take a tour, select **Next** on the welcome screen. The guided tour helps you build your first automation. You can pick your preferred journey to create an automation. You can build an automation with a use case or without a use case. Select **Start** to begin the guided tour.

From the left navigation bar, which is shown in the following example, of the RPA Desktop Design Studio home page, you can do the following actions.

</td><td>

Create a skill automation project. For more information, see [Create a skill project in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-skill-project.md).A skill automation is a reusable component. You can build a skill so that you can provide prebuilt capabilities for other automation processes. For example, if a login functionality is used in four different automations, that login functionality can be created as a skill that you can reuse across automations.
