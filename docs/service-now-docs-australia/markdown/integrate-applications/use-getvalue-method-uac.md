# Use the GetValue method for Universal App Connector

Use the GetValue method to retrieve a value from an element.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have open or active applications, for example, where you want to capture elements.

Role required: None

## About this task

For information on the various additional operations that are available for the application screens and elements, see [Additional options for application screens and elements in Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/contextmenu-application-screens.md).

## Procedure

1.  Configure Universal App Connector.

    To learn more about configuring the application screens and child elements, see [Use the Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-uac.md).

2.  Under Global Objects, double-click the **UniversalApplication** object.

    The GetValue method appears in the Object Explorer pane.

3.  Drag the GetValue method to the Design surface.

4.  Double-click the GetValue method to configure the screens and elements in Universal App Connector.

5.  On the Configure screens and elements window, select the Choose from an open window drop-down \(\[Omitted image "UAC-connector-select-application-icon.png"\] Alt text: Choose from an open window drop-down.\) and select an application screen.

    For example, select the Badge Tool application.

    \[Omitted image "uac-set-value-select-screen.png"\] Alt text: Configure screens and elements window displaying list of open windows in the drop-down. The Badge Tool application is selected.

    **Note:**

    -   If no supported applications are open, the `App window not found message` is displayed.
    -   To display newly opened application screens on the list, select the Click to refresh windows icon \(\[Omitted image "refresh-uac-list.png"\] Alt text: Refresh windows icon.\).
6.  To add the selected application screen, for example, Badge Tool application, select **Add screen**.

    After you do this step, you can capture the screen elements to perform actions.

    The application screen appears under the Screens and elements pane.

    \[Omitted image "uac-add-screen-badge-app.png"\] Alt text: Badge Tool application screen name appears under Screens and elements.

7.  To capture the elements from the screen, right-click the added screen and select **Capture Element**.

    The focus is set on the application screen that you had captured and the capture elements dialog appears.

8.  After selecting the required element, select the Add Element icon \(\[Omitted image "add-element-icon-RPA.png"\] Alt text: Add Element icon\) and select the mode as **UIA**, to capture the element.

    **Note:** You must add at least one element to continue.

    For example, select the textbox element tagged as edit by selecting the text box next to User Name field.\[Omitted image "uac-get-value-username-capture.png"\] Alt text: The Badge Tool application shows Capture element dialog that captures the username field in UIA mode. This field can be added as an element using the Add element button.

9.  In the Configure screens and elements window, right-click the captured element, choose **Select** and select **Done**.

    **Note:** Select at least one element to perform the action. If none are selected, the action won't be executed. To proceed without selecting, select **OK**.

    \[Omitted image "uac-get-value-select-element.png"\] Alt text: Configure screens and elements window displaying the Select option on an element level.

10. Right-click the GetValue method and select either **Run From Here** or **Run This**.

    |Parameter name|Parameter description|Port Type|Data Type|
    |--------------|---------------------|---------|---------|
    |Return|Retrieves a value from the captured element.|Data Out|String|

    The input value in the captured element is retrieved and displayed in the Data Out port of the GetValue method. In this scenario, ServiceNow is retrieved.\[Omitted image "uac-get-value-final-result.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow displayed as the output in the captured element.

11. Double-click the required application screen or element and the Object Explorer pane is displayed listing the related methods.

    For example, if you select a Java application screen or element, the Java connector methods are displayed in Object Explorer.
