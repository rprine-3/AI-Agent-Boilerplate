# Use the UploadAttachment component

Attach documents to a table record in the RPA Hub by using the UploadAttachment component in the RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

You must have access to the required ServiceNow table to upload attachments.

Role required: none

## About this task

A table in the RPA Hub contains one or more records and each record provides certain information. Attachments can provide additional, useful information about the record. The maximum size of the attachments is 1024 MB.

You can configure the properties for the UploadAttachment component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the Attachment components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/properties-attachment-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **ServiceNow** &gt; **Attachments**.

2.  Drag the UploadAttachment component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the UploadAttachment component to the corresponding ports of the other components.
