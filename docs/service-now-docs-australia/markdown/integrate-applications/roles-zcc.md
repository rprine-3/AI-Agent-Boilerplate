### Contains Roles

List of roles contained within the role.

None.

### Groups

List of groups this role is assigned to by default.

### Special considerations

When a user contains a role that inherits the df\_data\_steward role, the user is considered a data steward in Zero Copy Connector Hub, and can create and manage data fabric tables. When the df\_data\_steward role is granted directly to a user, that user can access Zero Copy Connector Hub, but can't create or manage any data fabric tables.
