# Update a data asset

Edit catalog asset metadata to add business context, improve discoverability, and provide additional information.

## Before you begin

Role required: data steward \(**df\_data\_steward**\)

Enrich assets with descriptions, business context, and organizational metadata to help users understand what the data represents and how to use it. Some fields are auto-populated from source systems and are read-only to maintain data integrity with the source.
