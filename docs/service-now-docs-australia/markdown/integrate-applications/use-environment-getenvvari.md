# Use the GetEnvironmentVariable component

Retrieve the value of an environment variable by using the GetEnvironmentVariable component in RPA Desktop Design Studio. For example, you can get the value of the TEMP variable.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the GetEnvironmentVariable component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the Environment components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/util-environment-prop.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Utilities** &gt; **Environment**.

2.  Drag the GetEnvironmentVariable component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input field, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the GetEnvironmentVariable component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.

</table>5.  To test the component, under the **DESIGN** tab, click **Run**.


## GetEnvironmentVariable component

You want your robot to process files and save logs to different folders depending on whether it's running in Development or Production mode.

1.  At the start of the automation, use SetEnvironmentVariable to define the following variables:

    -   `ENV_MODE = Development`
    -   `LOG_PATH = C:\RPA\Dev\Logs`
    This variable defines if robot is running in the development mode, where to store the log files.

    \[Omitted image "set-env-var-dev-rpa.png"\] Alt text: SetEnvironmentVariable with development environment details.

2.  Later in the workflow, when saving log files, use **GetEnvironmentVariable** to retrieve the value of `LOG_PATH`.

    The robot dynamically stores the log files as per the value in the `LOG_PATH` variable.

3.  In production, simply update the environment variable setup to:

    -   `ENV_MODE = Production`
    -   `LOG_PATH = C:\RPA\Prod\Logs`
    \[Omitted image "set-env-var-prod-rpa.png"\] Alt text: SetEnvironmentVariable with production environment details.

    The robot now logs to the production folder automatically, because it reads the `LOG_PATH` value from the environment variable.
