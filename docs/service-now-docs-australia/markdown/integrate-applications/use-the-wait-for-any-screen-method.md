# Use the WaitForAnyScreen method for Universal App Connector

Find one or more application screens and optionally, their child elements within a time period that you specify and then perform actions that you specify.

## Before you begin

Role required: None

## About this task

When you use the WaitForAnyScreen method, it tries to find a screen by matching the screen match rules within a specified duration. If it fails to find the screen within that duration, you may optionally enable it to perform an action by passing the control to another component through the ELSE port. Else, the WaitForAnyScreen method completes its execution. For the WaitForAnyScreen method to find a screen, the screen must be in an opened state.

## Procedure

1.  Configure the UAC.

    To learn to configure the application screens and child elements, see [Use the Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-uac.md).

2.  Under Global Objects, double-click the **UniversalApplication** object.

    The WaitForAnyScreen method appears in the Object Explorer pane.

3.  Drag the WaitForAnyScreen method to the Design surface.

4.  Configure the WaitForAnyScreen method.

    1.  Select the settings icon \(\[Omitted image "uac-connector-settings-icon.png"\] Alt text: Wait For Any Screen method settings icon.\).

    2.  On the CHOOSE SCREENS window, select one or more application screens.

    3.  Select **OK**.

        The application screen that you selected appears in the WaitForAnyScreen method.

    4.  Configure the parameters on the WaitForAnyScreen method.

</table>5.  Double-click the required application screen or element and the Object Explorer pane is displayed listing the related methods.

    For example, if you select a Java application screen or element, the Java connector methods are displayed in Object Explorer.
