# Override a data port

Override a data port of a component in RPA Desktop Design Studio so that you can change the default behavior of the Data In and Data Out ports. By overriding a data port, you can simplify the automation workflow development and testing.

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  In the RPA Desktop Design Studio, on the Design surface, right-click the Data In or Data Out port of a component that you want to override and select **Port Properties**.

2.  In the PORT PROPERTIES dialog box, edit the details as needed.
