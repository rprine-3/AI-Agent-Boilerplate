# Create an Apache Hudi connection

Establish a zero copy connection to Apache Hudi in Zero Copy Connector Hub.

## Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

## About this task

Work with your data source admin to create a connection to Apache Hudi. For additional information about connecting, refer to the [Hudi connector documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hudi.html).

**Note:** This connector was developed by the open-source community and made available through the ServiceNow AI Platform for general use. Functionality can vary and might not cover all use cases supported by primary connectors.

## Result

A test connection is made to the external data source, verifying that the connection details are correct and the data source is accessible.

## What to do next

If the connection succeeds, configure data steward access on the **Access Control** tab. See [Manage access to an established connection using roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/manage-access-connection-zcc.md).

If the connection fails, verify the connection details with your data source administrator and try again.
