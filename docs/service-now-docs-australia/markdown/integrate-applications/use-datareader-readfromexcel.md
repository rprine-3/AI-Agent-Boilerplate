# Use the ReadFromExcel component

Extract data from a Microsoft Excel file as a DataTable by using the ReadFromExcel component in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

To use the ReadFromExcel component, install [Microsoft Access Database Engine](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920).

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the ReadFromExcel component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the Data Reader components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/util-datareader-prop.md).

-   **Real-world scenario: Importing employee records**

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the ReadFromExcel component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.

    |Parameter|Description|Data Port type|Data type|
