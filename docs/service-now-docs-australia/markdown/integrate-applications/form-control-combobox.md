# Methods and events of the ComboBox element

The ComboBox element in RPA Desktop Design Studio enables you to display the data in a drop-down combination box.

The methods and events of the ComboBox element are displayed in the Object Explorer pane.

The second part is a list box that displays a list of items from which you can select one.
