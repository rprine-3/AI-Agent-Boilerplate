# Components installed with RPA Hub

Several types of components are installed with the activation of the RPA Hub plugin, including tables, user roles, and scheduled jobs.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

Demo data is available for this plugin.

## Roles installed

**Note:** RPA role requires access to the cmdb\_rel\_ci table. If there are any customizations to the cmdb\_rel\_ci ACLs, provide the relevant read access role to the following RPA roles.
