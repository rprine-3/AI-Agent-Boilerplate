The ERP data discovery skill lets you query SAP standard database tables for data and transactional records based upon natural language queries. This skill simplifies the process of getting information, potentially increasing efficiency.

Along with data, transactional records such as purchase orders, sales orders, sales documents, material information, billing documents, and delivery data are searched.

ERP data discovery is designed to support a wide range of business needs. It is ideal for use cases involving automation, business intelligence, auditing, and operational visibility. Use ERP data discovery for general data retrieval, such as listing all purchase orders or customer records. You can also monitor exceptions, such as blocked deliveries, incomplete orders, delivery holds, or rejected items. ERP data discovery gives you access to key status fields, like delivery blocks, rejection reasons, and overall order progress.
