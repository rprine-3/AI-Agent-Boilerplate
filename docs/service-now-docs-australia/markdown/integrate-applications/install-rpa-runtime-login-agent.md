# Install Unattended Robot Login Agent

You can install the Unattended Robot Login Agent application in your Windows machine if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you meet the following set up requirements:

-   An unattended robot is mapped to only one machine.
-   The Windows machine or the Virtual Machine \(VM\) is persistent and constantly on to run unattended robots.
-   If connected via Citrix, the Windows machine or the VM must not go to sleep mode.
-   Login agent clears the legal notice message if the **sn\_rpa\_fdn.bypass\_legal\_notice** system property is selected.

    For more information about this property, see [Configure RPA Hub properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/rpahub-sys-properties.md).

    If you don't want the unattended robot to clear the legal notice, turn off the legal notice by turning off through the Active Directory Organizational \(AD OU\) policy. This ensures that the Unattended Robot Login Agent can log in seamlessly.

-   Unattended Robot Login Agent can handle only login-related screens, such as  the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen and the User Name and Password screen.
-   The idle timeout setting is turned off for the VDI pool.
-   Communication with the ServiceNow instance host is enabled.

Download and unzip the installation file for the Unattended Robot application. For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/download-installer-rpa.md).
