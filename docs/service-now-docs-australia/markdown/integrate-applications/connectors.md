# Connectors

The Connectors provide specialized abilities, such as automating tasks with Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and Microsoft Word documents. Connectors are different from components because they expose multiple methods and they are used differently.

Connectors reside in the ServiceNow® app store and become available to you when the RPA Desktop Design Studio connects to the appropriate RPA Hub instance.

Some connectors are available by default under the Toolbox pane while you must install the rest. To install, see [Manage plugins in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/install-plugins-rpa-studio.md).

When set up, Connector methods work just like the components. You connect methods with connectors and vice versa to create an automation.

An example of a connector is Google Chrome. The Chrome connector performs various tasks on the Chrome browser.

When you set up a connector, it exposes multiple methods that perform specific functions. For example, the Google Chrome connector exposes the following methods, and more:

-   Get the screenshot of a web page open on the Google Chrome.
-   Set a focus on a Google Chrome window that is inactive or running in the background.

The example shows the Microsoft Word connector and its methods.\[Omitted image "connectors-illustration.png"\] Alt text: Use Connectors.
