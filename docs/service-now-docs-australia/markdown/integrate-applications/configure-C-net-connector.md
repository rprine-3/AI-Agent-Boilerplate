# Configure the C\#.Net connector

Write and validate custom C\#.Net scripts and execute them as part of your automation by using the C\#.Net connector in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have installed the Scripting plugin on the RPA Desktop Design Studio. To install, see [Manage plugins in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/install-plugins-rpa-studio.md).

Role required: Developer

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Connectors** &gt; **C\#.NET**.

2.  Drag the C\#.Net connector to **Global Objects** in the Project Explorer pane.

3.  Right-click the C\#.Net connector in **Global Objects** and select **Configure**.

    The Script Editor window is displayed.

4.  Enter the custom script in the Script pane.

5.  Select **Add Reference** from the **References** tab section if you want to add Dynamic-link library \(DLL\) references to your custom script.

    You can select the references from the Reference Manager window and also from your computer.

6.  Select **Validate**.

    If your custom script has any errors, it is displayed in the Errors pane. Resolve the errors and select **Validate** to check for errors again.

## What to do next

The custom script you created by using the C\#.Net connector is now ready to be used in your automation.
