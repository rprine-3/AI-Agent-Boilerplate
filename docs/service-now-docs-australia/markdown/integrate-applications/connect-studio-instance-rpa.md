# Connect to an RPA Hub instance from RPA Desktop Design Studio

Connect to an RPA Hub instance in three ways using the Connection Manager so that you can establish a connection between the RPA Desktop Design Studio and ServiceNow RPA Hub instance.

## Before you begin

Set up the RPA Desktop Design Studio application to add ServiceNow instance details. For more information, see [Set up RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/set-up-rpa-studio.md).

Open an automation project. For more information, see [Open a local automation project in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/open-project-rpa-studio.md) and [Open a cloud automation project in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/open-project-remote-rpa-studio.md).

Role required: none

## About this task

After you launch the RPA Desktop Design Studio, you can connect to the same instance using different credentials.

You cannot connect to a different instance after the RPA Desktop Design Studio is launched.

To connect to a different instance, you must close and reopen the RPA Desktop Design Studio application.

## Procedure
