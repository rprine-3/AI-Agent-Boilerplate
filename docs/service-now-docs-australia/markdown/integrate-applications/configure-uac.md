# Use the Universal App Connector

Create automations for your Windows, Java, Google Chrome, and Edge browser-based applications by using the Universal App Connector \(UAC\). Configure the applications from a single, unified connector and capture the screens and elements or screen controls such as check boxes, and buttons. Use the methods of these screens and elements to build your automation.

## Before you begin

Add the Universal App Connector plugin from the Plugins Manager before using the connector. For more information about adding the SSH plugin, see [Manage plugins in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/install-plugins-rpa-studio.md).

Verify that you have open or active Windows, Java, Google Chrome, or Edge applications.

Role required: None

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Connectors**, and drag **Universal App Connector** to **Global Objects** in the Project Explorer pane.

    The connector is added as a **UniversalApplication** object under **Global Objects**.

2.  To use the methods at the **Universal App Connector** connector level, double-click the **UniversalApplication** object.

    |Method name|Reference|
    |-----------|---------|
    |**Click**|[Use the Click method for Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-click-method-uac.md)|
    |**GetValue**|[Use the GetValue method for Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-getvalue-method-uac.md)|
    |**SetValue**|[Use the SetValue method for Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-setvalue-uac.md)|
    |**Start**|[Use the Start method for Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-start-method.md)|
    |**WaitForAnyScreen**|[Use the WaitForAnyScreen method for Universal App Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-the-wait-for-any-screen-method.md)|

    For example, the Start method is used if you want the browser or application to start before interacting with any application screens or elements.

    The methods appear in the Object Explorer pane.

3.  To configure the screens and elements in the UAC, do the steps.

    1.  Under Global Objects, right-click **UniversalApplication** and select **Configure**.

    2.  On the Configure screens and elements window, select the **Choose from an open window** drop-down \(\[Omitted image "UAC-connector-select-application-icon.png"\] Alt text: Choose from an open window drop-down.\) and select an application screen.

        \[Omitted image "uac-connector-open-apps.png"\] Alt text: Open applications.

        **Note:**

        -   If no supported applications are open, the `App window not found message` is displayed.
        -   To display newly opened application screens on the list, select the Click to refresh windows icon \(\[Omitted image "refresh-uac-list.png"\] Alt text: Click to refresh windows icon.\).
    3.  To filter the opened applications by their type, select the **All** filter application type icon \(\[Omitted image "uac-connector-all-applications-filter.png"\] Alt text: Filter application type icon.\) and select All or the application type.

        For example, if you select **Chrome**, only Google Chrome web pages appear in the **Choose from an open window** list.

        For example, if you select **Windows Application**, only Windows screens appear in the **Choose from an open window** list.

        \[Omitted image "filter-app-type-uac.png"\] Alt text: Filter the application types.

    4.  To add the selected application screen, select **Add screen**.

        After you do this step, you can capture the screen elements to perform actions.

        The application screen appears under the Screens and elements pane.

        \[Omitted image "uac-connector-application-screen-added.png"\] Alt text: Application screen name appears under Screens and elements.

    5.  To capture the elements from the screen, under the Screen and elements pane, right-click the added screen and select **Capture Element**.

        \[Omitted image "uac-connector-capture-window.png"\] Alt text: Capture Element option.

        The focus is set on the application screen that you had captured and the capture elements dialog appears.

        For example, when you are capturing elements of a Windows application such as Notepad. If you select the **UIA** mode \(UI Automation\), the scroll bar of the Notepad is also captured.

        \[Omitted image "uac-windows-app-uia-mode.png"\] Alt text: UI Automation mode of the Windows application, such as Notepad.

        If you select the **AA** mode \(Active Accessibility\), the scroll bar of the Notepad is not captured.

        \[Omitted image "uac-windows-app-aa-mode.png"\] Alt text: Active Accessibility mode of the Windows application, such as Notepad.

    6.  To use the methods at the **Universal App Connector** connector level for the two modes, UI Automation and Active Accessibility, double-click the **UniversalApplication** object.

        For more information about the methods for UI Automation mode and Active Accessibility mode, see [Methods of UI Automation mode and Active Accessibility mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/uac-windows-uia-aa-methods.md).

        The methods appear in the Object Explorer pane.
