# Create an activity manually in RPA Desktop Design Studio

Create and use an activity to provide modularity to an automation project in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Set up the RPA Desktop Design Studio application and add the ServiceNow instance details. For more information, see [Set up RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/set-up-rpa-studio.md).

Role required: none

## About this task

Activities are a reusable set of instructions that are designed for an automation on the Design surface of RPA Desktop Design Studio.

You can design automation workflows in an activity on the Design surface by using various components.

Each activity contains two components by default: Start and End. These components can't be deleted because they are the starting and ending points of the activity.

You can reuse each activity multiple times within the same automation project by dragging the activity to the Design surface. You can also import activities in different automation projects.

To create an activity using Now Assist, see [Create an activity with AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-activity-now-assist.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Project Explorer pane, navigate to **Activities**.

    The Activities section lists all the activities that are created under each project. By default, a Main activity is created when a new project is initiated. The automation execution starts from the startup activity, in this case, Main activity as shown in the following example.

    \[Omitted image "main-activity-proj-exp.png"\] Alt text: Main activity is created when a new project is initiated.

2.  Do any of the following options for a desired action.

</table>    **Important:** You might come across the following behaviours when you drag and drop an automation component from the Toolbox, Object explorer, Project explorer, and Skills explorer to the Design surface:

    -   If you drag and drop a component to the same component in the Design surface, then the new component replaces the existing component. For example, if you already have the **ActionSet** component on the Design surface and you drag and drop another **ActionSet** component to the existing **ActionSet**, then the new version replaces the existing component.

        All the connections \(control and data connections\), variables, or static data associated to the existing component gets associated to the newly dropped component if the port name and the port data type are the same.

    -   If you drag and drop a new component to a different component or method in the Design surface then the new component replaces the existing component.

        All the connections, variables, or static data associated to the existing component gets associated to the newly dropped component if the port names and the port data types are the same.

    -   If you drag and drop a component between two components that are already connected in the Design surface, then the component is placed between the existing components. You may come across the following behaviours when you drag and drop a component between two components:
        -   If port names and the port data types of the newly dropped component match with the connected components, then the data connections are created.
        -   If the port names are the same and the port data types are different, then the data connections are created only if the port data type is can be converted \(the source port data must be converted to target data type. This is known as typecasting or type conversion. For more information on type casting, see [Java Type Casting](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_type_casting.asp)\). For example, integer to object but not object to integer.
        -   If the port names are the same and the port data type can be converted, but there is already an existing data connection between the two components, then no new data connection is created.
