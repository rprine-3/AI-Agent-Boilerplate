# Configure notifications for ERP Semantic Mining tasks

Enable notifications to find out when ERP Semantic Mining succeeds or fails in a mining job for the ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) system of record.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Before you can set up notifications for yourself, your admin must add you to the ERP Semantic Mining Notification group.

Role required: sn\_erp\_mining.erp\_admin, sn\_erp\_mining.erp\_user
