# ERP Semantic Mining candidate recommendations field descriptions

On a candidate record in ERP Semantic Mining, the **Recommendations** tab displays information about suggested next actions for replatforming ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) candidates.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.
