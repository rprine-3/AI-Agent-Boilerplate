# Configuring ERP Semantic Mining

Set up ERP Semantic Mining to enable the app to scan the system of record for candidates to replatform. Administrators can also quickly check the health of the ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) connection and investigate any issues, and view knowledge articles related to errors.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

You must install Zero Copy Connector for ERP and configure connections and ERP data models before you can install ERP Semantic Mining.

## Server requirements

For the credentials, use an SAP service type user account in your system of record that requires the following S\_RFC SAP authorization objects:

-   S\_RFC with Activity = 16 \(Execute\) for the following Function Modules:
    -   SAPWL\_WORKLOAD\_GET\_STATISTIC
    -   SWNC\_COLLECTOR\_GET\_AGGREGATES
    -   SWNC\_COLLECTOR\_GET\_DIRECTORY
    -   SQLM\_API\_GET\_NEXT\_DATA\_PACKAGE
-   S\_TABU\_NAM with Activity 03 \(Display\) for the following table: TRNSPACET

There are additional authorizations needed for Zero Copy Connector for ERP. For more information, see [Configuring Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-integration-configuration-overview.md).

**Note:** The credentials you specify for the Zero Copy Connector for ERP connection must match the service user credentials in the ERP system.

## Types and number of available connections

Zero Copy Connector for ERP and ERP Semantic Mining currently support ECC \(minimum SAP Netweaver 7.31\) and SAP S/4HANA systems.

**Note:** Each installation of ERP Semantic Mining supports adding up to 10 systems. However, ERP Semantic Mining can connect to only one live ERP system at a time.

You should install Zero Copy Connector for ERP and add credentials there before you install and configure ERP Semantic Mining. For more information, see [Connect to SAP with RFC or BAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/set-up-erp-integration-connection.md).

The number of ERP connections you can have per ServiceNow instance depends on your license.

For details on Connections and Credentials, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
