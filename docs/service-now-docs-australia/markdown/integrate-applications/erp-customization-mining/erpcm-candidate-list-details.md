# ERP Semantic Mining candidate list field descriptions

The candidate list in ERP Semantic Mining displays information on the basic details for each candidate.

Evaluation of how well a candidate is suited for replatforming.The value represents how well the remote tables and extraction tables for the candidate match an application.

-   A high potential indicates that ERP Semantic Mining can immediately use remote tables and extraction tables that match the ERP model for the application candidate without making additional changes.
-   A low potential indicates that the application candidate matches few of the remote tables and extraction tables in the ERP models in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.
