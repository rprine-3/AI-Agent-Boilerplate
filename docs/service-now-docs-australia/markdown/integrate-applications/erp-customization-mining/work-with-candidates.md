# Finding and working with candidates to replatform

Use ERP Semantic Mining to identify potential ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) app candidates for replatforming.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Replatforming is the process of scanning legacy ERP system code to find potential candidates to move onto your ServiceNow AI Platform instance as new apps. You can use data from the ERP system as a source for apps built on the ServiceNow AI Platform, improving performance, enhancing security, and reducing maintenance.

ERP Semantic Mining evaluates application candidates and presents a numeric score. The higher the score, the better the candidate is for replatforming.

-   A high potential indicates that ERP Semantic Mining can immediately use remote tables and extraction tables that match the ERP model for the application candidate without making additional changes.
-   A low potential indicates that the application candidate matches few of the remote tables and extraction tables in the ERP models in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

Good candidates for replatforming tend to be smaller applications that use data from the ERP system.

**Note:**

If you delete a candidate from ERP Semantic Mining, the candidate automatically reappears the next time the ERP system is scanned. Instead of deleting candidates, use the **Save as potential candidate** feature to organize your candidates.

If ERP Semantic Mining shows that a candidate has a number of similar candidates, consider building one app that meets the needs of some or all similar candidates when you replatform.
