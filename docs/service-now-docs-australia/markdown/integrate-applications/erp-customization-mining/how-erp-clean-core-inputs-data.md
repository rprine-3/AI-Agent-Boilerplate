# How ERP Semantic Mining extracts and processes data

ERP Semantic Mining retrieves data from the ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) system using extractors and processes it before the data is available on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

Use an SAP extractor to analyze the ERP data sources and validate the syntax. The following extractors are available to retrieve data from the ERP system:

-   APPstats
-   COMPHIER
-   SQLM

The supported extractors process data using ServiceNow AI Platform tables.
