# Sample Glide query for ERP data in ERP Semantic Mining

Access data from the ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) system of record through the Glide API.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

The following is an example of a Glide query that fetches a customer name.

```

var sap_customer_gr = new GlideRecord('sn_erp_integration_st_sap_sales_customer');
sap_customer_gr.get('customer_number', '100032');
sap_customer_gr.getValue('name');

```
