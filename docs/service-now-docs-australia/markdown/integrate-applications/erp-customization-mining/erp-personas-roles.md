# ERP Semantic Mining roles

Administrators assign roles to give team members permission to configure or use ERP Semantic Mining.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

**Note:** When you assign ERP Semantic Mining roles to a user, you must include the scope. For example, assign the `sn_erp_mining.erp_admin` role, not just `erp_admin`.

For more on assigning roles, see [Assign a role to a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignARoleToAUser.md).

To learn more about managing per-user subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md) and contact your account representative.
