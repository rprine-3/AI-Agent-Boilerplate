# How ERP Semantic Mining works with Zero Copy Connector for ERP and remote tables

Zero Copy Connector for ERP enables you to connect to your ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) system, and to organize its data.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

ERP Semantic Mining enables you to find good candidates for replatforming from the ERP system to the ServiceNow AI Platform.

ERP Semantic Mining suggests candidates and possible next steps, such as updating remote tables and extraction tables to access ERP data. Remote tables send data to the ServiceNow instance as an attachment, which is then analyzed using AI/ML to identify similar candidates to replatform.

After you have identified candidates to replatform and taken the recommended action in ERP Semantic Mining, you must only use Zero Copy Connector for ERP to access the remote tables and extraction tables. These tables are data sources for building apps, flows, and workspaces.

## Using remote tables and extraction tables with Zero Copy Connector for ERP and ERP Semantic Mining

You can use a combination of remote tables and extraction tables to retrieve data from your legacy ERP system.

-   Remote tables get their records from running an associated script against an external data source.
-   Extraction tables retrieve large amounts of data using a scheduled query, and use transform tables to process data for use on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

Remote tables describe the schema for the data that you want to retrieve from an external source, such as the ERP system. Use remote tables to connect the ServiceNow AI Platform to third-party sources, or to another instance, so that you can retrieve external data and optionally cache it in the memory. You can view external data in lists or forms and process it with standard Glide scripts. You can also group, sort, aggregate, and filter the data just like you would for standard internal tables.

By using a remote table, you can retrieve the data from external sources or from another instance with REST or SOAP services. The external data lives in the memory in read-only mode, which makes the data temporary, or transient, within the ServiceNow AI Platform. You can then view and manipulate the external data without importing or storing it. For more information, see [Remote tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/remote-tables.md).

Use an extraction table to work with large amounts of ERP data. ERP extraction tables regularly save data to a local transform table on the ServiceNow AI Platform, which you can then process and use as the data foundation of a replatformed app.
