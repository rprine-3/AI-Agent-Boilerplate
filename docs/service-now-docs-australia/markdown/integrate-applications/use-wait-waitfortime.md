## About this task

You can use the Wait For Time component anywhere in an automation. Depending on the wait time that you have configured, the automation waits after the component previous to the Wait For Time component is executed.

To configure the properties for the Wait For Time component, see [Properties of the Wait components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/wait-properties.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **General**.

2.  Drag the Wait For Time component to the Design surface.

3.  To set the wait time, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the Wait For Time component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.

    |Port Type|Port name|Data type|Purpose|Mandatory?|Notes|

    |Data In|Wait Time \(Seconds\)|Integer|Takes the wait time.|Yes| |
