# Use the Base64Encode component

Encode a string with the base64 algorithm by using the Base64Encode component in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the Base64Encode component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the String Utilities components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/util-stringutil-prop.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Utilities** &gt; **String Utilities**.

2.  Drag the Base64Encode component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the Base64Encode component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.
