# Use the Terminate component

Abort an automation by using the Terminate component in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the Terminate component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the General components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/Properties-general-components.md).

## Example

For example, in the automation workflow that requires to read data from an Excel, For Each loop and GetListItem components are used to extract data from the DataTable and display in a message box. If any error occurs while reading the data from the Excel, you can use the Try Catch component to handle the exception and the Terminate component to end the automation. The error message is also shown in process job.
