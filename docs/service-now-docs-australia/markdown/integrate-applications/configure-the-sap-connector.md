# Configure the SAP connector

Capture one or more SAP application screens, UI elements on the screen, and then expose the methods at the application, screen, or element levels by configuring the SAP connector.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the SAP plugin on the RPA Desktop Design Studio is installed. For more information, see [Manage plugins in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/install-plugins-rpa-studio.md).

Ensure that at least one SAP application window is active or open on your machine.

The SAP application must support these environments:

-   Windows – Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019
-   SAP ECC EH8 Client
-   .Net 4.7.1

Role required: none
