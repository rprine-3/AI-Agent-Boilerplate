# Configure the IBM Personal Communications emulator

Configure the IBM Personal Communications \(PCOMM\) emulator on the RPA Desktop Design Studio by capturing the PCOMM emulator screens and their elements. After capturing the screens, you can use the screen and element methods to automate actions on the screens and elements.

## Before you begin

Add the Terminal connector object to the Global Objects list in the Project Explorer pane so the Terminal connector is available to all the activities, components, and connectors in the automation project.

Start an emulator session and connect it to a server.

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Project Explorer pane **&gt; Global Objects** and right-click the **TerminalSession** object.

2.  Select **Configure**.

    \[Omitted image "terminal-connector-right-click-object.png"\] Alt text: Configure option that you navigated to in Step 1.

3.  On the Terminal Connector window, make sure that Pcomm is selected.

    By default, Pcomm is selected.

    \[Omitted image "pcomm-emulator-selected.png"\] Alt text: Pcomm emulator list is selected by default.

    **Tip:** To load a PCOMM emulator screen that doesn't appear in the list, select the refresh icon \(\[Omitted image "connector-refresh-icon.png"\] Alt text: Screen refresh icon.\).

4.  Capture a PCOMM emulator screen.

    1.  In the Pcomm list, select a PCOMM Mainframe emulator screen.

        \[Omitted image "select-PCOMM-screen.png"\] Alt text: PCOMM Mainframe emulator screen selection.

        **Note:** When the PCOMM emulator establishes a connection with the server, a session is created with the name of the session. For example, the name of the session in the example is A.

    2.  Select **Add Screen**.

        The emulator screen is added and appears in the Screens and elements pane and under the TerminalSession object in the Project Explorer pane.

        \[Omitted image "PCOMM-emulator-screen-added.png"\] Alt text: PCOMM emulator screen added in the Screens and elements pane and under the TerminalSession object in the Project Explorer pane.

        When you capture multiple screens and elements and want to automate tasks on one screen or element, the connector must first find the screen or element by using the match rules. To know about the match rules, see [Use the screen or element match rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/find-the-screen-or-element-to-perform-automation.md).

5.  Capture an element from the Pcomm emulator screen.

    1.  Right-click the screen that you have captured and select **Add Element**.

        \[Omitted image "PCOMM-capture-element.png"\] Alt text: Add Element option for PCOMM screen.

    2.  In the TERMINAL PREVIEW screen, move your mouse device to the element that you want to capture.

        The element displays its information.

        \[Omitted image "PCOMM-emulator-text-info.png"\] Alt text: PCOMM emulator screen text information.

    3.  Add the element as a field by right-clicking the element and selecting **Add as Field**.

        The data in a Mainframe screen is displayed within fields. The emulator screen that you configure in the RPA Desktop Design Studio indicates a field with a rectangle. The following image shows a field within a rectangle.

        \[Omitted image "terminal-conn-mainframe-field.png"\] Alt text: Mainframe screen field.

        When you select **Add as Field**, the connector treats the element as a field that displays the data or enables data entry. With this option, you can get the text or data from a field and then enter the data in a form.

    4.  Add fields after selecting them in a tabular format.

        To add fields after selecting them in a tabular format, select the contiguous fields that make up a table. The following example shows how you must select the fields to capture a table.

        \[Omitted image "terminal-conn-fields-as-table.png"\] Alt text: Field selection. For the text description, refer to the text that follows this example.

        Select the fields.

        1.  Select the first field in the table.
        2.  On your keyboard, press **Shift**.
        3.  Select the last field in the table.
        Right-click and select **Add as Table**.

    5.  In the context dialog box, enter the name of the field or table in the **NAME** field.

        \[Omitted image "terminal-connector-context-dialog.png"\] Alt text: Context dialog box that shows the POSITION, LENGTH, and NAME fields.

    6.  Select the Add Field icon \[Omitted image "add-element-icon-RPA.png"\] Alt text: Add field icon..

        To capture more elements, you can repeat steps 5a through 5f.

    7.  Close the **TERMINAL PREVIEW** screen by selecting **OK**.

        The element is added and appears in the Screens and elements pane in the Terminal Connector screen under the TerminalScreen\_0 object.

        \[Omitted image "PCOMM-text-field-added.png"\] Alt text: Text field added in the Screens and elements pane under the TerminalSession\_0 object.

6.  Use the screen match rules to enable the terminal connector to locate a screen or element.

    When you capture multiple screens, fields, or tables and want to automate tasks on one screen or element, the connector must first find the screen or element. To enable the connector to find the screen or element, use the screen match rules at [Use the screen or element match rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/find-the-screen-or-element-to-perform-automation.md).

7.  View the screen and element methods.

    1.  View the screen-level methods under the TerminalSession object in the Project Explorer pane by double-clicking the screen that you captured.

        The methods appear in the Object Explorer pane.

    2.  View the element-level methods in the Project Explorer pane by navigating to the element under the screen that you captured and double-clicking the element.

        The methods appear in the Object Explorer pane.
