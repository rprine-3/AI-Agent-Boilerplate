# Update an established connection

Keep connection details current by updating service account information, authentication, or security settings.

## Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Established connections** tab in Zero Copy Connector Hub in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
2.  Select the connection that you want to configure.

3.  Update the connection details.

    **Important:** Changing connection details can affect data mapping in the data fabric tables created using this connection. If you need to preserve the current data mapping, consult the data source administrator before updating the connection to ensure the data mapping isn't affected.

    1.  Select **Edit**.

    2.  Update the connection identification.

        For example, update the connection description if data stewards can't find the connection or if the data source admin adds new data assets.

    3.  Update the connection attributes.

        For example, you might update the connection attributes if the connection URL or service account information changes.

    4.  Update the authentication method or private key information.

        For example, update the private key and pass phrase when the private key changes or is no longer valid.

    5.  In the confirmation dialog box, confirm that you want to make the changes by selecting **Edit**.

4.  Select **Save and connect**.


## Result

The system tests the connection. If connection succeeds, the changes are saved.

## What to do next

If the connection fails, [View the connection log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-connection-details-zcc.md). Review the connection details with the data source admin and try again.

If your changes impact data fabric tables, ensure the proper access is configured on the **Access Controls** tab.

## View the connection log

Monitor and troubleshoot a connection by viewing the connection log.

### Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Established connections** tab in Zero Copy Connector Hub in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.

### What to do next

Review the log entries and consult your data source administrator if necessary. Update the connection details if any connection attributes are incorrect. See [Update an established connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-connection-details-zcc.md).

## Deactivate a connection

Temporarily disable the connection between data fabric tables and their data source by deactivating a connection.

### Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

### About this task

A connection admin can stop queries to an external data source or prevent changes to data mapping by deactivating a connection. When a connection is deactivated, external data isn't available from any data fabric tables using the connection.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Established connections** tab in Zero Copy Connector Hub in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
2.  Select the connection that you want to deactivate.

3.  Select the More Actions icon \(\[Omitted image "more-actions-menu-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\), and select **Deactivate**.

4.  Confirm that you want to deactivate the connection by selecting **Deactivate**.


### Result

The connection is deactivated.

-   External data is no longer pulled by any data fabric table using the connection.
-   The **Data Assets** tab and **Access Control** tabs aren't accessible in the connection.

### What to do next

To update the connection information or access the **Data Assets** or **Access Control** tabs again, you must reactivate the connection. See [Reactivate a connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-connection-details-zcc.md).

## Reactivate a connection

Manage data assets and access control in a deactivated connection by reactivating it.

### Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

### About this task

A connection admin can reactivate a connection that's been temporarily deactivated.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Established connections** tab in Zero Copy Connector Hub in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
2.  Select the connection that you want to reactivate.

    **Note:** View all deactivated connections by selecting **Deactivated** in the **Status** list.

3.  Select **Reactivate**.

4.  Review and update connection details as needed.

5.  Select **Save and connect**.


### Result

The connection is activated.

-   External data is pulled by any data fabric table using the connection.
-   The **Data Assets** tab and **Access Control** tabs are accessible in the connection.

## Delete a connection
