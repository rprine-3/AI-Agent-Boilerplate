# Using the Overview tab to view the bot processes in RPA Hub

By using the **Overview** tab in RPA Hub, you can quickly view the bot process details in one place.

## Introduction of the Overview tab

The **Overview** tab appears after a bot process is in published, in maintenance, or a retired stage. You can see the status of all life-cycle stages \(but not for the Build stage\) for both the attended and unattended bot processes.

## Sections of the Overview tab

The **Overview** tab is divided into the following six sections:

-   Process information
-   Happening now
-   Upcoming changes
-   Performance
-   Work queues
-   Contacts

**Note:** The descriptions of these sections are in a table later in this topic.

## Roles required

To access the **Overview** tab, you must have one of the following roles:

-   RPA developer
-   RPA release manager
-   RPA business manager
-   RPA support user
-   RPA admin

## Examples

The **Overview** tab for an unattended bot process is shown in the following example.

\[Omitted image "overview-unattended-trigger-mode-removed.jpg"\] Alt text: Overview tab for a published unattended bot process.

The **Overview** tab for an attended bot process is shown in the following example.

\[Omitted image "overview-attended.jpg"\] Alt text: Overview tab for a published attended bot process.

## Details of the sections in the Overview tab

For more information about the **Overview** tab, see [Get a snapshot of a bot process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/open-overview-page-rpa.md).

**Note:** If you don't have access to a particular table, you can't see that table in the **Overview** tab.

The following table shows the detailed descriptions of the sections and actions that are available.
