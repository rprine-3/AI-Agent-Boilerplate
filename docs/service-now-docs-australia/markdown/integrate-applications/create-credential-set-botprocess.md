# Create a robot credential in RPA Hub

Create a robot credential so that the unattended robot can log in to a Windows machine and perform the automation.

## Before you begin

Familiarize yourself with the credential management concept. For more information, see [Credential Management in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/credential-management-rpa-hub.md).

Do this task only when you select the **Process Type** field as **Unattended** on the Bot process configuration form while you're creating a bot process. For more information, see [Configuring a bot process record in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-botprocess.md), [Bot process configuration form in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-botprocess-config.md), and [Bot Process form in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/select-botprocess.md).

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager, or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## About this task

You can't delete a robot credential if it’s associated with any credential group. For more information, see [Create a credential group in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-credential-group.md).

You can't edit the **Robot Username** field when the life-cycle stage status of the associated bot process is set to **Published**. You can edit the password irrespective of what the life-cycle stage is of the associated bot process. For more information, see [Life-cycle stage statuses \(LLCS\) of a bot process in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/lifecycle-stages-botprocess.md).

You can't edit the **External Credential** field when the life-cycle stage status of the associated bot process is set to **Published**.

If a robot credential uses an external credential vault, you must make sure that the associated external credential vault is active.

In RPA Hub, you can retrieve the robot credentials, application credentials, or a Time-based One-time Password \(TOTP\) seed in two ways:

-   From a ServiceNow credentials record \(application credential, robot credential, or TOTP authenticator\).
-   From an external credential vault. For more information, see [External credential vault in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/external-credentials-rpa.md).

The value must be in a JSON format. You can't enter an empty JSON value.

For more information about the JSON, see [Steps to configure an external credential vault in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/config-ext-cred-rpa.md).
