# DHCP Reserve IP v4 Address Range activity

The DHCP Reserve IP v4 Address Range activity reserves an IP address range for DHCP use.

The DHCP activities use the [REST web service activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateARESTWebServiceActivity.md) to manage IP addresses using an Infoblox DDI Grid Server. These activities are configured to use a MID Server with REST capabilities.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Infoblox DDI** &gt; **DHCP**.
