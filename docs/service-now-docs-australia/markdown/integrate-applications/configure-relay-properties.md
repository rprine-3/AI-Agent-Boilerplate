# Configure relay behavior

Configure relay behavior by setting properties either in the `config.yaml` file or in the `Relay Property [sn_zc_tunnel_relay_prop]` table on your instance.

## Before you begin

-   The Reverse Tunnel store app must be installed.
-   The private relay must be deployed and registered.

Role required: sn\_zc\_tunnel.relay\_manager

## About this task

The private relay supports two configuration sources:

-   **`config.yaml`**

    A configuration file shipped with the relay zip file and deployed in your environment. Properties set in `config.yaml` take precedence over properties set on the instance. Modifying this file does not require a relay restart as changes are applied automatically. If issues occur, restarting the relay applies the changes immediately.

    Modify `config.yaml` only when you have a functional or business reason to do so.

-   **Relay properties table \(ServiceNow instance\)**

    Properties configured in the `Relay Property [sn_zc_tunnel_relay_prop]` table on your ServiceNow instance are retrieved dynamically during the relay configuration polling cycle. Changes are applied without restarting the relay. Use the `Relay Property [sn_zc_tunnel_relay_prop]` table for most configuration changes to avoid relay restarts.


|Property|Default|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|**reconnect-multiplier**|2|Multiplier applied to the reconnect interval when the relay retries a connection to the gateway.|
|**reconnect-jitter**|0.3|Jitter applied to the reconnect interval to prevent simultaneous reconnection attempts from multiple relays.|
|**config-poll-interval**|30000 ms|Interval in milliseconds at which the relay polls the instance for configuration updates.|
|**debug**|false|When set to true, enables debug logging on the relay.|
|**reregistration-max-attempts**|5|Number of retry attempts made when registering backend services with the gateway instance. If all attempts are exhausted, the gateway connection is closed.|
|**max-streams**|10000|Maximum number of concurrent streams supported. When the cap is reached, new streams are rejected and traffic is distributed to another relay.|
|**stream-window-kb**|256 KB|Flow control window size in kilobytes for each stream. Controls the amount of data in flight per stream.|
|**cert-reissue-window**|30 days|Number of days before certificate expiry at which the relay initiates certificate renewal. The relay generates a new certificate signing request and re-establishes the connection using the renewed certificate.|
|**http-request-timeout**|30000 ms|Timeout in milliseconds for HTTP requests made by the relay to the instance.|
|**reconnect-initial-delay**|1000 ms|Delay in milliseconds before the relay attempts to reconnect to the gateway.|
|**reconnect-max-delay**|60000 ms|Maximum delay in milliseconds between reconnection attempts.|
|**cert-monitor-interval**|86400000 ms|Interval in milliseconds between certificate expiration checks.|
|**glide.kmf.issuing.reverse\_tunnel\_relay.validity\_ms**|365 days|Validity period of the relay certificate. Minimum: 1 millisecond. Maximum: 20 years.|

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Private Relay** &gt; **Relays**.

2.  Open the relay record.

3.  In the Relay Properties related list, select **New**.

4.  Enter the property name and value.

    For example, to enable debug logging, you would set the property name to `debug` and the value to `true`.

    Invalid property values fall back to defaults, and a warning is logged. Configuration polling is not affected.

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The new property value is applied during the next configuration polling cycle without requiring a restart.
