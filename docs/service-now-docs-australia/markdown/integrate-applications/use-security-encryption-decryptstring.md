# Use the DecryptString component

Decrypt an encrypted string by providing the encryption key using the Decrypt String component in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the Decrypt String component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the Encryption components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/properties-security-encryption-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Security** &gt; **Encryption**.

2.  Drag the Decrypt String component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the Decrypt String component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.
