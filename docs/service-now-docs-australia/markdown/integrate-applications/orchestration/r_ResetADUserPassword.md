# Reset AD User Password activity

The Reset AD User Password activity resets the password of a user account in Windows Active Directory.

If the new password violates any Active Directory password requirements, such as length or character combinations, the reset activity fails and returns the appropriate error message. This error appears in the ECC Queue and when you point to the activity in the Workflow Editor.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Active Directory**.

**Note:** This activity replaces an AD activity by the same name available in prior releases. If you have a workflow that uses the deprecated activity, your workflow will continue to work normally after upgrading to Instanbul. However, all new workflows must use the custom version of this activity, which was built with the [PowerShell activity designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_PowershellActivityDesigner.md).
