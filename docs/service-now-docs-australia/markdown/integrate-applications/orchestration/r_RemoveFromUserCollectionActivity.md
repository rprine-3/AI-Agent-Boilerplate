# Remove from User Collection activity

The Remove from User Collection activity removes a user from a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) user collection.

The Remove from User Collection activity uses the [Powershell activity designer template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAPowershellActivity.md) to access a user collection on a Microsoft SCCM target host. The activity is configured to use a MID Server with Powershell capabilites and to run a MID Server script called `RemoveFromUserCollection.ps1` to edit the collection.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\)**.
