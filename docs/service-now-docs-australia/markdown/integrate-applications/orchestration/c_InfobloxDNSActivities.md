# Infoblox DNS activities

The Infoblox DNS activities manage DNS records in your network using an Infoblox DDI Grid Server.

Use these activities to register, list, or delete DNS records managed on an Infoblox server.

**Parent Topic:**[Infoblox DDI activity pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_InfobloxDDIActivityPack.md)

## List DNS C-records activity

The List DNS C-records activity retrieves all canonical \(CNAME\) records from a specified Infoblox server.

The DNS activities use the [REST web service activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateARESTWebServiceActivity.md) template to manage DNS records using an Infoblox DDI Grid Server. These activities are configured to use a MID Server with REST capabilities.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Infoblox DDI** &gt; **DNS**.
