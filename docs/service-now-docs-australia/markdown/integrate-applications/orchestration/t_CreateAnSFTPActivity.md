# Create an SFTP activity

Create an activity that executes basic SFTP commands on a remote server.

## Before you begin

Roles required: activity\_creator or workflow\_admin

## About this task

You can create a custom activity that manages files and directories on a target host or copies a file from one SFTP server to another. The file content is streamed through a MID Server, which avoids having to store the data on the hard drive of the MID Server host machine.

**Note:** This activity requires the credentials of a user who can execute SFTP commands on the source host. The [Copy File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/r_CopyFileActivity.md) activity, provided in the activity pack, requires separate credentials to access the target host.

## Procedure

1.  Create a [custom activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/create-custom-activities.md).

    This action creates a custom activity using a template.

2.  After setting up [general properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/General-Flds-Templates.md) and [creating input variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/CreateInputVariables.md), configure the SFTP Execution Command.

</td><td>

Names of specific source files to include in the file transfer. Separate the file names with semi-colons. This field supports a semi-colon separated list of wild-card patterns. For example: `*.txt; a?cd.pdf.` If this field is blank, all files are included. Field available on following command: Get file list**Note:** For information about how the values in this field affect options in other fields, see the logic explanation which follows.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d591004e237">

**Is a directory**

</td><td>

If checked, specifies the file path is a directory. Field available on following command: Remove file or directory

**Suffix for temporary file**

</td><td>

If a file exists on a target host, this command enables a temporary suffix to use for a file name. If this field contains a value, the activity first copies the source file to a temporary file on the target host using **targetFilePath + tempFileSuffix** as the name. Upon completion, the activity renames the file to the actual target file name. If this field is blank, the activity copies the source file directly to the target file and overwrites it, if it exists.

**UID**

</td><td>

User ID attribute to apply to a file or directory. The UID and GID values must be set together as a pair or they are ignored. The UID and GID numbers are internal values returned by the Get File List activity. Typically, you first use the Get File List activity to return a list of files and their attributes. Then you can move a file from a source host to a target host and set the source file attributes on the target file.

</table>    The system uses this logic to determine which files to move from the source host:

    -   If the Source files field is empty, the system selects all the files in the source directory. Otherwise, it only selects those files whose names match one of the file name patterns given in the field.
    -   If the Excluded files field is empty, the system excludes nothing. Otherwise, it excludes those files whose names match one of the file name patterns given in the field.
    -   The exclude rule has a higher preference than the include rule. If a file name matches one of the file name patterns in the Excluded files field, it does not get into the selection regardless of the include rule.
    -   When the Include subfolders check box is cleared, the system looks only in the source directory for files to include or exclude. Otherwise, it looks in the source directory and any of its subfolders for files to include or exclude.
    **Note:** You can map parameter values in a test payload to variables in the **Outputs** tab automatically. See [automap output variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/automap-output-variable-inputs.md).


## What to do next

-   Use [auto-mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/automap-output-variable-inputs.md) to generate outputs and parsing rules \(recommended for JDBC\)
-   If you do not use auto-mapping, you can manually [create output variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAnOutputVariable.md) and [create parsing rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAParsingRule.md)

**Parent Topic:**[Orchestration custom activity templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_ActivityDesignerComponents.md)

## SFTP template execution parameters

You use execution parameters to create the input process script in the **Preprocessing** form.

For descriptions of the command fields, see [Configure the SFTP execution command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAnSFTPActivity.md).

</table>## Configure the SFTP execution command

Use the input variables you created to configure the command that Orchestration executes on the SFTP target.

### Before you begin

Create the input variables you need in the **Inputs** form before you can advance to the **Execution Command** stage.

Role required: activity\_creator, admin

**Note:** You can test the JDBC connection between the MID Server and the target without having to run the activity in a workflow context. For details, see [test template outputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/CreateInputVariables.md).

### Procedure

1.  Drag variables from the list of inputs and drop them into command fields.

    The system formats the variable in the proper syntax for the command.

    \[Omitted image "SFTPExecutionCommand.png"\] Alt text: In this example, the Create directory command displays in the Command field.

2.  Complete the fields shown in the table.
