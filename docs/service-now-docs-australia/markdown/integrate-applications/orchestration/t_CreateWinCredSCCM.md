Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) requires the appropriate credentials to deploy applications using the Client Software Distribution application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_client\_sf\_dist.csd\_admin or admin

## About this task

Client software distribution requires Windows credentials that have administrative rights on the SCCM server.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the list of credential types, select **Windows Credentials**.

4.  Provide a user name and password with administrative rights on the SCCM server.

    **Important:** Ensure the following:

    -   This user must have the Application Administrator role on the SCCM server.
    -   Use the credentials to log into the SCCM Server and connect via Windows PowerShell from the System Center Configuration Manager console at least once to set the path variable for that credential.
