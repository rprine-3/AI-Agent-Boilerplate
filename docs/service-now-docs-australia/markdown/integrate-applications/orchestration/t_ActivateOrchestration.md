# Activate Orchestration

The Orchestration \(com.snc.runbook\_automation\) plugin is available within a separate subscription from the rest of the ServiceNow platform.

## Before you begin

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. The account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.

If you don't have an account manager, decide to delay activation after purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a subproduction instance without charge, follow these steps.
