# Infoblox DDI activity pack

This activity pack supports Infoblox DDI management through ServiceNow Orchestration.

The Infoblox DDI activity pack manages the IP addresses used in a network by integrating DNS and DHCP. Custom Orchestration activities use Infoblox Web API \(WAPI\) REST web services to access the Infoblox GRID server.

**Important:** Managing IP addresses through the Infoblox server requires a fully functional MID Server.

Starting with the Jakarta release, the Infoblox activity pack updates to version 2. This update supports Infoblox network views, which can restrict the visibility of network data. The view parameter can be passed as a query parameter or payload content, to do operations in a specific view. Version 2 also supports specifying the version of WAPI to use in integration endpoints.

Supported for Infoblox:

-   WAPI version 2.0 for REST messages
-   NIOS appliance version 7.0

**Note:** To use the Infoblox DDI activities and workflow, you must [request activation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_ActivateAnActivityPack.md) of the Orchestration - Infoblox DDI Activty Pack plugin.
