# Remove from Device Collection activity

The Remove from Device Collection activity removes a device from a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) device collection.

The activity is configured to use a MID Server with Powershell capabilites and to run a MID Server script called RemoveFromUserCollection.ps1 to edit the collection.
