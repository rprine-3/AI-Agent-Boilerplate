# Client Software Distribution

The Client Software Distribution \(CSD\) application allows administrators to distribute software from the service catalog using third-party management systems.

CSD allows an administrator to create all the records necessary to deploy software from service catalog requests, including software models and catalog items. You can use the CSD application to automate the deployment and [revocation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_SCCMSoftwareRevocation.md) of software from an SCCM host using the custom [SCCM activity pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_SCCMActivityPack.md). You can define lease periods for software distributed from the Service Catalog and allow lease extensions in some cases, pending approvals. Deployment is accomplished using Orchestration activities and workflows.

CSD also integrates with [Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/c_SAMOverview.md) to manage license counts for deployed software.
