# Installed with Orchestration ROI

Several types of components are installed with the Orchestration - ROI plugin \(com.snc.runbook\_automation.roi\).

**Parent Topic:**[Orchestration ROI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrationROI.md)

## Tables installed with Orchestration ROI

Tables are added with activation of Orchestration ROI.

<table id="table_on4_5sp_ps"><thead><tr><th>

Table

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Expense and Savings\[run\_rate\_predicted\_savings\]

</td><td>

Contains the data for the reports in **Orchestration** &gt; **ROI Reports** &gt; **Predicted Savings**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Savings Report\[savings\_report\]

</td><td>

Contains the number of automations that have been run before the date specified in the **Processed On** column, based on:-   Each automation entry’s associated workflows
-   Estimated savings based on the estimated duration per task.
-   Calculated savings based on calculated duration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Detailed Savings Report\[detailed\_savings\_report\]

</td><td>

Contains a detailed list for the Savings Report \[savings\_report\] table. This list contains each automation’s run date and savings for that automation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Automation Entries\[automation\_entry\_form\]

</td><td>

Contains automation entries that couple labor resources to specific manual tasks. You can specify the estimated duration to perform a task manually and the estimated number of times that a task is performed per month. If this automation entry already has workflow automations implemented, you can specify the associated workflows. The system calculates the savings, based on the labor rate card and the number of workflow automations that have been performed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Roadmap Planning\[roadmap\_planning\]

</td><td>

Contains roadmap planning for each automation entry to be implemented. You can provide estimated hours to implement a workflow automation, the automation percentage anticipated by the end of the year, and the starting month to implement the workflow.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Correlated Tasks\[manual\_mapping\_records\]

</td><td>

Contains all matching manual tasks for each automation entry. Each tasks’s information is stored in this table for the system to use to calculate the actual duration and volume for each manual task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Correlated Tasks Rules\[manual\_mapping\_conditions\]

</td><td>

Contains the correlated task rules the system uses to look up manual tasks corresponding to each automation entry.
