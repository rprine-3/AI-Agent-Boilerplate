# Remove AD Object activity

The Remove AD Object activity deletes an object from Windows Active Directory.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Active Directory**.

**Note:** This activity replaces an AD activity by the same name available in prior releases. If you have a workflow that uses the deprecated activity, your workflow will continue to work normally after upgrading to Instanbul. However, all new workflows must use the custom version of this activity, which was built with the [PowerShell activity designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_PowershellActivityDesigner.md).
