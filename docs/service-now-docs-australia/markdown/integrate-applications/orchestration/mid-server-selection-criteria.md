# Select the default MID Server for Orchestration

Orchestration uses the default MID Server if it cannot find a MID Server with the correct IP range and capability.

Specify the default MID Server in either of these locations:

-   The **Default MID Server** field on the Orchestration application record. See [Configure a default MID Server for each application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_SpecifyMIDServerApplications.md) for instructions.
-   The **Default MID Server to use for Orchestration Activities** property. Navigate to **Orchestration** &gt; **MID Server Properties** to set this value.

These two values are automatically kept in synch. You can change the default MID Server in either location.
