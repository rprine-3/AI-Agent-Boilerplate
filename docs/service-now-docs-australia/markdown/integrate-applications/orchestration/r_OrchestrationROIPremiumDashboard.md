# Orchestration ROI premium reports

The premium dashboard provides detailed reports on calculated savings over time.

The ROI premium reports require the Orchestration - ROI Premium plugin and are built using [Performance Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_PerformanceAnalytics.md). The Orchestration - ROI Premium plugin is dependent on the [Performance Analytics - Premium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_PremiumPerformanceAnalytics.md) plugin which requires a separate subscription.

**Important:** You must activate the Performance Analytics [scheduled collection job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_OrchestrationROIPremiumDashboard.md) before Orchestration ROI premium can display data.

To access the ROI premium dashboard, navigate to **Orchestration** &gt; **ROI Reports** &gt; **Premium Dashboard**.
