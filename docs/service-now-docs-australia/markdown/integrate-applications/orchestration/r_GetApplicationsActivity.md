# Get Applications activity

The Get Applications activity returns a list of all the applications available on a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) server.

The Get Applications activity uses the [Powershell activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAPowershellActivity.md) to access the applications on the SCCM server. The activity is configured to use a MID Server with Powershell capabilities and to run a MID Server script called GetApplications.ps1. This script filters the results of the GET, so that only specific attributes are returned for the applications on the SCCM server. Filtering the results in this manner controls the size of the payload, while providing the most desirable application data. The list of available applications is returned as an array in a JSON object.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\)**.

**Note:** The Get Applications activity does not use a pre-processing script.
