# SSH activity pack

Orchestration provides an activity pack of SSH activities that were customized using the ServiceNow activity designer.

These activities perform the same functions as SSH activities by the same name from previous releases and replace those activities for all new workflows. The custom SSH activities were built with the [Create an SSH activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAnSSHActivity.md), which gives workflow administrators the ability to store input and output variables in the [databus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrationDatabus.md).

**Note:** Existing workflows from earlier versions that were created with legacy SSH activities continue to function normally after an upgrade to Geneva. However, all new workflows must use these custom SSH activities.

To use the SSH custom activities, you must [request activation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_ActivateAnActivityPack.md) of the Orchestration - SSH plugin.
