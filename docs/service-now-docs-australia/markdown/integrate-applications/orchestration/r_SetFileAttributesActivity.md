# Set File Attributes activity

The Set File Attributes activity sets common file attributes, such as timestamps, size, permissions, and UID/GID, for a file or directory on an SFTP server.

A good practice is to use the Get File List activity to return a list of files and their attributes first. Then, when you moved a file from a source host to a target host, use the Set File Attributes activity to set the source file attributes on the target file. This is demonstrated in the [SFTP File Transfer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/r_SFTPWorkflow.md)workflow.
