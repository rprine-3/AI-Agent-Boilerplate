# Add to User Collection activity

The Add to User Collection activity adds a user to a Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) user collection.

The Add to User Collection activity uses the [Powershell activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAPowershellActivity.md) to access the SCCM server. The activity is configured to use a MID Server with Powershell capabilities and to run a MID Server script called AddToUserCollection.ps1 to edit the collection.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\)**.

**Note:** The Add to User Collection activity does not use pre-processing or post processing scripts.
