# Move Address List activity

The Move Address List activity moves a Microsoft Exchange address list to another location in the address hierarchy.

This activity implements the Microsoft Exchange [Move-AddressList](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124520%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx) command.

The Exchange server caches the changes from this activity but does not immediately apply them. Use the [Update Address List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/r_UpdateAddressListActivity.md) activity after this activity to apply the changes or wait for the Exchange server to automatically apply cached changes.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Exchange** &gt; **Address List**.

**Note:** This activity replaces an Exchange activity by the same name available in releases prior to Geneva. If you have a workflow created in a previous version that uses the deprecated activity, your workflow will continue to work normally after upgrading to Geneva. However, all new workflows must use the custom version of this activity. This activity was built with the [PowerShell activity designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_PowershellActivityDesigner.md), which gives workflow administrators the ability to store input and output variables in the [databus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrationDatabus.md).

|whatif|Check box that indicates if the activity should stage the changes without applying them. Use this variable to test your activity settings before using the activity in a live workflow.
