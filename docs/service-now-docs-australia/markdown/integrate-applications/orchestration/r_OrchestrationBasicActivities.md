# Deprecated Orchestration activities

These Orchestration activities have been deprecated.

## Run Probe

The Run Probe activity launches a MID Server probe on behalf of a document. All Orchestration activities that launch a probe on a target machine are based on the Run Probe activity. Your ServiceNow instance must have access to a MID Server configured to use SSH to run this activity.

**Important:** This activity is deprecated and is unavailable for new workflows. To replace the functionality of this probe, use the [Probe activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAProbeActivity.md) to create a custom activity. Workflows from a previous release that use the Run Probe activity can continue to do so.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Probe|Select a MID Server probe from the list. This is the name of the probe as it appears in the discovery\_probes table.|
|Source for probe|Enter the IP address of the host system against which the probe runs \(the probe's target\).|
|Sensor script|The script to run using the results of the probe. The output from the probe is contained in a variable called *output*. Any error from the probe is contained in a variable called *error*.|

## SOAP Request

The SOAP Request activity executes a SOAP request on a target server.

**Important:** This activity is deprecated and is replaced by the [SOAP Message workflow activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/r_SOAPMessageActivity.md) activity. Workflows from a previous release that use the SOAP Request activity can continue to do so. However, this activity is not available for new workflows.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|SOAP URL|The SOAP endpoint.|
|Username|User name for basic authentication credentials.|
|Password|Password for basic authentication credentials.|
|Envelope Script|Script for setting up parameters for the web service.|
|Sensor Script|The script to execute after the request has been made and a response has been received.|

-   **[Reactivate a deprecated activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_ReactivateDeprecatedActivity.md)**  
Orchestration activities that were converted to activity packs are deprecated for upgraded and new instances but can be reactivated for use in new workflows.
-   **[SOAP Message workflow activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/r_SOAPMessageActivity.md)**  
The **SOAP Message** activity uses SOAP messages defined in the System Web Services plugin and can call the messages using a MID Server.
-   **[Probes used by Orchestration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/r_OrchestrationProbes.md)**  
Certain probes, controlled by MID Servers, perform Orchestration tasks on remote computers, such as restarting a server or creating virtual machines from templates.
-   **[PowerShell activities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrPowerShellActivities.md)**  
PowerShell is built on the Windows .NET Framework and is designed to control and automate the administration of Windows machines and applications.
-   **[SSH activities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrationSSHActivities.md)**  
SSH activities allow workflows to perform operations on Linux and Unix computers.
