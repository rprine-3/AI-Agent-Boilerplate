## Schedule Orchestration ROI calculations for standard reports

The scheduled job that calculates Orchestration ROI standard reports is active by default and controlled by system properties.

### Before you begin

Role required: orchestration\_manager, admin

### About this task

The system provides a default scheduled job called Processing ROI Schedule that allows you to configure when Orchestration calculates the ROI for standard reports. This schedule allows scripting for advanced conditions. To modify the schedule or write a script to run, open Processing ROI Schedule from **System Scheduler** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs** and click **Configure Job Definition**. To execute the schedule directly from the job definition, click **Execute Now**

To control the running of the schedule job with the Orchestration properties.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Orchestration ROI** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  Configure the following properties:

<table id="table_jdv_fvr_3v"><thead><tr><th>

Property

-   **Default**: true


</td></tr><tr><td>

roi.processing.interval

</td><td>

Scheduled ROI processing interval \(hours\). This property sets the repeat interval for the scheduled job that processes savings reports and correlated tasks.-   **Type**: integer
-   **Default**: 24
