# Uninstall Windows App activity

The Uninstall Windows App activity uninstalls an application from a Windows target machine.

The only applications that can be uninstalled using this activity are those that were installed by a Windows Installer.

**Note:** This activity replaces a Powershell activity by the same name available in releases prior to Geneva. If you have a workflow created in a previous version that uses the deprecated activity, your workflow will continue to work normally after upgrading to Geneva. However, all new workflows must use the custom version of this activity. This activity was built with the [Powershell activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateAPowershellActivity.md), which gives workflow administrators the ability to store input and output variables in the [databus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrationDatabus.md).

## Input variables

|Variable|Description|
