# F5 Network Management activity pack

Orchestration provides custom activities for configuring elements of an F5 load balancer, including pools, pool members, and the virtual servers contained in the pool.

All F5 custom activities are in the F5 Network Management Application [Application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationScope.md) and are activated by the Orchestration - F5 network management plugin, which must be [activated by request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_ActivateAnActivityPack.md).

ServiceNow provides custom F5 activities, built from the [REST web service activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateARESTWebServiceActivity.md), that you can use to perform the following tasks:

-   Add, delete, or verify pools.

-   Add a profile to a virtual server.
-   Configure the virtual server for vlans, irules, pool, and persistence.
