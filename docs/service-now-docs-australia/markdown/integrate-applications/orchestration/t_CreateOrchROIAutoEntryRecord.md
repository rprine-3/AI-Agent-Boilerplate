# Create an Orchestration ROI automation entry record

The ROI automation entry record couples the cost of performing a task with the specific workflow that automates the task, for the purpose of calculating the resulting savings.

## Before you begin

Role required: orchestration\_manager

Before starting this procedure, verify that the appropriate [labor rate cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateOrchROILaborRateCard.md) were created.

## About this task

Use this record to apply a manual hourly rate to a task that is performed automatically by your instance. To determine the savings realized from orchestrating a task, the system can evaluate whether those savings were estimated or calculated.

-   **Estimated savings**: Uses the labor rate, the time estimates for completion of the task, and the number of automations that have been run to determine savings.
-   **Calculated savings**: Uses the labor rate, the time calculated for completion of the task, based on the configured evaluation period, and the number of automations that have been run to determine savings.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Orchestration** &gt; **ROI** &gt; **Automation Entry Form**.

2.  Fill in the fields on the form, as appropriate.

<table id="table_t5v_xcs_ps"><thead><tr><th>

</table>3.  Select one of these submission options:

    -   **Submit**: Saves the record to the table without running any calculations.
    -   **Submit and process now**: Saves the record and calculates the savings based on the hourly rate and the number of workflow contexts for this automation entry.
