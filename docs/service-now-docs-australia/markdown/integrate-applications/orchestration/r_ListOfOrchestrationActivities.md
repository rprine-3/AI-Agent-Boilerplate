# List of Orchestration activities

Use Orchestration activities in a Workflow to integrate with third-party systems.

Several Orchestration activities have been rewritten as [Application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationScope.md) activities using the [activity designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_WorkflowActivityDesigner.md) and grouped into [activity packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrationActivityPacks.md). Other non-scoped activities are deprecated and may or may not appear in the Workflow Editor. However, all deprecated activities still function in existing workflows that use them.
