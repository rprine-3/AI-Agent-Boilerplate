# Is AD Account Locked activity

The Is AD Account Locked activity determines whether an Active Directory user account is locked.

An account may be locked automatically if a user enters an incorrect password more times than allowed by the Active Directory security policy. You can unlock an account using the [Unlock AD User Account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_OrchActiveDirectoryActivities.md) activity.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Active Directory**.

**Note:** This activity replaces an AD activity by the same name available in prior releases. If you have a workflow that uses the deprecated activity, your workflow will continue to work normally after upgrading to Instanbul. However, all new workflows must use the custom version of this activity, which was built with the [PowerShell activity designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_PowershellActivityDesigner.md).
