# Publish a custom activity

When a user creates a custom activity and saves or submits it, that activity appears in the **Custom** and **Packs** tabs of the designer palette, but is visible only to the user who created it.

## Before you begin

Roles required: admin, activity\_admin, activity\_creator

## Procedure

1.  When you finish configuring the activity, click **Publish**.

    This makes the activity accessible to other users on the instance with the workflow\_admin or activity\_creator role. Published activities are available for upload to the ServiceNow Store, can be added to workflows, and can be edited by any user with the proper roles.

2.  To edit a published activity, click **Checkout**.

    When an activity is checked out by a user, only that user can modify it. The fields of a checked out activity are read-only for all other users.

3.  When you are finished editing the checked out activity, publish it again.

    The system adds a new version of this activity to the **Custom** tab in the Workflow Editor palette.

    **Note:** Activities you create and publish are visible in the **Packs** tab only if they were created in the current application scope.
