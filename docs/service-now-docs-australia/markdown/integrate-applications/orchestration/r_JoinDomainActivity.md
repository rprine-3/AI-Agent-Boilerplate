# Join Domain activity

The Join Domain activity joins a Windows computer to a domain.

If the computer is already a member of a domain, this activity completes without modifying the computer. Joining a domain requires a username and password. This user must have domain administration privileges or privileges to join a computer to the domain.

**Note:** This activity replaces a Powershell activity by the same name available in releases prior to Geneva. If you have a workflow created in a previous version that uses the deprecated activity, your workflow will continue to work normally after upgrading to Geneva. However, all new workflows must use the custom version of this activity. This activity was built with the [PowerShell activity designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_PowershellActivityDesigner.md), which gives workflow administrators the ability to store input and output variables in the [databus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_OrchestrationDatabus.md).
