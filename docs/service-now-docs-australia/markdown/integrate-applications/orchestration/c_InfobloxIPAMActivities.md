# Infoblox IPAM activities

The Infoblox IPAM activities manage IP addresses in your network using an Infoblox DDI Grid Server.

Use these activities to register, reserve, list, or delete IP addresses.

**Parent Topic:**[Infoblox DDI activity pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_InfobloxDDIActivityPack.md)

## IPAM Register IP Address activity

The IPAM Register IP Address activity registers an IP address in a network using Infoblox IPAM.

The output of this activity produces an InfoBlox IP address record that can be used for other IPAM functions in the format `fixedaddress/<encrypted key>:<reserved ip address>/<view>`.

The IPAM activities use the [REST web service activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateARESTWebServiceActivity.md) to manage IP addresses using an Infoblox DDI Grid Server. These activities are configured to use a MID Server with REST capabilities.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Infoblox DDI** &gt; **IPAM**.
