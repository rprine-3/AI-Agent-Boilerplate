# Request client software distribution

Client software distribution requires the Orchestration - Client Software Distribution plugin \(com.snc.orchestration.client\_sf\_distribution\), which is available by request with a subscription to Orchestration.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Orchestration - Client Software Distribution plugin activates the [Orchestration - System Center Configuration Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_ActivateSysCentrConfigMgrActiv.md) plugin that contains the custom SCCM activities used to deploy or revoke software using an SCCM server. For additional plugin dependencies, see [Plugins installed with client software distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/r_IWClientSWDist.md).

**Note:** The Orchestration - Client Software Distribution plugin runs in its own application scope.
