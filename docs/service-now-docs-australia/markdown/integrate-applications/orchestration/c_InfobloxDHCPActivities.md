# Infoblox DHCP activities

The Infoblox DHCP activities manage the IP addresses reserved for DHCP in your network.

Use these activities to reserve, list, or delete IP addresses that are used for DHCP assignment in your network.

**Parent Topic:**[Infoblox DDI activity pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/c_InfobloxDDIActivityPack.md)

## DHCP Reserve IP v4 Address Range activity

The DHCP Reserve IP v4 Address Range activity reserves an IP address range for DHCP use.

The DHCP activities use the [REST web service activity template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/orchestration/t_CreateARESTWebServiceActivity.md) to manage IP addresses using an Infoblox DDI Grid Server. These activities are configured to use a MID Server with REST capabilities.

To access this activity in the Workflow Editor, select the **Custom** tab, and then navigate to **Custom Activities** &gt; **Infoblox DDI** &gt; **DHCP**.

## DHCP Delete IP Reservation activity

The DHCP Delete IP Reservation activity deletes IP reservations in DHCP using either an IPv4 or IPv6 address range.

An automation can obtain an Infoblox DHCP object to delete from either of these activities:
