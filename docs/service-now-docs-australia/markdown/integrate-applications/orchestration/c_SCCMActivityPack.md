# SCCM activity pack

The Microsoft System Center Configuration Management \(SCCM\) activity pack provides Orchestration activities you can use to manage software deployments and collections on an SCCM server.

You can use SCCM Orchestration activities to deploy and revoke software from an SCCM server or manage user and device collections. The system manages software on an SCCM server using Orchestration activities and workflows.

Client software distribution requires:

-   SCCM 2012 R2 and later.
-   Powershell 3.x.
-   Powershell Remoting enabled.
-   The Windows PowerShell x86 execution policy must be set to unrestricted mode.
-   Latest version of the SCCM **cmdlet** library installed on the SCCM server.
-   Use the credentials to log onto the SCCM Server and connect via Windows PowerShell from the System Center Configuration Manager console at least once to set the path variable for that credential.
