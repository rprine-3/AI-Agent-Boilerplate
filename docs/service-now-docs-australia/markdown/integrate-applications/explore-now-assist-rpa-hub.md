# AI in RPA Hub

Use ServiceNow Otto for RPA Hub to accelerate automation development with AI. Instead of writing code or configuring workflows manually, you can describe what you need in natural language and AI generates automations, activities, and logic rules. You can preview generated code before deploying, ensuring it meets your requirements.

## ServiceNow Otto for RPA Hub overview

The ServiceNow Otto for RPA Hub application offers generative AI capabilities to accelerate your automation development process. The following generative AI capabilities are available in the RPA Desktop Design Studio application:

-   Build simple, brand-new automations quickly and efficiently.
-   Easily add new activities to existing automations, ensuring modularity and scalability.
-   Enhance the automation logic with text instructions, either in an empty activity or by selecting a component in an existing one.

Both new and experienced users can develop and build faster automation by using the ServiceNow Otto for RPA Hub application.

## Generative AI skills

The RPA bot generation skill helps users to build an automation that is based on text input. Access the RPA bot generation skill from the RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface.

For more information, see [Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\) bot generation skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/rpa-bot-generation.md).

## How to use the RPA bot generation skill

By using the RPA bot generation skill, your users can perform the following tasks:

-   **Create an automation with AI**

    Create an automation from text instructions and preview the options from the RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface. First, your user selects the **Create automation** option and then selects the **Build with AI** option to get started. For more information, see [Create an automation with AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-automation-now-assist.md).

    The following example shows how an automation is created with AI in the RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface.

    \[Omitted image "build-now-assist-screen-rpa.png"\] Alt text: RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface that shows the \(1\) Create automation option and \(2\) Build with AI option.

-   **Create an activity with AI**

    Create an activity from the text instructions and preview options. For more information, see [Create an activity with AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-activity-now-assist.md).

    The following example shows how an activity is created with AI in the RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface.

    \[Omitted image "create-activity-now-assist-rpa.png"\] Alt text: RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface that shows the New activity by using AI option.

-   **Extend automation logic with AI**

    Enhance an automation logic by using text instructions with the **Build automation** option, either from an empty activity or by selecting a component in an existing activity. For more information, see [Build an automation with AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/build-automation-now-assist.md).

    The following example shows an automation logic that is built with AI from an empty activity on the design surface in the RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface.

    \[Omitted image "canvas-level-inline-prompt.png"\] Alt text: RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface that shows the Build automation option from an empty activity on the design surface.

    The following example shows an automation logic that is built with AI by selecting a component in the RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface.

    \[Omitted image "comp-level-inline-prompt-example.png"\] Alt text: RPA Desktop Design Studio user interface that shows the Build automation option after a component is selected, for example, Start.


## Licensing requirements

## AI limitations

This application uses artificial intelligence \(AI\) and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study that generate predictions based on patterns in data. As a result, this application may not always produce accurate, complete, or appropriate information. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this application has been fully trained or tested for your use case. To mitigate these issues, it is your responsibility to test and evaluate your use of this application for accuracy, harm, and appropriateness for your use case, employ human oversight of output, and refrain from relying solely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making purposes. This is especially important if you choose to deploy this application in areas with consequential impacts such as healthcare, finance, legal, employment, security, or infrastructure. You agree to abide by [ServiceNow’s AI Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.servicenow.com/ai-acceptable-use-policy.html), which may be updated by ServiceNow.

## Data processing

This application requires data to be transferred from ServiceNow customers' individual instances to a centralized ServiceNow environment, which may be located in a different data center region from the one where your instance is, and potentially to a third-party cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure. This data is handled per ServiceNow's internal policies and procedures, including our policies available through our [CORE Compliance Portal](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0564067).

## Data collection

ServiceNow collects and uses the inputs, outputs, and edits to outputs of this application to develop and improve ServiceNow technologies including ServiceNow models and AI products. Customers can opt out of future data collection at any time, as described in the [AI Opt-Out page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/opt-out-of-data-sharing-for-now-assist.md).

**Note:** We have controls in place to enable/disable the data collection and data processing.
