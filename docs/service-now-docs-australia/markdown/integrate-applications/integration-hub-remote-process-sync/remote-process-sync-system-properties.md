</td><td>

Number of seconds that records in the error state can exist in the inbound queue before they expire. The system purges expired records from the queue once a day.**Important:** Records in the error state have not been processed. Review and fix the process definition and its related records. To reprocess records in the inbound queue, set the state to Ready. To ignore these records, set the state to skipped.
