# Look Up Correlation by Local Record action

Look up an active correlation by a specified local record sys\_id. The local record is the record the correlation synchronizes on the local instance. Remote Process Sync actions and flows use the returned correlation to synchronize a local record with a record on a remote system.

## Roles and availability

Available as a ServiceNow Core Remote Process Sync action.

-   **Subscription requirements**

    This action requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Request Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/request-ih-overview.md) and [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

-   **Remote System**

    Data type: **Record**

    Reference to the Process Sync Remote System record for the remote instance you are synchronizing processes with. This record identifies the instance that receives outbound synchronization changes or that sent inbound synchronization changes.

    Data type: **Record**

    Reference to a record on the local instance you are synchronizing with another instance. The data pill contains all the field values for the specified record. For example, a case record on the local instance.


## Outputs

These outputs appear in the Data panel. You can use them as inputs elsewhere in your flow.

-   **Correlation Detail**

    Data type: **Object**

    Object containing correlation information about a record. The object identifies the local and remote correlation IDs associated with a local record.

    Data type: **String**

    Status code returned by the action.
