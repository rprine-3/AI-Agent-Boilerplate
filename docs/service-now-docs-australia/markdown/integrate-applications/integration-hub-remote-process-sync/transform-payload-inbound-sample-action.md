-   **Payload**

    Data type: **String**

    Portion of a JSON payload you want to use to generate an object structure. Select the elements of the JSON structure you want to map to elements of an object structure.


## Outputs

These outputs appear in the Data panel. You can use them as inputs elsewhere in your flow.

-   **Capture Metadata**

    Data type: **Object**

    Object containing information about the capture definition that created the payload.

-   **Changed Fields**

    Data type: **Dynamic Object**

    Object containing information about the field value changes. The system uses these changes to synchronize correlation and local records.

-   **Attachment Metadata**

    Data type: **Array of Object**

    Array containing information about the attachments to synchronize.
