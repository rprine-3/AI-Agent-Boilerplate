## Roles and availability

Available as a ServiceNow Core Remote Process Sync action.

-   **Subscription requirements**

    This action requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Request Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/request-ih-overview.md) and [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Retry policy

The Get Attachment Metadata for Local Record action uses the RPS Push Attachment Policy to retry failed requests at regular intervals. To view or edit this policy, navigate to the Retry Policies \[sys\_retry\_policy\] table at **All** &gt; **IntegrationHub** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Retry Policies**.

## Inputs

Provide a value for each input that your action needs. To add dynamic values, you can also drag pills from the Data panel or select them from the pill picker.

-   **Local Record**

    Data type: **Record**

    Reference to a record on the local instance you are synchronizing with another instance. The data pill contains all the field values for the specified record. For example, a case record on the local instance.

-   **Strategy**

    Data type: **Choice**

    Level of attachment detail to gather. The available options are All or Deltas. Use the All option to gather all synchronized attachments. Use the Deltas option to gather only attachments that have changed since the last synchronization.

-   **Remote System**

    Data type: **Record**

    Reference to the Process Sync Remote System record for the remote instance you are synchronizing processes with. This record identifies the instance that receives outbound synchronization changes or that sent inbound synchronization changes.

-   **Correlation Detail**

    Data type: **Object**

    Object containing correlation information about a synchronized record. The object identifies the local and remote correlation IDs associated with a local record.

-   **Attachments**

    Data type: **Array of Objects**

    Array containing a list of attachment objects to evaluate.

-   **Max Attachment Size \(MB\)**

    Data type: **Integer**

    Integer specifying the maximum uncompressed attachment size that can be included in the list of attachments, in megabytes.

    You can use this field to limit attachment sizes and avoid errors that may result from syncing very large attachments.

    Leave this field blank to use the platform limit for attachment sizes.

-   **Allowed Extensions**

    Data type: **List**

    List containing the attachment extensions that can be included in the list of attachments. Leave this field blank to use the platform restrictions.


## Outputs

These outputs appear in the Data panel. You can use them as inputs elsewhere in your flow.

Attachments: Data type: **Array of Objects**

Array containing information about the attachments to synchronize.
