# Build your first Remote Process Sync integration

Step through an example of how to build a Remote Process Sync integration in order to link the automated processes of two ServiceNow® instances together.

## Before you begin

-   Activate Remote Process Sync on each instance in your integration by purchasing the Integration Hub Enterprise package. For more information, see [Request Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/request-ih-overview.md).
-   Activate the explicit roles security feature on each instance in your integration. For more information, see Explicit Role plugin.
-   Learn about how to build and manage an Integration Hub Remote Process Sync integration by checking out [Getting started with Remote Process Sync](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub-remote-process-sync/getting-started-with-remote-process-sync.md).
-   Confirm the instances that you will link together in the following example are not production instances. It is recommended to test this example on sub-production instances only in order to avoid overwriting any important data on either instance. You might also want to use a [Personal Developer Instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guides/sandiego/now-platform/pdi-guide/personal-developer-instance-guide-introduction) for testing this example integration.
-   Confirm that you do not have any existing business rules, workflows, or Workflow Studio flows whose logic will conflict with the flows we will create in the following example.
-   Role required: admin

## About this task

In the following example, you will step through how to link two ServiceNow instances' automated processes together. The use case for this example is that a customer creates requests for hardware that are fulfilled by a vendor. We will refer to the customer's instance as Instance A, and the vendor's instance as Instance B. We will start by setting up credentials in each instance that can access the remote instance. We will also create a user in each instance that can run the outbound and inbound flows.

## Procedure

1.  In Instance A, ensure that your domain is set to `global`, and then navigate to **System Security** &gt; **Users and Groups** &gt; **Users**.

2.  Select **New** to open a new User form view, and then fill in the following fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |User ID|Enter `rps.api.instance.a`|
    |First name|Enter `RPS API User for Instance A`|

    Select **Save**.

3.  While still on the User form, select **Set Password** to set a password.

    For details, see steps four and five in [Configure password for a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/reset-your-password.md).

4.  [Reset the password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_EnrollInPasswordReset.md) for RPS API User for Instance A.

    We have successfully set up how our Remote Process Sync integration will trigger, and which fields will be captured and sent to either remote instance. In this final section, we will customize the inbound flows in Workflow Studio so that they properly transform inbound data.

38. In Instance B, navigate to **IntegrationHub** &gt; **Remote Process Sync** &gt; **Process Sync Definitions**, and then select the `Hardware Fulfillment Process` record from the list.

39. Make a copy of the `Remote Process Sync Inbound Flow Template - Basic` record.

    1.  Navigate to Workflow Studio and select the Subflows tab.

    2.  Filter the **Name** column to locate the `Remote Process Sync Inbound Flow Template - Basic` record and select it.

    3.  In the subflow, select the More Actions menu, then select **Copy subflow**.

40. In the subflow, update the Payload.

    1.  Expand the `Transform Payload from Inbound Sample` action.

    2.  In the Sample Payload field, enter the following sample payload:

        ```
        {"capture_metadata":{"changed_by":"admin","timestamp":"2020-09-24 19:26:59"},
        "changed_fields":[

    1.  Navigate to Workflow Studio and select the Subflows tab.

    2.  Filter the **Name** column to locate the `Remote Process Sync Inbound Flow Template - Basic` record and select it.

    3.  In the subflow, select the More Actions menu, then select **Copy subflow**.

47. In the subflow, update the Payload.

    1.  Expand the `Transform Payload from Inbound Sample` action.

    2.  In the Sample Payload field, enter the following sample payload:

        ```
        {"capture_metadata":{"changed_by":"admin","timestamp":"2020-10-26 14:18:45"},
        "changed_fields":[
          {"display_value":"","value":"incident","key":"sys_class_name"},

## Result

We've finished building our Remote Process Sync integration. The integration will now trigger whenever a user creates an Incident record with the Hardware assignment group in Incident A. When this happens:

-   The fields specified in Instance A's Capture Definition are captured and stored in a local record.
-   The local record is correlated with a remote record in Instance B.
-   The captured fields are mapped to the fields we specified in Instance B's Inbound Flow.

Then, when a user resolves the correlated Incident record in Instance B:

-   The fields specified in Instance B's Capture Definition are captured and stored in a local record.
-   The local record is correlated with the remote record in Instance A.
-   The captured fields are mapped to the fields we specified in Instance A's Inbound Flow.

## What to do next

Test out your Remote Process Sync integration by creating an Incident record in Instance A with the Hardware assignment group. Then, resolve the correlated Incident record in Instance B. If your correlated records don't sync as expected, check your Inbound API User's credentials and Process Sync Definition configuration in each Instance. If you continue to experience issues with your example integration, refer to [Monitoring and troubleshooting your integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub-remote-process-sync/getting-started-with-remote-process-sync.md).
