# Set up the Microsoft Azure DevOps Boards spoke using personal access token

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Azure DevOps Boards using basic authentication to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Azure DevOps Boards spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## About this task

If you want to use different connections in your flow, subflows, and actions, create the child alias and select the default alias record as its parent. To configure the child alias, perform the same steps that are needed to configure the parent alias. Depending on your requirement and set up, you can choose either the parent alias or child alias in your flow, subflows, and actions.

You can also use multiple Azure DevOps accounts. In this case, you should provide the respective **Password** while configuring the credential record and specify the relevant **Connection URL** while configuring the connection record.

## Obtain the personal access token

Authenticate Azure DevOps Boards by using the personal access tokens.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Log in to your Azure DevOps portal as an admin.

2.  Navigate to **User Settings** &gt; **Personal access tokens**.

    \[Omitted image "pat-devops.png"\] Alt text: Generate personal access token.
