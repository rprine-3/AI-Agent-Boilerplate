# ServiceNow Remote Instance Spoke

Integrate your local and remote ServiceNow instances to export, import, and manage records from your local instance.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription on the local instance where it will be installed. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

ServiceNow Remote Instance spoke v2.3.2 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [ServiceNow Remote Instance spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-sn-remote-instance.html).

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for the Orlando version and later.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Outputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_outputs\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke requirements

Ensure that the spoke users have only the required minimum permissions to access data in ServiceNow tables. Do not assign elevated privilege roles to users of this spoke unless very much required. This practice ensures controlled access to data.

**Note:** The terms remote instance and local instance are used in these contexts:

-   Local instance: This is the ServiceNow instance from which the communication is initiated and established.
-   Remote instance: This is the ServiceNow instance with which the local instance communicates.

## Spoke actions

The ServiceNow Remote Instance spoke provides actions to export, import, and manage records when events occurs in your local ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

</table>**Note:** The **Company** field is required to import or export records using the default transform maps. However, users can modify the transform maps as per their requirement. Also, use the import sets when working with integration involving data transfer.

## Spoke user role

The ServiceNow Remote Instance spoke provides the Remote Instance Admin \(sn\_now\_remote\_spk.Remote Instance Admin\) role that provides administrative rights for all tables that are avaiable with the ServiceNow Remote Instance spoke.

## Spoke transform maps

The ServiceNow Remote Instance spoke provides sample transform maps in active state and associated sample target tables to demonstrate using transform maps to save the remote ServiceNow instance data in your local ServiceNow tables. You can use these sample transform maps and target tables as reference to create transform maps as per your requirement.

For more information, see [Transform maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/system-import-sets/c_CreatingNewTransformMaps.md).

**Note:**

-   By default, the sample transform maps uses **sys\_id** as the coalesce field. You can customise the transform map script as per your requirement to change the coalesce field.
-   By default, the export and import actions use the spoke tables. You can change this to use different import sets.
-   The time zones may be different in your ServiceNow instances. Ensure that you customise flows accordingly.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

Two connection and credential aliases are required for this spoke; one for the local instance and other for the remote instance. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the ServiceNow Remote Instance spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-rem-instance.md).
