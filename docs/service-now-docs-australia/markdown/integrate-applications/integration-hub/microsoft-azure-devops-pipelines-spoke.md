## Supported versions

## Spoke requirements

-   Spoke dependencies are installed
-   Personal access token is generated on Azure DevOps
-   Microsoft Azure DevOps Pipelines alias is set up on your ServiceNow instance
-   Microsoft Azure DevOps Pipelines spoke plugin is installed on your ServiceNow instance

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream​
-   com.glide.hub.integration.runtime​
-   com.glide.cobject​
-   com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest​

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Spoke actions

The Microsoft Azure DevOps spoke provides actions to automate Azure DevOps Pipelines' tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

**Note:** To execute the actions, you must first set up an outbound integration by configuring the Microsoft Azure DevOps Pipelines spoke connection and credential record.

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Pipeline Management|Look up Pipelines Stream​|Retrieves the details of all pipelines such as ID and name for an Azure DevOps project.|
|Look up Pipeline|Retrieves the details of a pipeline such as the ID and name of the pipeline.|
|Run Management|Run Pipeline​|Runs a pipeline based on the details you specify.|
|Look up Run​|Retrieves details of a run such as name and ID for a pipeline.|
|Look up Runs|Retrieves the list of the top 10000 runs such as name and ID for a pipeline.|
|Log Management|Look up Logs|Retrieves the details of all logs such as URL and signed content for a corresponding pipeline run.|
|Look up Log|Retrieves the details of a log object such as ID and URL for a corresponding pipeline run.|
|Artifact Management|Look up Artifact​|Retrieves an artifact object from a pipeline run.|
|Utility Actions|Attach File to ServiceNow Record​|Attaches the log or artifact file to a ServiceNow record.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
