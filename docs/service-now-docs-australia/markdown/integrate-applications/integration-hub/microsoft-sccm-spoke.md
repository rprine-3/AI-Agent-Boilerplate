The Microsoft System Center Configuration Management \(SCCM\) spoke spoke provides actions to automate SCCM tasks when events occur in the ServiceNow AI Platform. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Application Management|Get Applications|Retrieves the application data from the SCCM server.|
|Deployment Management|Get Deployments|Retrieves deployment data from the SCCM server.|

To see inputs and outputs for these activities, see [SCCM activity pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_SCCMActivityPack.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the SCCM alias record to authorize actions on a Microsoft System Center Configuration Management \(SCCM\) server.

|Connection alias|Description|Connection URL|
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
|SCCM|Connection to the SCCM server.|The URL of the host machine where the SCCM server is installed.|

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Microsoft SCCM spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-sccm.md).

## MID server requirements

To use these actions, your instance must have a MID Server set up and configured to use PowerShell. For more information about running actions on the MID Server, see [Integration steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integration-steps.md). For information, see [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
