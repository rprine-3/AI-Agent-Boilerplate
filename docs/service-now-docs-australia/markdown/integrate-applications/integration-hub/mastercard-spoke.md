# Mastercard Spoke

Integrate your ServiceNow instance with Mastercard’s Mastercom API Suite \(MCOM\) and Mastercom Extended APIs \(MCOM Extended\) to manage the full card dispute lifecycle. Handle tasks such as searching transactions, creating claims, and processing chargebacks, pre-arbitration, and arbitration case filings efficiently.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Mastercard Spoke v3.0.1 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Mastercard Spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-mastercard-spoke.html).

## Supported version

This spoke was built for Mastercom v6.

## Key features

Mastercard Spoke enables a flow designer to build workflows using actions that invoke Mastercomand Mastercom Extended. This includes the ability to:

-   Search transactions
-   Create claims and initiate chargebacks
-   Manage seamless filing of pre-arbitration and arbitration cases
-   Collaborate with merchants to prevent chargebacks
-   Monitor disputes throughout the dispute lifecycle
-   Expedite the end-to-end dispute management process
-   Manage disputes for cleared Single Message System original transactions with Mastercom Extended

**Note:** The Mastercom API \(MCOM\) handles disputes for Dual Message System transactions, while the Mastercom Extended API \(MCOM Extended\) handles disputes for Single Message System transactions, which are primarily PIN debit and ATM transactions \(such as Cirrus and Maestro\). For more information, see the [Mastercard developer documentation](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercom-extended/documentation/support/).

## Spoke requirements

-   Integration Hub subscription
-   Mastercard configuration details such as, certificate, key alias, consumer key, and keystore password

## Spoke dependencies

Ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The Mastercard Spoke provides actions to simplify card dispute resolution. Available actions include:

-   **Actions with sensitive information** - These actions contain sensitive information in the request and response body. When using Mastercom/Mastercom Extended APIs, it is recommended to use a Tokenization solution. This involves using a request builder to securely create requests and a response parser to handle encrypted API responses.

    |--------|------|-----------|
    |Mastercom Chargeback Management|Look up Chargeback Documents Request Builder|Retrieves and parses chargeback-related documents in the required format.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
