# Okta Spoke

Use Okta to manage users, passwords, and groups.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Okta spoke v4.8.3 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Okta Spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-okta.html).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   com.glide.cobject:sys,com.glide.script.vtable
-   com.snc.remote\_directory\_sync

-   Flow Designer Model \(com.glide.hub.designer\_backend.model\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Supported versions

API version v1.

## Spoke flows

The Okta spoke provides sample flows in the draft state to demonstrate automating user and group management tasks. To customize a sample flow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample flows include:

|Flow|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Add User to Okta Group|When a user is created, it adds the user to the specified group.|
|Onboard User in Okta|When a user is created in ServiceNow, creates and activates the user in Okta.|
|Remove Okta Group Membership on Deactivation|When a user is deactivated, it removes the user from all Okta groups.|

**Note:** Okta has the ServiceNow\_UD application to provision users in ServiceNow. ServiceNow can also be configured to provision users at Okta. Therefore, ServiceNow administrators must confirm that circular user creation doesn’t occur.

## Spoke subflows

For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Conversational Spokes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conv-spokes-na.md).

Available conversation action is Create Group that creates a group in Okta with the provided details.

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Okta group management AI agent|Automates group-related tasks in Okta using Integration Hub such as those related to managing of groups, handling user memberships, and retrieving group details.|
|Okta password management AI agent|Automates password-related workflows in Okta from Integration Hub. Automate actions such as reset password to temporary values, set new password, expire passwords, unlock user accounts, reset user authentication factors, and change user passwords.|
|Okta group membership management AI agent|Automates group-related workflows in Okta from Integration Hub. Automate actions such as Look up User Groups Stream’, and 'Look up Group Members Stream'.|
|Okta user management AI agent|Automates user management workflows in Okta from Integration Hub. Automate actions such as manage user accounts, sessions, and statuses.|
|Okta application access management AI agent|Automates access management workflows in Okta from Integration Hub. Automate actions such as look up users and groups by application ID stream, and revoking user application access.|
|Okta application management AI agent|Automates application management-related workflows in Okta from Integration Hub. Automate actions such as look up applications, retrieve application details by ID, and create or update Okta application records.|
|Okta logs management AI agent|Automates log management-related workflows in Okta from Integration Hub. Automate actions such as 'Look up Okta Logs Stream’.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Okta account requirements

The Okta spoke requires generating and configuring your Okta account to use a web API key.

## Credential and connection alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

This spoke uses the Okta Connection &amp; Credential Alias record to authorize actions. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Okta spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-okta-v1.1.1.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls that can run either on an instance or, optionally, through a MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the Okta alias to configure where actions run and, if needed, specify MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
