## Supported versions

This spoke was built for the Microsoft Intune Application programming Interface \(API\) version v1, but may be compatible with the later versions.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   [Microsoft Entra ID Spoke \(formerly Microsoft Azure Active Directory spoke\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/microsoft-azure-ad-spoke.md)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation. For more information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Spoke subflows

|Create Software Configuration|Enables a CSD agent to create the software configuration record of the specified Microsoft Intune application.|
|Configure Group|Enables a CSD agent to create and configure the Microsoft Intune group in Intune Admin Portal.|
|Deploy Application|Adds the provided user or device to a group in the Microsoft Intune server.|
|Discover and Store Data|Discovers the data from the Microsoft Intune server and updates the records in the Application \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_application\], Group \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_group\], and Deployment \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_deployment\] tables.|
|Look up Application Details|Retrieves the additional deployment details for applications and updates the respective records in the deployment table.|

</table>## Spoke module

The Microsoft Intune spoke adds the Microsoft Intune application to your instance and includes these modules:

|Module|Description|Table|
|------|-----------|-----|
|Applications|Displays the list of applications from the Microsoft Intune server.|Application \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_application\]|
|Groups|Displays the list of groups from the Microsoft Intune server.|Group \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_group\]|
|Configurations|Stores software configuration details for the applications.|Configuration \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_sf\_config\]|
|Deployments|Displays the list of deployments on the Microsoft Intune server.|Deployment \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_deployment\]|
|Server Instances|Stores details of the provider servers.|Server Instance \[sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke\_server\]|

**Important:** To use these modules and tables, install the [Client Software Distribution 2.0 application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd-app-2.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Microsoft Intune spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ms-intune.md).
