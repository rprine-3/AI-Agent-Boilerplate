# Create licenses for distributed software using CSD 2.0

Licenses are associated with the software model and must be created if you want to track the license for software deployed by CSD 2.0.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_csd.CSD Admin

You can create software licenses in CSD 2.0 for software items deployed from the service catalog by CSD 2.0. CSD 2.0 depends on the allocations available to determine if the license is available for the requested software. If **Allocations Available** is greater than `0`, CSD 2.0 assumes that the license is available for the software.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Client Software Distribution 2.0** &gt; **Software Entitlements**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill these values.

<table id="table_f41_jqh_fsb"><thead><tr><th>

-   For Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager:
    -   If **Install Collection** specified in **Software Configuration** \(that is linked with catalog item\) is of type **Device**, the license check is performed on software entitlements with **Allocation Type** as **Device**.​
    -   If **Install Collection** specified in **Software Configuration** \(that is linked with catalog item\) is of type **User**, the license check is performed on software entitlements with **Allocation Type** as **User**.
-   For :
    -   If **Group** specified in **Software Configuration** \(that is linked with catalog item\) is of type **Mobile** or **Computer**, the license check is performed on software entitlements with **Allocation Type** as **Device**.
    -   If **Group** specified in **Software Configuration** \(that is linked with catalog item\) is of type **User**, the license check is performed on software entitlements with **Allocation Type** as **User**.

    The license is created with the required rights.
