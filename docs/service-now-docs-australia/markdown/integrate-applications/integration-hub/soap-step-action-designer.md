# SOAP step

Enable action designers to send outbound SOAP web service requests to external systems.

**Note:** SOAP step is not available in the base system and requires the ServiceNow® Integration Hub subscription. After the required plugin is activated, the step is visible under Integrations.

## Roles and availability

-   Available as an Workflow Studio action step. Users with the action\_designer role can create a custom action with one or more action steps.
-   Action designers need the web\_service\_admin role to perform these web services tasks.
    -   Select WSDL
    -   Load new WSDL
    -   Select a WS-Security policy

## Fields

<table id="table_ndq_3kp_2fb"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">

Connection Details

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connection

</td><td>

The type of connection to use. -   **Define Connection Inline**: Define connection information within the action step.
-   **Use Connection Alias**: Define connection information using the Connection Alias table. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action.

 To learn more about connections and credentials, see [Introduction to credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connection Alias

</td><td>

Connection &amp; Credential alias record that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. **Note:** This field is available when **Use Connection Alias** is selected from the Connection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Credential Alias

</td><td>

Credential alias that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the credential information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. **Note:** This field is available when **Define Connection Inline** is selected from the Connection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use MID

</td><td>

Option to use a MID Server to run the SOAP step. Select this check box to display the **MID Selection**,**MID Application**, and **Capabilities** fields.**Note:** This field is available when **Use Connection Alias** is selected from the Connection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Endpoint

</td><td>

The URL endpoint for the SOAP request. If **Use Connection Alias** is selected, this field is read-only and displays the endpoint URL associated with alias. If **Define Connection Inline** is selected, enter an endpoint URL for the connection.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Test SOAP Step

</td><td>

Button to test the SOAP step. To test, select the **Test SOAP Step** button. Enter any required input values and select the **Run Test** button. After the test runs, any step outputs or error messages are displayed in the Test Results section of the test window.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connection Timeout

</td><td>

Number of milliseconds the system waits for a successful host connection. If the step does not make a successful connection during this time, the connection request times out. If **Define Connection Inline** is selected, enter a timeout value for the connection. Leave this field empty to use the system default connection timeout value.

**Note:** Avoid setting the **Connection Timeout** value to zero, as this may cause a stale connection.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Selection

</td><td>

Option to select a specific MID Server or MID Cluster. Choose any one of the following options. -   **Auto-Select MID Server**: Your ServiceNow instance selects the MID Server without manual input.
-   **Specific MID Server**: Your ServiceNow instance uses MID Server that you specify.
-   **Specific MID Cluster**: Your ServiceNow instance uses the MID Cluster that you specify.

A MID Cluster is a group of MID Servers that enables your ServiceNow instance to handle multiple integrations, and improve integration speed. For more information, see [Configure a MID Server cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureAMIDServerCluster.md).


 This field is available when **Define Connection Inline** is selected from the Connection list, and **Use MID** is checked.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Cluster

</td><td>

Data pill for the MID Cluster you want to use. This field is available when **Define Connection Inline** is selected from the Connection list, **Use MID** is checked, and **Specific MID Cluster** is selected from the MID Selection list.

</table>## Action error evaluation

-   **If this step fails**

    Data type: **Choice**

    Option to continue running the next step or go to error evaluation. To use the step status code or message for a custom action error condition, see [Action error evaluation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/action-error-evaluation.md).


## SOAP response size limit

The system limits the size of SOAP responses to 5 MB. Direct SOAP responses that exceed this limit generate an error. To support larger response sizes, increase the response size limit with the **glide.pf.soap.response\_payload\_max\_size** system property. This system property supports a maximum value of 10 MB.
