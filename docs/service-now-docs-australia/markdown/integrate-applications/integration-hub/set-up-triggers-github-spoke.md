5.  Select **Configure**.

6.  In the User field, select the user name on whose behalf the inbound session or flow is triggered.

7.  Select **Generate secret** to generate the secret.

    The secret is used to sign the payload of the webhook. You must configure the secret on GitHub.

    The secret is generated on the Secret field.
