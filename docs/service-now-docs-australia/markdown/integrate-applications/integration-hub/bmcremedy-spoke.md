## Spoke modules

The BMC Remedy spoke adds a BMC Remedy application to your instance and includes these modules:

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Credentials|Credential records for the BMC Remedy spoke can be accessed here.|
|Objects|Information about the objects in BMC Remedy can be accessed here. You can also create an object that can be used in your flows. See [Create a BMC Remedy object in your ServiceNow instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/create-obj-bmc.md) for information about creating an object.|

## Spoke user roles

The Remedy\_Admin \(sn\_bmcremedy\_spoke.Remedy\_Admin\) is available when the BMC Remedy spoke is installed. Users with role can view and create objects in the Objects module.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

Two aliases are available when you install the BMC Remedy spoke; one alias is of the **Connection and Credential** type and the other alias is of the **Credential** type. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the BMC Remedy spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-bmc.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls that can run either on an instance or, optionally, through a MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the BMC Remedy alias to configure where actions run and, if needed, specify MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
