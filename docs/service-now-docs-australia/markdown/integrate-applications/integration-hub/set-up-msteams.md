# Set up the Microsoft Teams Graph spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Microsoft Teams account by creating a custom OAuth application in Microsoft Azure portal to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Microsoft Teams Graph spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## Register an application using the Microsoft Azure portal

Provide authorization to the ServiceNow instance by registering an application in Microsoft Entra ID \(formerly Microsoft Azure Active Directory\).

### Before you begin

Role required: Microsoft Entra ID admin

### About this task

Complete these steps from the Microsoft Azure portal.

### Procedure

1.  In the Microsoft Azure portal, copy and record the **Directory ID** for later use.

    For more information, see [Get tenant and app ID values for signing in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-and-app-id-values-for-signing-in) in [Microsoft Entra ID documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/).

2.  Register your application in Azure portal. For instructions on registering an application, see [Tutorial: Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory) in the [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/).

3.  Copy and record the **Application ID** for later use.

4.  Add the **Redirect URL** in this format: `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`.

    For more information, see [Authentication and authorization for Azure Time Series Insights API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-authentication-and-authorization) in [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/).

5.  For the **Required Permissions**, select **Microsoft Graph**.

    For more information, see [Permissions and consent in the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) in [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/).

    For information about the permissions required to use the spoke actions, see the Spoke actions section in [Microsoft Teams Graph Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/msteams-spoke.md). Provide permissions as per your requirement. For more information about the permissions, see [Microsoft Graph REST API v1.0 reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) in [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/).

6.  Record the **Client Secret** for use in later configurations.


### Result

The ServiceNow application is created with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Configure connections for the Microsoft Teams Graph spoke

Add and configure the Microsoft Teams connections to authenticate ServiceNow requests in the Microsoft Teams Graph spoke.

### Before you begin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Select the **Integrations** tab.

3.  Under **Connections**, toggle and enable the **Outbound** connections.
