# Request client software distribution

Client software distribution requires the Orchestration - Client Software Distribution plugin \(com.snc.orchestration.client\_sf\_distribution\), which is available by request with a subscription to Integration Hub.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Client Software Distribution plugin activates the System Center Configuration Manager plugin that contains the [Microsoft SCCM spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/microsoft-sccm-spoke.md) actions to deploy or revoke software using an SCCM server. For additional plugin dependencies, see [Plugins installed with client software distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd-installed-plugins.md).

**Note:** The Client Software Distribution plugin runs in its own application scope.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Plugins**.
