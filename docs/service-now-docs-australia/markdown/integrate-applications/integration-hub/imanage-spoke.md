# iManage Spoke

Automate document, folder, workspace, and user management while enabling seamless collaboration within iManage. This automation solution facilitates tasks such as creating, downloading, uploading, updating, and removing files on iManage directly from the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

iManage spoke v1.1.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [iManage Spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-imanage-spoke.html).

## Roles

All iManage users are assigned to the predefined Default role. Because the default role is automatically assigned to all users, for security reasons it has limited privileges. The iManage administrator can modify this role's privileges but cannot delete it. Other roles can be created, deleted, or modified as required.

The iManage spoke user \[sn\_imanage\_spk.user\] is available when the iManage spoke is installed. The role is required for users accessing iManage external storage.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow® IntegrationHub Action Step — REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow® IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow® IntegrationHub Action Template — Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Supported versions

iManage Work API \(REST API v2\).

## Spoke actions

iManage provides actions to automate the tasks in the following table when events occur in ServiceNow.

## iManage online account requirements

The iManage spoke requires an iManage work account and access to the iManage Control Center to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up iManage spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-imanage-spoke.md).
