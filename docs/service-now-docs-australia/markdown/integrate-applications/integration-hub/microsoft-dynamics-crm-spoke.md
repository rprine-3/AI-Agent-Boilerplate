</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Microsoft Dynamics CRM record management AI agent|Manages CRM records including deleting, and retrieving the required records.|
|Microsoft Dynamics CRM case management AI agent|Creates case in Microsoft Dynamics CRM and retrieves details of the specified case.|
|Microsoft Dynamics CRM contact management AI agent|Retrieves contact streams and contact details by ID, and creates new contacts.|
|Microsoft Dynamics CRM lead management AI agent|Creates lead in Microsoft Dynamics CRM and retrieves details of the required lead.|
|Microsoft Dynamics CRM account management AI agent|Creates an account in Microsoft Dynamics CRM and retrieves details of the required accounts.|
|Microsoft Dynamics CRM opportunity management AI agent|Creates opportunities, retrieves opportunity details, parses CRM entity data, and manages opportunity streams.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Spoke module

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM spoke adds a Microsoft Dynamics CRM module to your ServiceNow instance. The Opportunities module displays the details of the opportunities.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the Microsoft\_Dynamics\_CRM alias record to authorize actions.

|Connection alias|Description|Connection URL|
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
|Microsoft\_Dynamics\_CRM|Connection to Microsoft Dynamics CRM|URL configured when you create your application in Azure. This URL ends with `dynamics.com`.|

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Microsoft Dynamics CRM spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ms-dynamics-crm.md).
