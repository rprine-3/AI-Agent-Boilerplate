# Set up the SuccessFactors spoke v4.x.x

Integrate the ServiceNow instance with your SuccessFactors instance using OAuth client application and API key.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the SuccessFactors spoke.
-   Enable these system properties:
    -   **glide.pf.rest.response\_payload\_max\_size**: The maximum value is, `10240`.
    -   **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.serialized.val\_size\_limit**: The maximum value is, `16384`.
    -   **com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length**: The maximum value is, `65536`.
-   Role required: admin.

**Note:** This procedure is applicable if you are setting up the SuccessFactors spoke v4.11.1 for the first time. If you are using an earlier version of the SuccessFactors spoke, see [Migrate to SuccessFactors spoke v4.11.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/migrate-successfactors.md) for the migration procedure.

For more information about setting up the spoke, see [SAP SuccessFactors Spoke - OAuth Setup &amp; Migration - Pre-Tokyo, Tokyo and beyond](https://www.servicenow.com/community/knowledge-managers/sap-successfactors-spoke-oauth-setup-amp-migration-pre-tokyo/ta-p/2468046) in [ServiceNow Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/).

## Register OAuth client application in SuccessFactors

Enable client certificate authentication for the outbound communication by generating the keystore.jks and keystore.cer files.

### Before you begin

-   Generate a valid JKS certificate. For information about creating a JKS certificate, see [Creating Java Keystore\(JKS\) with Private Key and Certificate Chain](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Cloud_Platform_Master_Data_for_Business_Partners/246fb358c1c7413289c03b8c72734209/18f5bae37a664396b2ebbc1b3c384c53.html) in [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/), or, do the steps.
    1.  Use the command `openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048` to generate the private.key file.
    2.  Use the private.key to create x.509 certificate \(.cer file\) that contains your public key.

        Use the command `openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -out publickey.cer -days 365`

-   Convert the public and private key to a .p12 file.

    Use the command to do the above step `openssl pkcs12 -export -in publickey.cer -inkey private.key -out successfactors.p12 -name "<provide custom name>".`

-   Convert the .p12 file to .jks

    Use the command to do the above step `keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore successfactors.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore successfactors.jks`.

-   Role required: admin.

## Synchronize data between SuccessFactors and ServiceNow

Customise the sample flows as per your requirement to synchronize data between your SuccessFactors and ServiceNow instances.

### Todo entity

The SuccessFactors spoke provides sample flows to synchronize data bi-directionally for the todo entity. The sample flow, Run SuccessFactors Integration Flow can customised to retrieve data from SuccessFactors, while the Create Todo and Update Todo flows creates or updates the todo records in SuccessFactors when events occur in ServiceNow. While customising the sample flows, ensure that you provide appropriate triggers to retrieve and save future updates using transform maps.

### Other default entities

For these entities, the sample flow, Run SuccessFactors Integration Flow, can be customised to retrieve data from SuccessFactors:

-   Department
-   Location
-   Job Profile
-   Workers Profile
-   Effective Workers Profile
-   Job History Including Secondary Assignments

To create or update records in SuccessFactors for these entities when events occur in ServiceNow:

-   Create flows or subflows as per your choice or customise the sample flows and subflows.
-   Use Metadata Retrieval and Record Management actions in your flows.
-   Ensure that you provide appropriate triggers to retrieve and save future updates using transform maps.

### Other SuccessFactors entities

Depending on the SuccessFactors permissions and configurations, you can also synchronize data of other entities as per your requirement.
