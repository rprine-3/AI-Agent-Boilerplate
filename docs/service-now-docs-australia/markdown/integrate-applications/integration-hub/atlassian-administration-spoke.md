## Spoke subflows

The Atlassian Administration spoke provides sample subflows to demonstrate automating Atlassian Administration tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Pull Atlassian Group Details|This subflow retrieves all Group Details from Atlassian Administration such as group product and site details.|

## Spoke actions

The Atlassian Administration spoke provides actions to automate Atlassian Administration tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Group Management|Look up Organization Groups Stream|Retrieves information about groups, users, and roles assignments.|
|User Management|Look up Organization Users Stream|Retrieves information about users, groups, and product last access.|
|Remove User from Group|Removes given user from a group in the Atlassian Administration instance.|

## Spoke module

The Atlassian Administration spoke adds the Atlassian Administration application to your instance and includes these modules:

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Groups|Contains data related to groups.|
|Product and Site Details|Contains data related to product and site.|
|Group Product Site Role Details|Contains data related to site roles for product groups.|

## Spoke user roles

The Atlassian Administration spoke provides these user roles to control access to data:

|User role|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Atlassian Admin \(sn\_atlassian\_spoke.atlassian\_admin\)|Creates connections for the Atlassian Administration application.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
