## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|GitLab pipeline management AI agent|Manages pipeline tasks \(that is, looks up project pipelines by ID, retrieves pipeline test reports, streams project pipeline jobs and streams project pipeline data\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab branch management AI agent|Manages branch management \(that is, compare branches, tags, or commits, creates and deletes branches, manages branch protection, and looks up branch details or streams\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab merge request management AI agent|Manages merge requests \(creates, updates, accepts, and deletes merge request notes, and retrieves information about merge request notes\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab package management AI agent|Manages package management \(that is, deletes project packages, manages registry repositories, and performs detailed lookups for packages and files\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab token management AI agent|Manages token management \(that is, looks up and revokes personal access tokens\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab issue management AI agent|Manages issue management tasks \(that is, creates, updates, and manages issues and the related notes\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab project management AI agent|Manages project management tasks \(that is, creates, updates, and deletes projects and milestones, manages user and group access, and retrieves project and milestone streams\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab source code management AI agent|Manages source code tasks \(that is, looks up commit difference, adds new file to repository, and looks up commit by project ID\) in GitLab.|
|GitLab group management AI agent|Manages user-group tasks \(that is, adds and removes users from groups\) in GitLab.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Spoke flows

The GitLab spoke provides sample flows to demonstrate automating the GitLab tasks. To customize a sample flow, copy it to a new application scope.

|Flow|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Archive projects older than 6 months|Archives the projects which are inactive for the last six months.|

## Spoke subflows

The GitLab spoke provides sample flows to demonstrate automating the GitLab tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

|Subflows|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Process GitLab Deployment Webhook Events​|Processes deployment webhooks in GitLab.|
|Process GitLab Job Webhook Events​|Processes job webhook events in GitLab.|
|Process GitLab Merge Request Webhook Events|Processes merge request webhook events in GitLab.|
|Process GitLab Pipeline Webhook Events​|Processes pipeline webhook events in GitLab.|
|Process GitLab Push Webhook Events​|Processes push webhook events in GitLab.|

## Spoke webhooks

Bi-directional webhooks can be setup to be notified about the required events. Routing policy defines conditions that must be met to notify the ServiceNow app. These conditions are based on the events in GitLab for which you wish to be notified about. When the conditions are met, routing policy triggers the associated subflow, which in turn automates the GitLab tasks.

The bi-directional webhooks requires separate setup and can be used independently without using the spoke actions. By default, the GitLab Webhooks application is available in the GitLab spoke and has the following modules:

|Webhook|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|GitLab Webhook Registries|Displays the list of available webhook registries.|
|GitLab Webhook Routing Policies|Displays the list of available webhook routing policies.|

## Spoke module

The GitLab spoke provides Gitlab Token Management application that includes the Gitlab Token Managements module. You should record here to authenticate requests from your ServiceNow instance.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the GitLab spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-gitlab-spoke.md).
