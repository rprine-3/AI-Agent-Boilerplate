2.  Open the action with the PowerShell step that has the credential you want to test.

    If you don't have a PowerShell step you're already working with, you can [Create an action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/create-action.md) with a new [PowerShell step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/powershell-step-action-designer.md).

3.  In the Connection Details section, enter the connection information.

4.  Click **Test PowerShell Step**.

5.  If the step has data pills as input, provide the required input in the **Step input pills** field.

6.  Click **Run Test**.
