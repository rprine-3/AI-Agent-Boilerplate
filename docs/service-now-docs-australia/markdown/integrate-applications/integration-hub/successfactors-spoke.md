# SuccessFactors Spoke

The SuccessFactors spoke is built by Bristlecone, Inc. Manage data and entities in SuccessFactors from your ServiceNow instance.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Spoke actions

The SuccessFactors spoke provides sample actions in the draft state to demonstrate automating the SuccessFactors tasks when events occur in ServiceNow. To customize a sample action, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample actions include:

**Note:**

-   To help prevent unauthorized users from accessing the sensitive data, the hasRole functionality has been implemented for the sensitive actions of the SuccessFactors spoke. As a result, users without the System Administrator role won’t be able to run successfully the actions if they don't have the SuccessFactors Spoke Admin role. This rule is applicable from SuccessFactors spoke v3.1.5 and v4.0.3 of the spoke respectively. For more information, see the [SuccessFactors Spoke hasRole fix details](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1281664) knowledge base article on [NOW Support](https://support.servicenow.com/now).
-   To help prevent unauthorized users from generating reports for SuccessFactors spoke tables, report\_view ACLs are incorporated with the spoke admin role. Thus, you must have the SuccessFactors Spoke’s Admin role to generate a report.

</table>To retrieve the data, run Run SuccessFactors Integration Flow. The data in the staging tables is available for seven days. During this time period, you must use transform maps to save this data in the required target ServiceNow tables according to your requirement.

## Spoke transform maps

The SuccessFactors spoke provides sample transform maps in inactive state and associated sample target tables to demonstrate using transform maps to save SuccessFactors data in your ServiceNow tables. You can use these sample transform maps and target tables as reference to create transform maps according to your requirement.

For more information, see [Transform maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/system-import-sets/c_CreatingNewTransformMaps.md).

## Spoke user roles

These user roles are available along with the spoke:

-   SuccessFactors Admin \(sn\_successfactors.SuccessFactors Admin\): If you have this role, you can access all spoke modules and tables.
-   SuccessFactors Private Data \(sn\_successfactors.SuccessFactors Private Data\): If you have this role, you can access to data in these spoke modules:
    -   View My Direct Deposit Information
    -   View My Total Rewards
-   SuccessFactors Public Data \(sn\_successfactors.SuccessFactors Public Data\): If you have this role, you can access to data in these spoke modules:
    -   View My Time Off Balance
    -   View My Time Off Details
    -   View My Time Card Details For Past 1 Month
    -   View My Worker Profile
    -   View My Holiday Calendar
    -   View My Reporting Structure

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

Two connection and credential aliases are available with the SuccessFactors spoke. One for the SOAP API and the other for the OData API.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the SuccessFactors spoke v4.x.x](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-successfactors.md).
