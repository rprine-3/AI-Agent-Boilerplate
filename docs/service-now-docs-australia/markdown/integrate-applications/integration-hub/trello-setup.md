# Set up the Trello spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Trello by creating an API key in Trello to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Trello spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## Generate Trello API key and token

Generate a Trello API key and token to get access to the Trello portal.

### Before you begin

Trello Role required: admin

### Procedure

3.  Go to [Developer API Keys](https://trello.com/app-key).

4.  Copy the API key from Personal Key on the Developer API keys page.

5.  In the following link, replace \{YourAPIKey\} with the API key that you copied in the last step and open the link.

    `https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write,account&response_type=token&name=ServerToken&key={YourAPIKey}`

    For example, if your API key is 123xyz, then open the following link- `https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write,account&response_type=token&name=ServerToken&key=123xyz`

    The MyPersonalToken page appears and asks if you want to give access to your account.
