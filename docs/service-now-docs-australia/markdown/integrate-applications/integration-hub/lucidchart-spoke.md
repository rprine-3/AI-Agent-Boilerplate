## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Lucidchart Diagramming Spoke version 1.1.1. For version history of the spoke, see [Lucidchart Diagramming Spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-secops-rn-lucidchart-diagramming-spoke.html).

## Supported versions

Lucidchart API version 1.0.

## Spoke requirements

The Lucidchart Diagramming Spoke requires creating a workspace and custom app on your Lucid account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens for the Lucidchart Diagramming spoke. See [Create OAuth 2.0 Client in Lucidchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-lucidchart.md) and [Create a connection and credential alias for the Lucidchart Diagramming spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/create-conn-cred-lucidchart.md).

## Spoke actions

The Lucidchart Diagramming Spoke provides **Create Diagram** action to access your Lucid account directly from the ServiceNow® instance and create an architectural diagram.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Create a connection and credential alias for the Lucidchart Diagramming spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/create-conn-cred-lucidchart.md).
