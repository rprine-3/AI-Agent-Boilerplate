## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, confirm that these dependent plugins are installed:

## Spoke requirements

-   Storage account in your Microsoft Azure portal for integration with your ServiceNow instance.

    **Note:** Verify that you have the Storage Blob Data Owner role.

    To assign the role:

    1.  Log in to your storage account and navigate to Access Control\(IAM\).
    2.  Select the Add a role assignment and select the Storage Blob Data Owner role.
    3.  Assign access to the required Azure AD user, group, or service principle option. Select the email address of the Azure account and save the changes.

    For more information, see [Use the Azure portal to assign an Azure role for access to blob and queue data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal).

-   Record and save the access keys and Directory ID for later use.

## Spoke subflows

The Azure Blob Storage spoke provides sample subflows to demonstrate automating the Azure Blob Storage tasks. To customize a sample flow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample flows include:

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Move Blob|Moves a blob from source container to destination container.|
|Rename Blob|Renames the specified blob.|
|Look up Blobs Stream|Retrieves the details of all blobs in a container.|
|Look up Containers Stream|Retrieves a list of containers under the specified storage account.|

## Spoke actions

The Azure Blob Storage spoke provides actions to automate Azure Blob Storage tasks when events occur in the ServiceNow AI Platform. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Blob Management|Attach Blob to ServiceNow Record|Attaches a blob to the ServiceNow record.|
|Copy Blob|Copies a blob from one container to another container.|
|Delete Blob|Deletes the specified blob.|
|Lease Blob|Creates a lock on a blob for write and delete operations.|
|Look up Blob|Retrieves details of the specified blob.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
