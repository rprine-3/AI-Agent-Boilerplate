## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke flows

The Aha! spoke provides a sample flow, Upsert Aha Ideas to:

-   Check if an idea is created in the Aha Ideas \[sn\_aha\_spoke\_aha\_ideas\] table in ServiceNow instance. If an idea record is created, the flow creates the idea record in Aha! and updates the value of auto-generated ID ServiceNow instance.
-   Check if an existing idea has been updated and synchronizes the details updates in Aha!.

You can also create a copy of the flow and customize it according to your requirement.

## Spoke subflows

The Aha! spoke provides a sample subflow, Process Aha webhooks to create and update records in Aha!, and save the records' information in the Aha Feature \[sn\_aha\_spoke\_feature\_aha\] table.

</table>## Spoke triggers

Use triggers in the Aha! spoke to subscribe to the required events. The endpoint enables webhooks to connect with your ServiceNow instance. You can configure the flows to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met. The supported events are:

|Category|Trigger|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|Default|Comment Added|Trigger initiates when a comment is added to a feature in Aha! workspace.|
|Field Change|Trigger initiates when a field is changed in Aha! workspace.|
|Feature Management|Feature Created|Trigger initiates when a feature is created in Aha! Workspace.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Create an Aha! OAuth2 application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/create-aha-oauth2-authentication.md) and [Set up ServiceNow instance for Aha!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-servicenow-instance-to-authorize-aha.md).
