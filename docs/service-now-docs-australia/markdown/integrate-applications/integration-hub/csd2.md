# CSD 2.0 for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager

Use the CSD 2.0 along with the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager spoke to deploy and revoke software deployments from Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and manage distributions on hosts.

To use the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager spoke with CSD 2.0, you must activate Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager spoke and CSD 2.0.

The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager spoke contains actions that CSD 2.0 uses to deploy software from a service catalog request and manage user and device collections on Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager servers. In addition, CSD 2.0 can manage license counts for deployed software, revoke software deployed by Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager without user interaction, and manage lease periods.

**Note:** For systems deploying software from Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, the **Lease end** field is only available if the configuration specifies an uninstall collection.
