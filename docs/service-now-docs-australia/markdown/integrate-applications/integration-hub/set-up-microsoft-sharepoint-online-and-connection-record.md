# Configure Microsoft SharePoint Online connection record

Integrate your ServiceNow instance with the Microsoft SharePoint Online by setting up the Microsoft SharePoint Online and a connection record.

## Before you begin

-   Request Integration Hub subscription
-   Activate [Microsoft SharePoint Online Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/sharepoint-online-spoke.md)
-   Create an OAuth application on Microsoft Azure portal.
-   Access to Microsoft Azure portal
-   Role required: admin

## Generate certificate for Windows

Generate a digital certificate file in the .cer format to upload it to Microsoft Azure.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread\#setting-up-an-azure-ad-app-for-app-only-access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread#setting-up-an-azure-ad-app-for-app-only-access).

2.  Execute the PowerShell script.

    The script generates two files with .PFX and .CER extensions.

    **Note:** Store or remember the password that is used to encrypt private key to generate the .PFX file and .CER files.

3.  Use the .PFX file to create a Java Key Store \(JKS\) file.

    **Note:** Store or remember the password that is used to generate the .JKS file from the .PFX file.


## Generate self-signed certificate for Mac

Generate a digital certificate file in the .cer format to upload it to Microsoft Azure.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Open the terminal on your Mac machine.

2.  Replace the placeholder `<filename>` with a file name of your choice and execute this script `keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore <filename>.jks -storepass <enter password for keystore> -validity 720 -keysize 2048`.

    **Note:** The password to the keystore must contain at least six characters.

    The keystore asks you to enter certain information.

3.  Enter your custom information, as given in the image for illustration.\[Omitted image "MS-sharepoint-spoke-sponline-certificate-mac.png"\] Alt text: Keystore custom information.

4.  Press **Return**.

    **Note:** The **Thumbprint** value is a hexadecimal value. You can use a Hexadecimal to Base64 \(Hex to Base64\) converter tool to encode the **Thumbprint** value to a Base64 value.

6.  Click **Submit**.

    The Microsoft SharePoint Online account is integrated with your ServiceNow instance and the spoke is ready to be used.

    **Note:** If the single sign-on is setup, configure your flows to retrieve the user details from Microsoft SharePoint Online using the spoke action, Look Up User Information By Login Name, to verify if the user is authorised to perform the required actions.


### What to do next

1.  Navigate to **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**.
2.  Open the credential record you had created. For example, **SharePoint Credentials**.
3.  From Related Links, click **Get OAuth Token**.

    The system displays a confirmation message that the OAuth token flow is completed successfully. Review the details if the flow is not completed successfully.

    **Note:**

    -   Confirm that the thumbprint has been defined in the connection record
    -   Confirm that you allow pop-up windows in your browser.
    The spoke setup is completed and you can use the flows as per your requirement.

    **Note:** If the generated token doesn't work after the spoke setup, open your OAuth application in the Azure portal and select the two checkboxes under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**.\[Omitted image "ms-exchng-ol-tokens.png"\] Alt text: Select the tokens in the Azure portal.
