# ServiceNow University Spoke

Manage the courses on the ServiceNow University platform from your ServiceNow instance. For example, get the details of all the courses on ServiceNow University by executing a spoke action from your ServiceNow instance.

## ServiceNow University spoke subscription

The ServiceNow University spoke is available with the ITSM Enterprise license. You can integrate Coaching with Learning with ServiceNow University. For more information, see [External Content Integration Sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/integration-source-coaching-with-learning-coaching-wfo-itsm.md).

## Spoke version

ServiceNow University Spoke v1.1.1 is the latest version.

## Spoke actions

The ServiceNow University spoke provides actions to automate ServiceNow University tasks when events occurs in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Look up Courses Stream|Provides course details.|
|Look up User Courses Activity Stream|Provides course activity for all users for a specific time period.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
