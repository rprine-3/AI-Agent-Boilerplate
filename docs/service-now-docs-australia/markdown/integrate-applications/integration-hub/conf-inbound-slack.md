# Configure inbound decisions in ServiceNow instance

2.  Select the required subflow from the Document list.

**Note:** Ensure that the **Table name** is `Flow [sys_hub_flow]`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Condition

</td><td>

Conditions to be met in your Slack application for which actions must be performed in ServiceNow instance. For updating relevant record in your ServiceNow instance, specify the **Action ID** value you had provided while [configuring outbound configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conf-outbound-slack.md) in the condition.

**Note:** **Action ID** of the outbound configuration must be used in the relevant inbound decision to complete the flow. For example, **Action ID** of the Approval Message outbound configuration is provided in the Approval Decision inbound decision. This ensures that upon the request approval or rejection, update is made to the relevant record in your ServiceNow instance.

</table>4.  Click **Submit**.

    When events meet conditions specified in the policy, the associated subflow is triggered.

    **Note:** These inbound decisions are saved in the Decision tables. Users are cautioned against directly updating or modifying data in these tables.
