-   Manage multiple Stream Connect integrations through a single application.
-   Gain insights into how your integrations use and process data with detailed charts, lists, and statistics.
-   View total data usage, data usage per month, and data usage per topic, for the last 13 months.
-   Edit topics, producers, consumers, and replicators through a simplified interface.
-   View data for Hermes and Direct Kafka environments.

## Stream Connect Dashboard organization

To view the dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **Integration Hub** &gt; **Stream Connect** &gt; **Stream Connect Home**.

The dashboard has the following components.

-   Overview section, with data usage tab.
-   Topics
-   Consumers
-   Producers
-   Message Replications
-   Topic Replications
-   Alerts

The following sections explain each component in greater detail.

## Overview section

View detailed information about your Stream Connect integrations.

The Overview section has two tabs: Stream activity and Data usage.

-   The Stream activity tab shows the activity on topics, consumers, producers, replicators, and alerts.
-   The Data usage tab shows Stream Connect usage over time.

\[Omitted image "stream-connect-dashboard.png"\] Alt text: User interface for the Stream activity tab of the Stream Connect dashboard overview page.

The Stream activity tab has these components.

-   **1. Active entities and alerts**

    The Active entities section displays the number of topics, consumers, producers, and topic replicators created. The Active alerts section shows the total number of active alerts with each alert's number, type, affected entity, and date updated.

-   **2. Streamed data overview**

    This section has several charts detailing the amount of data and messages consumed and produced. By default, the charts display data for all topics. You can view data for a single topic by selecting one from the **All Topics** list. Each topic is listed by its topic alias. For a Direct Kafka topic, the alias name is followed by the system name, in brackets. For example, a topic with an alias of my\_topic and a system name of c\_platform appears as **my\_topic \[c\_platform\]**. If plugins for both Hermes and Direct Kafka are installed, alias names for Hermes topics are followed by **\[Hermes\]**. If only the Hermes plugin is installed, topic aliases appear without the system name.

    You can also organize the displayed data by time, viewing data for the **Last 24 hours**, **Last 2 days**, **Last 7 days**, or by setting a **Custom range**.

    This section has the following charts.

    -   Consumed data: The total amount of data consumed.
    -   Messages processed: The total number of processed messages.
    -   Produced data: The total number of data produced.
    -   Messages produced: The total number of messages produced.
    -   Consumers data usage trends: The amount of data consumers used over the last seven days.
    -   Producers data usage trends: The amount of data producers used over the last seven days.

\[Omitted image "sc-dashboard-data.png"\] Alt text: User interface for the Data usage tab of the Stream Connect dashboard overview page.

The Data usage tab has these components.

-   **3. Kafka Cluster andMonth selectors**

    Use the **Kafka Cluster** list to select data for either **Hermes usage** or **Direct Kafka usage**.

    **Note:** The **Kafka Cluster** list only appears if the plugins for both Hermes and Direct Kafka are installed. If only one plugin is installed, the **Kafka Cluster** list is hidden and the dashboard displays data for either Hermes or Direct Kafka, depending on the plugin. For more information about plugins, see [Integration Hub plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/ih-plugins.md).

    Select a start month and end month to view data usage over time. Data usage history is available for the last 12 complete months plus the current month.

-   **4. Data usage details**

    Displays the following charts.

    -   Total data usage in MB: The total data usage for the selected months.
    -   Topics utilized: The total number of topics with data usage for the selected months.
    -   Data usage: The data usage per month for the selected months.
    -   Data usage by topic: The data usage per topic for the selected months.
