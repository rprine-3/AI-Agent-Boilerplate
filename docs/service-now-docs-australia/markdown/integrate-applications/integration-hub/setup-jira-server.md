# Set up the Jira spoke for Jira Server

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Jira Server using user name and password to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

-   Starting with the Australia release, instructions for generating and using API tokens have been removed from our documentation to align with Atlassian's Acceptable Use Policy.
-   As of February 15, 2024 PT, your Jira Server products reached the end of support. Starting from Jira Software 9.13 and Jira Service Management 5.13, new Jira releases support only Data Center licenses.
-   End of life for impacted Data Center products will take place on March 28, 2029 at 23:59 PST. Data Center subscriptions and any associated Marketplace apps will expire on this date, making Data Center products and apps read-only. For more information, see [Data Center EOL General Questions](http://atlassian.com/licensing/data-center-end-of-life#data-center-eol-general-questions).
-   Apps that collect API tokens to create individual 3LO apps don't comply with Atlassian security requirements for cloud apps and Atlassian acceptable use policy.

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Jira spoke.
-   Role required: admin.
