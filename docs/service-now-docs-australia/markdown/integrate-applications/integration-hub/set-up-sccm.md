# Set up the Microsoft SCCM spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and SCCM using Windows credentials to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Microsoft SCCM spoke.
-   Role required: admin.
-   [Configure the MID Server for SCCM activities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigMIDServerForSCCMActivities.md).

**Note:** Ensure that user must be able to establish remote PowerShell sessions with the Microsoft SCCM server. The spoke scripts use **Microsoft.PowerShell32** configuration for creating sessions. For user permissions, see [User permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote_requirements?view=powershell-7.4#user-permissions) in [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/).
