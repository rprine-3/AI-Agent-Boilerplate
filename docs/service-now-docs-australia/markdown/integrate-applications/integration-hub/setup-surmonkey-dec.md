    1.  In **OAuth Redirect URL**, enter the ServiceNow instance URL in this format: `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`.

    2.  Copy and record the values of **Client ID** and **Secret**.

    3.  Provide these scopes for the app:

        -   Create/Modify Surveys
        -   Create/Modify Collectors
        -   Create/Modify Responses
        -   View Response Details
