## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

## Set up the Microsoft Azure Virtual Network Spoke

To execute the actions of the Microsoft Azure Virtual Network Spoke, you must first install and configure the Microsoft Azure Resource Management Spoke. No separate configuration of the Microsoft Azure Virtual Network Spoke is necessary. To view the procedure to set up the Microsoft Azure Resource Management Spoke, see [Set up the Microsoft Azure Resource Management spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-res-mngmt.md).
