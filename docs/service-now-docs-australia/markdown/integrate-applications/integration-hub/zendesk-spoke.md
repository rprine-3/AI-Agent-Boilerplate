## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub imports

The Zendesk spoke adds the Import Zendesk Users Integration Hub imports to your ServiceNow instance. The Integration Hub imports help you import the users' data from Zendesk account to your ServiceNow instance in an automated way. For more information about Integration Hub imports, see[Integration Hub - Import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integrationhub-imports.md).

## Spoke modules

The Zendesk spoke adds the Zendesk Spoke application to your ServiceNow instance. The Zendesk Spoke application includes these modules:

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Users|Stores the details of the Zendesk users. These details are imported using the Import Zendesk Users Integration Hub imports.|
|Remote table|
|Request|Retrieves and displayes the details of the requests raised by the specified requestor. For this, you must provide the value of **Requester ID**.|
|Webhook|
|Webhook Registries|Stores the webhook registries. The webhook registries register a Zendesk webhook in ServiceNow to notify ServiceNow when certain events occur in Zendesk.|
|Routing Policies|Stores the details of the webhook.|
|Tickets|Stores detailf of the tickets created or updated in Zendesk.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Zendesk spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-zendesk.md).
