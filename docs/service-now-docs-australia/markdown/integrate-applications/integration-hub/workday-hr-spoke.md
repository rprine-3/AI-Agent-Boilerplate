## Spoke version

Workday HR spoke v3.0.2 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Workday HR spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-workday-hr.html).

## Required configurations in Workday

To set up the integration, you must initially perform this procedure in Workday:

1.  Register an Integration System User.

    **Note:** While filling account information details, confirm that you select the **Do Not Allow UI Sessions** check box.

2.  Create a security group and assign it to the integration system user.

</table>        **Note:** Confirm that the business process security policies are activated for the security group.


**Note:** If you have installed spoke v1, uninstall it and install the spoke v1.1.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, confirm that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - SOAP \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.soap\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Outputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_outputs\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   System Import Data Source \(glide.system\_import\_data\_source\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)​

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke flows

The Workday HR spoke provides a sample flow, Verify User Sample Flow that demonstrates automating the Workday tasks. This flow calls the subflow with the same name to verify if the user who raised the request is a valid user in the Workday system. To customize a sample flow, copy it to a new application scope.

## Spoke subflows

The Workday HR spoke provides sample subflows to demonstrate automating Workday HR tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Verify User Subflow|Verifies if the user who raised request is a valid user in Workday system.|
|Get WID For Worker|Retrieves WID details of the employee using the Look up Worker Profile action.|
|Create User|Creates a user in the ServiceNow when the user is onboarded in the Workday system. To use this subflow, you should [Set up webhooks for your Workday HR spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-webhook-wd-hr-spoke.md).|
|Leave of absence|Retrieves the leave of absence details of an employee from Workday using the LeaveofAbsence Webhook.|
|Deactivate User|Deactivates an user in Workday using the Workday Deactivate User webhook.|
|Look up job Requisition|Retrieves all the existing job requisition information from Workday application into Job Requisition table.|
|Update Job Requisition|Retrieves the changes made to the existing job requisition in Workday using the UpdateJobRequisition webhook and stores the changes in the Job Requisition table.|
|Look up Using WQL Stream|Retrieves Workday HR data using a WQL \(Workday Query Language\) stream query.|
|Sample Sequences to Make a WQL Call|Constructs a Workday Query Language \(WQL\) query based on the specified inputs.|

## Spoke actions that use Workday SOAP APIs

Workday itself organizes its APIs into two major categories: SOAP Public API and REST API. Thus, the Workday HR spoke also reflects the same. You can use the spoke by using one of these two APIs, but not necessarily both, depending on the spoke actions you must use.

The Workday HR spoke provides actions to automate Workday tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** The legacy SOAP actions are deprecated but remain fully functional with Basic Authentication and System Authentication.

Available actions include:

**Note:** The SOAP-based actions use the Workday SOAP web services and require you to perform the configurations mentioned in [Configurations to use Workday SOAP Basic Auth with WS-Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/soap-wd-hr-spoke.md).

</table>## Spoke actions that use Workday REST APIs

Workday itself organizes its APIs into two major categories: SOAP Public API and REST API. Thus, the Workday HR spoke also reflects the same. You can use the spoke by using one of these two APIs, but not necessarily both, depending on the spoke actions you must use.

The Workday HR spoke provides actions to automate Workday tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

**Note:** The REST-based actions use the Workday REST API and requires you to perform the configurations mentioned in [Configurations to use Workday REST API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/rest-wd-hr-spoke.md).

</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
