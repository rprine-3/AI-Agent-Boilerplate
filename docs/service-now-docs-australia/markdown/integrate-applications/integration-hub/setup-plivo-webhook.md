### Result

The callback URL is added in your Plivo account. You can create routing policies and subflows as per your requirement. See [Create routing policy and customize webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-plivo-webhook.md) for information regarding the creation of new routing policies and subflows.

## Create routing policy and customize webhook

Create a webhook routing policy and subflow as per your requirement.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_plivo\_spoke.Plivo\_Admin and decision\_table\_admin

### About this task

Routing policy in the Plivo WebHook Routing Policy module triggers the subflows and notifies the ServiceNow instance when certain events occur in your Plivo account. See [Plivo Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/plivo-spoke.md) for information about the fields that the routing policy and subflows support.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Flow Designer** &gt; **Designer**.

2.  Click **Subflows**.

3.  Create a copy of the default subflow.

    Two subflows are available along with Plivo spoke; Plivo Call Handler and Plivo SMS Handler. You can create a copy of either of these subflows as per your requirement.

4.  Customize the subflow as per your requirement and publish it.

    See [Building subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/subflows.md) for more information about creating and using subflows, and [Plivo Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/plivo-spoke.md) for information about the supported fields.

5.  Navigate to **Plivo Spoke** &gt; **Plivo WebHook Routing Policy**.
