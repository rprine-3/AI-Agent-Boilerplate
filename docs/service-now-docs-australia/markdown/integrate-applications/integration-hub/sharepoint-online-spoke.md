</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online file management AI agent|Automates file-related tasks such as, sharing files with users or groups, copying files, moving files, creating text files, retrieving file details, and managing file permissions.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online list management AI agent|Automates SharePoint operations such as, managing lists, creating and renewing subscriptions, retrieving list details, and automating workflows.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online site management AI agent|Automates SharePoint operations such as, creating and deleting sites, managing site collections, retrieving site information, and automating SharePoint workflows.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online group management AI agent|Automates group management processes such as, adding or removing users from groups, creating or deleting groups, updating group ownership, and managing roles within SharePoint sites.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online list item management AI agent|Automates SharePoint operations such as, creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving list items.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online user management AI agent|Automates user management tasks such as, a retrieving user's SharePoint groups, user information by login name, and user details by email.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online folder management AI agent|Automates folder management tasks such as, renaming folders, creating folders, sharing and unsharing folders with users or groups, listing files and folders, and deleting folders.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online change management AI agent|Perform the Get Next Token and Get Delta Link Token For Drive actions.|
|Microsoft SharePoint Online search management AI agent|Retrieves the required search query results and enables users to streamline processes.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## SharePoint Online account requirements

The Microsoft SharePoint Online spoke requires that you create a custom app on your SharePoint Online account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens. See [Configure OAuth application in Microsoft Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/configure-oauth-application-in-microsoft-azure.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

-   **Single tenant**

    This spoke includes the MicrosoftSharepointOnline alias record to authorize actions on Microsoft SharePoint Online. Select this alias in the Tenant record to authorize changes in Microsoft SharePoint Online for a single tenant.

-   **Multiple tenants**

    This spoke includes the MicrosoftSharepointOnline alias record to authorize actions on Microsoft SharePoint Online. Create a connection and credential alias record for each additional tenant site that you want to support. Select the correct alias in the Tenant record to authorize changes in Microsoft SharePoint Online. Create a connection and credential alias record for each additional tenant site that you want to support. Select the correct alias in the Tenant record to authorize changes in Microsoft SharePoint Online. See [Create aliases for multiple tenants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/create-aliases-sharepoint.md).


**Note:**

Three alias records are available by default with the spoke; Sharepoint Online, SharePoint Graph, and SharePoint Graph Root Site Subscription. Each alias record requires a tenant to be associated with it. If you intend to use all SharePoint Online, Graph, and Root Subscription actions in the spoke, you must ensure that you have created three tenant records in the Tenants tables of the Microsoft SharePoint Online spoke so that each tenant record is associated with its respective alias record.

-   If configuring an integration for a single tenant, use the existing **MicrosoftSharepointOnline** alias record.
-   You can use multiple tenants with the **Microsoft SharePoint Graph** connection alias only.
