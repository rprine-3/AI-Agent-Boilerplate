## Spoke version

Secureworks CTP spoke v1.0.3 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Secureworks CTP spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-secureworks-ctp.html).

Secureworks portal account.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The Secureworks CTP spoke provides actions to automate Secureworks CTP tasks when events occurs in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Event Management|Get Event Details|Retrieves the details of a specific event.|
|Get Recent Events|Retrieves details of a list of recent events.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Secureworks CTP spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-secureworks-ctp.md).
