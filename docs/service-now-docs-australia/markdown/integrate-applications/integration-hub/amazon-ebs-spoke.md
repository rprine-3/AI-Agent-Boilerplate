# Amazon EBS Spoke

Manage block level storage volumes and snapshots in Amazon EBS from your ServiceNow instance.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Spoke version

Amazon EBS spoke v1.0.2 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Amazon EBS spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-amazon-ebs.html).

## Supported version

This spoke was built for API version 2016-11-15, but may be compatible with later versions.

**Note:** If you use different API version, ensure that you change the API version in all spoke actions.

## Spoke requirements

-   User with full access to Amazon EC2.
-   Access Key ID and Secret Access Key of the user. Record these values for later use.

For more information about creating user in IAM and providing the required access, see [Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) page on the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) site.

## Spoke actions

The Amazon EBS spoke provides actions to automate Amazon EBS tasks when events occur in ServiceNow. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Elastic Block Store Management|Attach Volume|Attaches an EBS volume to a running or stopped instance.|
|Create Snapshot|Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume.|
|Create Volume|Creates an EBS volume that can be attached to an instance in the same Availability Zone.|
|Delete Snapshot|Deletes the specified snapshot.|
|Delete Volume|Deletes the specified EBS volume.|
|Detach Volume|Detaches an EBS volume from an instance.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Amazon EBS spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ebs.md).
