## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The Automation Anywhere spoke provides actions to automate Automation Anywhere tasks when events occurs in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Bot Management|Deploy Bot|Deploys a bot in the bot runner devices.|
|Get Bot|Retrieves details of the specific bot.|
|Look up Bots|Retrieves information about all the bots.|

|Look up Users Stream|Retrieves details of all the users.|

**Note:** Only users with bot runner or admin role can execute the spoke actions.

## Spoke module

The Automation Anywhere spoke adds the Automation Anywhere application to your instance and includes the Authentication module. In this module, you should provide details in the default credential record to authentication the ServiceNow requests. See [Create a Credential record for the Automation Anywhere spoke]() for more information.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Automation Anywhere spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-auto-anywhr.md).
