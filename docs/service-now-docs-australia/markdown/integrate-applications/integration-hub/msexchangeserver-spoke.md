-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - PowerShell \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.powershell\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)

    **Note:** The Create Calendar Event For User and Lookup Room Availability actions are supported only on Exchange Server 2013.

-   Exchange Server 2013 installed on Windows Server 2012 R2

This spoke may be compatible with the earlier versions of Microsoft Exchange Server.

## Spoke requirements

Powershell remoting must be enabled on the target Exchange Server. For more information about the Microsoft Exchange Server, see [Exchange Server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-server?view=exchserver-2019).

## Spoke flows

The Exchange Server spoke provides sample flows to demonstrate automating the Exchange Server tasks. To customize a sample flow, copy it to the required application scope. Available sample flows include:

|Flow|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Pull From Subscriptions|Uses the Look up Items From Subscription ID subflow to periodically retrieve the modified items in an active subscription and saves the details in the ServiceNow instance.|
|Look up Calendar Item from Item ID Flow|Uses the Look up Items From Subscription ID subflow to display the details of the modified items in a subscription in the Subscription to Events Mapping module.|
|Renew Subscription|Uses the Renew Subscription subflow to renew subscription.|

**Note:** Subscriptions are valid for 24 hours and flows renew the subscriptions periodically. If there are failures with the third-party applications, subscriptions will not be renewed. That is, **Active** is set to **False**. In the event of failure, you should use the create subscription flow to create a subscription.

## Spoke subflows

The Exchange Server spoke provides sample subflows to demonstrate automating the Exchange Server tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to the required application scope. Available sample subflows include:

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Look up Items From Subscription ID|Saves the details of the modified items in a subscription to the Event to Subscription Mapping table.|
|Create Subscription|Creates a subscription for the specified mailbox and adds it to the Subscription table. If the subscription already exists, the subflow adds the application details to the subscription record.|

</table>## Spoke modules

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Subscriptions|Displays details of the subscriptions in Exchange Server. Data is populated in this module when the Create Subscriptions and Renew Subscriptions subflows are executed.|

|Subscription to Events Mapping|Displays details of the subscriptions and events. Data is populated in this module when the Look up Items From Subscription ID subflow is executed.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

Two connection and credential aliases are created when the Microsoft Exchange Server spoke is activated, Exchange and Exchange\_https.

**Note:**

-   The Exchange\_https alias is supported only on Exchange Server 2013.
-   The Exchange\_https alias is required to use the Create Calendar Event For User and Lookup Room Availability actions.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Microsoft Exchange Server spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-msexchange.md).

## MID Server requirements

Your instance must have a MID Server set up and configured to run PowerShell 2.0. Use the connection record associated with the Microsoft Exchange alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
