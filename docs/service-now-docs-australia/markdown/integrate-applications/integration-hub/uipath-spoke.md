</table>## Spoke modules

The UiPath spoke adds the UiPath application to your ServiceNow instance. The UiPath application includes these modules:

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|UiPath Webhook Registries|Contains details about the webhook registry records.|
|UiPath Webhook Routing Policies|Contains details about the webhook routing policy records. Three routing policies are available with the spoke that retrieve information about jobs, robots, and processes.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the UiPath spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conf-alias-uipath.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls, which can run on an instance or MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the UiPath alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

**Note:** The MID Server users must have the sn\_uipath\_spoke.uipath\_admin role.

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
