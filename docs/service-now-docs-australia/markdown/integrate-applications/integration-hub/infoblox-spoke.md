## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the Infoblox alias record to authorize actions.

</td><td>

Connection to Infoblox server

</td><td>

-   Connection type: HTTP
-   Connection URL: URL of the host machine where the Infoblox server is installed.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>To use the spoke connection alias, create an associated Connection record and an associated Credential record. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Infoblox spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-infoblox.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls, which must run on a MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the Infoblox alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
