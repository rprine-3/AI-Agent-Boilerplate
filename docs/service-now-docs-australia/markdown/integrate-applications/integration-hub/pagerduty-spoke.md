# PagerDuty Spoke

The PagerDuty spoke provides actions to view and analyze meaningful usage data for PagerDuty software subscriptions. Analyze on-call users to determine which licenses are stale so that you can reclaim these licenses and realize your potential savings.

For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

PagerDuty spoke v1.6.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [PagerDuty spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-pagerduty.html).

## Supported versions

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|PagerDuty team management AI agent|Creates teams, updates team details, manages users and escalation policies, and retrieves information about teams and their subscriptions.|
|PagerDuty business service management AI agent|Creates, updates, and deletes business services, manages subscribers, and retrieves dependencies.|
|PagerDuty schedule management AI agent|Retrieves schedule streams and details of the required schedule.|
|PagerDuty extension management AI agent|Retrieevs details of the required extensions, creates new extensions, retrieves a stream of extensions, and updates existing extensions.|
|PagerDuty user management AI agent|Retrieves details of the on-call users, updates user details, creates new users, removes the required users and retrieves the user streams.|
|PagerDuty incident management AI agent|Creates new incidents, updates existing ones, and retrieves details of the required incident.|
|PagerDuty notification management AI agent|Retrieves details of notifications.|
|PagerDuty service management AI agent|Creates new services, updates details of existing services, and retrieves details of the required service.|
|PagerDuty audit management AI agent|Retrieves the audit records and integrates the PagerDuty functionalities into broader operational flow.|
|PagerDuty escalation policy management AI agent|Creates, updates, deletes, and retrieves escalation policies, as well as stream policy data for integration into workflows|
|PagerDuty tag management AI agent|Creates tags, retrieves details of the required tag, retrieves tag streams, deletes tags, and assigns tags.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
