## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agents|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Google Calendar event manager AI agent|Manages event manager tasks \(that is, look up an event by an event ID, look up an events stream, look up busy slots by a calendar ID, move an event, create an event, look up events by a calendar ID, delete an event, update an event\) in Google Calendar.|
|Google Calendar list manager AI agent|Manages calendar list tasks \(that is, delete a calendar from a calendar list, look up a calendar from a calendar list by an ID, look up calendars from a calendar list stream\) in Google Calendar.|
|Google Calendar access control list manager AI agent|Manages access control list tasks \(that is, update an access control list, delete an access control list, look up an access control list stream, look up an access control list by a calendar ID\) in Google Calendar.|
|Google Calendar metadata manager AI agent|Retrieves time zones metadata \(that is, look up time zones metadata\) from Google Calendar.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Spoke module

The Google Calendar spoke adds a Google Calendars module to your ServiceNow instance. The Google Calendars module displays the details of the calendar lists.

## Google Calendar Online account requirements

The Google Calendar spoke requires a custom app that you create in [Google G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Google Calendar spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-gcal.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls that can run either on an instance or, optionally, through a MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the Google Calendar alias to configure where actions run and, if needed, specify MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
