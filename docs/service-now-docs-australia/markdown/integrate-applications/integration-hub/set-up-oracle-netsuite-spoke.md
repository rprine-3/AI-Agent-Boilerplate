## Configure a connection record for Oracle NetSuite

Configure a connection record between your ServiceNow instance and Oracle NetSuite. The record centrally stores credentials, OAuth tokens, client ID, and client secret, and is a reusable connection across flows.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Close the notification, if it appears.

    \[Omitted image "oracle-netsuite-spk-cls-note.png"\] Alt text: New version available notification.

    |OAuth Token URL|Option to provide the endpoint that issues access tokens after authorization.|

9.  Select **Configure and Get OAuth Token**.

    The OAuth Access token is generated for the Oracle NetSuite spoke.

    **Note:** You must log in to Oracle NetSuite before the OAuth access token is granted.

    \[Omitted image "oracle-netsuite-spk-oauth-token-avl.png"\] Alt text: Oracle NetSuite OAuth configuration done.


## Generate webhook authentication token

Generate an authentication token that enables the Oracle NetSuite requests to your ServiceNow instance to get authenticated. The requests contain events occurring in the Oracle NetSuite real-time. For example, Oracle NetSuite sends a notification when a customer record is created.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

**Important:** Skip this procedure if you don’t need to initiate an inbound call from Oracle NetSuite to ServiceNow.

Oracle NetSuite Webhook, a preconfigured sample scripted REST API, is available on your ServiceNow instance. It listens to events occurring on the Oracle NetSuite real-time, and logs the status of the events as success or failure in your ServiceNow instance. To enable the authentication of the events that Oracle NetSuite sends to the scripted REST API, you must generate an authentication token in the Oracle NetSuite webhook registry. The token is included in the webhook that Oracle NetSuite sends.

To access the webhook, navigate to **All**&gt;**System Web Services****&gt; Scripted Web Services****&gt; Scripted REST APIs**, in the Name field, enter `Oracle NetSuite Webhook`, and press **Enter**.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Oracle Netsuite Spoke** &gt; **Webhook Registry**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Fill the form.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Oracle Netsuite Account Number|Option to enter the account number that the Oracle NetSuite provides.|
    |Object Name|Option to provide the type of the object in Oracle NetSuite that it includes in the webhook. For example, customer.|
    |Authentication Token|Option to generate the authentication token that Oracle NetSuite uses to have its requests authenticated on your ServiceNow instance. The token is generated after you select **Generate Authentication Token**.|
    |Description|Option to enter a description of the webhook.|

4.  Select **Generate Authentication Token**.

    The authentication token is generated.

    \[Omitted image "oracle-netsuite-spk-auth-token-generated.png"\] Alt text: Authentication token generated.

5.  Copy and store the authentication token at a secure place.

6.  Select **Update**.

    The webhook is recorded in the webhook registry.

    \[Omitted image "oracle-netsuite-spk-webhook-regd.png"\] Alt text: Webhook registered in the webhook registry.


## Deploy SuiteScript in Oracle NetSuite

Deploy a SuiteScript that enables the Oracle NetSuite to send real-time event details to the scripted API in your ServiceNow instance using the webhook.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

**Important:** Skip this procedure if you don’t need to initiate an inbound call from Oracle NetSuite to ServiceNow.

ServiceNow provides a preconfigured sample SuiteScript that you can update and enable the Oracle NetSuite to send real-time events to the scripted API in your ServiceNow instance. You update the SuiteScript by providing the authentication token you had generated, ServiceNow Webhook URL, object, and the Oracle NetSuite account number at appropriate places in the NetSuite script. After configuring the sample NetSuite script, you must deploy it on the Oracle NetSuite application so it can send events to the scripted API in your ServiceNow instance.

### Procedure

1.  From the [Oracle NetSuite spoke](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/5b03388aeb1d62108cc7f41fbad0cdf9/1.0.1) page on [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/store), download the `servicenow_webhook_call.js` file to your local disk.

2.  Log in to Oracle NetSuite.

3.  Navigate to **Customization** &gt; **Scripting** &gt; **Scripts** &gt; **New**.

4.  Select **New Script**.
