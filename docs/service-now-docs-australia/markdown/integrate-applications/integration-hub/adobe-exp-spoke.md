For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

Adobe Experience Platform spoke v2.1.1 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Adobe Experience Platform release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-adobe-exper.html).

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for Adobe Experience Platform released on September 10, 2019, but may be compatible with later versions.

-   Registered Adobe ID account

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

**Note:** Two connection and credential alias records are needed for the Adobe Experience Platform spoke; one for data inlet management and batch ingestion, and other for data collection. Each alias should be associated with the respective Adobe Experience Platform API.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Adobe Experience Platform spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-aep-spoke.md).
