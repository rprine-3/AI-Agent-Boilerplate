# Set up the Guidewire spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Guidewire using basic Auth or OAuth 2.0 authentication to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Guidewire spoke.
-   Choose and implement the Guidewire authentication approach appropriate for your application. See the Guidewire documentation for [Choosing an authentication flow](https://docs.guidewire.com/cloud/cc/202205/cloudapica/cloudAPI/topics/71_Authentication/p_choosing-an-authentication-flow.html) for details.
-   Ensure that the dependent plugins are activated.
-   Role required: admin.

## Register Guidewire as an OAuth provider

Use the information generated during the Guidewire application configuration to register Guidewire as an OAuth provider. OAuth provider registration enables the ServiceNow instance to request OAuth 2.0 tokens.
