## Supported versions

This spoke was built for Amazon Alexa API version v1, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Spoke version

Amazon Alexa v1.3.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Amazon Alexa spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-amazon-alexa.html).

## Spoke requirements

Admin access to [Amazon Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/) and AWS Lambda.

## Important security considerations

Be aware of these considerations to securely use Amazon Alexa:

-   Amazon stores voice recordings of the Amazon Alexa smart assistant customers forever unless the Amazon Alexa account is configured to delete the recordings. For more information about deleting the voice recordings, see [Delete Alexa Voice Recordings Automatically](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G68KUKTXN92WY3C3).
-   To stop recording conversations, turn the microphone off on the Alexa enabled devices.
-   To ensure safety and protect privacy when using Alexa devices, take measures such as, choosing a strong password and using a pin for voice purchases.
-   Install or activate only the legitimate skills.
-   Ensure proper credential management in AWS Lambda when invoking the ServiceNow Rest API.
-   Ensure that your AWS Lambda function is accessible to only the required skills by adding the Alexa Skills Kit trigger to the required AWS Lambda function. Using these triggers, you can allow only the required skills to access your AWS Lambda function. For more information, see [Configure the trigger for a Lambda function](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-an-aws-lambda-function.html#configuring-the-alexa-skills-kit-trigger).

    **Note:** Use the AWS Lambda function as an endpoint of your skill. If your are using custom web service, validate the skills. For more information, see [Host a Custom Skill as a Web Service](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-a-web-service.html).

-   You can securely store your sensitive data in the AWS Lambda function using environment variables. For more information, see Using [AWS Lambda environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
