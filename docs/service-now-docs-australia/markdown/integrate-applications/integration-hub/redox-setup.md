# Set up the Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke

Integrate your ServiceNow instance and the Redox engine with both inbound and outbound configuration.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Ensure you have the admin access to the Redox engine dashboard [https://dashboard.redoxengine.com/\#/login](https://dashboard.redoxengine.com/#/login).
-   Activate the Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## About this task

This task gives the procedure to set up both the inbound and outbound transactions between your ServiceNow instance and the Redox engine. After you configure the inbound transactions, the Redox engine can make calls to the ServiceNow REST Application Programming Interface \(API\). The outbound setup enables the ServiceNow instance to get authenticated and connect with the Redox engine.

## Procedure

1.  [Create a Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke connection and credential record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/redox-setup.md).

    This procedure enables the outbound transactions.

2.  [Configure the external Redox healthcare system as a source system for the Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/redox-setup.md).

    This procedure enables the inbound transactions.
