## Spoke flows

The Saba spoke provides a flow to pull tokens on a scheduled basis. Enable the flow to ensure that the spoke actions work properly.

|Flow|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Get Saba Token|Retrieves access token for Saba and generates a new refresh token after every six days.|

## Spoke actions

The Saba spoke provides actions to automate Saba tasks when events occur in the ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Get Authorization Code|Retrieves the authorization code that is required to get the access token in the Saba system.|
|Get Access Token|Retrieves the access token for Saba based on username, password, authorization code, connection alias, and application registry.|
|Get Refresh Token|Retrieves the refresh token for Saba.|
|Get Saba System Timezone Difference|Compares the time zones of the Saba system and ServiceNow platform and retrieves the difference.|
|Look up Courses Stream|Retrieves the main view to get course data. This is based on filters such as count per page, and start page.|
|Look up User Course Activity Stream|Retrieves user progress on course items.|
|Look up Users Stream|Retrieves data of employees from the the Saba system.|
|Save Assignment|Creates or updates a standard assignment.|

## Spoke module

The Saba spoke adds a Saba application to your ServiceNow instance. The Saba application has the following module:

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Credentials|Details required to pull tokens from the Saba system.|

## Saba spoke account requirements

The Saba spoke requires registering an OAuth 2.0 application in your Saba account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens for the Saba spoke. Record the generated Client ID, Client Secret, Application key, Integration user name, and password for later use.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
