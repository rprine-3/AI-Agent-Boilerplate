# Manage endpoint with OAuth 2.0 support

Manage endpoint for webhooks in third-party applications that support the OAuth 2.0 authentication. The endpoint enables webhooks to connect with your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: flow\_designer and connection\_admin

Subscription required: This feature requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

Ensure that you've installed the required spoke plugin.

Ensure that you have created an OAuth application endpoint for the external client applications to access the ServiceNow instance. For more information about creating an inbound OAuth application endpoint, see [OAuth Inbound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/oauth-inbound.md).

-   If you want to create an OAuth application endpoint for external client applications to access the ServiceNow instance, see [Create an endpoint for clients to access the instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.md).
-   If you want to create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients to access the ServiceNow instance, see [Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients \(machine to machine integration\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-jwt-endpoint.md).
