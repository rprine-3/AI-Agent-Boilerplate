# Client Software Distribution 2.0 application

Client Software Distribution 2.0 application \(CSD 2.0\) application enables administrators to distribute software from the service catalog using third-party management systems.

CSD 2.0 enables an administrator to create all the records necessary to deploy software from service catalog requests, including software models and catalog items. You can use the CSD 2.0 application to automate the deployment and revocation of software from a third-party software provider using the custom flows. You can define lease periods for software distributed from the Service Catalog and allow lease extensions in some cases, pending approvals. Deployment is accomplished using provider-specific spoke flows, subflows, and actions. For example, deployment is accomplished using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager spoke.

CSD 2.0 also integrates with Software Asset Management \(SAM Professional or SAM Foundation\) to manage license information of the deployed software.

**Note:** CSD 2.0 is different from [Client Software Distribution using Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd-integrationhub.md). CSD 2.0 is available on ServiceNow Store.

**Note:** To integrate CSD 2.0 with SAM, navigate to **Client Software Distribution 2.0** &gt; **Properties** and select the check box for **Determines whether to use SAM plugin\(SAM Foundation or SAM Professional\) tables for managing software models and licensing information**.\[Omitted image "CSD2-props.png"\] Alt text: Option to integrated with SAM.

## Important considerations

Ensure that you are aware of these differences between CSD and CSD 2.0:

Supported providers

</td><td>

Microsoft System Center Configuration Management \(SCCM\).

</td><td>

Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Jamf, and Microsoft Intune.

Procedure to add new provider

</td><td>

User must write extension point scripts.

</td><td>

User can use subflows in Workflow Studio. This is easier than writing extension point scripts in CSD.

</td></tr><tr><td>

License compliance check and entitlements

</td><td>

Tightly coupled with the SAM license data.

</td><td>

Flexibility to choose either the SAM tables or CSD 2.0 tables.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Data discovery

</td><td>

Microsoft SCCM provider uses PowerShell cmdlets for data discovery.

</td><td>

Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager spoke is updated to use the REST protocol for data discovery. This improves the performance and reduces load on MID Server as REST supports pagination.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software revocation

</td><td>

CSD can revoke software requested using the CSD catalog. CSD can also uninstall software using SCCM when revocation is triggered from the reclamation candidates for SCCM provider.

</td><td>

CSD 2.0 can revoke software requested using the CSD 2.0 catalog. CSD 2.0 can also uninstall software using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, and Jamf when revocation is triggered from the reclamation candidates.

</table>## Application version

CSD 2.0 v1.7.4 is the latest version.

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This application provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

</table>There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** To access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent, users must have the CSD Admin role.

## Available sample agentic workflows

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available sample agentic workflows and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. Use the available sample agentic workflow in AI Agent Studio so that AI agents can coordinate to solve complex problems.
