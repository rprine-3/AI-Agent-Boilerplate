# Retrieve SCCM data for client software distribution

Retrieve the collections and the list of applications available for deployment from your SCCM servers.

## Before you begin

**Role required**: sn\_client\_sf\_dist.csd\_admin or admin

Before starting this procedure:

-   Set up your Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) server, create the applications and collections, and configure the deployments you need. For information, see your SCCM documentation.
-   [Configure the Application Administrator role on the SCCM server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t-config-SCCM-deployment-manager.md) with the Application Deployment Manager role on the SCCM server.
-   Set up the MID Server to communicate with the SCCM server.
-   Add Powershell credentials to the ServiceNow Credentials \[discovery\_credentials\] table for the SCCM user who has the Application Deployment Manager role.

## About this task

To populate the Client Software Distribution application with SCCM data:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Client Software Distribution** &gt; **SCCM** &gt; **SCCM Server Instance**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the SCCM Server Instance form, identify the server by name and select the connection and credential alias.

    **Note:** Leave the **Fully qualified domain name** field empty.

4.  Click **Submit**.

    The new SCCM server appears in the list.

5.  Open the new SCCM record and click **Discover now** under **Related links**.

    The system runs the Discover SCCM flow that retrieves the application, collection, and deployment data from the SCCM server.
