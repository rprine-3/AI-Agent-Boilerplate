-   Reduces the occurrence of disputes and chargebacks

## Spoke requirements

**Note:** If used outside the spoke implementation, some of these plugins are licensable features and need appropriate licenses.

</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
