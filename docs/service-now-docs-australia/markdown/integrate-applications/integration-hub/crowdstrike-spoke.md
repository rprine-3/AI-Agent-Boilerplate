# CrowdStrike Spoke

Manage licenses for CrowdStrike Falcon protection suite by fetching details of devices with active Falcon sensors installed and checking license compliance.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

CrowdStrike spoke v1.1.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [CrowdStrike spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-crowdstrike.html).

## Spoke requirements

CrowdStrike account with a Falcon administrator role.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses when used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The CrowdStrike spoke provides actions to automate CrowdStrike tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance.

</table>**Note:** This spoke has a Look up User action and Software Asset Management related actions only.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
