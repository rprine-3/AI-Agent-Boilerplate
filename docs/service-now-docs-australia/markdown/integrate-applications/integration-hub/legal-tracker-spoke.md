# Legal Tracker Spoke

Legal Tracker spoke enables a seamless integration of the Thomson Reuters Legal Tracker application with a ServiceNow® instance to enable legal departments to create matters for Outside Firm and Outside Counsel Engagements and to track spends.

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Supported versions

Legal Tracker API \(REST API v1\)

## Spoke actions

Legal Tracker provides actions to automate the tasks in the following table when events occur in your ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** To avoid unauthorized access, make sure that the required users have the least privileges for the spoke actions.

## Spoke user roles

The Legal Tracker Spoke user \[sn\_legal\_trckr\_spk.user\] is available when the Legal Tracker spoke is installed. The role is required for users accessing Legal Tracker.

## Legal Tracker online account requirements

The Legal Tracker spoke requires a Legal Tracker account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
