# Looker Spoke

Manage subscriptions for Looker by analyzing usage based on last login time and activity sessions to determine which licenses are stale so that you can reclaim these licenses and realize your potential savings.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Looker spoke v1.0.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Looker spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-looker.html).

## Spoke requirements

Looker account with an admin role.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream Inputs \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   ServiceNow Workflow Studio - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The Looker spoke provides actions to automate Looker tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Role Management|Look up Roles|Retrieves all roles in an account.|
|User Management|Look up Users Stream|Retrieves all users in an account.|
|Update User|Modifies the specified user’s details.|
|Delete User|Deletes the specified user and associated records from the account.|
|User Inputs - Dynamic|Retrieves the list of fields to be used as dynamic input.|

**Note:** This spoke has a Look up User action and Software Asset Management related actions only.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Setting up the Looker spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-looker-spoke.md).
