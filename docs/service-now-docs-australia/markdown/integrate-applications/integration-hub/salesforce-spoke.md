</table>## Salesforce account requirements

The Salesforce spoke requires configuring your Salesforce account to generate an OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Grant token.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Salesforce spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-sf-spk.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls, which can run on an instance or MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the Salesforce alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
