## Spoke actions

The SAP Commerce Cloud provides actions to automate  tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Order Management|Look Up Order Details|Retrieves order details of the specified order.|
|Look Up Orders|Retrieves the order history for the specified user ID.|
|Shopping Cart|Look Up Shopping Cart|Retrieves the shopping cart content for the specified user ID.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
