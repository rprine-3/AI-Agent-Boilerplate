# Amazon SNS Spoke

Integrate ServiceNow with Amazon SNS. Manage topics and subscriptions, and delegate roles in Amazon SNS from your ServiceNow instance.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Amazon SNS spoke spoke v1.1.4 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Amazon SNS spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-amazon-sns.html).

## Supported version

This spoke was built for API version 2010-03-31, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Spoke requirements

-   User with full access to Amazon SNS.
-   Access Key ID and Secret Access Key of the user. Record these values for later use.

For information about creating and accessing keys, see the [AWS Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html) documentation.

## Spoke subflows

The Amazon SNS spoke provides a sample subflow to demonstrate automating Amazon SNS tasks. To customize the sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflow is, Amazon SNS Subscription. The subflow receives three types of messages; Notification, Subscription Confirmation, and Unsubscribe Confirmation. This subflow is triggered when you configure your ServiceNow instance to receive events from Amazon SNS. For more information about the required configurations, see [Receive events at your ServiceNow instance from Amazon SNS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/notification-sns.md).

**Note:** Spoke subflow can be used independently to subscribe for notifications from Amazon SNS. For more information about the configurations, see [Receive events at your ServiceNow instance from Amazon SNS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/notification-sns.md).

## Spoke actions

## Spoke module

The Amazon SNS spoke adds an AWS Configurations module to your ServiceNow instance. If you want receive events at your ServiceNow instance from Amazon SNS, you must specify the subflow internal name here. For more information about the required configurations, see [Receive events at your ServiceNow instance from Amazon SNS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/notification-sns.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Amazon SNS spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-amazon-sns.md).
