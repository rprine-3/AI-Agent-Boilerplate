## Spoke module

The UKG spoke adds a UKG application to your ServiceNow instance. The UKG application has these modules.

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Credentials|Details of the UKG users with permissions to perform the required actions.|
|Time Off Request Details|Details of the time off requests, along with the status.|
|Time Off Request Details Staging Tables|Details of the time off requests from the staging tables.|

## UKG spoke account requirements

The UKG spoke requires registering an OAuth 2.0 application in your UKG account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens for the UKG spoke. Record the generated Client ID, Client Secret, and Application key for later use.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
