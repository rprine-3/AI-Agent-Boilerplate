## About this task

-   For identification purposes, all calculated field name starts with **CF**.
-   Create all calculated fields for this report before developing the report. Thus, all fields are available while creating the report.

But ensure that the report field name or column heading override for the respective field \(if it’s given in the report document\) is same as it is in the report document. Report field label should be same as it is in the report document. Else, the developed action fails.
-   **Group Column Heading** for each business object in the **Group Column Headings** section should be empty.
-   Ensure that you add parenthesis in filter while creating it.
-   All reports must be shared or owned by the ISU user that accesses these actions on the ServiceNow platform.
