# Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke

Enable communications with your customers using the Redox platform from your ServiceNow instance.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Spoke version

Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke v1.0.3 is the current version. For version history of the spoke, see [Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-redox-electronic-health-record-spoke.html).

## Key features

The Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke enables a hospital, payer \(insurance\), or life sciences company to:

-   Enable interoperability with an electronic medical record \(EMR\) or another healthcare system by leveraging the ServiceNow Healthcare and Life Sciences data model that is based on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA\) and the Health Level Seven International \(HL7\) industry standards. For more information, see [Healthcare and Life Sciences data model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/hcls-serv-mgmt-core.md).
-   Improve patient care and reduce cost by reducing data duplicity and entry.
-   Connect to the healthcare ecosystem by enabling patient-centric workflows.

## Spoke requirements

-   Administrator access to the Redox Dashboard.
-   **API Key** and **Source Secret**. You can find these values in the dashboard of your Redox account. For more information, see [Authenticate an API key](https://docs.redoxengine.com/how-to/send-and-manage-requests/authenticate-an-api-key) in the [Redox documentation](https://docs.redoxengine.com/).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Redox Electronic Health Record Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/redox-setup.md).
