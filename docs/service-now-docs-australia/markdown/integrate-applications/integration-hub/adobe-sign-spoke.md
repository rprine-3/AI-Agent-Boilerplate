# Adobe Sign Spoke

Automate the process of sending a legal document to an individual or list of recipients for digital signature using Adobe Sign. For example, automate employee onboarding and offboarding, or sending non-disclosure agreements, legal agreements, and statements of work for digital signature. Use ServiceNow data in document templates and enable users to upload documents for signature as needed.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Adobe Sign spoke v2.10.1 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Adobe Acrobat Sign spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-adobe-sign.html).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for Adobe Sign API version v6, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Key features

Adobe Sign spoke enables a flow designer to:

-   Automate the process of sending a legal document to an individual or list of recipients for digital signature.
-   Copy and customize sample flows for sending transient documents or Adobe Sign library documents for digital signature.
-   Discover and synchronize the Adobe Sign documents.
-   Pause a flow until an agreement or document is signed. A scripted REST API webhook waits for the recipient to sign the document.
-   Use values from a signed document in a flow.
-   Manage the life cycle of documents in Adobe Sign from the ServiceNow instance.

## Spoke requirements

-   Adobe Sign account
-   Adobe Sign account admin credentials to perform the required account specific tasks in Adobe Sign
-   Adobe Sign group admin credentials to perform the required group specific tasks in Adobe Sign.

    **Note:** Account admin or group admin can add users to the groups. These users can access information specific to their group only.

-   Adobe Sign application configured to integrate with ServiceNow
-   Adobe Sign application details such as application ID and client secret.
-   ServiceNow admin credentials to create and synchronise the required Adobe Sign groups with ServiceNow.

    **Note:**

    -   This is the default admin role that is created when the Adobe Sign spoke is activated.
    -   ServiceNow admin has access to information about all Adobe Sign groups synchronized with ServiceNow and all tables part of the Adobe Sign spoke.
    -   User role specific to the group is created in ServiceNow, when the group is created in the ServiceNow instance. Group users have access to information specific to their Adobe Sign groups only and can view only the group-specific data from the tables that are part of the Adobe Sign spoke.
-   Integration Hub subscription

See the [Adobe Sign development](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/sign/docs.html) documentation for instructions on creating and configuring custom applications.

## Spoke flows

The Adobe Sign spoke provides sample flows to demonstrate automating the Adobe Sign tasks. To customize a sample flow, copy it to the required application scope. Available sample flows include:

|Flow|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Adobe Sign - Send NDA Demo|Sends a statement of work for digital signature using a Adobe Sign library document when a Service Catalog request is created by the **Adobe Sign - Statement of Work Demo** item. Before using this flow, activate the **Adobe Sign - Statement of Work Demo** catalog item.|
|Adobe Sign - Statement of Work Demo|Sends a non-disclosure agreement for digital signature using a Adobe Sign library document when a Service Catalog request is created by the **Adobe Sign - Statement of Work Demo** item. Before using this flow, activate the **Adobe Sign - Statement of Work Demo** catalog item.|

The Adobe Sign spoke adds catalog items for use with the Adobe Sign spoke sample flows. Before triggering an Adobe Sign spoke sample flow, activate these catalog items.

|Catalog item|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|Adobe Sign - Statement of Work Demo|Sends a statement of work for digital signature using a Adobe Sign library document.|
|Adobe Sign - Send NDA Demo|Sends a non-disclosure agreement for digital signature using a Adobe Sign library document.|

## Spoke subflows

The Adobe Sign spoke provides a sample subflow to demonstrate automating Adobe Sign tasks. To customize the sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflow is, Get Documents Per Group. The subflow retrieves documents relevant to an Adobe Sign group and stores them in the AdobeSign Documents table.

</table>## Spoke scheduled job

To delete the passwords related to Add Participant to Agreement with Password Authentication action which are stored over the last 30 days, you can use the Scheduler To Remove Participant Password scheduled job. You can also change when the scheduler runs.

To set this up, navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs** &gt; **Scheduler To Remove Participant Password** and activate the scheduled job.

## Groups and user roles

Create a group in your ServiceNow instance to synchronize the group with the corresponding group in Adobe Sign.

User role specific to the group is created in ServiceNow, when the group is created in the ServiceNow instance. For example, a HR group user role, sn\_adobesign\_spoke.HR, is created when the HR group is created in ServiceNow. ServiceNow admin can assign these group user roles to users and control access to the group-specific information such as:

-   Documents and agreements
-   Connection and credential aliases
-   Credential records
-   Application registries
-   Data in tables of the Adobe Sign spoke

To run flows and subflows, group users must also have these roles:

-   connection\_admin
-   credential\_admin
-   flow\_designer
-   oauth\_admin
-   script\_debugger
-   view\_changer

Only ServiceNow admin has access to information about all Adobe Sign groups that are synchronised with the ServiceNow instance.

## Adobe Acrobat Sign account requirements

The Adobe Sign spoke requires creating a custom app on your Adobe Sign account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

**Note:** A connection and credential alias is specific to a group in Adobe Sign.

A sample connection and credential alias is provided for demonstration purpose. ServiceNow admin must create an alias for each Adobe Sign group to synchronize that group with the ServiceNow instance. For example, you can have different connection and credential alias records one for each BU in your organization such as HR, Legal, Finance and so on. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Synchronize Adobe Sign group with ServiceNow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-adobe-sign.md).
