## Spoke version

Google Cloud Functions v1.0.3 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Google Cloud Functions spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-google-cloud-functions.html).

## Supported versions

## Google Cloud Functions spoke requirements

The Google Cloud Functions spoke requires a custom app that you create in Google Cloud Platform.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   [Google Identity and Access Spoke]()
-   [Google Cloud VPC Access Spoke]()
-   [Google Cloud Storage Spoke]()
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The Google Cloud Functions spoke provides actions to automate Google Cloud Functions tasks when events occurs in the ServiceNow AI Platform. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Google Cloud Functions spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/gcloud-func-setup.md).
