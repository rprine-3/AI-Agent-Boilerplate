</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Microsoft OneDrive sharing management AI agent|Adds or removes a collaborator and manages their permissions for a file or folder in Microsoft OneDrive. Also, lists all the collaborator details associated with a file or folder.|
|Microsoft OneDrive drive management AI agent|Retrieves the metadata of a specific drive in Microsoft OneDrive.|
|Microsoft OneDrive file management AI agent|Manages files, file versions, and attachments in Microsoft OneDrive. Also, retrieves details of the required file.|
|Microsoft OneDrive folder management AI agent|Manages folders in Microsoft OneDrive.|
|Microsoft OneDrive permission management AI agent|Creates sharing link for a drive item and manages permissions.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Spoke module

Bi-directional webhooks can be set up to get notifications about the required events. Routing policy defines conditions that must be met to notify the ServiceNow app. These conditions are based on the events in OneDrive that you want to be notified about. When the conditions are met, a routing policy triggers the associated subflow, which in turn automates the OneDrive tasks.

The bi-directional webhooks require separate setup and can be used independently without using the spoke actions. By default, the OneDrive Webhooks application is available in the OneDrive spoke and has the following modules:

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|OneDrive SyncToken|Enables you to view SyncTokens of OneDrive.|
|OneDrive Webhook Registries|Enables you to create and view the OneDrive webhooks in ServiceNow.|
|OneDrive Webhook Routing Policy|Enables you to create and view the routing policies for the OneDrive webhooks in ServiceNow. You can also customize the conditions in the routing policies as per your requirement.|

## OneDrive Online account requirements

The Microsoft OneDrive spoke requires a custom app that you create in Microsoft Azure.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

-   **Single tenant**

    The OneDrive spoke includes the OneDrive alias record to authorize actions on Microsoft OneDrive. Select this alias in the Tenant record to authorize changes in Microsoft OneDrive for a single tenant.


For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Microsoft OneDrive spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-msonedrive.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls that can run either on an instance or, optionally, through a MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the Microsoft OneDrive alias to configure where actions run and, if needed, specify MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
