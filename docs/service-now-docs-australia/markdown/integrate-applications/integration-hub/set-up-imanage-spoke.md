# Set up iManage spoke

Integrate a ServiceNow instance and the iManage spoke by using  iManage credentials to authenticate  ServiceNow  requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the iManage spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## Request an application with iManage

Request an application with iManage and register it in the iManage Control Center.

### Before you begin

You must have an iManage account and tenant administrator credentials.

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  As an iManage Cloud \(cloudimanage.com\) customer, send an email to appregistration@imanage.com with the following details.

    -   Application Name: ServiceNow - External Storage
    -   Redirect\_Url: `<your-instance>/oauth_redirect.do`
    -   Customers name: Give your Customer name
    -   Tenant/Customers ID: Give your tenant or customer ID
    iManage will review and respond with the Client ID and Secret

2.  Once you have the Client ID/ Secret, register your application in iManage Control Center by following the document [Adding an application](https://docs.imanage.com/cloud/cc-help/en-US/Adding_an_application.html).

    **Note:**

    -   This integration capability has been validated for iManage cloud. If you want to use it for iManage on-premises, validate that it meets your requirements before using it.
    -   If you are a iManage on-premises user, follow the document [Adding an application package](https://docs.imanage.com/cc-help/10.4.3/en-US/Adding_Apps.html) to register your application.

### What to do next

[Register iManage as OAuth provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-imanage-spoke.md).

## Register iManage as OAuth provider

Register iManage as an OAuth provider to allow the instance to request OAuth 2.0 tokens.

### Before you begin

Note the following requirements:

-   Integration Hub subscription.
-   iManage access credentials
-   The iManage spoke must be activated

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  On your ServiceNow® instance, navigate to **System OAuth** &gt; **Application Registry**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the page titled **What kind of OAuth application**, select **Connect to a third-party OAuth Provider**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Unique name to identify the record, for example, `iManage OAuth profile`.|
    |Client ID|Application ID of the iManage application.|
    |Client Secret|The Client Secret you generated when you created the application.|
    |Default Grant type|The value in this field should be **Password**.|
    |Token URL|The value in this field should be `https://cloudimanage.com/auth/oauth2/token`. You might have to unlock the field to enter the value.|

5.  Right-click the form header, and select **Save**.

    The system validates the OAuth credentials.


### Result

iManage is registered as an OAuth provider, which enables the instance to request OAuth 2.0 tokens.

### What to do next
