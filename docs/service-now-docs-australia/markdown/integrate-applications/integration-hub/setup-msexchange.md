# Set up the Microsoft Exchange Server spoke

Connect your ServiceNow instance with the Microsoft Exchange Server by setting up the connection and credential records for both the Microsoft Exchange Server that are provided when you install Integration Hub on your instance.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the latest Microsoft Exchange Server spoke plugin on your ServiceNow instance.
-   Role required: admin.

## About this task

The Microsoft Exchange Server spoke provides two aliases: Exchange and Exchange\_https and their respective configuration templates as out of the box components when you install the Microsoft Exchange Server . These out of the box components enable you to easily set up the connection and credential records for both the aliases by just providing the connection and credential information. The out of the box components are already configured for you. To learn how to create the connections and credential records, see:

-   [Configure a connection for the Exchange alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-msexchange.md)
-   [Configure a connection for the Exchange\_https alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-msexchange.md)

You can perform all spoke actions except the Create Calendar Event For User and Lookup Room Availability actions. The Create Calendar Event For User and Lookup Room Availability actions are supported only on Exchange Server 2013.

**Note:** The user details that are provided in the credential record must have the application impersonation role.

To use the Create Calendar Event For User and Lookup Room Availability actions, perform the same steps again for the Exchange\_https connection and credential alias. MID Server isn’t necessary to perform this action.

## Configure a connection for the Exchange alias

Configure a connection for the Exchange alias to establish a connection between the ServiceNow® instance and the Microsoft Exchange Server host.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Click the **Integrations** tab.

3.  Under **Connections**, toggle and enable the **Outbound** connections.

4.  Locate the **Exchange** alias.

    **Tip:** To find the alias, in the Search all connections field, enter `Exchange`.

        \[Omitted image "exchange-server-conn1.png"\] Alt text: Configure the default connection.

    -   To manage more than one Microsoft Exchange Server spoke connection records, you should create a new child alias record by clicking **Add Connection**. For more information about using multiple connections, see [Supporting multiple connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/support-multiple-connections.md).
