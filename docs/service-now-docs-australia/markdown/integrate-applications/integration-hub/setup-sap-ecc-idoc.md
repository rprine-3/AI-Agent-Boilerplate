# Set up the SAP ECC IDoc spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and SAP ECC IDoc spoke by using the Basic Auth credentials to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the SAP ECC IDoc spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## Configure MID Server for the SAP ECC IDoc spoke

Configure MID Server using the SAP proprietary JAR files to integrate SAP ECC IDoc account with your ServiceNow® instance.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **Security**.

    **Note:** This is applicable only if your MID Server is installed on a Linux machine

2.  Disable the MIME type validation for file attachments.

    \[Omitted image "mime-type-sap-ecc-rfc.png"\] Alt text: Option to disable the MIME type validation

    **Note:** This is applicable only if your MID Server is installed on a Linux machine.

3.  Navigate to **MID Server** &gt; **JAR Files**.

4.  Upload the required SAP proprietary files \(JAR, SO, or DLL\) obtained after contacting your SAP ECC IDoc admin.

    For more information, see [Synchronize a JAR file to MID Servers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_SynchronizeAJARFiletoMIDServers.md).


### What to do next

Ensure that the files are synchronised in the `<MID-Server-root-directory>/agent/extlib` directory. If the files aren't synchronised, restart the MID Server.

## Create a credential record for the SAP ECC IDoc spoke

Create a credential record for the SAP ECC IDoc account. The SAP ECC IDoc spoke connection and credential alias uses these credentials to authorize actions.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**.

2.  Click **New**.

    The system displays this message: `What type of Credentials would you like to create?`

    |Active|Option to actively use the credential record.|
    |Order|Order to apply this credential. For example, `100`.|
    |Credential alias|Credential alias associated with the spoke.|

5.  Click **Submit**.


## Create a connection record for the SAP ECC IDoc spoke

Create a connection record for your SAP ECC IDoc account. The SAP ECC IDoc spoke connection and credential aliases use these connections to perform actions in SAP ECC IDoc.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials Aliases**.

2.  Open the alias record for SAP ECC IDoc.

3.  From the **Connections** tab, click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill these fields.

    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name to uniquely identify the record. For example, `SAP ECC IDoc Connection`.|
    |Credential|Credential record created for SAP ECC IDoc spoke. For example, `SAP ECC IDoc Cred`.|
    |Connection alias|Alias record associated with this connection.|
    |Host|Fully qualified domain name of the target host where the SAP ECC IDoc server is installed.|
    |Active|Option to actively use the connection record.|
    |Domain|Domain that the action runs in.|
    |Override default port|Target port used by the connection. If blank, the system uses the default port.|
    |Use MID server|Option to use a MID Server for this connection. Select the check box and define the fields in the **Advanced MID Server Configuration** tab.|
