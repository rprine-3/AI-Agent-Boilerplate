# Set up the Azure Application Insights spoke

Create a connection alias on your ServiceNow instance. The alias enables your ServiceNow instance to request OAuth tokens from the Microsoft Azure Application Insights and enables the authenticate its requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Microsoft Azure Application Insights spoke.
-   Role required: admin

## Register Microsoft Azure Application Insights as an OAuth provider

Create an OAuth application on Microsoft Azure that authenticates requests for OAuth tokens from your ServiceNow instance.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Log in to [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Select **App registrations**.

3.  Select **New registration**.

4.  Fill the form.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the OAuth application.|
    |Supported account types|Option to specify who can use the OAuth application that you're creating to access Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.|
    |Redirect URI \(optional\)|Option to provide the redirect URI. The redirect URI format is https://&lt;instance-name&gt;.service-now.com/oauth\_redirect.do. From the Select a platform list, select **Web**.|
