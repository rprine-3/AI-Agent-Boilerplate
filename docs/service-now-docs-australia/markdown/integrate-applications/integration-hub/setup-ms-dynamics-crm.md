# Set up Microsoft Dynamics CRM spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Microsoft Dynamics CRM by using the Windows credentials to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request Integration Hub subscription.
-   Install Microsoft AD.
-   Activate the Microsoft Dynamics CRM spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## About this task

Perform these steps to use all Microsoft Dynamics CRM spoke actions.

## Configure Microsoft Dynamics CRM application

Create a custom OAuth application from your Microsoft Dynamics CRM account to enable OAuth 2.0 authentication with the Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

### Before you begin

Microsoft Dynamics CRM requirements:

-   Microsoft Dynamics CRM account
-   [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com) account
-   Role required: Microsoft Dynamics CRM admin

### About this task

Complete these steps from your Azure Developer account. See the [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/) product documentation for instructions on creating and configuring custom applications.

### Procedure

1.  Log in to the [Microsoft Azure App registration portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) with your organization credentials.

2.  Register a new custom application by filling in the application name, the supported account type, and the redirect URI, and then click **Register**.

    An overview of the application's basic information is shown.

3.  Copy the application ID to a text file.

    You will use this ID and the client secret generated in the next step to register the app as a third-party OAuth provider on your ServiceNow instance. You use the application ID as the client ID when you connect the application to ServiceNow.

4.  Add a client secret.

    1.  In Microsoft Azure, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Certificates &amp; secrets**.

    2.  Provide a description and an expiration date and click **Add**.

        **Note:** The client secret is only displayed in plain text for a short time. You use the client secret when you connect the application to ServiceNow.

5.  Enable the permissions you want the application to support.

    For more information, see the [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

    1.  In Microsoft Azure, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **API permissions**.

    2.  Click the Microsoft Graph tile.

    3.  Select the Delegated or Application permissions that the application supports.

        Delegated permissions enable the application to access the API as a signed-in user. Application permissions enable the application to run as a background service or daemon without a signed-in user.

    4.  Click **Add permissions**.


### What to do next

[Register Microsoft Dynamics CRM as OAuth provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ms-dynamics-crm.md).

## Register Microsoft Dynamics CRM as OAuth provider

Use the information generated during Microsoft Dynamics CRM account configuration to register Microsoft Dynamics CRM as an OAuth provider and allow the instance to request OAuth 2.0 tokens.

### Before you begin

-   Request Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
-   Create a Microsoft Dynamics CRM application.
-   Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  In ServiceNow, navigate to **System OAuth** &gt; **Application Registry**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the screen titled **What kind of OAuth application**, select **Connect to a third-party OAuth Provider**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Value required|
    |-----|--------------|
    |Name|Enter any name to uniquely identify the record, for example `Dynamics CRM OAuth profile`.|
    |Client ID|Enter the Application ID of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM application you created in Azure.|
    |Client Secret|Enter the Client Secret you generated when you created the application in Azure.|
    |Default Grant type|Select **Authorization Code**.|
    |Authorization URL|Click the lock icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-lock.png"\] Alt text: Lock icon\), enter `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` followed by a question mark and the resource attribute of your instance, and then click the lock icon again.

    |Token URL|Click the lock icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-lock.png"\] Alt text: Lock icon\), enter `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token`, and then click the lock icon again.|
    |Redirect URL|Click the lock icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-lock.png"\] Alt text: Lock icon\), enter `https://<instance>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`, and then click the lock icon again.|

5.  In the **OAuth Entity Scopes** related list, edit the provided entity scope to include the URL of your Microsoft Dynamics CRM application.

    The name and the OAuth scope are often the same string.

    \[Omitted image "oauth-entity-scopes-ms-dyn-crm.png"\] Alt text: The Microsoft Dynamics CRM OAuth entity scopes.

6.  Right-click the form header, and click **Save**.

    The system validates the OAuth credentials.


### What to do next

Create credential record for Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

## Create Credential records for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM spoke

Create Credential records for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM custom OAuth application you created during Microsoft Dynamics CRM account configuration. The Microsoft Dynamics CRM spoke connection and credential aliases use these credentials to authorize actions.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure
