# SAP ECC RFC Spoke

The SAP ECC RFC spoke is built by Bristlecone, Inc. Manage items, journals, procurements, and others, in SAP ECC RFC account from your ServiceNow® instance.

## Request apps on Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html). Starting on March 1st 2022, all SAP spokes will be available only on the Store.

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

SAP ECC RFC spoke v2.11.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [SAP ECC RFC spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-sap-ecc-rfc.html).

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for these SAP ECC RFC versions and the spoke is compatible with versions listed below:

-   SAP application version where spoke is developed: SAP EHP8 for ERP6.0
-   Compatible SAP application versions: SAP ECC6.0 Base pack until latest SAP EHP8 for ERP6.0
-   SAP JCo: 3.0.20 or later

## Spoke requirements

-   Contact the admin of your SAP ECC RFC account and obtain these SAP proprietary JAR files and other required files:

    -   `sapjco3.jar`.
    -   `libsapjco3.so`: If your MID Server is installed on a Linux machine, obtain this file.
    -   `sapjco3.dll`: If your MID Server is installed on a Windows machine, obtain this file.
    A JAR file, `sapConnector-1.0.1.jar` , is available along with the spoke to provide custom interface to interact and execute RFCs and IDocs in the SAP ECC RFC account. The JAR file is installed as part of the spoke in your ServiceNow instance.

-   Copy and record the client value of the target host where the SAP ECC RFC server is installed.
-   Configure the values of these system properties:
    -   **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.serialized.val\_size\_limit**: This property serializes JSON objects and ensures that the data is in the required format. Specify the number of bytes as per your requirement. For more information, see [Workflow Studio system\\n properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flow-designer-system-properties.md).
    -   **glide.rest.max\_content\_length**: This property specifies the payload size. Specify the maximum payload size you want to use in your flows. The maximum value you can specify for this property is, 25 MB.
-   If you are using this spoke along with the SAP ECC IDoc, SAP S4 HANA IDoc, SAP S4 HANA RFC spokes, during spoke upgrades, ensure that you upgrade all the spokes to their latest versions.

    **Note:** If you are upgrading the spoke from an earlier version, make sure to restart the MID server.


## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Outputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_outputs\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Spoke user roles

The SAP ECC RFC spoke provides user roles to control access to data.

-   Users with the sn\_sap\_ecc\_rfc\_spo.SAP\_ECC\_RFC\_Spoke\_Admin role have access to the spoke tables.
-   Users with the sn\_sap\_ecc\_rfc\_spo.SAP\_ECC\_RFC\_Spoke\_Read role can view data in the SAP ECC RFCs table and module.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the SAP ECC RFC spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-sap-ecc-rfc.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use Remote Function Call \(RFC\) protocol \(SAP Proprietary protocol – SAP Standard Interface\), which can run on an instance or MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the SAP ECC RFC spoke alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information about running actions on the MID Server, see [Integration steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integration-steps.md)

**Note:**

-   If the MID Server is installed on a Linux machine, perform the configurations as outlined in [Configure MID Server for the SAP ECC RFC spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-sap-ecc-rfc.md).
-   If the MID Server is installed on a Windows machine, no configurations are needed.

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
