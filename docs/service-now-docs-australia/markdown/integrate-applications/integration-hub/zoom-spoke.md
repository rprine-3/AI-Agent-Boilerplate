</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Zoom user management AI agent|Looks up the details of a user, and creates, deletes, and disassociates a user.|
|Zoom meeting management AI agent|Creates, ends, and deletes meetings, looks up meeting details, and adds a meeting registrant.|
|Zoom cloud recording management AI agent|Looks up meeting recordings and meeting recording settings.|
|Zoom chat management AI agent|Enables users to create and manage chat channels, send and update messages, and handle member-related operations.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Zoom spoke requirements

These actions use REST calls, which can run on an instance or Zoom spoke See [Building flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flows.md) for more information. Use the connection record that is associated with the Zoom alias to configure where actions run and set Zoom spoke selection attributes. For more information about the alias, see [Connection and credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/zoom-spoke.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

This spoke uses the Zoom Connection &amp; Credential Alias record to authorize actions. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Zoom spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-zoom.md).
