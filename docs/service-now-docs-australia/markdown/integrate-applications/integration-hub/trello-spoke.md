# Trello Spoke

Manage Trello Enterprise subscriptions using your ServiceNow instance. Analyze data usage for Trello enterprise and reclaim idle subscriptions.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Trello spoke v1.5.1 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Trello spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-trello.html).

## Spoke requirements

-   Trello Enterprise admin access
-   Ensure that your Trello subscription is linked to Atlassian account.
-   Ensure that your authorized account has both Trello Enterprise admin and Atlassian account admin access.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke flows

The Trello spoke provides the Upsert Trello Board flow to check if a new board has been created in the Trello Boards table, or if an existing board has been updated and accordingly synchronizes it in Trello. To customize the sample flow, copy it to the required application scope.

## Spoke subflows

The Trello spoke provides the Process Trello Webhook subflow to retrieve data based on the changes happening in Trello. The subflow is executed when the webhook is triggered. To customize the sample flow, copy it to the required application scope.

When any changes occur in the board, the webhook is triggered, the Process Trello Webhook subflow is executed, and the board changes can be viewed in the subflow logs.

</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Generate Trello API key and token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/trello-setup.md) and [Create a Trello connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/trello-setup.md).
