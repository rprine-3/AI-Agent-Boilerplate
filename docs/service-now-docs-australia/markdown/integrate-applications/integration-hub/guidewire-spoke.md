## Spoke version

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for Guidewire application programming interface \(API\) version Elysian \(2022.05\), but may be compatible with later versions. This spoke also supports APIs on Guidewire Cloud InsuranceSuite.

## Key features

Guidewire spoke application enables a flow designer to build workflows from actions which call the Guidewire InsuranceSuite cloud APIs. These actions can be called from any subflows within the insurance applications which provide real-time integration with Guidewire. Manage ClaimCenter, PolicyCenter, and ContactManager actions that:

-   Create, cancel, submit, validate, update, and close claims.
-   Manage customer contact details.
-   Retrieve policies associated with the customer.
-   Delete or change claim details.
-   Add notes to claims.

## Spoke requirements

Guidewire account

## Spoke dependencies

Ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** If used outside the spoke implementation, some of these plugins are licensable features and need appropriate licenses.

## Spoke actions

The Guidewire spoke provides actions to trigger Guidewire's cloud InsuranceSuite processes when events happen in your ServiceNow instance. This spoke integrates with most APIs from Guidewire's ContactManager, PolicyCenter, and ClaimCenter relevant to auto and property insurance claims. You can extend and customize the available actions for your business needs.

**Note:**

-   Across all Guidewire actions included in this spoke, only a subset of the fields from Guidewire responses are parsed into the action outputs. This spoke returns the entire Guidewire JSON response.
-   Streaming actions retrieve records individually instead of the entire list simultaneously.

</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
