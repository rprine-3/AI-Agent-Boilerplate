# SAP Ariba Spoke

The SAP Ariba spoke is built by Bristlecone, Inc. Manage the primary and transactional data of buying and sourcing suites in the SAP Ariba instance from your ServiceNow instance. The SAP Ariba system offers a single SaaS offering edition and the SAP Ariba spoke works as-is irrespective of the datacenter chosen.

**Important:** The SAP Ariba spoke uses the ITK-style service \(file upload or file download\) REST APIs via MIME multi-part format, and not ITK jar. So, although SAP Ariba announced [end of life](https://support.ariba.com/item/view/KB0547223) of ITK jar by Dec 31st, 2023, which resulted in the removal of ITK from the SAP download site and SAP Portal, there is no functionality impact to the existing SAP Ariba spoke.

## Spoke scheduled script and system property

A scheduled script, Ariba Export Task Scheduler, and system property, **sn\_sap\_ariba\_spoke.ariba.export.task.scheduler**, are available along with the spoke. The system property defines the number of days by which all the records older than this will be purged. The script uses this value to purge the records that have not been copied to the data source.

-   To view the scheduled script, enter `sysauto_script_list.do` in the filter navigator and search for the script, Ariba Export Task Scheduler.
-   To view the system property, navigate to **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties** and search for the system property, **sn\_sap\_ariba\_spoke.ariba.export.task.scheduler**.

You can configure the scheduled script and system property according to your requirement.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls, which can run on an instance or MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the SAP Ariba alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information about running actions on the MID Server, see [Integration steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integration-steps.md)

**Note:** The Linux server that is needed to create the SSH credential record, must be installed in the same network’s machine or virtual machine where your MID Server is installed.

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
