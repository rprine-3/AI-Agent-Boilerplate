-   Messages API version v1
-   Voice API version v1

## Spoke requirements

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke subflows

The Vonage spoke provides sample subflows to demonstrate automating Vonage tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Vonage SMS Webhook|Processes the SMS requests from Vonage.|
|Vonage Voice Webhook|Processes the voice requests from Vonage.|
|Vonage WhatsApp Webhook|Processes the WhatsApp requests from Vonage.|

To customize the default subflow, you must a create a copy of the sample subflow and customize the subflow as per your requirement. While customizing subflows, you must ensure that the subflows are configured to avoid infinite loops.

## Spoke triggers

Use triggers in the Vonage spoke to subscribe to the required events. The endpoint enables webhooks to connect with your ServiceNow instance. You can configure the flows to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met. The supported events are:

|Category|Trigger|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|Call Management|Voice Ringing|Trigger is initiated when a call is made from Vonage and the number is Ringing.|
|Voice Answered|Trigger is initiated when a call is made from Vonage and the call is Answered.|
|Voice Completed|Trigger is initiated when a call is made from Vonage and the call is Completed.|
|SMS Management|SMS Delivered|Trigger is initiated when an SMS is sent from Vonage to a number.|
|SMS Failed|Trigger is initiated when an SMS is sent from Vonage and it fails.|
|SMS Accepted|Trigger is initiated when a message has been accepted for delivery, but has not yet delivered.|

For information about setting up the triggers for the Vonage spoke, see Setup the trigger for vonage spoke.

</table>## Spoke module

Bi-directional webhooks can be set up to be notified about the required events. Routing policy defines conditions that must be met to notify the ServiceNow instance. These conditions are based on the events in Vonage that you want to be notified about. When the conditions are met, routing policy triggers the associated subflow, which in turn automates the Vonage tasks. By default, the Vonage Spoke application is available and has the following modules:

-   Vonage Webhook Registries
-   Vonage WebHook Routing Policies

Use the Vonage Webhook Registries module to assign a token and provide the API path. You must generate a Callback URL here and provide this URL in Vonage. Default routing policies are provided as a reference in the Vonage WebHook Routing Policies module. Customize these routing policies as per your requirement. The routing policy supports these fields:

-   Keywords
-   Call Direction
-   Call Status
-   Event Type
-   From
-   SMS Status
-   SMS Text
-   To
-   WhatsApp Message Status
-   WhatsApp Text
-   Show Related Fields

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

Two connection and credential aliases are available along with the Vonage spoke:

|Vonage alias|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|VonagePrimary|Required for the actions that manage SMS, number, and account.|
|Vonage|Required for the actions that manage calls and WhatsApp.|

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Vonage spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-vonage-spoke.md).
