# CSD 2.0 for Jamf

Use the CSD 2.0 along with the Jamf spoke to deploy and revoke software deployments from Jamf and manage distributions on hosts.

To use the Jamf spoke with CSD 2.0, you must activate Jamf spoke and CSD 2.0.

The Jamf spoke contains actions that CSD 2.0 uses to deploy software from a service catalog request and manage user and device collections on Jamf servers. In addition, CSD 2.0 can manage license counts for deployed software using ServiceNow Software Asset Management, revoke software deployed by Jamf without user interaction, and manage lease periods.

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This application provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance. The agents guide you through the required details, confirms actions for safety, and attempts to handle errors while performing operations.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Jamf group membership addition AI agent|Enables users to add members to static groups in Jamf.|
|Jamf group deletion management AI agent|Enables users to delete groups in Jamf.|
|Jamf application targets addition AI agent|Enables users to add static groups as targets to applications in Jamf.|
|Jamf application targets removal AI agent|Enables users to remove static groups as targets from applications in Jamf.|
|Jamf group creation management AI agent|Enables users easily and deterministically create groups in Jamf.|
|Jamf group membership removal AI agent|Enables users to remove members from static groups in Jamf.|

**Note:**

-   To access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent, users must have the CSD Admin role.
-   Ensure that you install the latest version of Jamf spoke.
-   To use the AI agents, ensure that you are using the default connection that is available with the Jamf spoke.

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

## Available sample agentic workflows

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available sample agentic workflows and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. Use the available sample agentic workflow in AI Agent Studio so that AI agents can coordinate to solve complex problems. To modify the available sample agentic workflow as per your requirement, see [Modify an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/modify-aia-use-case.md).

Available sample agentic workflow includes:
