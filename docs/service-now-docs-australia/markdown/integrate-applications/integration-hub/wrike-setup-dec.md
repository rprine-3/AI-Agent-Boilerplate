# Set up the Wrike spoke

Integrate your ServiceNow instance with Wrike by creating a custom OAuth application in the Wrike API Developer Site and configuring a connection in the Wrike spoke.

## Before you begin

-   Copy and record the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** by logging in to [Wrike account](https://login.wrike.com/login/?redirectUrl=/frontend/apps/index.html#/api) as an admin and add an app. For more information about creating an app, see [OAuth 2.0 Authorization](https://developers.wrike.com/oauth-20-authorization/).
-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Wrike spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Select **Integrations**.

3.  Select the **Connections** tab.

4.  Locate the alias for **Wrike** and select **View Details**.

    -   To configure the default connection and credential alias record that is shipped along with the Wrike, click **View Details**.

    -   To manage more than one Wrike spoke connection records, you should create child alias record by clicking **Add Connection**. For more information about using multiple connections, see [Supporting multiple connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/support-multiple-connections.md).
    If you're configuring the spoke for the first time, click **Configure**. Otherwise, select **Edit**.
