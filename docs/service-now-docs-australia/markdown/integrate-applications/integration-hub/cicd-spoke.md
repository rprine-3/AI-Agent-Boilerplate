# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery \(CICD\) Spoke

Build a Continuous Integration and Continuation Delivery \(CICD\) pipeline for your ServiceNow instances. You can automate publishing and installing applications from an application repository, activating plugins, running ATF test suites, and running an instance scan.

## CICD spoke application

The CICD spoke application is installed by default from the Orlando upgrade onward.

## Spoke version

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery \(CICD\) spoke v1.0.11 is the latest version.

## Supported versions

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery \(CICD\) REST API version 1.0.0, which is a ServiceNow AI Platform feature active by default.

## Spoke flows

This spoke has no sample flows.

## Spoke subflows

The Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery \(CICD\) spoke provides sample subflows in the draft state to demonstrate automating CICD tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

## CICD account requirements

The Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery \(CICD\) spoke requires creating basic authorization credentials. The user credentials must have either the admin or sn\_cicd.sys\_ci\_automation roles to authorize CICD actions and flows.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the CICD alias record to authorize actions on local and remote instances. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery \(CICD\) spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-cicd.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls, which can run on an instance or MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the CICD alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
