# AI Search Spoke

Store data from the required third-party application in the AI Search server through Workflow Studio. Access data through the AI Search portal.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

AI Search spoke v2.0.3 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [AI Search spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-ai-search.html).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are activated:

-   AI Search \(com.glide.ais\)
-   External Content for AI Search \(com.glide.ais.external\_content\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The AI Search spoke provides actions to automate tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

<table id="table_hfv_43j_h4b"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ingest Document

</td><td>

Ingests properties of the specified document into the batcher. In releases starting with Rome, you can optionally specify security principal access permissions for the document.

 Specify the document's properties as name-value pairs in a JSON object formatted as in the following example:

```
{
  "title": "Report 2021-02-26",
  "author": "Abel Tuter",
  "url": "http://example.com/reports/2021/02/26/"
}
```

 You can specify the document's security principal access permissions as name-value pairs in a JSON object formatted as in the following example:

```
{
  "everyone": false,
  "groups.deny": [
    "report-users",
    "hr-users"
  ],
  "groups.read": [
    "report-admins",
    "hr-admins"
  ],
  "none": false,
  "users.deny": [
    "ad\bow-ruggeri",
    "don_goodliffe"
  ],
  "users.read": [
    "ad\beth-anglin",
    "ad\abel-tuter",
    "carol.coughlin@sharepoint"
  ]
}
```

 For more details on security principal access permissions, see [External content access permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/defining-access-perms-ext-docs-ais.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ingest Document Using Download URL

</td><td>

Downloads a document from a URL and ingests it into the batcher. In releases starting with Rome, you can optionally specify security principal access permissions for the document.

 Add the URL's domain to the AI Search spoke's list of trusted domains before you specify this action's **Download URL** input. For details on modifying the spoke's list of trusted domains, see [Set up the AI Search spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ais-spoke.md).

 This action doesn't support authentication session IDs or cookies, so the document URL must allow unauthenticated access.

 Specify the document's properties as name-value pairs in a JSON object formatted as in the following example:

```
{
  "title": "Report 2021-02-26",
  "author": "Abel Tuter"
}
```

The document's **url** property is automatically populated with the value of the **Download URL** input.

 You can specify the document's security principal access permissions as name-value pairs in a JSON object formatted as in the following example:

```
{
  "everyone": false,
  "groups.deny": [
    "report-users",
    "hr-users"
  ],
  "groups.read": [
    "report-admins",
    "hr-admins"
  ],
  "none": false,
  "users.deny": [
    "ad\bow-ruggeri",
    "don_goodliffe"
  ],
  "users.read": [
    "ad\beth-anglin",
    "ad\abel-tuter",
    "carol.coughlin@sharepoint"
  ]
}
```

 For more details on security principal access permissions, see [External content access permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/defining-access-perms-ext-docs-ais.md).
