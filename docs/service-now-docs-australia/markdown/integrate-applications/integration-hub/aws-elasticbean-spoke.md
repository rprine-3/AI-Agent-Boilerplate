## AWS Elastic Beanstalk account requirements

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk spoke requires a credential that you create in the Amazon Web Services Management Console.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Create a credential record for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-elasticbean-spk.md).
