## Spoke actions

The X spoke provides actions to automate tweeting when events occur in ServiceNow. Available actions include:

<table id="table_sjg_qjx_cjb"><thead><tr><th>

Action

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Tweet

</td><td>

Tweets a message or media. Messages and media are tweeted as per X limits.**Note:** If you wish to tweet media, use the Look Up Attachment Records action before this action in your custom flow to retrieve the required media.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Spokes and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

The X Spoke provides AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance. For more information about AI agents, see [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md).

Available AI agents include:

<table id="table_ugm_jds_k2c"><thead><tr><th>

AI Agent

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

X Tweet management AI agent

</td><td>

This AI Agent posts tweets to the X handle that you had configured that contain text.**Note:** You must configure a valid X handle before using this AI Agent.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

**Note:** Two connection and credential alias records are needed for the X spoke. One for tweeting messages and other for tweeting media. Each alias should be associated with the respective X API.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the X spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-x-spk.md).
