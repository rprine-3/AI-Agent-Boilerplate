# Define the Microsoft Intune configuration

Associate that software with a group through a Microsoft Intune configuration to create catalog items for Microsoft Intune software deployment or to configure your instance to revoke software through Microsoft Intune.

## Before you begin

Before you create a Microsoft Intune configuration record, make sure you have discovered the Microsoft Intune applications, groups, and deployments, and set up the necessary software models.

Role required: sn\_ms\_intune\_spoke.microsoft\_intune\_admin or admin

## About this task

The Microsoft Intune configuration process associates software with Microsoft Intune groups. To deploy software from a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager server, the user or device must be a member of a Microsoft Intune group associated with an install deployment. CSD 2.0 enables you to revoke unentitled software using the Microsoft Intune server when that software can be removed using an uninstall group. Users requesting revokable software from the Service Catalog also have the ability to define lease start and stop dates and request lease extensions.
