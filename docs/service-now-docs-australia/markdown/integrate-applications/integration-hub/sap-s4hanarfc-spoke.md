## Spoke version

SAP S4 HANA RFC spoke v2.7.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [SAP S4 HANA RFC spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-sap-s4-hana-rfc.html).

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for SAP S4 HANA RFC 2023.

## Spoke requirements

-   Contact the admin of your SAP S4 HANA RFC account and obtain these SAP proprietary JAR files and other required files:

    -   `sapjco3.jar`.
    -   `libsapjco3.so`: If your MID Server is installed on a Linux machine, obtain this file.
    -   `sapjco3.dll`: If your MID Server is installed on a Windows machine, obtain this file.
    A JAR file, `sapConnector-1.0.jar`, is available along with the spoke to provide custom interface to interact and execute RFCs and IDocs in the SAP S4 HANA RFC account. The JAR file is installed as part of the spoke in your ServiceNow instance.

-   Copy and record the client value of the target host where the SAP S4 HANA RFC server is installed.
-   Configure the values of these system properties:
    -   **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.serialized.val\_size\_limit**: This property serializes JSON objects and ensures that the data is in the required format. Specify the number of bytes as per your requirement. For more information, see [Workflow Studio system\\n properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flow-designer-system-properties.md).
    -   **glide.rest.max\_content\_length**: This property specifies the payload size. Specify the maximum payload size you want to use in your flows. The maximum value you can specify for this property is, 25 MB.
-   If you are using this spoke along with the SAP ECC IDoc, SAP S4 HANA IDoc, SAP ECC RFC spokes, during spoke upgrades, ensure that you upgrade all the spokes to their latest versions.

**Note:** To retrieve information for authorization purposes, use the Execute RFC spoke action.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Outputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_outputs\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke module

The SAP S/4 HANA RFC spoke adds the SAP S4 HANA RFC Spoke application to your instance and includes these modules:

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|SAP S/4 HANA - RFCs|Displays the list RFCs. Some RFCs are provided along with spoke. You can create additional RFCs as per your requirement. The Execute RFC action uses these records as an input.|
|SAP S/4 HANA Flow Executions|Displays the dates on which the Retrieve Incoming Invoice flow is executed. After you set up the SAP S4 HANA RFC spoke, create a record to specify the date up to which you want to retrieve the invoice data. For more information, see [Set up the SAP S4 HANA RFC spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-saphana-rfc.md).|
|SAP S/4 HANA Invoice Data|Displays details of the invoice data. Customize and execute the default flow, Retrieve Incoming Invoice to retrieve the invoice data.|
|SAP S/4 HANA Users Records|Displays details of the users, based on their user role. Customize and execute the default flow, Retrieve Users by Role to retrieve the user information.|

## Spoke user roles

The SAP S4 HANA RFC provides the sn\_sap\_s4\_hana\_rfc.SAP\_S4\_HANA\_RFC\_Spoke\_Admin user role to control access to data. Users with the sn\_sap\_s4\_hana\_rfc.SAP\_S4\_HANA\_RFC\_Spoke\_Admin role have access to the spoke tables.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use Remote Function Call \(RFC\) protocol \(SAP Proprietary protocol – SAP Standard Interface\), which can run on an instance or MID Server. Use the connection record associated with SAP S4 HANA RFC spoke alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information about running actions on the MID Server, see [Integration steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integration-steps.md)

**Note:**

-   If the MID Server is installed on a Linux machine, perform the configurations as outlined in [Set up the SAP S4 HANA RFC spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-saphana-rfc.md).
-   If the MID Server is installed on a Windows machine, no configurations are needed.

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
