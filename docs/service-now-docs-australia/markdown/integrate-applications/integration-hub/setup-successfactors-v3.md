# Set up the SuccessFactors spoke v3.x.x

Integrate the ServiceNow instance with your SuccessFactors spoke instance using basic credentials.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the SuccessFactors spoke.
-   Enable these system properties:
    -   **glide.pf.rest.response\_payload\_max\_size**: The maximum value is, `10240`.
    -   **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.serialized.val\_size\_limit**: The maximum value is, `16384`.
    -   **com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length**: The maximum value is, `65536`.
-   Role required: admin.

**Note:** SuccessFactors will be deprecating basic authentication by Nov 2026 and hence, everyone must use OAuth SAML, which SuccessFactors spoke v4.11.1 supports.

-   If you are installing the SuccessFactors spoke for the first time, install SuccessFactors spoke v4.11.1. For more information about setting up SuccessFactors spoke v4.11.1, [Set up the SuccessFactors spoke v4.x.x](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-successfactors.md).
-   If you are using an earlier version of the SuccessFactors spoke, migrate to SuccessFactors spoke v4.11.1. For more information, see [Migrate to SuccessFactors spoke v4.11.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/migrate-successfactors.md).

The connection record for the SOAP API in SuccessFactors is created.

## Synchronize data between SuccessFactors and ServiceNow

Customise the sample flows as per your requirement to synchronize data between your SuccessFactors and ServiceNow instances.

### Todo entity

The SuccessFactors spoke provides sample flows to synchronize data bi-directionally for the todo entity. The sample flow, Run SuccessFactors Integration Flow can customised to retrieve data from SuccessFactors, while the Create Todo and Update Todo flows creates or updates the todo records in SuccessFactors when events occur in ServiceNow. While customising the sample flows, ensure that you provide appropriate triggers to retrieve and save future updates using transform maps.

### Other default entities

For these entities, the sample flow, Run SuccessFactors Integration Flow, can be customised to retrieve data from SuccessFactors:

-   Department
-   Location
-   Job Profile
-   Workers Profile
-   Effective Workers Profile
-   Job History Including Secondary Assignments

To create or update records in SuccessFactors for these entities when events occur in ServiceNow:

-   Create flows or subflows as per your choice or customise the sample flows and subflows.
-   Use Metadata Retrieval and Record Management actions in your flows.
-   Ensure that you provide appropriate triggers to retrieve and save future updates using transform maps.

### Other SuccessFactors entities

Depending on the SuccessFactors permissions and configurations, you can also synchronize data of other entities as per your requirement.
