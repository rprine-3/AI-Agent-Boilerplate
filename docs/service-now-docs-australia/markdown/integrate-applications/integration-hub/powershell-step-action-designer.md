# PowerShell step

Run PowerShell scripts on remote machines from your ServiceNow instance through a MID Server.

PowerShell is built on the Windows .NET Framework and is designed to control and automate the administration of Windows machines and applications. ServiceNow supports PowerShell 3.0 to 7.4. PowerShell 3.0 does not support Windows 2003 Server.

**Note:** This step requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - Integration Hub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## PowerShell version

By default, Integration Hub supports PowerShell versions 3.0 to 5.1. To use a newer version, [add the MID Server property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerProperties.md) **mid.property.ihub.prefer\_powershell6Plus** and set it to `true`.

**Note:** PowerShell version 6.0 or later is not pre-installed on MID Servers. You must install the newer PowerShell version manually. Both the earlier versions \(PowerShell 3.0 to 5.1\) and the newer versions \(PowerShell 6.0 to 7.4\) can co-exist on the same MID Server. Test your Integration Hub and custom PowerShell scripts to ensure everything works before upgrading to a newer version of PowerShell.

## Roles and availability

Available as an Workflow Studio action step. Users with the action\_designer role can create a custom action with one or more action steps.

## Fields

<table id="table_tq4_bxp_4cb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Connection

</td><td>

Type of connection to use. -   **Define Connection Inline**: Define connection information within the action step.
-   **Use Connection Alias**: Define connection information using the Connection Alias table. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action.

 To learn more about connections and credentials, see [Introduction to credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connection Alias

</td><td>

Connection &amp; Credential alias record that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. **Note:** This field is available when **Use Connection Alias** is selected from the Connection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Credential Alias

</td><td>

Credential alias that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the credential information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. **Note:** This field is available when **Define Connection Inline** is selected from the Connection list.

Data pill for the MID Cluster you want to use. This field is available when **Define Connection Inline** is selected from the Connection list, and **Specific MID Cluster** is selected from the MID Selection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Remoting Type

</td><td>

The location where the PowerShell script runs such as the MID or a remote server.-   **Explicit Remoting \(Most Common\)**: Establish a connection with and run the script on a remote server.
-   **Implicit Remoting \(Advanced\)**: Run a script on a MID Server while importing necessary modules from a remote server. If selected, define the **Remote name prefix** and **Modules to import** fields. For optimal performance, only import modules necessary to the step. If blank, all available modules are imported from the server.
-   **Run on a MID Server or have your script establish a remote session**: Run a script directly on a MID Server, or define remoting specifications within the script. This value is the default.

 **Note:** To invoke a function in a PowerShell script command or PowerShell script file, the command must define the function param block if the function has input parameters. This requirement applies to explicit and implicit remoting. For additional information on param block, see Microsoft's documentation on Windows Powershell parameters at [https://technet.microsoft.com/](https://technet.microsoft.com/).

</table>## Action error evaluation

-   **If this step fails**

    Data type: **Choice**

    Option to continue running the next step or go to error evaluation. To use the step status code or message for a custom action error condition, see [Action error evaluation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/action-error-evaluation.md).


## PowerShell scripting variables

To access input variables from the **Command** field, you must call them using special syntax. The syntax you use depends on the value of a system property. If the **Remoting Type** is **Run on a MID Server or have your script establish a remote session**, some reserved variables are available in addition to input variables.

-   **Input variable syntax**

    By default, prefix variable names with a $ character. For example, if an input variable is named **message**, use $message to access the variable in script.

    If the **mid.powershell.command.script.parameter\_passing** parameter is set to false, prefix the variable name with $env:SNC\_. For example, if an input variable is named **message**, use $env:SNC\_message to access the variable in script. To learn more about the **mid.powershell.command.script.parameter\_passing** parameter, see [MID Server parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-parameters.md).

-   **Reserved variables**

    When the **Remoting Type** is **Run on a MID Server or have your script establish a remote session**, the following variables are available for use in script. Reserved variables cannot be used as custom input variable names.

    |Reserved variable|Description|
    |-----------------|-----------|
    |$computer|Host IP address defined in the Connection alias record.|
    |$cred|Credential object that contains the credentials defined in the connection record. Use this variable with any PowerShell cmdlet that supports the credential parameter. For example, `New-PSSession -credential $cred`.|
    |$log\_info|If the **mid.property.powershell.log\_info** property is set to true, adds logging information to a PowerShell script.|

    The following variable names are reserved for internal processing and should not be used as input variables.

    -   script
    -   useCred
    -   isMid
    -   isDiscovery
    -   debug
    -   user
    -   password
    -   executingScriptDirectory
    -   midScriptDirectory
    -   hresult
