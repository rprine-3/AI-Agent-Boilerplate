# Set up the SAP S4 HANA IDoc spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and SAP S4 HANA IDoc spoke by using the Basic Auth credentials to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the SAP S4 HANA IDoc spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

**Note:** To retrieve information, use the Execute RFC spoke action in the [SAP S4 HANA RFC Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/sap-s4hanarfc-spoke.md).

## Procedure

1.  Configure MID Server using the SAP proprietary JAR files.

    1.  Navigate to **System Properties** &gt; **Security**.

        **Note:** This is applicable only if your MID Server is installed on a Linux machine

    2.  Disable the MIME type validation for file attachments.

        \[Omitted image "mime-type-sap-ecc-rfc.png"\] Alt text: Option to disable the MIME type validation

        **Note:** This is applicable only if your MID Server is installed on a Linux machine.

    3.  Navigate to **MID Server** &gt; **JAR Files**.

    4.  Upload the required SAP proprietary files \(JAR, SO, or DLL\) obtained after contacting your SAP S4 HANA IDoc admin.

        For more information, see [Synchronize a JAR file to MID Servers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_SynchronizeAJARFiletoMIDServers.md).

    **Note:** Ensure that the files are synchronised in the `<MID-Server-root-directory>/agent/extlib` directory. If the files aren't synchronised, restart the MID Server.

2.  Create a credential record for the SAP S4 HANA IDoc account.

    1.  Navigate to **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**.
