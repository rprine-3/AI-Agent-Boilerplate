# Set up Okta spoke

Integrate the Okta spoke with Okta to automate various actions on Okta. For example, you can automate the activation of a user on Okta. To integrate, connect your ServiceNow instance and Okta using an API key or OAuth authentication.

## Before you begin

-   Request Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Okta spoke on your ServiceNow instance.
-   Account with the Okta developers portal.
-   Role required: admin.

## About this task

Depending on your requirement, you can set up the spoke using an API key or OAuth credentials. However, you can use only one alias at a time for a ServiceNow domain.

## Set up Okta spoke using API key

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and your Okta account using an API key to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

### Generate an API key to request authentication

Generate an API key on your Okta organization or developer account to have the connection record authenticated by the Okta developer's or organizational account.

#### Before you begin

Okta requirements:

-   Okta organization or developer account
-   Role required: Okta administrator

#### About this task

The API key enables the Okta organization or developer account to authenticate an access request from your ServiceNow instance.

#### Procedure

1.  Log in to [https://developer.okta.com/login/](https://developer.okta.com/login/).

2.  On the left panel, navigate to **Security** &gt; **API**.

3.  On the API page, select Tokens.

    \[Omitted image "okta-spoke-token-menu.png"\] Alt text: Token tab.

4.  Select **Create token**.

5.  In the Create token window, enter a name for the token.

6.  Select **Create token**.

    The token is created.

    \[Omitted image "okta-spoke-token-created.png"\] Alt text: Token created.

7.  Copy the API token and store at a secured place.

    Note the expiry date of the token.

    \[Omitted image "okta-spoke-token-expiry-date.png"\] Alt text: Token expiry date.


### Create an API Key credential record for the Okta spoke

Create Credential records to the Okta application that you created. The Okta spoke connection and credential alias uses these credentials to authorize actions.

#### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

#### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select **API Key Credentials**.
