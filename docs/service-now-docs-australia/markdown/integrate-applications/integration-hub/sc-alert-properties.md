# Stream Connect Alerting properties

Specify alert properties and how alerts are managed in Stream Connect.

## Alerts

To view Stream Connect Alerting properties, navigate to **Integration Hub** &gt; **Stream Connect** &gt; **Alert Properties**. You must have the stream\_connect\_viewer role to view alerting properties and stream\_commect\_admin role to modify alerting properties.

The Stream Connect Alerting UI has the following alerts.

-   Producer Failed Alert. Triggered when a producer fails to produce messages to a topic.
-   Queue Depth Processing Time Alert. Triggered when the estimated message processing time exceeds the specified value.
-   Consumer Poll Failed Alert. Triggered when a consumer is unable to connect to a topic or read the messages in a topic. For example, if a topic is deleted from Hermes while the associated subscription is still active.
-   Consumer Processing Alert. Triggered when a consumer fails to process messages from a topic.
-   Topic Replication Failed Age Alert. Triggered when the topic replication status remains FAILED for longer than the specified value.
-   Topic Replication Inactivity Alert. Triggered when topic replication is inactive for longer than the specified value.
-   Undelivered Messages Age Alert. Triggered when no messages are delivered to a topic for longer than the specified value. For example, if a producer is running but unable to send data due to network issues or misconfiguration, and the delivery gap exceeds the threshold.
-   Unprocessed Messages Age Alert. Triggered when messages remain unprocessed in a topic for longer than the specified value. For example, if a consumer is assigned to a topic but fails to process messages due to a crash, lag, or misconfiguration, and the message backlog exceeds the threshold.
