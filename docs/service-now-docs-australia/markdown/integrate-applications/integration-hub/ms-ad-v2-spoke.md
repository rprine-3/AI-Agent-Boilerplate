# Microsoft Active Directory v2 Spoke

Create, delete, and manage objects in Microsoft Active Directory, such as users, groups, and computers.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Microsoft Active Directory v2 spoke v2.5.3 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Microsoft AD v2 spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-ms-ad-v2.html).

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for Microsoft Active Directory.

## Spoke requirements

Ensure that Active Directory Web Services \(ADWS\) is deployed in the same server where Microsoft Active Directory is installed. The MID server can access the Active Directory Web Services \(ADWS\) at port 9389. For more information about ADWS deployment, see Microsoft documentation.

In the MID Server and Microsoft Active Directory v2 server, run the following PowerShell commands to install the Active Directory module:

```
PS> Import-Module ServerManager
PS> Install-WindowsFeature -Name RSAT-AD-PowerShell
```

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   IHUB Spoke Util Pack \(com.snc.ihub\_spoke\_util\_pack\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - PowerShell \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.powershell\)

**Note:** If used outside the spoke implementation, some of these plugins are licensable features and require licenses.

## Spoke actions

The Microsoft Active Directory v2 spoke provides actions to automate the tasks when events occur in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Microsoft Active Directory object manager|Manages object accounts in the Active Directory \(AD\) and retrieves their details.|
|Microsoft Active Directory user authenticator|Manages user accounts and passwords in the Active Directory \(AD\) and retrieves their details.|
|Microsoft Active Directory group manager|Manages groups in the Active Directory \(AD\) and retrieves their details.|
|Microsoft Active Directory computer manager|Manages computers in the Active Directory \(AD\) and retrieves their details.|
|Microsoft Active Directory user manager|Manages users in the Active Directory \(AD\) and retrieves their details.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Microsoft Active Directory v2 spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ms-ad-v2.md).

## MID Server requirements

To use these actions, your instance must have a MID Server set up and configured to use PowerShell. For more information about running actions on the MID Server, see [Integration steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integration-steps.md). For more information about the MID Server, see [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).

**Note:** You must install the MID Server and Microsoft Active Directory on different servers.
