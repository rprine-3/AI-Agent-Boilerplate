## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Miro board item management AI agent|Manages board items tasks \(that is, add a sticky note item to a board, add a shape item to a board, add a card item to a board, add a text item to a board\) in Miro.|
|Miro team management AI agent|Manages team management tasks \(that is, update a team, remove a user from a team, delete a team, add a user to a team, look up a team, create a team\) in Miro.|
|Miro user management AI agent|Manages user management tasks \(that is, look up an authenticated user, delete a user, create a user, activate a user, deactivate a user, update a user, look up a user\) in Miro.|
|Miro board management AI agent|Manages board management tasks \(that is, create a board, update a board, look up a board, delete a board\) in Miro.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Spoke flows

The Miro spoke provides sample flows to demonstrate automating the Miro tasks. To customize a sample flow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample flows include:

|Flow|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Add User to Miro Team|Looks up a user and the related team in Miro based on the group member and group in your ServiceNow instance and then add the user to the Miro team.|
|Remove Deactivated User from Miro Teams|Looks up a user in Miro teams, group members in your ServiceNow instance and then removes the user from each team in Miro.|

## Spoke module

The Miro spoke adds a Miro Spoke module to your ServiceNow instance. The Miro Spoke module syncronizes and stores information about Miro Teams and Miro Users. The Miro spoke contains the following tables:

-   Miro Teams \(sn\_miro\_spoke\_teams\)
-   Miro Users \(sn\_miro\_spoke\_users\)

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Miro Teams|Lists all the teams in Miro.|
|Miro Users|Lists all the users in Miro.|

## Integration Hub imports

The Miro spoke adds the following Integration Hub imports to your ServiceNow instance. The Integration Hub imports help you import data from Miro account to your ServiceNow instance in an automated way. For more information about Integration Hub imports, see[Integration Hub - Import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integrationhub-imports.md).

|Import|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Create or Update Miro Teams Records|Imports teams details from Miro account into the Miro Teams table.|
|Create or Update Miro Users Records|Import users details from Miro account into Miro Users table.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Miro spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-miro.md).
