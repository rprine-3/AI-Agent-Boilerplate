|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Confluence Groups|Enables you to specify the groups that have access to Confluence products. By specifying these groups, you can manage the users within only these groups using the Confluence Cloud spoke.|

Data accessed through these spoke modules is stored in these tables:

<table id="table_ajt_dvq_n4b"><thead><tr><th>

</td><td>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
