# Set up Microsoft Exchange Online spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Microsoft Exchange Online account by creating a custom OAuth application in Microsoft Exchange Online to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Microsoft Exchange Online spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## Register an application using the Microsoft Azure portal

Provide authorization to the ServiceNow instance by registering an application with Azure AD.

### Before you begin

Role required: Azure Active Directory admin

### About this task

Complete these steps from the Microsoft Azure portal. For instructions on registering an application, see the [Microsoft Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/).

### Procedure

1.  In the Microsoft Azure portal, add the **Redirect URIs** in this format: `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`

2.  For the **Required Permissions**, select **Microsoft Graph**.

    **Note:** The permissions displayed here are needed to use all the spoke actions. However if you want to use only some of the actions, you can add only the required permissions. For more information about the required permissions for each action, see [Spoke actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/ms-exch-online-spoke.md).

3.  Record the **Client Secret** for use in later configurations.


### Result

The ServiceNow application is created with Microsoft Azure AD.
