## About this task

**Note:** Customize flows in Flow Designer based on your requirements.

## Procedure

1.  In Workflow Studio, create a flow.

2.  Specify **TRIGGER** to initiate the flow.

3.  Specify one of the following actions to be performed during the flow:

    -   **Send Adhoc Signature Request To User**
    -   **Send Adhoc Signature Request To Users - Inline**
4.  To pause the flow until the specified document is signed or rejected, select the **Wait for Signature from Docusign** action.

5.  Perform one of the following set of actions:

    -   To send an embedded signing URL, select **Use Embedded Signing**, and **Embedded Signing Recipient \[User\]**.
    -   To send a document for signing, provide details regarding Docusign account, PDF document, recipient, email, and envelope expiry.
    -   The selected document or Embedded Signing URL is sent to the recipients for signing. While signing the document, the recipient details are auto-populated.
    -   An envelope record is created in the **Envelopes** table. The Envelope status and other details are updated.
