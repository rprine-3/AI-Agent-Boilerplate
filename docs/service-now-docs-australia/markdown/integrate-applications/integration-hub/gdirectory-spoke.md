For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

**Note:**

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Google Directory account requirements

The Google Directory spoke requires a custom app that you create in the Google Developers Console.

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for API version v1, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Spoke subflows

The Google Directory spoke provides sample subflows to demonstrate automating tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to the required application scope. These webhook subflows perform specific tasks when webhooks execute user resource changes in the Google Directory. Available sample subflows include:

<table id="table_z3x_yx3_dzb"><thead><tr><th>

Subflow

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Create Google Directory User Webhook Subflow

</td><td>

When you update the details of a user in the Google Directory, a webhook notifies your ServiceNow instance. Now, when you execute the `Create Directory User Webhook Subflow`, it creates a subscription and an entry to the `Google Directory Webhook Registries table`.**Note:** To execute the subflow, you must provide the webhook URL that ServiceNow exposes for incoming webhooks in the Test Subflow window. The webhook URL format is`https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/api/sn_googledir_spoke/google_directory_webhook_callbacks/wh_entry`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Google Directory spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-gdirectory.md).
