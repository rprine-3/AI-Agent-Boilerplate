# Get insights from the Integration Hub Usage Dashboard

Use the Integration Hub Usage Dashboard to get insights on the Integration Hub transactions. For example, you can view which protocol was the most used in the transactions in the last year. You can also use filters and customize the layout and arrangement of the columns in the reports.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, flow designer, action\_designer, usage\_admin, or flow\_operator

## Procedure

1.  To access the dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **IntegrationHub** &gt; **IntegrationHub Usage**.

    **Note:** There’s no order in which you must view the reports, set the filters, or customize the columns in the report tables. So, you can complete one or more of the following steps in any order. The Transactions tab is selected by default.

5.  To hide or reveal the slices in a pie chart, do the following actions:

    Each slice in a pie chart represents a transaction usage insight. However, it might be difficult to view certain slices because they’re obscured by fairly bigger slices.
