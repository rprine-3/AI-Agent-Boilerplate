## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

**Note:** Three connection and credential alias records are needed for the Twilio spoke. One each for Twilio Base, Twilio Notify, and Twilio Messaging. Each alias should be associated with the respective Twilio API.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Twilio spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-twilio.md).
