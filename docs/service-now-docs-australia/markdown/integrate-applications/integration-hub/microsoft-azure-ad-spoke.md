</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Microsoft Entra ID user management AI agent|Automates user and group management tasks in Microsoft Entra ID. The AI agent creates, enables and disables users, manages security and office groups, and performs advanced queries such as, retrieving incremental changes or direct reports.|
|Microsoft Entra ID group management AI agent|Automates user and group management tasks in Microsoft Entra ID. The AI agent retrieves group details, manages group memberships, creates security groups, and automates user provisioning into Office 365.|
|Microsoft Entra ID license management AI agent|Automates the management of users, security groups, and office groups in Microsoft Entra ID. The AI agent retrieves details about the subscribed SKUs, assigns user licenses, and remove user licenses.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Microsoft Entra ID account requirements

The Microsoft Entra ID spoke requires creating a custom app on your Microsoft Entra account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens. See: [Create an Microsoft Entra ID application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-azure.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the AzureAD alias record to authorize actions on Microsoft Entra ID.

|Connection alias|Description|Connection URL|
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
|AzureAD|Connection to Microsoft Entra ID.|https://graph.microsoft.com|

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Microsoft Entra ID spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-azure.md).
