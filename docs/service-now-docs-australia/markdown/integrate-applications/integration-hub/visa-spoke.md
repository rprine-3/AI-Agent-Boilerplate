# Visa Spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance with the Visa spoke to seamlessly invoke Visa APIs under Visa Resolve Online \(VROL\) for Visa card dispute process and card-on-file payments using Visa Stop Payment Service \(VSPS\). You can use the spoke to search for transactions, collaborate with merchants, manage disputes and perform other functions with enhanced security.

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Visa spoke v2.5.2 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Visa Spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-visa-spoke.html).

## Key features

The feature includes creating actions to invoke Visa APIs through VROL and VSPS to manage the end-to-end card dispute process and card-on-file payments. This includes tasks such as:

-   Retrieve enriched transaction information
-   Perform transaction searches
-   Initiate the creation of dispute cases
-   Submit Visa questionnaire
-   Initiate pre-arbitration and arbitration on existing dispute cases

## Spoke requirements

Integration Hub subscription

## Spoke dependencies

Ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The Visa spoke provides actions to invoke Visa APIs under VROL and VSPS to manage the entire card dispute process. Available actions include:

-   **Actions with sensitive information** - These actions contain sensitive information in the request and response body. You should use a Tokenization solution when invoking these VROL and VSPS APIs.

    **Important:** You should disable flow execution logs for Visa APIs that contain Personally Identifiable Information \(PII\) data. To do this, set the property **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.level** in System Properties to OFF.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For more information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Visa Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-visa-spoke.md).
