# Slack Spoke

Use the Slack spoke to post messages and manage access to channels.

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf). To learn more about the subscription, contact your account manager.

## Spoke version

The Slack spoke v1.9.3 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Slack spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-slack.html).

## Slack account requirements

The Slack spoke requires creating a workspace and custom app on your Slack account to generate the OAuth 2.0 tokens for the Slack spoke. See [Configure Slack app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/configure-slack-workspace.md).

**Note:** The spoke set up procedure outlined here requires bot user tokens only. You can't use the Create User and Deactivate User actions while using the bot token scopes. To use these actions, you must obtain user token from your Slack account.

## Spoke subflows

The Slack spoke provides some sample subflows to demonstrate automating the Slack workspace tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

<table id="table_xg2_mgg_3mb"><thead><tr><th>

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Slack user manager|Manages Slack users and integrates Slack actions with the ServiceNow workflows. It looks up users and streamlines user management and communication within the Slack Channels.|
|Slack notification manager|Automates workflows by executing the Slack Spoke actions. It enables the users to send notifications and updates such as details of incidents, problems, changes, and requests to the Slack channels. It streamlines communication and manages notifications better.|
|Slack conversation manager|Performs actions such as setting channel topics, renaming conversations, adding or removing users from channels, creating and archiving channels.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

</table>## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Slack spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-slack.md).
