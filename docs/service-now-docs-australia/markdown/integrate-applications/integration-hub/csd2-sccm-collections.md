# Define the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager configuration

Associate that software with a collection through a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager configuration to create catalog items for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager software deployment or to configure your instance to revoke software through Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

## Before you begin

Before you create a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager configuration record, make sure you have discovered the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager applications, collections, and deployments, and set up the necessary software models.

Role required: sn\_ms\_epcfgmgr\_spk.Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin or admin

## About this task

The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager configuration process associates software with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager collections. To deploy software from a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager server, the user or device must be a member of a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager collection associated with an install deployment. CSD 2.0 enables you to revoke unentitled software using the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager server when that software can be removed using an uninstall collection. Users requesting revokable software from the Service Catalog also have the ability to define lease start and stop dates and request lease extensions.
