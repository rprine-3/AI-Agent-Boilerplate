## Procedure

    Register an application page appears.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the application that you want to register.

4.  Under Supported account types, select an account with the required organizational directory.

5.  Select **Register**.

6.  Open the application that you registered and navigate to the **Overview** section.

7.  Collect the Application \(client\) ID and Application \(tenant\) ID.

    You need the client secret key while configuring your ServiceNow instance.

12. Select Dynamics CRM and add the following permission.

    `user_impersonation`

    **Note:** These steps aren't applicable for user\_impersonation or Microsoft Dynamics CRM connection because the user\_impersonation scope is offered as a Delegated permission in Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
