# Set up the Oracle Autonomous DB spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Oracle Autonomous DB by using the  credentials to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate and set up the [Oracle Cloud IAM Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/oracle-iam.md).
-   Activate the Oracle Autonomous DB spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## Create a credential record for the Oracle Cloud IAM spoke

Create a credential record for the Oracle Cloud IAM account. The Oracle Cloud IAM spoke connection and credential alias uses these credentials to authorize actions.

### Before you begin

Use the public key from the Java Keystore \(JKS\) file and generate a fingerprint from your Oracle Cloud account. For more information about fingerprint, see [Required Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#three).

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**.

2.  Click **New**.

    The system displays this message: `What type of Credentials would you like to create?`

3.  Select **OCI SHA256WithRSA Signature**.

4.  On the form, fill these values.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name to uniquely identify the record. For example, Oracle IAM Cloud Cred.|
    |Certificate Sys ID|Sys ID of the OCI Signing Certificate.|
    |Alias|Alias of the KeyStore.|
    |Alias Password|Alias password of the KeyStore.|
    |Key ID|Key ID helps identify which key is used when multiple keys are used to sign tokens. The Key ID must be slash \(/\) separated values of Tenancy OCID, User OCID, and Fingerprint in this format: `ocid1.tenancy.oc1..<unique_ID>/ocid1.user.oc1..<unique_ID>/<key_fingerprint>`.|
    |Applies to|Option to specify if the credential applies to all MID Servers in the network.|
    |Active|Option to actively use the credential record.|
    |Authentication Algorithm|Custom authentication algorithm for outbound signing requests. Select `OCI SHA256RSA Signing Algorithm`|

5.  Right-click the form header and click **Submit**.


## Create a connection record for the Oracle Cloud IAM spoke

Create a connection record for your Oracle Cloud IAM account. The Oracle Cloud IAM spoke connection and credential aliases use these connections to perform actions in Oracle Cloud IAM.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials Aliases**.

2.  Open the alias record for **OracleIAM\_credentialANDconnecton**.

3.  From the **Connections** tab, click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill these fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name to uniquely identify the record. For example, `Oracle IAM conn`.|
    |Credential|Credential record created for Oracle Autonomous DB spoke. For example, `Oracle IAM Cred`.|
    |Connection alias|Alias record associated with this connection. Search and select `sn_oci_iam_spoke.OracleIAM_credentialAN`|
    |Host|Fully qualified domain name of the target host where the **Oracle Cloud IAM** server is hosted. For example, `database.ap-mumbai-1.oraclecloud.com` .|
    |Connection URL|Base URL to connect to **Oracle Cloud IAM**. For example, `https://database.ap-mumbai-1.oraclecloud.com`.|
    |Active|Option to actively use the connection record.|
    |Domain|Domain that the action runs in.|
    |Override default port|Target port used by the connection. If blank, the system uses the default port.|
    |Use MID server|Option to use a MID Servers for this connection. If the check box is selected, define the fields in the Advanced MID Server Configuration related list.|

5.  Click **Submit**.

    |Alias Password|Alias password of the KeyStore.|
    |Key ID|Key ID \(kid\) helps identify which key is used when multiple keys are used to sign tokens. The Key ID must be slash \(/\) separated values of Tenancy OCID, User OCID, and Fingerprint in this format: ocid1.tenancy.oc1..&lt;unique\_ID&gt;/ocid1.user.oc1..&lt;unique\_ID&gt;/&lt;key\_fingerprint&gt;.|
    |Applies to|Option to specify if the credential applies to all MID Servers in the network.|
    |Active|Option to actively use the credential record.|
    |Credential alias|Associated credential record. If you have already created a credential alias, search and select the record.|
    |Authentication Algorithm|Custom authentication algorithm for outbound signing requests. Select `OCI SHA256RSA Signing Algorithm`|
