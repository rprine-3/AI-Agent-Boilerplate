# Smartsheet Spoke

The Smartsheet spoke integrates the ServiceNow® platform with Smartsheet so that you can automate various actions, such as creating cells in a particular sheet when a database table is updated.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Smartsheet spoke v2.8.0 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Smartsheet spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-smartsheet.html).

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for Smartsheet v1.0.1, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Spoke requirements

You must have a Smartsheet admin account.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)

-   ServiceNow Integration Hub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   The latest Smartsheet spoke plugin

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and need appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation. For information about licenses, contact your account manager.

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Smartsheet user management AI agent|Enables Process Analysts to automate user management workflows within Smartsheet using Integration Hub. It can automate tasks such as create, update, remove users, and retrieve user information.|
|Smartsheet sheet management AI agent|Enables Process Analysts to automate sheet management workflows within Smartsheet using Integration Hub. It can automate looking up sheets by their ID.|
|Smartsheet column management AI Agent|Assists the Process Analyst in managing and automating column-related tasks in Smartsheet which enables better design and execution of flows in Integration Hub. The agent performs tasks such as fetch list of available columns in a sheet, and a specific column in a sheet.|
|Smartsheet attachment management AI Agent|Enables the Process Analyst to improve Smartsheet workflows by automating attachment-related tasks such as attaching files or URLs, looking up attachment streams, and looking up attachments by ID.|
|Smartsheet group management AI Agent|Enables the Process Analyst to improve group management workflows by automating certain tasks. The Process Analyst can automate tasks such as getting the list of available groups, and update group name.|
|Smartsheet sharing management AI agent|Enables the Process Analyst to improve workflows related to sharing in Smartsheet by automating certain actions such as looking up sheet share streams, and creating share sheets.|
|Smartsheet cross sheet reference management AI agent|Improves workflows related to cross-referencing of sheets by automating certain tasks such as looking up cross-sheet references stream and by ID, and creating a cross-sheet.|
|Smartsheet row management AI agent|Automates row management by performing certain tasks such as creating new rows, helping users manage data effectively and optimize their processes.|
|Smartsheet comment management AI agent|Automates various tasks related to comments such as adding a comment, adding a comment with attachment, updating a comment, and look up for a comment.|
|Smartsheet cell history AI agent|Automates various tasks related to the history of the data in the cells such as looking up cell history stream to retrieve and analyze historical data from Smartsheet cells,|
|Smartsheet folder management AI agent|Automates folder-related tasks such as fetch list of available folders, create a new folder, and update a folder.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
