</table>## Spoke module

The MECM spoke adds the MECM application to your instance. The application includes the following modules and data accessed through the spoke modules stored in the respective tables:

|Module|Description|Table|
|------|-----------|-----|
|Applications|Displays the list of applications from the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager server.|Application \[sn\_ms\_epcfgmgr\_spk\_application\]|
|Configurations|Stores the software configuration details for the applications.|Configuration \[sn\_ms\_epcfgmgr\_spk\_sf\_config\]|
|Server Instances|Stores the details of the servers provided.|Server Instance \[sn\_ms\_epcfgmgr\_spk\_server\]|
|Deployments|Displays the list of deployments from the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager server.|Deployment \[sn\_ms\_epcfgmgr\_spk\_deployment\]|
|Collections|Displays the list of collections from the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager server.|Collection \[sn\_ms\_epcfgmgr\_spk\_collection\]|

**Note:** These modules are available only when the [Client Software Distribution 2.0 application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd-app-2.md) is installed.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Configure Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and set up the spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd2-conf-sccm.md).

## MID Server requirements

To use these actions, your instance must have a MID Server set up and configured to use PowerShell. For more information about running actions on the MID Server, see [Integration steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integration-steps.md). For information, see [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
