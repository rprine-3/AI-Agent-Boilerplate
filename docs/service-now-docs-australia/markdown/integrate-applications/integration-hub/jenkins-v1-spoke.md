</td></tr><tr><td>

Test Connection

</td><td>

</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

<table id="table_iby_vjs_52c"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Jenkins Configuration Management AI Agents

</td><td>

Manages a node from the Jenkins server.Retrieves a CSRF token if your Jenkins server has the "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" option enabled.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Jenkins Build Management AI Agents

</td><td>

Manages a build from a Jenkins server job and retrieves the required build details.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Support for CRSF tokens

If your Jenkins server has the "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" option enabled, certain actions require a unique token. Use the Get CSRF Token action to retrieve a token for use by the rest of the flow. The action outputs the token as a data pill for use in other actions in the flow.

## Connection and credential requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the Jenkins Connection &amp; Credential Alias record to authorize actions. To use the spoke connection alias, create an associated Connection record and an associated Credential record.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Jenkins spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-jenkins-v1.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use the REST calls, which must run on a MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the Jenkins alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
