Create webhook routing policy and subflow as per your requirement in the GitLab spoke.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

The default routing policy in the GitLab WebHook Routing Policies modules triggers the relevant GitLab subflow and notifies the ServiceNow app when certain events occur in GitLab. To use any other fields in your custom subflow and customize conditions in the routing policy, perform these steps.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Flow Designer** &gt; **Designer**.

2.  Click **Subflows**.

3.  Create a copy of the required subflow.

4.  Customize the required subflow as per your requirement and publish it.

    See [Building subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/subflows.md) for more information about creating and using subflows and [GitLab spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/gitlab-spoke.md) for information about the GitLab fields that the default routing policy supports and the GitLab events that the subflows support.

5.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **GitLab Webhooks** &gt; **GitLab Webhook Routing Policies**.

    Five routing policies are available along with the spoke. You can configure them as per your requirement or create a routing policy.

6.  To create a routing policy, click **New**.

7.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_iqz_j5s_h5b"><thead><tr><th>
