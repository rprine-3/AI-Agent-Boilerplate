## Spoke requirements

-   Contact the admin of your SAP S4 HANA IDoc account and obtain these SAP proprietary JAR files and other required files:

    -   `sapidoc3.jar` and `sapjco3.jar`.
    -   `libsapjco3.so`: If your MID Server is installed on a Linux machine, obtain this file.
    -   `sapjco3.dll`: If your MID Server is installed on a Windows machine, obtain this file.
    A JAR file, `sapConnector-1.0.1.jar` is available along with the spoke to provide a custom interface between SAP S4 HANA IDoc account and ServiceNow instance. The JAR file is installed as part of the spoke in your ServiceNow instance.

-   Copy and record the client value of the target host where the SAP S4 HANA IDoc server is installed.
-   To retrieve information for authorization purposes, use the Execute RFC spoke action in the [SAP S4 HANA RFC Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/sap-s4hanarfc-spoke.md).
-   If you are using this spoke along with the SAP ECC IDoc, SAP ECC RFC, SAP S4 HANA RFC spokes, during spoke upgrades, ensure that you upgrade all the spokes to their latest versions.

## Spoke dependencies

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   Flow Designer Action Step - Script on MID \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.script\_mid\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the SAP S4 HANA IDoc spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-sap-s4-hana-idoc.md).

## MID Server requirements

These actions use Remote Function Call \(RFC\) protocol \(SAP Proprietary protocol – SAP Standard Interface\) leveraging Application Link Enabling \(ALE\) framework, which can run on an instance or MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the SAP S4 HANA IDoc alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information about running actions on the MID Server, see [Integration steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/integration-steps.md)
