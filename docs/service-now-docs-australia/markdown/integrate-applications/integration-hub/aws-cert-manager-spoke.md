## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The AWS Certificate Manager spoke provides actions to automate AWS Certificate Manager tasks when events occurs in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Certificate Management|Delete Certificate|Deletes a certificate and its associated private key.|
|Get Certificate|Retrieves an Amazon-issued certificate and its certificate chain.|
|Get Certificate Details|Retrieves detailed metadata about the specified ACM certificate.|
|Import Certificate|Imports a certificate to AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) to use with services that are integrated with ACM.|
|Look up Certificates|Retrieves a list of certificate ARNs and domain names.|
|Request Certificate|Requests an ACM certificate for use with other AWS services.|
|Resend Validation Email|Resends the email that requests domain ownership validation.|
|Update Certificate Option|Updates details of the specified certificate.|
|Tag Management|Add Tags To Certificate|Associates a set of tags with the required certificate.|
|Look up Tags For Certificate|Retrieves all tags that are associated with the specified certificate.|
|Remove Tags From Certificate|Removes the association of tags from certificate.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the AWS Certificate Manager spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-aws-cert-manager.md).
