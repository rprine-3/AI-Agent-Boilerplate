</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Google Chat member management AI agent|Performs actions for managing members\(adds current application to a space, removes current application from a space, adds member to a space, removes member from a space, look up a space member\) in Google Chat.|
|Google Chat space management AI agent|Performs actions for managing\(looks up a space, deletes a space, creates a space, updates a space\) spaces in Google Chat.|
|Google Chat message management AI agent|Performs actions for managing\(deletes a message, creates a message thread, looks up a message, sends a message to thread\) messages in Google Chat.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.
