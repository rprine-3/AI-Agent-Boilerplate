</table>## Spoke module

The Jamf spoke adds the Jamf application to your instance. The application includes these modules and data accessed through the spoke modules is stored in the respective tables:

|Module|Description|Table|
|------|-----------|-----|
|Applications|Displays the list of applications from the Jamf server.|Application \[sn\_jamf\_spoke\_application\]|
|Groups|Displays the list of groups from the Jamf server.|Group \[sn\_jamf\_spoke\_group\]|
|Configurations|Stores software configuration details for the applications.|Configuration \[sn\_jamf\_spoke\_sf\_config\]|
|Policies|Displays the list of policies from the Jamf server.|Policy \[sn\_jamf\_spoke\_policy\]|
|Server Instances|Stores details of the provider servers.|Server Instance \[sn\_jamf\_spoke\_server\]|

**Note:** These modules and tables are available only when the [Client Software Distribution 2.0 application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd-app-2.md) is installed.

Another table is Jamf Credential \[sn\_jamf\_spoke\_jamf\_credential\] is available that stores details of the credential records. This table is available along with the Jamf spoke and doesn't require installation of the [Client Software Distribution 2.0 application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd-app-2.md).

## Spoke triggers

Use triggers in the Jamf spoke to subscribe to the required events. The endpoint enables webhooks to connect with your ServiceNow instance. You can configure the flows to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met. The supported events are:

|Category|Trigger|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|Computer Management|Computer Inventory Completed|Trigger initiates when a managed computer submits inventory.|
|Group Management|Smart Group Computer Membership Change|Trigger initiates when a managed computer joins or leaves the membership of a smart computer group.|
|Mobile Device Management|Mobile Device Inventory Completed|Trigger initiates when a device completes the Update Inventory MDM command.|

For information about setting up the triggers for the Jamf spoke, see [Set up triggers for the Jamf spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/jamf-setup-triggers.md). For more information about inbound integration, see [Conditional and event-driven inbound integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conditional-and-event-driven-inbound-integration.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Jamf spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-jamf-spk.md).
