# Microsoft Exchange Online Spoke

The Microsoft Exchange Online spoke creates and manages calendar and mail in Microsoft Exchange Online. To create, manage, or delete users and groups, use the Microsoft Azure AD spoke.

**Note:** User and group management can be done using Microsoft Azure AD only and not Microsoft Exchange Online spoke.

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Microsoft Exchange Online calendar management AI agent|Automates workflows related to the calendar within Microsoft Exchange Online such as calendar event management, attachment handling, and time zone look ups.|
|Microsoft Exchange Online room management AI agent|Automates workflows related to the room management within Microsoft Exchange Online such as 'Look up Rooms Stream'.|
|Microsoft Exchange Online metadata retrieval management AI agent|Automates workflows related to the room metadata management within Microsoft Exchange Online such as looking up room metadata and time zone metadata.|
|Microsoft Exchange Online meeting scheduler AI agent|Automates calendar management tasks within Microsoft Exchange Online. It enables users to find the available meeting time slots and create the meetings accordingly.|
|Microsoft Exchange Online mail manager|Automates mail management tasks within Microsoft Exchange Online such as look up mail folders and messages, delete messages, and set mailbox auto-replies.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Microsoft account requirements

The Microsoft Exchange Online spoke needs registering an application using the Microsoft Azure portal to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up Microsoft Exchange Online spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ms-exch-ol.md).

## MID Server requirements

To use these actions, your instance must have a MID Server set up and configured to use PowerShell. Make sure that Power Shell with EXO V2 module is installed. This module is required for executing the Mailbox management actions. Use the connection record associated with the Mailbox alias to configure where actions run as well as set MID Server selection attributes. For more information about the MID Server, see [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
