# Docusign eSignature Spoke

Automate the process of sending a document to an individual or list of recipients for digital signature using Docusign eSignature. For example, automate employee onboarding and offboarding, or send non-disclosure agreements, legal agreements, and statements of work. Use ServiceNow data in document templates and enable users to upload documents for signature as needed.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## IntegrationHub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Docusign eSignature spoke v4.5.1 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Docusign eSignature Spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-docusign.html).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Compatible versions

This spoke was built for Docusign eSignature API version v2 or v2.1, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Key features

Docusign eSignature spoke enables a flow designer to:

-   Automate the process of sending a document from a ServiceNow attachment or Docusign eSignature template to an individual or recipient list for digital signature.
-   Discover and synchronize Docusign eSignature accounts and templates in ServiceNow.
    -   Retrieve a list of accounts and associated templates from Docusign eSignature and then insert or update them as records in the Accounts \[sn\_docusign\_spoke\_accounts\] and Templates \[sn\_docusign\_spoke\_docusign\_templates\] tables using the Get Accounts subflow.
    -   Retrieve templates associated with a specified Docusign eSignature account and then insert or update them as records in the Templates \[sn\_docusign\_spoke\_docusign\_templates\] table using the Get Templates Per Account subflow.
-   Copy and customize sample flows for sending templates and on-demand document requests.
-   Pause a flow until a document is signed. A scripted REST API webhook waits for the recipient to sign the document.
-   Use values from a signed document in a flow.
-   Attach a completed Docusign eSignature document to a ServiceNow record for auditing purposes.
-   Manage envelopes and users.

## Spoke requirements

-   Docusign eSignature account
-   Docusign eSignature administrator credentials
-   Docusign eSignature application configured to integrate with ServiceNow
-   Docusign eSignature application details such as client ID, integrator key, secret keys, and RSA keypairs
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub subscription

    **Note:** Ensure that you have activated the Flow Designer support for the Service Catalog \(com.glideapp.servicecatalog.flow\_designer\) plugin.


See the [Docusign Developer Center](https://developers.docusign.com/) documentation for instructions on creating and configuring custom applications.

## Spoke flows

The Docusign eSignature spoke provides sample flows to demonstrate automating Docusign tasks. Use Docusign eSignature spoke actions to automate any tasks desired by your organization. To customize a sample flow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample flows include:

|Flow|Description|

</table>## Spoke triggers

ServiceNow supports specific events on Docusign that create triggers. You must first configure a flow with a supported trigger definition. When an event, for example, a push request, occurs on the Docusign, it sends the payload via a webhook to the ServiceNow instance. After that, the flow that you configured is triggered at the ServiceNow instance to automate a workflow. The supported events are:

|Category|Trigger|Definition|
|--------|-------|----------|
|Envelope Management|Envelope Completed|Trigger is initiated when an envelope has been completed by all the recipients. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Envelope Declined|Trigger is initiated when an envelope has been declined by one of the recipients. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Envelope Deleted|Trigger is initiated when a sent envelope is deleted. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Envelope Delivered|Trigger is initiated when all recipients have opened the envelope through the Docusign signing website. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Envelope Sent|Trigger is initiated when an envelope is sent to recipient. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Envelope Voided|Trigger is initiated when an envelope has been voided by the sender or has expired. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Recipient Management|Recipient Completed|Trigger is initiated when the recipient has completed their actions for the envelope. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Recipient Declined|Trigger is initiated when the recipient declines to sign the document\(s\) in the envelope. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Recipient Delivered|Trigger is initiated when the recipient has viewed the document\(s\) in an envelope through the Docusign signing web site. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|
|Recipient Sent|Trigger is initiated when an email notification is sent to the recipient signifying that it is their turn to sign an envelope. Configure the flow to execute only when the specified trigger conditions are met.|

For information about setting up the triggers for the Docusign eSignature spoke, see [Set up triggers for the Docusign eSignature spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-ext-triggers-docusign.md). For more information about inbound integration, see [Conditional and event-driven inbound integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conditional-and-event-driven-inbound-integration.md).

## Docusign account requirements

The Docusign eSignature spoke requires configuring your Docusign account to generate an OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Grant token.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the Docusign Connection &amp; Credential Alias record to authorize actions.

**Important:**

-   You can choose to set up the Docusign spoke using [authorization code grant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-docusign-authorization-code.md) or [JWT grant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-docusign-jwt.md).

    -   Use Authorization Code Grant if your integration uses a browser or client to make requests to a web server.
    -   Use JWT Grant if each user of your integration will use a single system account to log in.
    For more information about when to chose either of the setup methods, see [Choose OAuth Type](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/choose/) in [Docusign Developer documentation](https://developers.docusign.com/).

-   Your company may have a Docusign account for each department that uses Docusign. To use multiple accounts with this spoke, create a child alias for each account. Also, ensure that you override the base alias with the child alias in your flows. At runtime, the system identifies the child alias associated with the account and sends the correct connection and credential information in the request.

    -   For more information about child alias and overriding the base alias, see [Supporting multiple connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/support-multiple-connections.md).
    -   For information about setting up multiple accounts, see [Create child aliases for additional Docusign accounts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/create-aliases-docusign.md).
    If your company only has one account, you can use the default **Docusign** alias provided with the spoke and proceed to setting up the Docusign spoke using [authorization code grant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-docusign-authorization-code.md) or [JWT grant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-docusign-jwt.md).


## MID Server requirements

These actions use REST calls that can run either on an instance or, optionally, through a MID Server. Use the connection record associated with the Docusign alias to configure where actions run and, if needed, specify MID Server selection attributes. For more information, see [MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

To set up the MID Server for this spoke, see [Set up MID Server for a spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/config-adv-mid-settings-for-oauth-on-mid.md).
