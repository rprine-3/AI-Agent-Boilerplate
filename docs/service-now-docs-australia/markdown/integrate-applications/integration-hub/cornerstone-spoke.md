## Spoke flows

The Cornerstone spoke provides a sample flow in the draft state to demonstrate automating the Cornerstone tasks. The sample flow, Cornerstone - Pull Todos Details, retrieves the list of Todos for the required user. Ensure that this user is added to your ServiceNow instance. The retrieved records can be accessed by navigating to the TO DO Lists module in the Cornerstone application of your instance.

To customize the sample flow, copy it to a new application scope.

## Spoke subflows

The Cornerstone spoke provides sample subflows in the draft state to demonstrate automating Cornerstone tasks. To customize a sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

|Cornerstone - Get Transcripts|Retrieves the transcript information of the required employee.|

## Spoke module

The Cornerstone spoke adds a Cornerstone application to your ServiceNow instance. The Cornerstone application has the TO DO Lists module. List of Todos that the sample flow, Cornerstone - Pull Todos Details, retrieves for the specified user, can be accessed here.

## Cornerstone spoke account requirements

If you want to use the default settings and permissions provided along with the spoke, you can install the ServiceNow tile on the Cornerstone Marketplace. For more information about registering an application, see [Register an OAuth Application](https://help.csod.com/help/csod_0/Content/Edge/Integration_Center/API_Management_Page/Register_an_OAuth_Application.htm?Highlight=register%20an%20application) in Cornerstone Online Help. Record the generated Client ID and Client Secret for later use.

If you want to configure and customise the spoke as per your requirement and provide additional permissions, register an OAuth 2.0 application in your Cornerstone account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens for the Cornerstone spoke. For more information, see [API Management](https://help.csod.com/help/csod_0/Content/Edge/Integration_Center/API_Management_Page/API_Management.htm?tocpath=Edge%2FInfrastructure%2FTools%7CAPIs%7CAPI%20Management%20Page%7C_____1) in the Cornerstone online help . Record the generated Client ID and Client Secret for later use.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Cornerstone spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-cornerstone.md).
