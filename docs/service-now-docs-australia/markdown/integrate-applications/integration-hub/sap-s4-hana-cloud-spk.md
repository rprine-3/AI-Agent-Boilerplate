</table>## Spoke scheduled job

The SAP S4HANA Public Cloud spoke provides a scheduled job, Generate Token and Cookie - Cloud Spoke. This scheduled job is run every 26 minutes, which creates a token and cookie.​ The Fetch Token and Cookie spoke action depends on this scheduled job.​

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.
