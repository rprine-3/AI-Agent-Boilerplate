# GitHub Spoke

Manage distributed version control and source code in GitHub from your ServiceNow instance. Create flows in ServiceNow to manage collaborative features such as tracking bugs, feature requests, tasks and so on, for projects in GitHub. View and analyze meaningful usage data for GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server software subscriptions so that you can reclaim stale licenses.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

GitHub spoke v3.6.4 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [GitHub spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-github.html).

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for GitHub API version v3, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Spoke requirements

-   GitHub account
-   User with admin credentials
-   Token to authenticate the ServiceNow instance

See the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en) for instructions on creating a GitHub account and generating a token.

## GitHub Webhooks module

Bi-directional webhooks can be set up to be notified about the required events. Routing policy defines conditions that must be met to notify the ServiceNow app. These conditions are based on the events in GitHub for which you want to be notified about. When the conditions are met, the routing policy triggers the associated subflow, which in turn automates the GitHub tasks.

The bi-directional webhooks require separate setup and can be used independently without using the spoke actions. By default, the GitHub Webhooks application is available in the GitHub spoke and has the following modules:

-   GitHub Webhook Registries
-   GitHub WebHook Routing Policies

Use the GitHub Webhook Registries module to assign a token and provide the API path. You must generate a Callback URL here and provide this URL in GitHub. A default routing policy is provided in the GitHub WebHook Routing Policies module. The default routing policy supports these GitHub fields:

|Supported GitHub fields|

To use other conditions in the routing policy, create a routing policy in the GitHub WebHook Routing Policies module and specify conditions according to your requirement. See [Set up bi-directional webhook for the GitHub spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-biwebhoook-github.md) for information regarding setting up and configuring the webhooks.

## Spoke triggers

ServiceNow supports specific events on GitHub that create triggers. You must first configure a flow with a supported trigger definition. When an event, for example, a push request, occurs on the GitHub, it sends the payload via a webhook to the ServiceNow instance. After that, the flow that you configured is triggered at the ServiceNow instance to automate a workflow. The supported events are:

|Category|Trigger|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|Branch Management|Branch Created|Flow is triggered when you create a branch on GitHub.|
|Repository Management|Pull Request Opened|Flow is triggered when you initiate a new pull request on GitHub.|
|Pull Request Edited|Flow is triggered when you update a pull request on GitHub.|
|Pull Request Closed|Flow is triggered when you close a pull request on GitHub.|
|Pull Request Assigned|Flow is triggered when you assign a pull request to a user on GitHub.|
|Pull Request Reopened|Flow is triggered when you reopen a pull request on GitHub.|
|Repository Fork|Flow is triggered when you fork a repository on GitHub.|
|Repository Push|Flow is triggered when you push to a repository on GitHub.|
|Release Management|Release Created|Flow is triggered when the details of a release are created on GitHub.|
|Release Edited|Flow is triggered when the details of a release are updated on GitHub.|
|Release Deleted|Flow is triggered when a release is removed on GitHub.|
|Release Released|Flow is triggered when a release is released on GitHub.|

For information about setting up the triggers for the GitHub spoke, see [Activate the trigger definition on ServiceNow instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-triggers-github-spoke.md). For more information about inbound integration, see [Conditional and event-driven inbound integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conditional-and-event-driven-inbound-integration.md).

## Spoke subflows

The GitHub spoke provides a sample subflow to handle various GitHub webhook events. Available sample subflows are:

**Note:** This subflow handles all GitHub events. You can customize this subflow to handle other GitHub webhook events that are not supported by default.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>To create subflows to handle other GitHub webhook events or handle the supported GitHub webhook events differently, customize the Process GitHub Webhook Events subflow. For this, you must a create a copy of the subflow, parse the payload, and customize the subflow according to your requirement. Payload is one of the inputs to the subflow.

While customizing subflows, you must confirm that the subflows are configured to avoid infinite loops.

**Note:**

-   You must configure webhooks to use the spoke subflow. See [Set up bi-directional webhook for the GitHub spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-biwebhoook-github.md) for information regarding setting up and configuring the webhook.
-   The sample subflows run as a user by default. It can be configured to run as a system.
-   GitHub spoke supports application/json payload. Configure the GitHub webhook accordingly. See the [GitHub Developer](https://developer.github.com/) documentation for instructions on creating and configuring a webhook.

</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|GitHub branch management AI agent|Manages and maintains the GitHub branches. Also, retrieves information about the GitHub branches.|
|GitHub issue management AI agent|Manages and automates GitHub-related tasks in Integration Hub.|
|GitHub repository management AI agent|Manages the GitHub repositories by handling the repository operations, pull requests, comments on pull request and milestones.|
|GitHub source code management AI agent|Manages source code and handles the repository files, commits, and comments.|
|GitHub Code Automation AI Agent|Manages code changes and GitHub operations from your ServiceNow instance. This agent interprets your requests, asks clarifying questions, and analyzes context to deliver well-integrated code updates. It also performs GitHub tasks such as creating branches, committing changes, and opening pull requests.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Spoke modules

The GitHub spoke adds these modules to your ServiceNow instance.

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|GitHub Owner|Displays the GitHub owner records that you had created.|
|GitHub Repositories|Displays the details of the GitHub repositories associated with the GitHub owners.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the GitHub spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-github-spoke.md).
