Integrate your ServiceNow instance with the GitHub and GitHub Enterprise Server to automate flows and perform actions on GitHub and GitHub Enterprise Server. For example, create a flow that creates a branch on GitHub and retrieves its details.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Demonstrates integrating the ServiceNow instance with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise Server.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the GitHub spoke.
-   An account with GitHub to create personal access tokens.
-   If you are using GitHub Enterprise server, an account to create personal access tokens.
-   Role required: admin.

## Procedure

1.  Generate a personal access token in GitHub account.

    1.  Log in to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

    2.  On the dashboard, select your profile icon.
