# Components installed with CSD 2.0

Several types of components are installed with the CSD 2.0 application.

**Parent Topic:**[Client Software Distribution 2.0 application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/csd-app-2.md)

## Tables installed

These tables are installed with the Client Software Distribution 2.0 application plugin \(com.sn.csd\).

|Client Software Distribution Software Configuration \[sn\_csd\_software\_config\]|Base table for all software provider configurations.|
|Client Software Distribution Lease Execution \[sn\_csd\_lease\_execution\]|Contains scripts that are scheduled to run the subflows and flows associated with deployment, revocation, and lease management.|
|Device Entitlement \[sn\_csd\_entitlement\_asset\]|Contains information about the license allocation for devices.|
|Client Software Distribution Application \[sn\_csd\_application\]|Base table for all software provider applications.|
|Client Software Distribution Lease Manager \[sn\_csd\_lease\_manager\]|Links the requested item with the required lease execution and schedule.|
|User Entitlement \[sn\_csd\_entitlement\_user\]|Contains information about the license allocation for users.|
|License Entitlement \[sn\_csd\_entitlement\]|Parent table for the device and user entitlement tables.|
|Client Software Distribution Lease Schedule \[sn\_csd\_lease\_schedule\]|Contains the schedule entries for deployment, lease and revocation.|
|Software Entitlement \[sn\_csd\_license\]|Contains licensing information of the required software model.|
|Software Model \[sn\_csd\_software\_product\_model\]|Contains details of the required software. The. details include display name, manufacturer, and so on.|
|Requested Software \[sn\_csd\_req\_software\]|Contains all requested software, and their statuses.|

## Roles installed

These roles are installed with the CSD 2.0 application.

<table id="table_h8t_4dc_kg"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

CSD Admin\[sn\_csd.CSD Admin\]

</td><td>

Administrator role for managing CSD 2.0.

</table>## Properties installed

Properties for CSD 2.0 manage the installation status of requested software deployments and configure scheduled Discoveries.

To access CSD 2.0 properties, navigate to **Client Software Distribution 2.0** &gt; **Properties**. The following properties are available:

<table id="table_l3m_gj3_ms"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>

Name

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Status check expiration interval \(days\). Configure the number of days the system should wait before ignoring the software installation status.

</td><td>

sn\_csd.softwareInstallExpDay

</td><td>

Controls how many days the system waits before ignoring the software installation status. The default time limit for installing software is 30 days before the system stops checking the installation status of a deployment.-   **Type**: integer
-   **Default value**: 30

 Installation statuses are:

 -   **Not installed**: User has not installed requested software prior to the expiration of the configured time limit.
-   **Installed**: Software was installed within the configured time limit.
-   **Status check expired**: Time limit has expired for the user to install the requested software. The system no longer checks the status of this deployment.
-   **Revoked**: Software was revoked by the administrator.
-   **Not Synced**: Installation status is not synchronized with the status in the server.

 **Note:** If SAM is used along with CSD 2.0, the status is updated automatically. Else, the admin should change the status manually.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reconcile software installation status interval \(hours\). Set the repeat interval for the scheduled job that determines the installation status.

</td><td>

sn\_csd.softwareInstallIntervalHour

</td><td>

Determines when the scheduled job runs that determines the installation status. By default, the system checks the installation status every hour.-   **Type**: integer
-   **Default value**: 24

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set scheduled application Discovery interval \(days\).

</td><td>

sn\_csd.discoveryExeDay

</td><td>

Sets the repeat interval for the scheduled job that runs application Discovery. By default, Discovery runs at midnight on the day set with this value. -   **Type**: integer
-   **Default value**: 5

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set lease execution schedule job interval \(minutes\)

</td><td>

sn\_csd.lease\_execution\_interval

</td><td>

Interval in which the CSD Lease Schedule scheduled job checks for requested software leases to start, stop, or extend.-   **Type**: integer
-   **Default value**: 1

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set time prior to lease end to notify requester \(days\).

</td><td>

sn\_csd.lease\_end\_notification

</td><td>

Determines how many days prior to the end of a software lease to notify the requester. If lease extensions are allowed, ensure that this period provides enough time for the approval process to complete before the lease expires.-   **Type**: integer
-   **Default value**: 5

</td></tr><tr><td>

Determines whether to use SAM plugin\(SAM Foundation or SAM Professional\) tables for managing software models and licensing information

</td><td>

sn\_csd.useSAMPlugin

</td><td>

Option to use SAM plugin along with CSD 2.0 and choose SAM tables.
