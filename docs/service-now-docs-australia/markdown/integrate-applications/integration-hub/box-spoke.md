</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

</table>There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Spoke triggers

ServiceNow supports specific events on Box that create triggers. You must first configure a flow with a supported trigger definition. When an event, for example, a push request, occurs on the Box, it sends the payload via a webhook to the ServiceNow instance. After that, the flow that you configured is triggered at the ServiceNow instance to automate a workflow. The supported events are:

|Category|Trigger|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|File Management|File Downloaded|Flow is triggered when a file is downloaded.|
|File Locked|Flow is triggered when a file is locked.|
|File Moved|Flow is triggered when a file is moved.|
|File Renamed|Flow is triggered when a file is renamed.|
|File Unlocked|Flow is triggered when a file is unlocked.|
|File Uploaded|Flow is triggered when a file is uploaded.|
|Folder Management|Folder Created|Flow is triggered when a folder is created.|
|Folder Downloaded|Flow is triggered when a folder is downloaded.|
|Folder Moved|Flow is triggered when a folder is moved.|
|Folder Renamed|Flow is triggered when a folder is renamed.|

For information about setting up the triggers for the Box spoke, see [Set up triggers for the Box spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/box-spk-triggers-setup.md). For more information about inbound integration, see [Conditional and event-driven inbound integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conditional-and-event-driven-inbound-integration.md).

## Spoke user roles

The following user roles are available with the spoke:

-   Policy User \(sn\_box\_spoke.box\_policies\_user\): Users with this role have access only to **Retention Policies** module.
-   Legal Hold Policy User \(sn\_box\_spoke.legal\_hold\_policy\_user\): Users with this role have access only to the **Legal Hold Policies** module.
-   Box Webhook Registry User \(sn\_box\_spoke.box\_webhook\_registry\_user\): Users with this role have access only to the **Box Webhook Registry** module.

## Box spoke module

Bi-directional webhooks can be set up to be notified about the required events. A webhook registry defines the conditions that must be met to notify the ServiceNow app. These conditions are based on the events in Box that you want to be notified about. When the conditions are met, the specified trigger name triggers the associated subflow, which in turn automates the Box tasks.

Webhooks require separate setup and can be used independently without using the spoke actions. The Box spoke adds the Box Spoke application to your instance and includes the following modules.

|Module|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Box Webhook Registry|Create and view the Box webhooks in ServiceNow.|
|Legal Hold Policies|View the list of available Box legal policies.|
|Retention Policies|View the list of available Box retention policies.|

## Box account requirements

The Box spoke requires creating a custom app on your Box account to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens. See [Create an OAuth application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-box-spoke.md).

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

This spoke uses the following alias records to authorize actions.

<table id="table_nnk_g2h_gfb"><thead><tr><th>

Connection &amp; Credential alias

</th><th>

Connection alias requirements

</table>To use the spoke connection aliases, create an associated Connection record and an associated Credential record for each alias. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Box spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-box-spoke.md).
