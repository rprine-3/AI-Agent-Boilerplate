|Active Worker Downloads|Displays details of the active workers. Data is retrieved when you run the Look up Active Workers spoke action.|
|Create Job Postings|Displays details about the job postings. Data is retrieved from the SAP Fieldglass instance after you set up the webhook.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

Two connection and credential aliases are available along with spoke; one record for supplier and another record for buyer. For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the SAP Fieldglass spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/fieldglass-setup.md).
