## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

The Amazon CloudWatch Spoke provides actions to automate Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) resource and application monitoring tasks when events occurs in your ServiceNow instance. Available actions include:

|Category|Action|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Alarm Management|Create Composite Alarm|Creates a composite alarm.|
|Delete Composite Alarm|Deletes the specified alarms.|
|Look Up Alarm|Retrieves a list of specified alarms.|
|Set Alarm State|Assigns a temporary state to an alarm for testing.|
|Anomaly Management|Create Anomaly Detector|Creates an anomaly detection model for a CloudWatch metric.|
|Delete Anomaly Detector|Deletes the specified anomaly detection model from an account.|
|Metric Management|Delete Metric Alarm|Deletes the specified alarms.|
|Look up Metric Data|Retrieves different metrics in a single request.|
|Upsert Metrics Alarm|Create a new alarm or updates an alarm and associates the alarm with the specified metric, metric math expression, or an anomaly detection model.|

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).
