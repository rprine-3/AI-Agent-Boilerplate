</table>## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Google Meet artifacts management AI agent|Automates tasks such as retrieving recordings, transcripts, and other meeting-related data, making it easier to organize and utilize meeting resources effectively.|
|Google Meet participant management AI agent|Automates tasks such as looking up participant details, retrieving participant session streams, and accessing session-specific information.|
|Google Meet conference management AI agent|Automates tasks such as look up conference details, retrieve live conference streams, and manage meeting spaces and participants.|
|Google Meet space management AI agent|Automates tasks such as creating and updating meeting spaces, ending active conferences, and retrieving information about existing meeting spaces.|

## Available conversational actions

Install Now Assist for Conversational Spokes and start using the conversational ability of Integration Hub spokes. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Conversational Spokes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/conv-spokes-na.md).

|Action|Usage|
|------|-----|
|Create Meeting Space|In the Ask Now Assist to... field, enter the phrase that asks Now Assist to perform the action and press **Enter**. For example, `Create a meeting space`.|
|Update Meeting Space|In the Ask Now Assist to... field, enter the phrase that asks Now Assist to perform the action and press **Enter**. For example, `Update a meeting space`.|

\[Omitted image "gmeet-spk-nowassist.png"\] Alt text: Use conversational action on Now Assist.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r-credentials.md).

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Google Meet spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/set-up-the-google-meet-spoke.md).
