# REST step

Send an outbound REST web service request to an external system.

**Note:** REST step is not available in the base system and requires the ServiceNow® Integration Hub subscription. After the required plugin is activated, the step is visible under Integrations.

[Outbound REST web service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/c_OutboundRESTWebService.md) is a platform feature that enables you to retrieve, create, update, or delete data on a web services server that supports the REST architecture.

## Roles and availability

Available as an Workflow Studio action step. Users with the action\_designer role can create a custom action with one or more action steps.

## Fields

<table id="table_p4n_cht_3cb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Connection

</td><td>

Type of connection to use. -   **Define Connection Inline**: Define connection information within the action step.
-   **Use Connection Alias**: Define connection information using the Connection Alias table. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action.

 To learn more about connections and credentials, see [Introduction to credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connection Alias

</td><td>

Connection &amp; Credential alias record that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel.

 **Note:** This field is available when **Use Connection Alias** is selected from the Connection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Credential Alias

</td><td>

Credential alias that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the credential information changes, you don't need to update your custom action.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use MID

</td><td>

Option to use a ServiceNow® MID Server to run the REST step. Select this check box to display the **MID Application** and **Capabilities** fields.**Note:** The system doesn't log REST request, response, and parameter runtime data sent via a MID server in the same way that [Outbound web services logging](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/outbound-request-logging.md) occurs. Instead, you can view this data in the [Flow execution details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flow-execution-details.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Base URL

</td><td>

Base URL for the REST request. -   If **Use Connection Alias** is selected, this field displays the base URL associated with the alias. You can override the base URL by clicking the lock icon \(\[Omitted image "lock-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lock icon\) and entering your own.
-   If **Define Connection Inline** is selected, enter a base URL for the connection.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>## Action error evaluation

-   **If this step fails**

    Data type: **Choice**

    Option to continue running the next step or go to error evaluation. To use the step status code or message for a custom action error condition, see [Action error evaluation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/action-error-evaluation.md).


## REST response size limits

By default, the system limits the size of REST responses that are not saved as attachments to 5 MB. Direct REST responses that exceed this limit generate an error. To support larger response sizes, either save the response as an attachment or increase the response size limit with the **glide.pf.rest.response\_payload\_max\_size** system property. This system property supports a maximum value of 10240 KB, which limits the REST response to 10 MB in size.

## Parsing a REST response

REST API calls return data in the Response Body. The response body data is usually structured in JSON or XML format. You can use a [Script step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/javascript-step-action-designer.md) to parse the structured data into variables to use elsewhere in the action or in a flow. There is also an [XML parser step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/xml-parser-step-action-designer.md) to parse a response body that's in an XML format.

The general strategy to get extracted data from the response is to do the following.

1.  Review the response body to select the data to return.
2.  Create input and output variables in the Script step.
    -   Create an input variable to pass in the Response Body from the REST step.
    -   Create output variables to return data from the response.
3.  Create a script to parse and map data.
    -   Use the `JSON.parse()` method in a Script step to parse a JSON response body.
    -   Map the parsed data to the output variables.
4.  Create action outputs for the output variables to make the data available to a flow.

For a detailed example, see the section on Parsing a REST Response in the [REST in IntegrationHub developer training \(Zurich\)](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/australia/app_store_learnv2_rest_australia_rest_integrations/app_store_learnv2_rest_australia_rest_in_integration_hub/app_store_learnv2_rest_australia_rest_in_integration_hub_objectives).
