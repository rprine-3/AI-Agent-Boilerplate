# Google Cloud Storage Spoke

Manage storage and retrieval of data in Google Cloud from your ServiceNow instance.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Integration Hub subscription

This spoke requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).

## Spoke version

Google Cloud Storage spoke v1.1.1 is the latest version. For version history of the spoke, see [Google Cloud Storage spoke release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/store-integrationhub-rn-google-cloud-storage.html).

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Template - Data Stream \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.rest\)
-   ServiceNow IntegrationHub Runtime \(com.glide.hub.integration.runtime\)
-   ServiceNow Flow Designer - Dynamic Inputs \(com.glide.hub.dynamic\_inputs\)
-   Complex Object \(com.glide.cobject\)

**Note:** Some of these plugins are licensable features and require an appropriate license if used outside the spoke implementation. For information on licenses, contact your account manager.

## Google Cloud Storage account requirements

The Google Cloud Storage spoke requires a custom app that you create in Google Cloud Platform.s

## Supported versions

This spoke was built for API version v1, but may be compatible with later versions.

## Spoke subflows

The Google Cloud Storage spoke provides sample subflows to demonstrate automating Google Cloud Storage tasks. To customize the sample subflow, copy it to a new application scope. Available sample subflows include:

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Move An Object|Moves an object from the source bucket to destination bucket.|
|Rename An Object|Renames the specified object.|

## Spoke actions

The Google Cloud Storage spoke provides actions to automate Google Cloud Storage when events occur in ServiceNow. For the spoke actions to be performed, you must ensure that your project or organization in Google Cloud Platform has the mentioned permissions. Available spoke actions include:

## Available AI agents

Install Now Assist for Integration Hub and start using the available AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/now-assist-spokes.md).

This spoke provides standalone AI agents that mimic human-like intelligence to perform tasks in your ServiceNow instance.

-   In the ServiceNow agentic system, you can create an agentic workflow that comprises of a set of large language model \(LLM\) instructions along with one or more standalone AI agents to execute an objective. See [Create an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-use-case-ai-agents.md) for information about adding AI agents to create agentic workflows as per your requirement and provide the required trigger.

    You can also search for other available AI agents and add them to your agentic workflow. See [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md) for more information.

-   You can create a clone of the required spoke AI agent and customize it as per your requirement. See [Duplicate an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-ai-agent.md) for more information about creating a clone.
-   See [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md) for information about AI agents.

Available AI agents include:

|AI Agent|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Google Cloud Storage object management AI agent|Manages object management tasks \(that is, object management, storage class updates, and object transfers\) in Google Cloud Storage.|
|Google Cloud Storage object access control management AI agent|Manages object access control management tasks \(that is, object access controls, deletes, lists, and creates or updates access control settings\) in Google Cloud Storage.|
|Google Cloud Storage bucket management AI agent|Manages bucket management \(that is, creates, updates, and deletes buckets, retrieves bucket details, manages IAM policies, lists all available buckets\) in Google Cloud Storage.|
|Google Cloud Storage bucket access AI agent|Manages bucket access \(that is, bucket access controls, create or update bucket access controls, and delete bucket access controls\) in Google Cloud Storage.|

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

**Note:** Ensure that the user running an AI agent has the required roles and permissions to access data or perform operations on data in the table that is associated with the AI agent.

## Connection and credential alias requirements

Integration Hub uses aliases to manage connection and credential information, and OAuth credentials. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using multiple environments. If the connection or credential information changes, you don't need to update any actions that use the connection.

For information about setting up the spoke, see [Set up the Google Cloud Storage spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/setup-gstorage.md).
