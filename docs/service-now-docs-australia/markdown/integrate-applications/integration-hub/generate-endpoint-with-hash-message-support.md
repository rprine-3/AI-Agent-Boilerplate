# Manage endpoint with Hash message support

Generate endpoint for webhooks in third-party applications that support hash message authentication. The endpoint enables webhooks to connect with your ServiceNow instance. You can deactivate or remove the configuration of the endpoint from the connection when you want the endpoint to no longer listen to the external webhook.
