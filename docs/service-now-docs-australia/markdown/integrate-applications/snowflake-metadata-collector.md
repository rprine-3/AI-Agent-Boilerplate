# Snowflake metadata collector

The Snowflake metadata collector provides read-only access to metadata from an external Snowflake account.

The collector harvests metadata from Snowflake Data Cloud. It collects tabular objects, Horizon objects such as policies and tags, and Snowflake data quality artifacts. It also harvests functions and stored procedures. The collector can gather column statistics and table query counts. In addition, it can harvest metadata for Streamlit applications.

## Metadata cataloged

The Snowflake collector catalogs the following information.

**Note:** The collector harvests all versions of overloaded functions and stored procedures. Each version has its own title/name in the catalog, but a distinct identifier.

</table>## Relationships between objects

The harvested metadata includes catalog pages for the following data asset types. Each catalog page has a relationship to the other related data asset types.

|Data asset page|Relationships|
|---------------|-------------|
|Snowflake Row access policies|Tables|
|Snowflake Masking Policies|Columns, Tag value|
|Table|Columns, Tag value, Data Metric Function that analyzes, Views, Tables, or Functions which the Table depends on|
|Snowflake Tags|Tag value|
|Columns|Table, Tag Value, System Tag Value|
|View|Schema that contains Views, Columns that are part of Views, Data Metric Function that analyzes View, Views, Tables, or Functions which the View depends on|
|Materialized View|Schema that contains Materialized Views, Columns that are part of Materialized Views|
|Schema|Database that contains Schema, Table that is part of Schema, View that is part of Schema, Materialized View that is part of Schema, Streamlit app that is part of schema|
|Streamlit App|Schema that contains Streamlit App|
|Database|Schema contained in Database|
|Data Metric Function|Table or View analyzed by this Snowflake Data Metric Function, Table, Views, Tables, or Functions which the Function depends on|

## Lineage and dependencies for Snowflake

The following lineage information is collected by the Snowflake collector. Note that any lineage for SQL Statements defined via variable statements are not supported.

Important things to note:

-   Any lineage for SQL Statements defined via variable statements are not supported.
-   The collector traces these relationships from a View’s columns to ultimate source Table columns across SQL expressions and subqueries.

Column in View

</td><td>

The collector identifies the associated column in an upstream view or table:

 -   Where the data is sourced from
-   That sort the rows via ORDER BY
-   That filter the rows via WHERE/HAVING
-   That aggregate the rows via GROUP BY

</td></tr><tr><td>

User-defined function

</td><td>

A Function and:

 -   Views referenced in Function
-   Tables referenced in Function
-   Functions referenced in Function

</td></tr><tr><td>

Stored Procedure

</td><td>

The collector identifies:

 -   The associated column in an upstream view or table
    -   Where the data is sourced from
    -   That sort the rows via ORDER BY
    -   That filter the rows via WHERE/HAVING
    -   That aggregate the rows via GROUP BY
-   The downstream table that has its data updated by this stored procedure.

 Note: The following stored procedures are not supported:

 -   Stored procedures with multitable inserts. However, multiple separate insert statements that insert into one table *are supported*.
-   Stored procedure with multiple SELECT and INSERT statements not separated by a semicolon delimiter.
-   Stored procedures used to create tables or any transient tables created during the execution scope of a stored procedure.

</table>Dependencies

The Snowflake collector catalogs dependencies between tables, views, and functions using the Snowflake Account Usage view OBJECT\_DEPENDENCIES. See the Snowflake documentation for more information about the OBJECT\_DEPENDENCIES view.

If you include the profiling and sampling specific parameters while running the collector, the following additional information is harvested for Columns.

**Note:** The user/role must have read access to data to be able to harvest profiling information \(column statistics\).
