## About this task

Do this task when you’re setting up the Attended Robot for the first time unless you’re changing the RPA Hub instance.

If the Attended Robot is launched when the RPA Desktop Design Studio is open in your Windows machine and a new profile is added to the Attended Robot Connection Manager, it does not reflect in the RPA Desktop Design Studio Connection Manager. If a new profile is added to the RPA Desktop Design Studio Connection Manager, the entry that you added in the Attended Robot Connection Manager is overwritten. In such scenarios, restart RPA Desktop Design Studio when a profile is added in the Attended Robot Connection Manager.
