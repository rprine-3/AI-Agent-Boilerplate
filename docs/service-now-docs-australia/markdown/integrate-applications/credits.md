# Workflow Data Fabric Credits

Workflow Data Fabric Credits let you monitor and track Workflow Data Fabric product usage through a dashboard showing credit usage, usage measurements, and thresholds that trigger alerts.

## Exploring Workflow Data Fabric Credits

Workflow Data Fabric lets organizations connect, manage, and automate their data workflows across different systems, through various product solutions.

Workflow Data Fabric Credits measure the usage of Workflow Data Fabric subscriptions. Each credit represents a unit of consumption under a unified meter. For example, depending on the underlying product a credit can represent a record, an API call, a megabyte of data throughput, or a minute of runtime.

For more information about Workflow Data Fabric products, meters, and reproducibility, see the [Fabric Credits - WDF Products and Meter Sources to trace and reproduce \[KB2276348\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=6778a81293aa2e54f538fb2d6cba10c1&id=kb_article_view) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
