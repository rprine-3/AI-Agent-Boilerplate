# RPA Hub and CSDM tables

RPA Hub manages and uses CSDM tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to RPA Hub.

## CSDM tables managed by RPA Hub

1.  Bot Process \[cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_process\]
2.  Robot \[cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_robot\]

The Bot Process table \(cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_process\) contains the configuration details of a process that runs on a robot. This table extends from the Base Bot Process table \(cmdb\_ci\_base\_rpa\_process\). The following image is a visual depiction of the bot process table hierarchy. \[Omitted image "botprocess-ci-rpa-csdm.png"\] Alt text: Visual depiction of the bot process table hierarchy.

The Robot table \(cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_robot\) contains the details of a software agent that runs a bot process \(cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_process\) that is built in the RPA Desktop Design Studio. This table extends from the Base Robot table \(cmdb\_ci\_base\_rpa\_robot table\). The following image is a visual depiction of the robot table hierarchy.

The bot process and the robot are associated with each other using CI relationship ‘Runs On::Runs’.

## CSDM tables used by RPA Hub

1.  Business Application \[cmdb\_ci\_business\_app\] - For associating business applications to bot processes and later, defining the application credentials for the same.

    For more information about assigning a business application to a bot process, see [Assign a business application to a bot process in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/associate-business-apps.md).

2.  Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] - For the machine name lookup feature on a robot record.

    For more information about machine name field, see [Create an unattended robot in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-unattended-robot.md).
