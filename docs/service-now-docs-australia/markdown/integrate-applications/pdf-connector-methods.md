# PDF connector methods

Accelerate PDF processing for your document automation by using the various methods of PDF connector in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Prerequisites for using the PDF connector

Use the Load method in PDF connector before using the other methods. Call this method with the full path to the PDF file \(FilePath\) and optionally provide a password \(Password\) if the PDF is protected.
