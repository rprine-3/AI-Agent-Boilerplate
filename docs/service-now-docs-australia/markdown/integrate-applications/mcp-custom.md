# Client registration using custom connector

Define a custom connector by providing your own MCP endpoint URL and authentication configuration if the registry does not contain a connector for the system you need.

## Before you begin

Role required: wdf\_builder or admin.

## About this task

Use a custom connector in the following situations:

-   The third-party system exposes an MCP-compatible endpoint, but no certified or community connector exists in the registry for it.
-   You are connecting to an internal or proprietary system within your organization that is not listed in the registry.
-   You need to override the endpoint URL or authentication settings of an existing registry connector for a specific environment or configuration.

Custom connectors support both manual and dynamic client registration, depending on the capabilities of the target system. Custom connectors are scoped to the instance and are not added to the shared MCP registry.

## Create an MCP Connector with OAuth 2.1

Create an MCP Connector with OAuth 2.1 for connecting to external systems or applications that support MCP.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_mcp\_client.admin

### About this task

OAuth 2.1 provides the most secure and flexible authentication for MCP connectors. If your MCP server supports it, select OAuth 2.1 as the authentication method. You can choose between Dynamic Client Registration, where the server auto-populates client details, or Manual Client Registration, where you provide the client details yourself.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric** &gt; **Connect Hub**.

2.  Click **Create** and select **Model Context Protocol**.

    The list of all available MCP connectors is displayed.

    You are redirected to the third-party page requesting authorization for the MCP client.

6.  Click **Approve**.

    The MCP client for your application is created and appears in the **Model Context Protocol** list.


## Create an MCP Connector with API Key

Create an MCP Connector with API key for connecting to external systems or applications that support MCP.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_mcp\_client.admin

### About this task

Use API key authentication when your MCP server requires a static key for authorization. Obtain the API key from your third-party application before configuring the connector.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric** &gt; **Connect Hub**.

2.  Click **Create** and select **Model Context Protocol**.
