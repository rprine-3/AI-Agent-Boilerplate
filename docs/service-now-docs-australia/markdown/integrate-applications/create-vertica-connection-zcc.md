# Create an OpenText Analytics Database \(Vertica\) connection

Establish a zero copy connection to an external Vertica database in Zero Copy Connector Hub.

## Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

## About this task

Work with your data source admin to create a connection to Vertica. For additional information about connecting, refer to the [Vertica connector documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/vertica.html).

**Note:** This connector was developed by the open-source community and made available through the ServiceNow AI Platform for general use. Functionality can vary and might not cover all use cases supported by primary connectors.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the available community connectors in Zero Copy Connector Hub in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Available connectors** &gt; **Community connectors**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Available connectors** &gt; **Community connectors**.
2.  Find the OpenText Analytics Database \(Vertica\) connector and select **Connect**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>4.  Select **Connect**.


## Result

A test connection is made to the external data source, verifying that the connection details are correct and the data source is accessible.

## What to do next

If the connection succeeds, configure data steward access on the **Access Control** tab. See [Manage access to an established connection using roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/manage-access-connection-zcc.md).

If the connection fails, verify the connection details with your data source administrator and try again.
