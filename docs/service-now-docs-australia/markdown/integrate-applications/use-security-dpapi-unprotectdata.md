# Use the UnProtectData component

Decrypt an encrypted string that is saved in a file with the UnProtectData component in the RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the UnProtectData component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the DPAPI components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/properties-of-dpapi-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Security** &gt; **DPAPI**.
