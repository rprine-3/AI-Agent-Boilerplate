# Configure the VB.Net connector

Write and validate a custom VB.Net script before executing it as part of a Workflow in the RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have installed the Scripting plugin on the RPA Desktop Design Studio. To install, see [Manage plugins in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/install-plugins-rpa-studio.md).

Role required: Developer

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Connectors** &gt; **VB.NET**.

2.  Drag the VB.NET connector to **Global Objects** in the Project Explorer pane.

3.  Right-click the **JavaScript**connector in Global Objects and select **Configure**.

    The Script Editor window is displayed.

4.  Enter the custom VB.NET script in the Script pane.

5.  Select **Add Reference** from the **References** tab section if you want to add Dynamic-link library \(DLL\) references to your custom script.

    You can select the references from the Reference Manager window and also from your computer.

6.  Select **Validate**.

    If your custom script has any errors, it is displayed in the Errors pane. Resolve the errors and select **Validate** to check for errors again.

The custom script you created by using the VB.net connector is now ready to be used in your automation.
