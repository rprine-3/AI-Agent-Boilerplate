# Data Stream \(Integration Hub\) data source

Enable platform Data Sources to load data from Integration Hub Data Stream actions.

A Data Stream is a stream of response data larger than 10 MB or data that returns paginated results. Successful execution of the Data Stream action returns a complex data output stream that the Data Source consumes. For more information, see [Data stream actions and pagination](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/data-stream-actions.md).

Complex data allows you to encode and store structured data in a machine-readable format. Based on Data Source configuration, complex objects can be either flattened into an import table or serialized completely as JSON data into a single column.

Complex data includes parent and child objects and nested objects, as shown in the following example:
