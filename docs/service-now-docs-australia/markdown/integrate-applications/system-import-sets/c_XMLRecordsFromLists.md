# XML records from lists

You can directly export records as XML from any list or form.

This export process preserves all record field values including system generated field values such as:

-   Sys ID
-   Creation date
-   Update date

The XML import process directly inserts records into the target table. During the import the system:

-   Ignores any business rules that normally apply to the table.
-   Does not provide any opportunity to transform incoming data.
-   Automatically matches a reference field's display value to the local Sys ID for some tables.

This process is good for directly copying records from one system to another but does not remove the need to know the relationships between tables. If you need validate or transform data or reconcile the sys ID values of reference fields, use an XML import set instead.

## Automatic matching of display values

During the import of XML records, the system attempts to match some reference field display values to a local sys\_id value.

If the system finds an existing record with a matching display value on the local instance, the import uses the sys\_id of the existing record rather than the sys\_id of the imported record.

For example, suppose you export an incident record that is assigned to the user John Smith. In the exported XML file there is an entry such as:

```
<incident>
	...
	<assigned_to display_value="John Smith">7712173d2ba80200c5244f74b4da159a</assigned_to>
	...
</incident>
```

This user already exists on the target instance but has a different sys\_id value such as:

```
<sys_user><name>John Smith</name>
	...
	<sys_id>18cab8de2be80200c5244f74b4da15f7</sys_id>
	...
</sys_user>
```

Since the display value matches an existing record, the system uses the local instance's existing sys\_id value for the reference field such as:

```
<incident>
	...
	<assigned_to display_value="John Smith">18cab8de2be80200c5244f74b4da15f7</assigned_to>
	...
</incident>
```

The system can match display values for the following tables.

-   User \[sys\_user\]
-   Group \[sys\_user\_group\]
-   Role \[sys\_user\_role\]
-   Group Roles \[sys\_group\_has\_role\]
