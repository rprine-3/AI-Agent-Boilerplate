# Processing custom CSV files

You can process CSV files that are delimited by a character other than commas.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin.

## About this task

This is an advanced step to create a CSV import. Normally, you would upload the data and import it directly using System Import Sets, which will create this CSV data source for you automatically.

## Procedure

1.  Create the data source record.

2.  Attach the CSV file to the data source.

3.  Customize the Data Source form and add the **CSV Delimiter** field.

4.  Enter the character you want to use as the CSV file delimiter, such as the pipe symbol \(\|\).

5.  Test load the data source.
