# Standard import set tables

Several Import Set tables are available by default.

## Notification

A standard object for describing an external interface for a notification in the system, such as alarms and alerts from monitoring systems. The default transform map for this object will create or update an incident record. The incoming notifications are coalesced into incidents based on the UUID field.

<table id="table_r3s_cb1_tq"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th><th>

Data type

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

uuid

</td><td>

The universally unique identification number or string that uniquely identifies this notification. It is marked as the coalescing value in the default transform map for the corresponding Incident and is mapped to the correlation\_id field of Incident.

</td><td>

Character \(40\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

corrective\_message

</td><td>

A free form string value that indicates the corrective or followup steps to be taken to address the issue identified in this notification. This field is not mapped by default.

</td><td>

Character \(40\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

duration

</td><td>

A string value representing the time value duration affecting the issue reported in this notification. Out of box, the duration field is not mapped. The format of the time is up to the calling program and must be mapped accordingly in the default map to be used.

</td><td>

Character \(40\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

expires\_on

</td><td>

A string value representing the datetime value that the issue reported in this notification will expire. Out of box, the expires\_on field is not mapped. The format of the time is up to the calling program and must be mapped accordingly in the default map to be used.

</table>## Computer

A standard object for describing an external interface for a computer in the system. The default transform map will create/update a Computer \(cmdb\_ci\_computer\) or Server \(cmdb\_ci\_server, cmdb\_ci\_win\_server, cmdb\_aix\_server etc ..\) based on the operating\_system field value. The incoming computers are coalesced based on the serial\_number field. Additionally, the transform script of the map will map to various extensions of the Computer \(cmdb\_ci\_computer\) based on the operating\_system value being entered.

-   UNIX Server \(cmdb\_ci\_unix\_server\)
    -   AIX
    -   HP/UX
    -   Solaris
    -   AIX
-   Windows Server \(cmdb\_ci\_win\_server\)
    -   Windows 2000 Server
    -   Windows 2003 Server
    -   Windows NT 4.0
-   Server \(cmdb\_ci\_server\)

    Any operating system that contains the word "Linux".

</table>## User

A standard object for describing an external interface for a user in the system.
