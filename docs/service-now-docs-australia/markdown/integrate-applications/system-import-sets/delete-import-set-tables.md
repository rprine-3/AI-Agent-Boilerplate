# Delete import set tables

Delete import set tables, related transform maps, or data only \(preserving the table structure\) to clean up your database.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Import Sets** &gt; **Import Set Tables** &gt; **Cleanup**.

2.  Move the tables you want to delete from **Available tables for deletion** to **Delete these tables**.

    Deleting any table deletes all records and removes the table.

3.  Include deleting related transform maps when you delete the import set tables by selecting the **Delete related transform maps** check box.

    All records and all associated transform maps are removed.

4.  Delete only data from the selected import set tables and preserve the table structure by selecting the **Delete data only \(preserve table structure\)** check box.

    All records are removed, but the tables remain intact.

5.  Click **Cleanup**.
