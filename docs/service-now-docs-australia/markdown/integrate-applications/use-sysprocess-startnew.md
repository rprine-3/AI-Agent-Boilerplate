2.  Drag the StartNew component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the StartNew component to the corresponding ports of the other component as described in the following table.

    |Port type|Purpose of connection|Mandatory?|
