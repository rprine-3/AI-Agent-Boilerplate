# Use the Find Window component

Set the focus back on various windows that are inactive or running in the background as part of a Robotic Process Automation workflow in the RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

The Find Window component identifies one or more rules associated with a Window and later uses the rules to set the focus back on the window. The component also returns the window handle of the window.

You can configure the properties for the Find Window component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the General components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/Properties-general-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **General** &gt; **Find Window**.

2.  Drag the Find Window component to the Design surface.

3.  Click the component settings icon \(\[Omitted image "component-settings-icon.png"\] Alt text: Component settings icon\).

4.  Click and drag the capture window icon \(\[Omitted image "drag-window.png"\] Alt text: Capture window icon.\) and drop it on the window that you want to find.
