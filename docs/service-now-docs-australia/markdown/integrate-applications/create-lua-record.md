# Create a robot license distribution record in RPA Hub

Define the consumption and distribution of licenses by creating a robot license distribution record in RPA Hub.

## Before you begin

You must do this task in the classic environment.

Familiarize yourself with license distribution in RPA Hub concepts. For more information, see [Robot license distribution in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/license-rpa-hub.md).

Install the RPA Hub. For more information, see [Install Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\) Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/install-rpa.md).

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## About this task

If the instance you are using is not domain separated, then create the license distribution record in the global domain.

If the instance you are using is domain separated, create a license distribution record in a top-down approach, starting with the top-level or primary domain. Do not create the license distribution record in the global domain. If the parent domain does not have a license distribution record, you can't create a license distribution record for child domains.

You can create only one license distribution record per domain.

A license distribution record is necessary to create any robots in the instance, for each domain.

For example, a domain separated instance with top domain and two child domains has 20 unattended robot licences and 45 attended robot licences. In each domain, you could assign 5 unattended robot licences and 15 attended robot licences. The **Available from Parent** field will show 10 unattended robot licences and 15 attended robot licences that are not yet assigned. When a robot is created in a child domain, a license is automatically utilized in that domain. In a license distribution record of a child domain, the **Utilized** field will show the value as 1 and the **Available to use or distribute** field will show the value as 4, which is remaining assigned licenses that are not yet utilized.

If you have more robots than the assigned licenses, then the instance or the specific domain \(and its child domains\) gets locked. Then, the robots do not execute automations in the current and child domains.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Robotic Process Automation** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Robots License Distribution**.
