# Request Zero Copy Connectors

Create zero copy connections and data fabric tables after requesting the Zero Copy Connectors app through the Now Support Service Catalog. If it isn't already installed, the app installs the Zero Copy Connector Hub.

## Before you begin

The Zero Copy Connectors app requires a separate subscription and must be activated by ServiceNow personnel.

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. The account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.

**Important:** The Zero Copy Connectors app is only supported on production and non-production instances. The Zero Copy Connectors app is not supported on demo instances.

If you don't have an account manager, decide to delay activation after purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a subproduction instance without charge, follow these steps.

Role required: admin

2.  Select **Request plugin** to open the **Activate Plugin** form on Now Support.
