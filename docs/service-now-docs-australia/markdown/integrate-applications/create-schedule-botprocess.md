# Create a schedule within a bot process in RPA Hub

Create a schedule within an unattended bot process to enable users to execute jobs in a planned manner at regular intervals. More than one schedule can be associated with one bot process.

## Before you begin

Do this task only when you select the **Process Type** field as **Unattended** on the Bot process configuration form, while you are creating a bot process. For more information, see [Configuring a bot process record in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-botprocess.md), [Bot process configuration form in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-botprocess-config.md), and [Bot Process form in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/select-botprocess.md).

\(Optional\) Configure the system properties related to **Activity Stream**, to add or remove the fields. The changes to these fields are captured in the work notes. For more information, see [Configure the system properties for an activity stream in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-sys-properties-activity.md).
