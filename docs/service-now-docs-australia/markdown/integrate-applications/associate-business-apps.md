# Assign a business application to a bot process in RPA Hub

Assign a business application to a bot process for an effective event correlation or to get information about assigned business applications. For example, you might want to see information about the SAP application.

## Before you begin

Create a bot process. For more information, see [Configuring a bot process record in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-botprocess.md).

Verify that the business application exists on this ServiceNow instance. To add a new business application, navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-service** &gt; **Business Applications**.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## About this task

You can add any credentials for assigned business applications. If you remove a business application, the associated application credentials are also removed.

You can't remove or edit an associated business application for a published or a retired bot process.

An RPA business user \[sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_business\_user\] can view the business applications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Robotic Process Automation** &gt; **RPA Hub Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(\[Omitted image "rpahublist-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\).
