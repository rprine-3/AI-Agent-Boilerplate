# Use the Occurrence component

Count how many times a character or word appears in a text body by using the Occurrence component in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the Occurrence component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the String Utilities components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/util-stringutil-prop.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Utilities** &gt; **String Utilities**.

2.  Drag the Occurrence component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the text fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the Occurrence component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.

    |Port type|Purpose of connection|Mandatory?|
    |---------|---------------------|----------|
    |Data In \(Text\)|Takes the text that the component searches from a previously executed component.|Yes|
    |Data In \(pattern\)|Takes the word or character that the component searches for the number of occurrences from a previously executed component.|Yes|
    |Data In \(IgnoreCase\)|Takes the Boolean value to indicate whether the component ignores the case while searching for occurrences from a previously executed component.|No|
    |Data Out \(Return\)|Returns the number of occurrences of the character or word as an integer and passes to the next component.|Yes|
    |Control In|Connects to the Control Out port of one or more components.|Yes|
    |Control Out|Connects to the Control In port of another component or the default end component.|No|

5.  To test the component, under the **DESIGN** tab, click **Run**.
