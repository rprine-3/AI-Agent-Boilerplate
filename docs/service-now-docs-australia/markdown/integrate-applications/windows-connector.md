# Windows connector

The Windows connector enables you to perform various actions on the Windows applications, and their user interface elements. These actions are performed through the methods provided by the Windows connector. You must configure the connector to expose its methods.

You must first use, configure, and then expose the methods in the Windows connector to use its methods.

-   To use the Windows connector, see [Use a connector in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-connector.md).
-   To configure the Windows connector, see [Configure Windows connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-windows-connector.md).
-   To expose the methods, see [Use connector method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-connector-method.md).
-   To use the methods, see [Use a component in RPA Desktop Design Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-components.md).

Windows connector methods are available at the following levels:

-   Connector
-   Screen
-   Element

|Method level|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|Connector|These methods enable you to perform actions on the connector to set a working directory, get the Windows handle, and more.|
