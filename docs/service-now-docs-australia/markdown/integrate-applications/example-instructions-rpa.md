## General guidelines

Follow these general guidelines when writing AI instructions:

-   **Be clear and specific**

    State exactly what you want. Use direct and clear sentences for the expected actions.

-   **Avoid vague language**

    Don't use jargon or abbreviations. Avoid ServiceNow jargon, such as FD - Flow Designer. For example, avoid instructions such as `Trigger a FD action named 'Action1', retrieve its output, and insert it into an existing Word`. Instead, use the phrase `Trigger a flow designer action named 'Action1', retrieve its output, and insert it into an existing Word file located at 'C:\Users\Worddocs\wordoc1.doc'`.

-   **Avoid ambiguity**

    Be specific for the context related to methods. For example, avoid instructions such as `Open file from file path 'C:\Users\Analysis\DataAnalysis.xlsx'`. Instead, use the phrase `Open an excel file from file path 'C:\Users\Analysis\DataAnalysis.xlsx'`.

-   **Set expectations and constraints**

    Specify component parameters wherever possible. For example, avoid instructions such as `Read the content of the file located in C drive and copy that content as the body of an email and then send it to 'email@ss.ss'`. Instead, use the phrase `Read the content of the file 'c:/d/f1/txt', and use the content as body to compose an outlook email with subject "my email text", and send this email to 'email@ss.ss'`.

-   **Use step-by-step instructions**

    Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. For example, use the phrase, `Open a Microsoft Word document located at 'C:\Marketing\Templates\Promo_Letter_Template.docx.', delete a specific page based on its index, add a new column to a table at a particular position, and close the document with changes saved` to make it clear and simple.
