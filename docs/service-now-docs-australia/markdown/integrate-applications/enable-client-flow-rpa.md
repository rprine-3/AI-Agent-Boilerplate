# Enable the client callable option on a flow or subflow in RPA Hub

Enable a client script to trigger an RPA Hub flow or subflow.

## Before you begin

You must do this task in the classic environment.

Make sure that you're familiar with the RPA Hub actions and subflow. For more information, see [Workflow Studio actions and subflow in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/rpa-hub-actions.md).

Invoke a flow or a subflow from Workflow Studio by using the InvokeFlow component or InvokeSubFlow component. For more information, see [Use the InvokeFlow component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-rpahub-flowdesigner-invokeflow.md) and [Use the InvokeSubFlow component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-rpahub-flowdesigner-invokesubflow.md).

By default, the flows, subflows, and actions can only be called by the FlowAPI within a server script. Flow and action designers can make individual flows, subflows, or actions available to client calls by enabling the Client callable option during design.

Consider the implications of making a flow or subflow client callable, such as whether it exposes protected data or bypasses validation logic.
