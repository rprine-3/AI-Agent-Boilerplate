3.  To configure the input field, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the control ports of the SetFileDropList component to the corresponding ports of the other components.
