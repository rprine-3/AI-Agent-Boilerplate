# Forms

The Forms components help you to trigger attended automations that are enabled with the Embedded Task Automation.

When you use the AttendedConfigurations component, it shows a list of attended configurations associated to the selected same bot process. To select and give control out port for each configuration that routes the automation logic.
-   **[Use the GetProcessFieldParameters component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-get-process-field-param-forms.md)**  
Gets the values of the associated **Table** fields mapped to the process field parameter, that you had configured in an attended configuration record of a bot process. The component returns both the individual values of the parameters and all values as an object. This component reads the value of the associated **Table** field in the ServiceNow form record.
-   **[Use the GetRecordContextID component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/use-get-record-context-id-forms.md)**  
Get the Sys ID of the ServiceNow form record that is associated to an attended configuration with the GetRecordContextID component in the RPA Desktop Design Studio. Sys ID is the output of the component. For example, Sys ID is used to fetch the attachments in a record.
