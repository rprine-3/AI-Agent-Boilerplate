# Install Unattended Robot

You can install the Unattended Robot application in your Windows machine if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you follow the hardware and software requirements. For more information, see [Requirements for Unattended Robot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/requirements-unattended-robot.md).

Ensure that you meet the following set up requirements:

-   An unattended robot is mapped to only one machine. This is applicable for standard robot.
-   The Windows machine or the Virtual Machine \(VM\) is persistent and constantly on to run unattended robots.
-   If connected via Citrix, the Windows machine or the VM must not go to sleep mode.
-   The idle timeout setting is turned off for the VDI pool.
-   Communication with the ServiceNow instance host is enabled.
-   Verify that the **glide.cometd.websocket.enabled** system property is set to true in the ServiceNow instance, to ensure that the robot is connected to the instance via websocket.
-   Verify that the websockets are also enabled on the client machine where the unattended robot runs.

Role required: admin
