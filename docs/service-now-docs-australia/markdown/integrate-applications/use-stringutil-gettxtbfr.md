# Use the GetTextBefore component

Find the string characters that are placed before a string by using the GetTextAfter component in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

This method is used to extract text that precedes a specified find string up to a specified length. If the length is 0, it extracts text from the beginning of the string.

You can configure the properties for the GetTextBefore component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the String Utilities components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/util-stringutil-prop.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Utilities** &gt; **String Utilities**.

2.  Drag the GetTextBefore component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the GetTextBefore component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.

Data In \(Text\)

</td><td>

Takes the text that the component searches from a previously executed component.Used to specify the string from where a sub string is extracted, starting at a position determined by a string match minus a specified length, and extending for a specified length.
