# Use the ChangeExtension component

Change the extension of a file by using the ChangeExtension component in RPA Desktop Design Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the ChangeExtension component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the File components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/util-file-prop.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Utilities** &gt; **File**.

2.  Drag the ChangeExtension component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the ChangeExtension component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.

## ChangeExtension component

Your RPA robot processes a batch of report files downloaded with `.txt` extension. To ensure consistency and compatibility with downstream systems, you need to rename these files to the `.doc` extension, after processing.

1.  Enter a variable component on the design canvas that stores the file path with extension.
2.  Add the ChangeExtension action after the variable component.
3.  Set the target extension to `.pdf`.
