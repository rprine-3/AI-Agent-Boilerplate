# Create an alert rule to generate custom notifications in RPA Hub

Create an alert rule to generate custom notifications for robots, schedules, process jobs, and other RPA Hub related tables.

## Before you begin

You must do this task in the classic environment.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_support\_user, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer, or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## About this task

Alert rules are configurations that define conditions in which an alert or a notification must be triggered. These rules help in managing and responding to issues identified in automations. These alert rules specify the condition or set of conditions that must be met for the alert to be triggered. For example, a trigger condition could be a certain error message, a performance metric exceeding a threshold, or the absence of expected data.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Robotic Process Automation** &gt; **Monitor** &gt; **Alert Rules**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

4.  Select **Save**.

Name

</td><td>

Unique name of the alert rule.

Active

</td><td>

Option to verify the usability of the alert rule.On clearing this option, the notifications will not be generated from this alert rule.

Application

</td><td>

Field that indicates which applications can use this alert rule.Role required to view this field: admin.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Alert Priority

</td><td>

Priority of the alert:-   **Critical**
-   **High**
-   **Medium**
-   **Low**

 The default value is set to **Medium**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Alert Type

Alert Trigger

</td></tr><tr><td>

Applies To

</td><td>

Table that the alert rule is applied on.For example, Bot Process \[cmdb\_ci\_rpa\_process\].

 Based on the table selected, after saving the record, a new related tab appears in the related list.

 For example, if you select a bot process related table in this field, the **Bot process** tab appears in the related list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Trigger Type

</td><td>

Trigger type of the alert rule:-   **Check Periodically**: The alert rule is triggered periodically, based on the settings in the Time duration \(hours\) list.
-   **When something happens**: The alert rule is triggered when something happens on a record that is selected in the Applies to table.

For example, if **Bot process** is selected from the Applies To list, an alert rule is triggered when a record is updated in the bot process.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Time Duration \(hours\)

</td><td>

Frequency, in hours, at which the alert rule is triggered.For example, if **Bot process** is selected from the Applies To list, an alert rule is triggered when a record is updated in the bot process every **24** hours.

 This field appears only when **Check Periodically** is selected from the Trigger Type list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Trigger Conditions

</td><td>

Conditions at which the alerts are triggered.Select a table from the Applies To list before modifying this field.

 Within the **Trigger Conditions** section, you can use the **Add Filter Condition** to add a trigger condition. For example, you might want to generate an alert rule when the life-cycle stage status of a bot process is not retired. In that case, select **Life Cycle Stage Status** from the – choose field – list, **is not** from the – oper – list, and **Retired** from the – value – list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apply Threshold

</td><td>

Option to verify the usability of the threshold.For example, if a **Process job** is selected from the Applies To list and a percentage or a number of process jobs fail in a given time period, to trigger an alert rule for the failure message, this option must be selected for the configuration of the threshold condition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Threshold Type

</td><td>

Type of threshold:-   **Count**
-   **Percentage**

 This field appears only when the **Apply Threshold** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set Condition \(Threshold\)

</td><td>

Threshold conditions to trigger alerts.Select a table from the Applies To list before modifying this field.

 This field appears only when **Percentage** is selected from the Threshold Type list.

 For example, you might want to generate an alert rule when a percentage of process jobs fail in a given time period. In that case, select **Created** in the – choose field – list, **on** in the – oper – list, and **Today** in the – value – list.

 \[Omitted image "alert-rule-set-condition.png"\] Alt text: Set threshold condition to trigger alerts.

Comparison

</td><td>

Qualifier to trigger alerts:-   **Is equal to**
-   **Is less than**
-   **Is more than**
-   **Is less than or equal to**
-   **Is more than or equal to**

 This field appears only when the **Apply Threshold** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Threshold Value

</td><td>

Value to determine if an alert rule must be triggered based on the qualifier selected in the **Comparison** field.For example, if a few process jobs fail in a day. To set a condition, select **Count** in the Threshold Type list, **Is more than** in the Comparison list, and **10** in the Threshold Value list.

 This field appears only when the **Apply Threshold** option is selected.
