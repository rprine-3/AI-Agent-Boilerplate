# Retire an MFA authenticator in RPA Hub

Retire a multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) authenticator in RPA Hub so that you can turn off the authentication. After you retire an MFA authenticator, it can’t be used again.

## Before you begin

Familiarize yourself with multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) concepts. For more information, see [Multi-factor authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/mfa-landing.md).

Familiarize yourself with the TOTP authentication in RPA Hub. For more information, see [TOTP authentication in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/totp-authentication-rpa.md).

You must do this task in the classic environment.

Create an MFA authenticator record. For more information, see [Create an MFA authenticator in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-mfa-authenticator-rpa.md).

Verify that the MFA authenticator record isn’t associated to a bot process whose life-cycle stage status is **Build**, **Published**, or **Retired**. If it's not associated to one of those statuses, dissociate it to retire the MFA authenticator.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Robotic Process Automation** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Authenticators**.

2.  Open the MFA authenticator that you want to retire.

3.  In the form header, select **Retire**.

4.  In the Confirmation dialog box, select **Retire**.
