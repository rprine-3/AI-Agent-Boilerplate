# Create a Prometheus connection

Establish a zero copy connection to a Prometheus system in Zero Copy Connector Hub.

## Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

## About this task

Work with your data source admin to create a connection to Prometheus. For additional information about connecting, refer to the [Prometheus connector documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).

**Note:** This connector was developed by the open-source community and made available through the ServiceNow AI Platform for general use. Functionality can vary and might not cover all use cases supported by primary connectors.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the available community connectors in Zero Copy Connector Hub in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Available connectors** &gt; **Community connectors**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector Hub** &gt; **Available connectors** &gt; **Community connectors**.
2.  Find the Prometheus connector and select **Connect**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_kmx_fw1_2fc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Name and description

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connection label

</td><td>

Unique name for this connection. This helps in identifying the connection within your system.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Connection name

</td><td>

System-generated name based on the Connection label. This field cannot be modified once the connection is established.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short description

</td><td>

Description of the connection explaining what it is about.

Connection attributes

Connection URL

</td><td>

Endpoint for the Prometheus coordinator host. For example:`https://<host>/<path>`

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Authentication methods

</td></tr><tr><td>

Authentication method

</td><td>

Authentication method to use with Prometheus. Default is Basic Authentication.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Username

</td><td>

Username for basic authentication. This field appears only when Basic Authentication is selected from Authentication Method.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Password

</td><td>

Password associated with the username. This field appears only when Basic Authentication is selected from Authentication Method.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Configure the connection security method.

    -   If you want to use Java security CA certificates to establish a secure connection with the data source, select **Default**.

        This option uses public certificates already available in the Java security truststore.

    -   If your data source requires one-way SSL and uses its own certificates, select **TLS**.

        Only one-way TLS \(server validation\) is supported. mTLS isn't supported.

5.  If you selected TLS, attach the Base64-encoded truststore PEM file.

<table id="choicetable_iqc_pl2_h3c"><tbody><tr><td id="d510756e278">

**Attach TrustStore file**

</td><td>

Upload the PEM file by selecting **Attach PEM file** and selecting the file.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d510756e290">

**Enter TrustStore file contents**

</td><td>

Copy and paste the contents of the truststore file, verifying the content begins with: ```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
```

 and ends with: ```
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Select **Connect**.

7.  In the DataFabric Connector Properties \[sn\_df\_connector\_properties\] table, set properties for queries that retrieve data from Prometheus.

    1.  Enter `sn_df_connector_properties.LIST` in the navigation filter.

    2.  Set the following properties.

        -   **prometheus.max.query.range.duration** — Defines the maximum span of time series data that the Prometheus connector can retrieve in a single query.
        -   **prometheus.query.chunk.size.duration** — Specifies the duration of each time chunk when splitting a query range into smaller intervals. Accepts standard duration notation \(for example, 1y, 1w, 1d, 1h, 30m\). The connector executes one query per chunk, reducing the risk of timeouts and improving performance on the Prometheus server. For more information, see [Range Vector Selectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/1.8/querying/basics/#range-vector-selectors).

## Result

A test connection is made to the external data source, verifying that the connection details are correct and the data source is accessible.

## What to do next

If the connection succeeds, configure data steward access on the **Access Control** tab. See .

If the connection fails, verify the connection details with your data source administrator and try again.
