# Create a model

Add a model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) to create a dataset containing tables from the ERP system to read and send updates to the ERP system.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

This video was recorded in the Zurich release.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Video that shows how to create a custom model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

## About this task

A model functions as a staging area that contains all potential fields you can add to remote and extraction tables, as well as, create, read, and update operations. You can then use the tables and queried data as a data source on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the ERP models page by selecting the models icon \[Omitted image "erpc-data-model-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the side panel.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the new model tab, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Zero Copy Connector for ERP new model field descriptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-new-model-descriptions.md).

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  Open the ERP models page again by selecting the models icon \[Omitted image "erpc-data-model-icon.png"\] Alt text:.

7.  Update the page by selecting the refresh list icon.

    The new model is displayed in the list.


## What to do next

After you add a new ERP model, specify additional criteria. For example, which tables it reads and joins, any parameters for inputs and outputs, and whether it uses a BAPI to update the ERP system. For more information, see the following topics:
