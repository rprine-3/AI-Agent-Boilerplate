# Add a REST service manually in Zero Copy Connector for ERP

When adding an entity to a model using REST, if the service you need isn't listed, add the service manually in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

Complete the following before adding a service manually:

-   Enable the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property. For more information, see [Install Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/install-erp-integration.md).
-   Create a connection and credential alias, specifying REST as the **Connection type**. For more information, see [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connection-alias.md).
-   Create a REST connection for the service. Add the connection alias that you created and the connection URL.

-   Create a system that uses the REST connection. For more information, see [Create an ERP system in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/create-an-erp-system.md). On the system record, confirm that the heartbeats are successful and the retrieval status is complete. If any have failed, select **Restart data retrieval**.
