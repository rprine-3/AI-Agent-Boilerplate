# Choose output parameters for a model

Specify output parameters for a model operation in Zero Copy Connector for ERP to define which ERP fields map to the ServiceNow AI Platform and how the returned data is stored.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

## About this task

If you're already in the process of managing a model and ready to specify outputs, you can skip to step 5.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the model page by selecting the models icon \[Omitted image "erpc-data-model-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the side panel.

3.  Select the model that you want to add a read operation to.

4.  Select the **Manage model** button.

5.  Open a model operation.

    If you don't have a model operation, add one to the model. For more information, see [Add an operation to a model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erpc-manage-models-read-op.md).

6.  Open an entity.

    If you don't have an entity, add one to the operation. For more information, see [Adding an entity to a model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/add-an-entity-to-model.md).

7.  Select the **Choose outputs** tab.

8.  Review the existing outputs to see if you must add any additional parameters.

    \[Omitted image "erpc-output-parameters-manager-zs2.png"\] Alt text: Choose outputs page.

    The **Required outputs** section lists any fields that you added to the inputs. The output page displays these fields as read-only; edit or remove them on the input page.

    **Note:** Required output applies only to table and OData entities.

    In the Table/Functioncall section, define the parameters the operation uses. The Table section appears for read operations, and the Functioncall section appears for BAPI operations.

    Zero Copy Connector for ERP automatically suggests mappings between table fields in source systems and target models. For example, map the fields of source table "purchase order - v2" with the fields of a relevant target table such as "platform table purchase order." This reduces the amount of manual work to do, while still giving you control to edit the mappings as needed. For more information, see [Zero Copy Connector for ERP AI semantic field mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-semantic-mapping.md).

    **Note:** The system generates mapped value names in inputs and outputs automatically, but you can edit them manually. For more information, see [Edit input and output mapped value name in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-edit-mapped-value-name-in-model-manager.md).

9.  Add a new output field or parameter.

    1.  Select the add icon \(+\) next to the last-defined parameter.

        If you are adding a mapped field for a table read operation, make sure to add the field to the applicable table section.

    2.  Search for and select the **Field name** for table reads or **Parameter name** for BAPI \(Business Application Programming Interface\) operations.

        The **Data type** field is automatically updated with the applicable values for your selection.

    3.  Enter the corresponding value in the **Mapped value** field.

    If you're adding a complex, nested parameter, such as an address that includes other parameters \(for street, for city, etc.\), Zero Copy Connector for ERP automatically identifies that it needs additional related parameters. Zero Copy Connector for ERP creates new, nested parameter rows that you must then populate with the related values. You can nest only parameters with **Object** or **Array** as the **Data type**.

    The following example shows outputs and nested outputs for a BAPI.

    \[Omitted image "erpc-output-parameters-nested.png"\] Alt text: Table expanded to show outputs with a nested output highlighted.

10. Add any nested output fields or parameters to choose what data to include from a complex parameter.

    For example, you may have a full billing address in the object parameters but only need the city and postal code as output.

    1.  Specify the parent output field or parameter.

    2.  Select the settings icon\[Omitted image "erpc-output-indent-icon.png"\] Alt text: or add icon + for the parent row.

    3.  In the modal that appears, select any additional, related fields or parameters to include.

    The parent automatically updates with the related, nested fields or parameters you selected.

11. Select **Save**.


## Result

When you add mapped fields or parameters as outputs and successfully read or update the ERP system, each parameter appears as a field. You can then add the field to a remote table or an extraction table. Manage the fields for the remote table or extraction table to add the retrieved parameters.
