# Using Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Use Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) to work with ERP models, remote tables, and extraction tables, and integrate ERP data from the ERP system onto the ServiceNow AI Platform.

The workflow of Zero Copy Connector for ERP generally follows its main sections, each of which you access by selecting the section icon in the contextual side panel.

You can also build flows in Workflow Studio to use retrieved ERP data for processes or tasks outside of Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

Build an ERP model using remote tables and extraction tables to organize, load, and transform ERP data, as well as flows to query the ERP system.

ERP models

</td><td>

Models function as templates for sets of tables that give you access to ERP data. You can use the standard Zero Copy Connector for ERP models as-is, or clone them to make changes.Manage models to map input and output data for reading and updating the ERP system using either table read operations or BAPIs \(business application programming interfaces\).

For more information, see [Building and managing models to work with ERP data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/work-with-erp-data-models.md).

Scripted API

</td><td>

Access ERP systems using the Zero Copy Connector for ERP scripted API. For more information, see [REST API connector for Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-rest-api-connector.md).

Flow action to query ERP data

</td><td>

Build a flow in Workflow Studio with the **Use ERP Data** flow action. Specify the details required to query the ERP system using the parameters defined in the model

</td></tr><tr><td>

Remote tables

</td><td>

Remote tables enable you to view and query data from the ERP system on the ServiceNow AI Platform.For more information, see [Using ERP remote tables in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-work-with-remote-tables.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

ERP extraction tables

</td><td>

Extraction tables use an extract, transform, load \(ETL\) process to extract large amounts of data from the ERP system at regular intervals, and then transform and save it to a Glide table.For more information, see [ERP data extraction and transformation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-extraction-tables.md).
