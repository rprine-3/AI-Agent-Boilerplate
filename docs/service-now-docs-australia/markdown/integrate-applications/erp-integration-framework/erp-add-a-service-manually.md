# Add an OData service manually in Zero Copy Connector for ERP

When adding an entity to a model using OData, if the service you need isn't listed, add the service manually in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

You can connect to an ERP system based on a metadata URL or an uploaded metadata file \(xml\). The file option enables you to, for example, access data from SuccessFactors. For more information, see [Obtaining data from SAP SuccessFactors using OData V2 APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/obtain-data-from-successfactors-using-odata-v2-apis.md).

Before you can add a service manually, you must do the following:

-   Confirm that you have an SAP system that has been enabled to make an OData connection.
-   Enable the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property. For more information, see [Install Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/install-erp-integration.md).
-   Create a connection and credential alias, specifying HTTP as the **Connection type**. For more information, see [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connection-alias.md).
-   Create an HTTP connection for the service. Add the connection alias that you created and the connection URL.
-   Create a system that uses the HTTP connection. For more information, see [Create an ERP system in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/create-an-erp-system.md). On the system record, confirm that the heartbeats are successful and the retrieval status is complete. If any have failed, select **Restart data retrieval**.
-   If you're going to connect using a URL, copy the metadata URL from the ERP system to which you're linking. Use the relative URL containing only the path following the domain, for example, v2/northwind/northwind.svc/$metadata.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

    3.  Check that a **Service base URL** is filled in automatically and a **Service name** is created automatically.

        -   Provide a different **Metadata URL**.
        -   In the **All** menu, enter `sn_erp_integration_odata_service_catalog.list` and delete the previous entry of service from the table.
