# Flows installed with Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) includes ERP flows that run automatically.

You don't need to do anything to activate the flows, but you can customize them in Workflow Studio, for example, to change the time that they run each day. For more information, see [Edit a flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flow-edit.md).

**Note:** Zero Copy Connector for ERP appears as **ERP Integration** when you work with it in Workflow Studio.

The flows that Zero Copy Connector for ERP automatically runs are:

-   Get SAP BAPIs and tables when system becomes active: This flow runs as soon as the heartbeat for an ERP system is live. It detects and retrieves the available BAPIs \(Business Application Programming Interfaces\) and tables for use when managing models. This flow also reads the OData catalog service if the OData heartbeat is successful.
-   ETL SAP BAPIs and Tables From all systems: This flow calls the Get SAP BAPIs and tables when system becomes active flow every night to retrieve any changes to available BAPIs and tables on the ERP system.

The flows write data to the following tables:

-   sn\_erp\_integration\_sap\_tables
-   sn\_erp\_integration\_sap\_bapi\_list
