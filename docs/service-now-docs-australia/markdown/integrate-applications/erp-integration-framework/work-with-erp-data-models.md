# Building and managing models to work with ERP data

Models in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) function as templates for sets of tables that give you access to ERP data. Use model management to build read, update, and create operations that access the ERP system. The operations have specified inputs and outputs to map fields for use on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Models represent datasets and create a staging area

A model represents the logical structure and organization of data coming from the ERP system. Models define the entities, attributes, read/update operations, and table join relationships that capture and represent business processes and data elements in the ERP system.When you first open Zero Copy Connector for ERP, you view a list of the models for your instance.

Zero Copy Connector for ERP supports two types of models:

-   Platform model: Model with input and output fields mapped to an already existing platform table. These models standardize ERP data by mapping it to existing ServiceNow platform tables.
-   ERP model: New, custom ERP model. These models follow the data structures defined by the connected, external ERP system. ERP models accommodate the unique formats of each ERP system.

Zero Copy Connector for ERP provides a standard set of models, such as SAP Material Stock and SAP Purchase Document. For a list, see [Standard extraction tables for Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-standard-extraction-tables.md). For information about building new models, see [Create a model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erpc-add-new-data-model.md). Use Zero Copy Connector for ERP data products, sets of predefined models and process extensions, as examples to help you implement and deploy applications with less manual work. For more information, see [Zero Copy Connector for ERP content packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-content-packs.md).

A model serves as a blueprint for configuring, customizing, and integrating the ERP system to meet your business requirements. A model functions as a staging area that contains all potential fields you can add to remote and extraction tables, as well as, create, read, and update operations. You can then use the tables and queried data as a data source on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

You can also build flows in Workflow Studio to use retrieved ERP data for processes or tasks outside of Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

You can view the list of existing models or add a new one to create a custom dataset. After you add a remote table, you can manage models to map input and output parameters, update the ERP system using BAPIs, and create table joins. You can also create extraction tables that regularly pull large amounts of filtered data from the ERP system. Another option is to use a custom ERP action in Workflow Studio to bring queried ERP data into other ServiceNow AI Platform processes.

You can create as many models as needed, though you can't edit their field names. You must have the sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin role to create and edit models.

## Model structure

Each model is linked to tables on the ERP system, as well as remote tables and ERP extraction tables on the ServiceNow AI Platform. You can connect the same table to multiple different models.

Each model connects to one ERP system. The connected ERP system:

-   Enables access to field and table information.
-   Helps coordinate data synchronization, sharing, and collaboration, enabling integration and operation between the model and the ERP system.

Models encompass remote tables from the ERP system, as well as APIs, ERP extraction tables, and create/read/update operations, to create a holistic dataset. For example, you can have one model for sales orders and another for inventory.

**Note:**

After installing Zero Copy Connector for ERP, an admin or a user with the sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin role must enable the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property so users can customize models. After enabling the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property, Zero Copy Connector for ERP retrieves all tables and BAPIs \(Business Application Programming Interface\) to use when managing models.System properties are maintained in the System Property table \[sys\_properties\], which you can access using the module navigator, or by directly entering `sys_properties.list` in the Navigator Filter.

## Managing models to perform create, read, and update operations on ERP systems

After you create or clone a model, you can specify how Zero Copy Connector for ERP reads, writes, and creates on the ERP system using the model manager page. When managing models, you can use a BAPI, which is an SAP remote procedure call that's similar to an API.

Each model can have only one create, one read, and one update operation defined.
