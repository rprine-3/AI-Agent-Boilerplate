# Debug Zero Copy Connector for ERP models

Use the debug models option in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) to see a log capturing the probe payload, payload response, status, and other information.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

## About this task

View debug logs from within Zero Copy Connector for ERP to obtain information about requests, responses, and payloads without having to open Workflow Studio.

Keep the following guidance in mind when debugging Zero Copy Connector for ERP models:

-   Turn debugging on and off as needed.
-   Debug logs persist for the current session only.
-   The system clears debug logs automatically each day.
-   For probe executions triggered through **Use ERP Data** flows, the system stores flow context IDs.
-   For probe executions outside of **Use ERP Data** flows, the system stores only transaction IDs, not flow context IDs.

## Procedure

1.  To turn on debugging, navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Enable ERP Models Debugging**.

2.  Select **Confirm**.

3.  To view the logs, navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Open Debug Logs**.

    Debug logs show flow engine context, probe communication, probe payload, payload response, status, and more.

    For details about the columns in debug logs, see [Zero Copy Connector for ERP debug logs field descriptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-debug-logs-columns.md).

4.  To turn off debugging, navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Disable ERP Models Debugging**.
