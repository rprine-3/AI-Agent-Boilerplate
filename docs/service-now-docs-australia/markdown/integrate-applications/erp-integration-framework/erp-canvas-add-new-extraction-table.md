# Add a new ERP extraction table in Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Create an ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) extraction table to capture large amounts of data every day, and save the data to a transformation \(staging\) table. The data is then available on the ServiceNow AI Platform, and you can add the extracted data to an ERP model or remote table.

## Before you begin

You must first configure the source table, target table, and table transform map before those tables can be added to an ERP extraction table. For more information on creating table transform maps, see [Create a transform map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/system-import-sets/t_CreateATransformMap.md).

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

## About this task

Zero Copy Connector for ERP provides a number of standard extraction tables, which you can use as-is. If you must change a standard extraction table, copy the table and then update the copied version.

You can create multiple ERP extraction tables, and multiple extraction tables can use the same ERP model. For example, create separate extraction tables for sales contracts, sales inquires, and old sales orders.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the ERP extraction tables page by selecting the extraction tables icon \[Omitted image "erpc-extraction-table-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the side panel.

3.  Select the **New** button.

    \[Omitted image "erpc-new-extraction-table.png"\] Alt text: New extraction table fields.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Zero Copy Connector for ERP extraction table field descriptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-extraction-table-descriptions.md).

5.  Select **Save**.
