# Use ERP Data action details for flows

After you're done creating and managing your model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP, go to Workflow Studio and use the Use ERP Data action to test your model's inputs and outputs. You can then build a flow with the action to incorporate ERP data into the ServiceNow AI Platform.

For information on using the Use ERP Data action to retrieve ERP data, see [Building flows to read or update the ERP system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-build-flow-operation.md).
