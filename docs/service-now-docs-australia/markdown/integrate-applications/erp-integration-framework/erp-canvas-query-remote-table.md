# Query a remote table using Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Query ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) remote tables from an ERP system directly from the **All** menu using Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_user

## About this task

You can query the ERP system to create an ERP model for your ERP processes. For more information, see [Building and managing models to work with ERP data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/work-with-erp-data-models.md).

**Note:** Zero Copy Connector for ERP doesn't replicate data into the ServiceNow AI Platform. It mirrors data that lives in the ERP system, and remains protected there.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the Remote tables page by selecting the remote tables icon \[Omitted image "erpc-remote-table-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the side panel.

3.  Select the remote table in the **Name** column, such as **SAP Country**.

4.  Select **Open remote table list**.

5.  Query the remote table using Glide for SAP.

    For example, you can select and hold \(or right-click\) on a column, such as **Storage location**, and select **Show Matching** records.

    The SAP data is accessible for you to work with using standard ServiceNow AI Platform searching, sorting, and filtering, such as the condition builder. For more information, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).
