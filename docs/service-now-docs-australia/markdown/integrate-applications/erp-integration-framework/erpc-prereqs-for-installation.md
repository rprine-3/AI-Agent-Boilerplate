# Requirements for installing Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Before you install Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\), you must complete several configurations on both the ERP system and the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Licensing

Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to Zero Copy Connector for ERP. For more information, see [Licensing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/licensing.md).

## ServiceNow AI Platform plugins

The following plugins are required to install Zero Copy Connector for ERP:

-   Integration Hub plugin \(for more information, see [Request Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/request-ih-overview.md)\)
-   Financial Services Remote Tables plugin \(for more information, see [Activate the remote tables plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/activate-remote-tables-plugin.md)\)

## MID Server requirements

**Note:** If you use a cloud solution, such as S/4HANA Cloud or SuccessFactors, MID Server is not required.

Communicating with the ERP system through a MID Server requires a valid connection and credential alias.

**Note:** The credentials you specify for the Zero Copy Connector for ERP connection must match the service user credentials in the ERP system.

Zero Copy Connector for ERP and ERP Semantic Mining currently support ECC \(minimum SAP Netweaver 7.31\) and SAP S/4HANA systems.

Navigate to **All** &gt; **MID Server** &gt; **Servers**, select a MID Server, and add the following:

-   In the **Supported applications** tab, edit the list to include Zero Copy Connector for ERP.
-   In the **Capabilities** tab, add Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

For more information, see [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

Assign the sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_mid\_server role to the mid\_user account. The role enables the MID Server to use the ImportSet API to send data to the ServiceNow instance.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Users**.
2.  Find and select the **mid\_user**.
3.  Select the **Roles** tab.
4.  Select **Edit**.
5.  Find and assign the **sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_mid\_server** role.

## Required SAP authorizations in development system

For the credentials, use an SAP service-type user account in your ERP system that has the following SAP authorization objects:

-   S\_RFC with Activity 16 \(Execute\) for the following Function Modules:
    -   RFCPING
    -   BAPI\_MONITOR\_GETLIST
    -   RFC\_METADATA\_GET
    -   RFC\_GET\_FUNCTION\_INTERFACE
    -   RFC\_READ\_TABLE
    -   DDIF\_FIELDINFO\_GET
-   S\_TABU\_NAM with Activity 03 \(Display\) for the following tables:
    -   DD01L
    -   DD02L
    -   DD02T
    -   DD03L
    -   DD04L
    -   DD04T
    -   DD12L
    -   DD17S
    -   DD40L
-   S\_DEVELOP with Activity 03 \(Display\)

## Required SAP authorizations in production and test systems

For the credentials, use an SAP service-type user account in your ERP system that has the following SAP authorization objects:

-   S\_RFC with Activity 16 \(Execute\) for the following Function Modules:
    -   RFCPING
    -   BAPI\_TRANSACTION\_COMMIT
    -   BAPI\_TRANSACTION\_ROLLBACK
    -   RFC\_METADATA\_GET
    -   RFC\_GET\_FUNCTION\_INTERFACE
    -   RFC\_READ\_TABLE
-   S\_TABU\_NAM with Activity 03 \(Display\) for the tables that you use in models.

## SAP proprietary files

Contact the administrator of your SAP ECC RFC account to obtain the following SAP proprietary JAR files and other required files:

-   Create a record called "SAP Jco Dll" and attach `sapjco3.dll`. Use this file if your MID Server is installed on a Windows server.
-   Create a record called "SAP Jco so" and attach `libsapjco3.so`. Use this file if your MID Server is installed on a Linux server.
-   Create a record called "SAP Jco Jar" and attach `sapjco3.jar`. Use this file for both Windows and Linux.

**Note:** Create the records at **All** &gt; **MID Server** &gt; **JAR Files**. For more information about creating JAR files and adding attachments, see [Synchronize a JAR file to MID Servers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_SynchronizeAJARFiletoMIDServers.md).

The MID Server restarts multiple times during this process.

For details about these files, see [SAP ECC RFC Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/sap-ecc-rfc-spoke.md).

## SAP configuration

You must configure the JCo connector before you install Zero Copy Connector for ERP. For more information, see [Installing the SAP Java Connection \(JCo\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/ffe3b941e82641bc97b76ce522423d83.html) on the SAP Help Portal.

You must add the DuckDB JDBC JAR file as a MID Server JAR file. For more information and to download, see [DuckDB JDBC Driver 1.1.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.duckdb/duckdb_jdbc/1.1.1) on the Maven website.

You need the following on your ERP system:

-   SAP ECC \(minimum SAP NetWeaver 7.31\)
-   SAP S/4HANA \(all versions supported\)
-   SAP Java Connector
