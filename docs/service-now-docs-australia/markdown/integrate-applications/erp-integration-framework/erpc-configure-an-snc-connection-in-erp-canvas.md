# Configure an SNC connection in Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Learn how to set up an SNC connection, including preparing the environment, configuring the SAP system, and testing the configuration.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Confirm that you have the following:

-   An SNC-compatible security library, such as SAP Secure Login Library or a Kerberos-based library.
-   Administrative access to the SAP system and the server where it's hosted.

## Procedure

1.  Install the required security library on the MID Server by navigating to **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

2.  Search for and open the **Zero Copy Connector for ERP RFC** alias with the ID sn\_erp\_integration.ERP\_Canvas\_RFC.

3.  In **Related Links**, select **Create New Connection &amp; Credential**.

    \[Omitted image "erpc-snc-connection1.png"\] Alt text: Alias record with name, ID, and related link option highlighted.

4.  Complete the form.

    For information about the fields, see [Configure the Zero Copy Connector for ERP credentials and connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/set-up-erp-integration-connection.md).

5.  Restart the MID Server to apply the changes.

    For more information, see [Manually start, stop, and restart a MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_InstallMIDServerAsWinService.md).

6.  Verify that the SNC configuration is working correctly.

    2.  On the home page, select **Actions**.

    3.  Hover over the **Name** column and select the filter icon.

    4.  Filter for **contains** and type `heartbeat`.

    5.  Select **Apply**.

    6.  Select **HeartBeat**.

    7.  Select **Test**.

    8.  Specify a **system** and then select **Run Test**.

        \[Omitted image "erpc-snc-connection3.png"\] Alt text: Test action window with system field and run test button highlighted.

    9.  When the test is complete, select the link **Your test has finished running. View the Action execution details**.

    10. Verify that the connection properties set are passed as input.

    11. Verify that **isAlive** is true, and if it's false, validate the parameters.
