# Add a read table entity to a model operation

Specify the read table entity that a Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) model uses for a read, update, or create operation.

## Before you begin

The read, update, or create operation must be added before an entity can be added to it. For more information, see [Add an operation to a model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erpc-manage-models-read-op.md).

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the ERP model page by selecting the models icon \[Omitted image "erpc-data-model-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the side panel.

3.  Select the model to add an operation entity to.

4.  Select the **Manage model** button.

5.  Select an operation, for example, a **Read** operation.

6.  Select **Select entity** on the **Manage entities** tab.

    \[Omitted image "erpc-manage-entities-manager-ys22.png"\] Alt text: Add operation entities on the manage models tab.

7.  Select a type, for example, **Read table**.

    \[Omitted image "erpc-add-entity-manager-ys2.png"\] Alt text: Select the type of entity you're adding.

    You can select **Preview table data** to view table details before specifying an entity. For more information, see [Preview read table entities in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-preview-entity.md).

8.  Select an entity, for example, a read table name.

    The AI Search for this field helps you find entities faster, for example, by entering `Countries` instead of `T005`.

    For table read operations, you may need to check the **Model entities** tab of the current or another related model to get the table name. Alternatively, ask your SAP administrator. For more information, see [View and edit models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/view-and-work-with-erp-data-models.md).

9.  Select **Add entity**.

    The entity card shows the date and time when the information was last retrieved.

    \[Omitted image "erp-add-read-entity-to-model1.png"\] Alt text: Manage model tab with entity card showing retrieval date and time.

10. Rearrange and delete table entities as needed.

    **Important:** Reordering deletes any existing table joins for the reordered entities.

    1.  Select **Rearrange order**, drag the tables to the order that you want, and select **Confirm reorder**.

    2.  To remove any tables you don't need, select the delete icon \[Omitted image "trash-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: on the card for a table.

        Deleting an entity removes all of its related field mappings and table joins.
