# REST API connector for Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Use the REST API connector to connect to any RESTful API with standardized API specification formats.

## REST API connector

You can use REST APIs to access business data from ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) systems. Integrating these APIs requires manual processes. The REST API connector solves this by providing a reusable, low-code integration layer.

For API details, see [sn\_erp\_integration API - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/sn_erp_integrationBothAPI.md).

## REST service connection configuration

REST connections use the HTTP connection template. For more information, see [Create an HTTP\(s\) connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-https-connection.md).

## Authentication options

The connector supports the following authentication options:

-   Basic Auth: A username and password \(Base64-encoded\). For more information, see [Basic authentication credential](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_BasicAuthCredentialsForm.md).
-   JWT \(JSON Web Token\): A bearer token authentication. For more information, see [JWT Bearer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/jwt-bearer.md).
-   API Key: A key passed as a header or query parameter. For more information, see [API key credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/API-key-credential-form.md).
-   OAuth 2.0: A token authentication with automatic token refresh. For more information, see [Manage OAuth tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_ManageTokens.md).

ServiceNow Vault stores credentials securely. For more information, see [Exploring ServiceNow Vault](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/exploring-servicenow-vault.md).

The system validates that the configured credential type matches one of the authentication schemes defined in the API specification before allowing execution.

## Importing a REST API definition into the Zero Copy Connector for ERP Model Manager

Import a REST API definition using one of the following methods:

-   Use the Swagger/OpenAPI URL and provide a public URL that points to a specification file. The system extracts the service name from the URL automatically. You can edit the service name before adding the service. After the service is added, all endpoints matching the current operation type become available for selection.
-   Upload a Swagger/OpenAPI JSON or Swagger/OpenAPI YAML file.

## Mapping data to your data model

After you import a REST service, use the Model Manager to define entities and map API response fields to the data model. For more information, see [Add a REST entity to a model operation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/add-a-rest-entity-to-a-model-operation.md).

## MID Server support

If your REST API runs on-premises or behind a firewall, you can route API calls through a MID Server. The connection record includes a midServerName property that routes traffic through the designated MID Server. Cloud-hosted APIs can connect directly without a MID Server. For more information, see [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md).

## REST API connector tables

For information about the REST API connector tables that support Zero Copy Connector for ERP, see [REST API connector tables for Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-rest-api-tables.md).
