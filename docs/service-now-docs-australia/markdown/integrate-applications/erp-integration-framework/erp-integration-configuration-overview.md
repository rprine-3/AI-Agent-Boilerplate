# Configuring Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Install Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) to configure connections to ERP systems.

## Connecting to an instance

Zero Copy Connector for ERP uses basic authentication to connect a ServiceNow instance with an instance on the ERP system \(such as SAP\).

After you configure a connection, you can read and update the ERP system and create records with Zero Copy Connector for ERP using ERP models. You can also create remote tables and extraction tables.

Use ERP Semantic Mining to identify legacy applications that are good candidates for replatforming, making their data immediately available on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [ERP Semantic Mining](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-customization-mining/erp-customization-mining-overview.md).

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, ERP Semantic Mining is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

## Connecting to multiple instances

The number of ERP connections you can have per ServiceNow instance depends on your license.
