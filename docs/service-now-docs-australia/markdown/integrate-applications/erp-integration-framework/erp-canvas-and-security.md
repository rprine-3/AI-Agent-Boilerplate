# Zero Copy Connector for ERP and security

In addition to role-based security and access control, Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) protects personally identifiable data in other ways.

Personally identifiable data is secured with Zero Copy Connector for ERP in several ways.

-   You can customize models and remote tables to exclude personal data in a specified field, such as email address.
-   All remote tables are secured using access control rules \(ACLs\). If you have a remote table that contains sensitive data, use ACLs to restrict that table from ServiceNow users. For more information, see [ServiceNow® access control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_SNCAccessControl.md).
