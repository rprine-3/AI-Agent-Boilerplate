# Connecting Zero Copy Connector for ERP to SAP using OData

Extract data securely from ERP OData v2 APIs for use in remote tables and extraction tables.

**Important:**

OData v2 doesn't use snapshot isolation, so you might experience some data consistency issues when retrieving data from an external ERP source.

## Providing OData access to users

You must have an SAP system enabled for OData connections.

To give users OData access, see the following instructions on the SAP help site: [Back-End Server: Assign OData Service Authorization to Users](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_ssb/1.0/en-US/6f/0e415370107d77e10000000a441470/content.htm?no_cache=true).

## Enabling download of XML files

The glide.attachment.extensions system property restricts the file types that can be downloaded. This property is empty by default. Check that the xml file extension hasn't been added to this property. For more information, see .

## System properties

The following are properties related to OData.

<table id="table_qkj_xs4_bdc"><thead><tr><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_erp\_integration.catalog\_service\_path

</td><td>

string

</td><td>

After the hostname and port, this path is used to connect with any SAP catalog service. The default is: /sap/opu/odata/iwfnd/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection. After you create the property and set it to true, a list of all services is retrieved from SAP. The information is stored in an XML file and attached to the system record. The XML can be used later. For example, parse the XML while offline with no connection to SAP. **Note:** To update the table catalog information, first remove the attachment displayed on the ERP Systems page. Then, run the retrieval process again to refresh the list.

</td><td>

Yes

</td><td>

admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_erp\_integration.odata\_max\_record\_fetch\_limit

</td><td>

integer

</td><td>

Limits the number of records fetched for GET calls by adding the $top parameter to the OData calls. This reduces the number of records read from the OData endpoint.

</td><td>

No

</td><td>

admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_erp\_integration.odata\_service\_path

</td><td>

string

</td><td>

After the hostname and port, this path is used to connect with any SAP OData service. Add a URL in **Value** to specify the OData service. The default is: /sap/opu/odata/sap.

</td><td>

Yes

</td><td>

admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_erp\_integration.response\_timeout

</td><td>

integer

</td><td>

Specifies the timeout value for OData response. If OData calls time out frequently, increase the timeout value. Specify the value in seconds. The default is 100 seconds. This value is used for responses both from external web and from a MID Server.

</td><td>

No

</td><td>

admin or sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_erp\_integration.use\_cookies

</td><td>

true \| false

</td><td>

Specifies whether to use cookies for an OData connection.

</td><td>

No

</td><td>

admin or sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_erp\_integration.use\_csrf\_token

</td><td>

true \| false

</td><td>

Indicates whether a CSRF token is sent for OData calls in Zero Copy Connector for ERP operations.

</td><td>

No

</td><td>

admin or sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:** To add a property manually, verify that your scope is set to Zero Copy Connector for ERP, then navigate to sys\_properties.list and select **New**.

## Heartbeat information

For an ERP system, there are separate heartbeat indicators for RFC and HTTP. When a system is established, the heartbeats are set to active and the status is updated, including any errors. If the heartbeat calls are successful, BAPI and OData retrieval is triggered in parallel and the status appears on the system record.
