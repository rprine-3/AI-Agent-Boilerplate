# Create an OData connection in Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Create an OData v2 connection to link to SAP so data can be extracted for use in remote tables and extraction tables in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

For information about OData connections in Zero Copy Connector for ERP, see [Connecting Zero Copy Connector for ERP to SAP using OData](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-use-odata-and-http-connection.md) and [OData capabilities supported by Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-data-hub-odata-query-capabilities.md).

## About this task

An admin or a user with the sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin role must enable the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property for you to edit, customize, and clone ERP models and tables.

-   The property must be enabled on the correct scope.
-   After enabling the property, Zero Copy Connector for ERP retrieves all tables and BAPIs \(Business Application Programming Interface\) to use when managing models.
-   The property must be configured for either a non-production or production state. \(Enabling the property on a production instance can create metadata records when new models and fields are added in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.\)
-   System properties are maintained in the System Property table \[sys\_properties\], which you can access by entering `sys_properties.list` directly in the Navigator Filter.

## Procedure

1.  Confirm that you have an SAP system that has been enabled to make an OData connection.

2.  Create a connection and credential alias.

    For credentials, you can use Basic Auth, OAuth, or API Key.

    For more information, see:

    -   [Basic authentication credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_BasicAuthCredentialsForm.md)
    -   [OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/oauth-2-credentials.md)
    -   [API key credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/API-key-credential-form.md)
    -   [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connection-alias.md)
3.  Create a connection and associate it with the new alias.

4.  Create a system with the connection.

    For more information, see [Create an ERP system in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/create-an-erp-system.md).

5.  On the system record, confirm that the heartbeats are successful and the retrieval status is complete.

    If any have failed, select **Restart data retrieval**. Any data retrieval that failed \(BAPI, OData, or tables\) is fetched again.

6.  Create a model and, after saving, open the model record.

    For more information, see [Create a model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erpc-add-new-data-model.md).

7.  Select **Manage model**.

8.  Select **Add model operation**.

    1.  Choose a **Select type**.

    2.  Select **Save and Continue**.

9.  Select the new operation.

10. Select **Select entity**.

    1.  In **Select type**, choose **OData**.

    2.  In **Select service**, search for and select a service, for example **API\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER \(Remote API for business partner\)** in the OData service catalog.

        When you specify the service, a call is made to the SAP service to read its metadata. The default service is /sap/opu/odata/iwfnd/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/ServiceCollection. If you must change the service, create a property named sn\_erp\_integration.odata\_service\_path and set the value.

        If you can't find the service you need, see [Add a service manually in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-add-a-service-manually.md).

    3.  In **Select the endpoints**, search for and select an endpoint, for example **A\_BusinessPartnerType**.

        \[Omitted image "erp-create-odata-conn1.png"\] Alt text: Add entity modal with OData service and endpoint specified.

    4.  Select **Add entity**.

        The flow named **GET SAP BAPIs and tables when system becomes active** runs to retrieve the data. The BAPI, table, and catalog tables are populated.

11. Select **Specify inputs** to check the information and edit as needed.

    For more information, see [Manage input parameters for a model operation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erpc-manage-model-inputs.md).

12. Select **Choose output** to check the information and edit as needed.

    For more information, see [Choose output parameters for a model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-manage-outputs.md).

13. Open the ERP systems list by selecting the systems icon \[Omitted image "erp-systems-icon-sidebar.png"\] Alt text: in the side panel.

14. Select the system.

15. Check the heartbeat and retrieval status until they're successful.

    \[Omitted image "erp-create-odata-conn2.png"\] Alt text: ERP system record with HTTP heartbeat status and OData retrieval status highlighted.

16. Create a model.

    1.  Open the ERP models page by selecting the models icon \[Omitted image "erpc-data-model-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the side panel.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  Add an **ERP model name**, **ERP module**, and **ERP system**, and select **Save**.

    4.  Select the new model in the list.

    5.  Select **Manage model**.

    6.  Select **Add model operation**.

    7.  Select a **Select type**.

    8.  Select **Save and Continue**.

17. Select the new operation.

18. Select **Select entity**.

    1.  In **Select type**, select **OData**.

    2.  In **Select service**, specify a service, for example **API\_BUSINESS\_PARTNER \(Remote API for Business Partner\) OData service catalog**.

    3.  In **Select the endpoints**, search for and select an endpoint, for example **A\_BusinessPartnerType Entity Name: Business Partner --- Return Type: Business Partner**.

    4.  Select **Add entity** and wait for retrieval to complete.

        \[Omitted image "erp-create-odata-conn3.png"\] Alt text: Add entity form with type, service, and endpoint specified.

19. Select **Specify inputs** to check the information and edit as needed.

    1.  If there are required fields, select **Select mandatory fields**.

    2.  Select any mandatory inputs listed and select **OK**.

    3.  Select **Save**.

20. Select **Choose output**.

    1.  Select **+ New output**.

    2.  Select fields, for example **BusinessPartnerName** and **Full Name**.

    3.  Select **Save**.

21. Test with Workflow Studio.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

    2.  On the home page, select **Actions**.

    3.  In the **Name** column, filter for **contains Value** and type `Use ERP`.

    4.  Select **Apply**.

    5.  Select **Use ERP data**.

    6.  Select **Test**.

    7.  Specify the **ModelName**, **ModelOperation**, **Mandatory fields** \(provide a value for the mandatory field if necessary\), select a **System**, and select **Run Test**.

    8.  When complete, select the link **Your test has finished running. View the Action execution details**.

    9.  View and check the output, for example, in **Output Data**, select the **Response** to view the output.
