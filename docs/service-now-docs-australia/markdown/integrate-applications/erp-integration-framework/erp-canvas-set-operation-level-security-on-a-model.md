# Operation-level security for models

Control access to model operations with user roles and groups.

## Model operation security

You must have the sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin role to create and edit models.

In Zero Copy Connector for ERP, new permission rules for model operations require you to have a specified role or be part of a specified user group to execute model operations. Each model operation must have at least one user role or one user group specified. You can add multiple user roles and groups as needed.

On a single model, different operations can have different permissions. For example, a financial data model can have some users with only read access to review data, but they can't update or create a financial record. For that same model, you can give other users or groups access to update and create financial records.

## Security of existing operations

To help prevent disruptions, all existing model operations have been assigned the admin role and the erp\_user role by default.

You can edit these permissions on the existing operations at any time to suit your needs. To change the permissions, select the edit \(pencil\) icon \[Omitted image "pencil-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: on the model operation card.

To clone a model, you must have permissions to access the model operations.
