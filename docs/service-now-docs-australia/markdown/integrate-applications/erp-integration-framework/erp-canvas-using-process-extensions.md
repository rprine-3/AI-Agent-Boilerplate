# Using Zero Copy Connector for ERP process extensions

Learn how to use the process extensions \(subflows\) in Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) content packs. Content pack models and process extensions are examples.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin

Follow these steps to copy a process extension \(subflow\) and edit the copy to use the correct cloned model or models. Use the cloned version of the models or models inside your copy of the subflow.

**Note:** You must have a cloned model created within its own application scope. For more information, see [Using Zero Copy Connector for ERP content packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/erp-integration-framework/erp-canvas-using-content-packs.md).
