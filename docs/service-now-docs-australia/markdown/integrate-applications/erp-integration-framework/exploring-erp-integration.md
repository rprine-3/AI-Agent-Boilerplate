# Exploring Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Zero Copy Connector for ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) enables you to connect to an ERP system to read, update, create, and extract data for use on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Zero Copy Connector for ERP overview

Zero Copy Connector for ERP helps you identify custom Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\) apps and fields in an ERP system \(such as SAP\) to access their data on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

Zero Copy Connector for ERP supports the following ERP systems:

-   SAP ECC
-   SAP S/4HANA
-   SAP S/4HANA Cloud
-   SuccessFactors
-   Workday
-   Oracle E-Business Suite \(EBS\)

Zero Copy Connector for ERP offers a unified data model for ERP systems. Zero Copy Connector for ERP enables you to manage tables that contain both standard and custom fields grouped within ERP models. You can send updates to and extract data from tables on the ERP system. Store extracted data in a remote table or an extraction table, depending on the size of datasets and refresh needs.

-   Remote tables get their records from running an associated script against an external data source.
-   Extraction tables retrieve large amounts of data using a scheduled query, and use transform tables to process data for use on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

**Note:** Zero Copy Connector for ERP doesn't replicate data into the ServiceNow AI Platform. It mirrors data that lives in the ERP system, and remains protected there.

## Benefits of Zero Copy Connector for ERP

The unified data model of the ServiceNow AI Platform helps integrate ERP data into the ServiceNow AI Platform. Zero Copy Connector for ERP streamlines ERP data management, making it accessible and actionable within the ServiceNow AI Platform and ServiceNow instances. Configure extraction tables to pull custom or delta data from the ERP system regularly.
