# Re-evaluate license distribution by executing RPA scripts

Run the Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\) script on demand to validate and unlock the robots in a domain and its child domains.

## Before you begin

Familiarise with license distribution in RPA Hub concepts. For more information, see [Robot license distribution in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/license-rpa-hub.md).

To unlock the robots in a domain, ensure that the license entitlement and consumption is compliant.

A schedule script runs every 12 hours to evaluate the utilized robots.

You must do this task in the classic environment.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin
