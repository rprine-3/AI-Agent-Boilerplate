# Work items in RPA Hub

A work item is a record in a work queue that stores the data a robot needs to perform a specific task.

Each item in the queue is processed separately, allowing robots to handle large workloads in smaller, manageable parts.

-   **Key benefits**
    -   Scalability: Distributes workload across multiple robots.

    -   Resilience: Failed items can be retried without restarting the whole process.

    -   Visibility: Tracks progress and outcomes for each unit of work.

    -   Flexibility: Enables parallel processing of large data sets.
