# Methods and events of the CheckBox element

The CheckBox element in RPA Desktop Design Studio enables you to capture true or false, yes or no, or on or off inputs from users. It helps in decision-making, enabling or disabling features, and controlling workflow execution.

The methods and events of the CheckBox element are displayed in the Object Explorer pane. You can use this element to present yes or no or true or false selections.

## Use cases

-   User preferences selection - Allows users to enable/disable specific options, such as "Run in background" or "Send email notification".
-   Conditional execution - Based on whether the checkbox is checked, the automation can execute or skip certain steps.
-   Multi-selection options - You can also use the check box element in groups to display multiple choices in a form. When multiple checkboxes are available, users can select multiple options. For example, selecting multiple file formats for export.
-   Validation and confirmation - Ensures that a user has acknowledged terms, agreements, or completed a required step before proceeding.
