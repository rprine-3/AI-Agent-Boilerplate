# Use the Protect component

Encrypt a string with the DPAPI algorithm from the Microsoft by using the Protect component in RPA Desktop Design Studio. The component returns the encrypted form of the data you provide.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

You can configure the properties for the Protect component. For more information about these properties, see [Properties of the DPAPI components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/properties-of-dpapi-components.md)

## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Security** &gt; **DPAPI**.

2.  Drag the Protect component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Connect the data and control ports of the Protect component to the corresponding ports of the other components as described in the following table.

<table id="table_jnw_jn1_krb"><thead><tr><th>

Port type

</th><th>

Purpose of connection

</th><th>

Mandatory?

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Data In \(ClearText\)

</td><td>

Passes the string that you want to encrypt from a previously executed component.

</td><td>

Yes

</td></tr><tr><td>

Data In \(Optional Entropy\)

</td><td>

The optional entropy provides additional security to the encrypted data from risks that make applications running under the same user vulnerable. Passes the entropy from a previously executed component.

</td><td>

No. Connecting the port is optional.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Data In \(Scope\)

</td><td>

Passes the scope of protection from a previously executed component.

</td><td>

Yes

</td></tr><tr><td>

Data Out \(String\)

</td><td>

Returns the encrypted string.

</td><td>

No. Connecting the port is optional.To view the output, right-click the **Return** field and click **Preview Data**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Control In

</td><td>

Passes the control from a from a previously executed component.

</td><td>

Yes

</td></tr><tr><td>

Control Out

</td><td>

Passes the control to the next component.

</td><td>

No

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  To test the component, under the **DESIGN** tab, click **Run**.
