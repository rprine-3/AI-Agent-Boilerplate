# Create an insight trigger

Create an active insight trigger so that you can run the related insight rule.

## Before you begin

This task must be performed in the classic environment.

Create an insight rule. For more information, see [Create an insight rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/automation-center/create-insight-rule.md).

Role required: sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user or sn\_ac.automation\_admin

## About this task

When an insight rule is processed, it generates an insight. Insights appear on the Insights widget in the Executions dashboard of Automation Center Workspace.

An insight trigger activates the associated insight rule to run.

An insight rule doesn’t run unless it’s mapped to an insight trigger.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Automation Center** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Insight Rules**.

2.  Open the insight rule for which you want to create and associate an insight trigger to.

3.  On the **Automation Insight Triggers** tab, select **New**.

4.  If the **New** button is unavailable, ensure that the Application scope you are in is same as the one where the record is.

    A message is displayed if the **New** button is unavailable. Follow the message to change the Application scope.

5.  Select the appropriate type of insight trigger that you want to create:
