# Automation Center Executions dashboard

The Automation Center Executions dashboard helps you manage the health of automations in one central place. You can also​ import automation metrics and data from third-party providers regardless of the technology used.

Executions refer to the times each automation runs.

You can access the Executions dashboard in either of two ways:

-   By navigating to **All** &gt; **Automation Center** &gt; **Automation Center Home** and then selecting the **Executions** tab.
-   By navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Automation Center Workspace** &gt; **Executions**.

## Executions dashboard details

The Executions dashboard provides the details about the automation executions in the form of charts and tables. These charts give an overview of the entire execution process.

You can filter all data that is displayed on this page using the four filters available:

-   Department
-   Automation
-   Source
-   Application

If you don’t specify any filter, then all available data is displayed.

**Note:** To view the Automation incidents, Automation changes, and Business application changes widgets, in addition to the Automation Center roles you need to have the itil or sn\_incident\_read and sn\_change\_read roles.
