# Manage automation requests

Manage all automation requests from one location from the Request Board in the Automation Center Kanban board.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user or sn\_ac.automation\_admin

**Note:** Kanban board does not display any automation request from demo data. If you want to view the demo data in Kanban board, then you must run the fix script. For more information, see [Run fix script to view demo data on Kanban board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/automation-center/run-fix-scripts.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Automation Center Workspace**.

    The Automation Center dashboard is displayed.

2.  Select the Kanban board icon \[Omitted image "icon-kanban.png"\] Alt text: kanban board icon.

    The Kanban board is displayed with the Request Board in view. You can view all the available automation requests with their states.

    **Note:** A maximum of 200 automation requests are available on the Request Board. This value can be changed only by someone with the sn\_ac.automation\_admin or sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user role.

    Also, anyone with the sn\_ac.automation\_admin or sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user role can reorder different states \(columns\) on the Request Board to set the lifecycle or process flow direction according to their requirement by editing the vtb\_board table.

3.  You can do multiple actions on the Request Board.

    -   Filter the automation requests to match your need.

        Filter the automation requests based on the following:

        -   **Date**: Select any date range to view automation requests created during that period.
        -   **Request type**: Select the type of request you want to view. You can choose to view automation requests, action requests, or review requests.
        -   **Priority**: Select one or more priority values to view automation requests with those priority value.
        -   **Department**: Select one or more departments to view automation requests that belong to the selected departments.
    -   Sort the automation requests for ease of use.

        \[Omitted image "kanban-sort.png"\] Alt text: Request board sort

        Select **Name**, **Priority**, or **Score** from the **Sort by** field.

        Select **Ascending** or **Descending** from the **Sort Direction** field.

        The automation requests are sorted based on the selected sorting options.

    -   Change the state of an automation request.

        To move an automation request from one state to another, drag the card to the required state column.

        When you don’t follow the happy path, error messages are displayed and you're guided to fix the issue.

        If a sorting is applied, the automation request card is placed according to the sorting. If no sorting is applied, the automation request card is placed based on the creation date.

    -   Create a task from the automation request card.

        1.  Select the task icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-task.png"\] Alt text: Task icon\) from the automation task card.

            The Task Board for the automation request is displayed.

        2.  Select the **Add Task** icon.

            The **Create New Automation Task** form is displayed. For more information, see [Automation task form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/automation-center/automation-task-form.md).

            Verify that the associated automation request is either in the **Planned** or **In Progress** state.

    -   View if an automation request has a task assigned to it. If yes, then how many tasks have been completed.
    -   View if an automation request has automations associated with it.
    -   View details of the automation request and create tasks.
        1.  Double-click a request that is in **Planned** state or any state after that.

            The contextual panel opens to the right of the screen.

        2.  View any details or comments in the **Details** and **Comments** tab of the contextual panel.
        3.  In the **Tasks** tab, select the **Add Task** button.

            The **Create New Automation Task** form is displayed. Provide the details. For more information, see [Automation task form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/automation-center/automation-task-form.md).
