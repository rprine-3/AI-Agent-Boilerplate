# Write a script for an automation message variable

Write JavaScript code input for variables that are added in the message of an insight rule.

## Before you begin

This task must be performed in the classic environment.

Create an insight rule. For more information, see [Create an insight rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/automation-center/create-insight-rule.md).

Role required: sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user or sn\_ac.automation\_admin

## About this task

When an insight rule is processed, it generates an insight. Insights appear on the Insights widget in the Executions dashboard of Automation Center Workspace.

An insight trigger activates the associated insight rule to run.

An insight rule doesn’t run unless it’s mapped to an insight trigger.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Automation Center** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Insight Rules**.

2.  Open an insight rule that you want to write JavaScript code for the associated message variable.

3.  On the **Automation Message Variables** tab, select a variable.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
