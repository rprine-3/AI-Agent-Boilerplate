# Create a checklist

Create a checklist to track the items for an automation request. A checklist is a list of tasks that you must track before publishing an automation request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ac.automation\_admin

**Note:** The option to create a checklist is available only when the automation request is in the In progress state. For information about moving an automation request to the In progress state, see [Move an automation request to the In progress state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/automation-center/move-automationrequest-to-inprogress.md).

After the automation request is moved to the following states, the option to create a checklist isn’t available:

-   Defer
-   Publish
-   Reject

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Automation Center Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(\[Omitted image "autocenter-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\).
