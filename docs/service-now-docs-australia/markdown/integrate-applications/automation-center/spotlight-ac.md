# Working with ServiceNow Spotlight feature

Use the ServiceNow Spotlight feature to auto-calculate automation request scores. Scores define the execution priority of the automation request. The higher the score, the higher the priority of the automation request.

ServiceNow Spotlight calculates scores when an automation request is created or updated. It's calculated only when the automation request is in the **New** or **Deferred** state.

If there’s any special need to have a different score than the auto-computed score, you can manually update the **Score** field. When you do that:

-   The flag **Score manually altered** is turned on.
-   The Spotlight score is computed and calculated in the **Score auto calculated** field.

You can switch over to using computed score by emptying the **Score** field or setting it to 0. After you save the request record, the system will populate the Spotlight score \(if any\) in the **Score** field.
