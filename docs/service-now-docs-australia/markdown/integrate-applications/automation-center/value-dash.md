# Automation Center Value dashboard

The Automation Center Value dashboard provides summary information about the states of goals and automations along with the actual and estimated cost and time saved for all active and future automations.

All widgets under the following sections are available only if the you have the sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user role:

-   Goals chart
-   Number of deployed automations under Active automations
-   Future automations

To access all other widgets in the Active automations section, you must associate a domain configuration with a data collection job. For more information see [https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/zurich-now-intelligence/page/use/performance-analytics/task/associate-domain-config-dc-job.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/associate-domain-config-dc-job.md).

You can access the Value dashboard in either of two ways:

-   By navigating to **All** &gt; **Automation Center** &gt; **Automation Center Home** and then selecting the **Value** tab.
-   By navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Automation Center Workspace** &gt; **Value**.

## Goals chart

The Goals chart displays the summary of automation goals categorized by their state along with the estimated cost saved per year.

For information about automation goals, see [Create an automation goal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/automation-center/create-automation-goal.md).

By default, the Goals chart provides details of all automation goals with associated active automation requests for the day you’re viewing the data.

Use the **Target date** drop-down list to view goals for a specific period. When you select the **Target date** filter, you can view the calendar of the current and the next month. Date filters are available for Custom range, Last 12 months, Last 6 months, and so on.
