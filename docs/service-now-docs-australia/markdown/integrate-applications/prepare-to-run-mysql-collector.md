# Prepare to run the MySQL collector

Create a MySQL user and grant permissions before running the collector.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Configure a MySQL user with the minimum required permissions for metadata harvesting.

## Procedure

1.  Create a user.

    ```
    CREATE USER 'catalog_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
    ```

    Replace `<password>` with a secure password.

2.  Grant permissions to the user.

    ```
    GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW, EXECUTE ON *.* TO 'catalog_user'@'%';
    ```

    This grants the following permissions:

    -   SELECT: Read access to tables and views
    -   SHOW VIEW: View definition access
    -   EXECUTE: Stored procedure and function access
