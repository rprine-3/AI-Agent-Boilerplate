## Procedure

1.  In the Toolbox pane, navigate to **Utilities** &gt; **Reflection**.

2.  Drag the GetProperty component to the Design surface.

3.  To configure the input fields, see [Configure port properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/configure-input-port-properties.md).

4.  Click the add icon \(\[Omitted image "add-image-icon.png"\] Alt text: Add icon.\) on the GetProperty component title bar to add the additional parameters.

5.  Connect the data and control ports of the GetProperty component to the corresponding ports of the other components.

    |Port type|Purpose of connection|Mandatory?|
