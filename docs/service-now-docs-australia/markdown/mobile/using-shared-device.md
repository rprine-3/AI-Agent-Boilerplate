# Using a shared device with multiple users

Use a single device between multiple users to have a secure and personalized experience, where each user accesses their account through a unique PIN.

**Note:**

-   This feature must be enabled by your administrator. To check if it is available to you, go to **Settings** and look for Device sharing in the menu.
-   For the admin configuration topics of this feature, see [Enable multiple users to work on a shared device](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/multi-user-single-instance.md).

## Shared device flow

This table shows the end-to-end flow of the shared device feature, covering both the initial setup experience and subsequent use by returning users.

You may see the following message if the mobile app is linked to more than one ServiceNow account. Since the shared device mode only works only with a single account on a device, you must remove the additional accounts from the app.

 To remove additional accounts:

1.  Click **OK** on the message.
2.  Select **Settings** to go back to the Settings page.
3.  Select **Accounts**.
4.  If the account you want to remove is logged in, swipe on the account and select **Log out**.
5.  For accounts you want to remove, do the following:
    1.  Swipe on the account name, select **Edit** and then **Remove from list**.
    2.  Select **Remove** in the confirmation message.

**Note:** Repeat steps \(a\) and \(b\) for each account you do not need for the shared mode.

    3.  Close the Accounts page.
6.  Return to the Settings page, select **Device sharing** from the menu and select **Activate shared device** mode.
