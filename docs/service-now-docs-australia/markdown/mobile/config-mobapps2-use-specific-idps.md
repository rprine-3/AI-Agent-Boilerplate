# Configure mobile apps to use specific identity providers

You can configure a login experience that is specific to a mobile app and different from the web login experience. For example, Now® Mobile app users can be automatically redirected to an identity provider \(IdP\) that is different from the IdP that is defined for the web session.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Admins can define the login experience for mobile users by associating app-specific login pages for mobile apps. For example, admins can enforce the following authentication scenarios:

-   When an instance is enabled with single sign-on \(SSO\), admins can configure mobile users to be redirected to a specific IdP login screen on their mobile app. This login screen can be different from the automatically redirected IdP that is defined for the instance.
-   Configure the mobile app to display the ServiceNow® SSO login page where users can provide their credentials to initiate the SSO login flow.
-   Configure the mobile app to display a custom login page with buttons that redirect users to different IdPs based on their role or persona.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Application Registry**.

2.  Select an application of **OAuth Client** type to open it.

    For example, select **ServiceNow Agent**, which is an OAuth Client.

3.  In the **Login URL** field of the Application Registries page, enter the login URL you want to use for this mobile app.

    For example, enter:

    -   `oauth_login.do`

        This login URL causes the local login screen to appear.

    -   `login_with_sso.do?glide_sso_id=<*valid active IdP sys\_id*>`

        This login URL redirects the user to an external IdP that is specified with the IdP sys\_id in the **glide\_sso\_id** parameter.

    -   `login_locate_sso.do`

        This login URL displays the ServiceNow SSO login screen where users can enter their email or user ID.

        \[Omitted image "mob-auth-servicenow-sso-login.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow SSO login page on a mobile app screen.

    You can also enter the login URL for a custom login page.

    **Important:**

    If you enter **login\_with\_sso.do** for the Login URL, you must also provide a valid IdP sys\_id as a **glide\_sso\_id** parameter to the URL. For example:

    `login_with_sso.do?glide_sso_id=bc47c42887101010d00b5773e8cb0b85`

    To get the valid IdP sys\_id:

    1.  In your instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Identity Providers**
    2.  In the Identity Providers page, select the IdP provider.
    3.  On the IdP provider page, right-click the page banner, and select **Copy sys\_id**.

        \[Omitted image "mob-auth-redirect-copy-idp-sysid.png"\] Alt text: Right-click menu showing the option to copy the IdP's sys\_id.

    If a valid IdP sys\_id isn’t provided, the OAuth client login URL value can't be saved.

    For information about configuring an external IdP on your instance, see [Create an external identity provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_CreateUpdateIdentityProvider.md).

4.  Select **Update** to save the entry.


## Result

Open the mobile app on a mobile device and select the instance. You should be redirected to the login page that was set up on the instance in the Application Registry.

**Note:** If **login\_locate\_sso.do** was saved as the Login URL and no default IdP is configured or the **sso\_source** for the user isn’t set, then an error displays when the user name is entered. This behavior is similar to web UI behavior.
