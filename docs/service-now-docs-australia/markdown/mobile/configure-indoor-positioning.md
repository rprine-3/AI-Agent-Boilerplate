# Configure indoor positioning

Indoor positioning enables end users to see their live location on an Indoor Wayfinding map and get guided navigation to their desired destination.

## Before you begin

Before you can configure indoor positioning, you must have completed the following configurations:

-   Configure Indoor Wayfinding. For more information, see [Indoor Wayfinding configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/indoor-wayfinding-config.md).
-   Set up at least one custom map provider in the Custom Map Provider \[sys\_sg\_custom\_map\_provider\] table. For more information, see [Configure a custom map provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/configure-custom-map-provider.md)

Role required: admin

## About this task

Consider the following requirements that are related to this task.

-   If all buildings use the same location provider, only one custom map provider record is needed.
-   If different location providers are needed for each building, create a custom map provider record for each building and select the building as the key. Then assign location providers to your mobile devices.

For information about the features this configuration enables for end users, see [Indoor positioning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/indoor-positioning-end-user.md).
