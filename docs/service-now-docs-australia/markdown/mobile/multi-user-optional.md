## About this task

There are three optional settings that can be used when working with the multi-user configuration on a shared device.

-   Set the maximum number of users on a shared device. The default is 15 users the maximum is 30 users.

    **Note:** If the maximum number of users has been reached and an additional user tries to add themselves, they are given the option to remove the user who has been inactive on the device the longest.

-   Enable the **EnablePushNotificationinSharedDeviceMode** property. By default, push notifications in a shared device are not enabled. Only use this property and set to true if you want to display push notifications to the active user.

    **Note:** Enabling push notifications on a shared device shows full message content in notifications and banners, risking exposure of other users' sensitive information. For this reason, push notifications are turned off by default.

-   Set the maximum idle time before users are prompted to re-enter their PIN. The default is 300 seconds. This feature is described in the topic [PIN timeout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/pin-timeout.md).
