# Request a new branded iOS app for public distribution

Request, test, and publish a custom iOS app that has your unique company identity. Then make the app available for public distribution on the Apple store.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Mobile Publishing enables you to request a new branded iOS app that can be distributed on the public Apple Store. After you complete the request form, your ServiceNow® instance builds the app and provides a link from where you can download an XCode archive file \(`.xcarchive`\). Then you download the XCode archive file, update it, and re-sign it to generate an iOS application archive file \(`.ipa`\). After the `.ipa` file is generated, you upload it to Apple Connect for testing. When testing is completed, you approve the build and can deploy your branded app with the public Apple Store.

**Note:** Publicly distributed iOS app builds take one week from submission to be ready for testing. ServiceNow can't expedite this time line because it's determined by Apple.

Images that do not follow the guidelines listed below might appear cut off in your branded app, as shown in this example.

</table>8.  Select **Next**.

9.  If you selected **iOS and Android** in the **Operating System** field on the **Add basic info** form in Step 3 above, see Step 8 in [Request a new branded Android app for public distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/request-public-branded-android-app.md) for information about filling out the **Set up for Android** form.

    After you complete the optional Android configuration, return to Step 10 in this topic to complete your request for a public branded iOS app.

10. In the Review and submit form, review the selections you made in Steps 1-9.

11. If all the selections are what you want, select **Submit** to submit your branded app request.


## Result

After you complete the request form, and submit it, your ServiceNow instance builds the app.

To view the status of the build:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Mobile Branding** &gt; **Manage Mobile Publishing Apps.**
2.  In **Your recent app requests** section, select the card for your branded app request to view its status on the **Request details** page.

When the app is ready for testing, you receive an email notification about the status of the build and also includes a link from where you can download an XCode archive file \(`.xcarchive`\).

**Note:**

-   You can only submit one build at a time. You can't submit another build until the current build is canceled, failed, or completed.
-   It usually takes about 1 week to build the iOS app for public distribution. If you are on a tight timeline, submit your publicly distributed Android first so that you can test it while you submit and wait for the iOS app build to complete. ServiceNow can't expedite this timeline because it's determined by Apple.

## What to do next

**Note:** For public branded iOS apps that are managed by Microsoft Intune, you must register the app in your Microsoft tenant after the build is created, but before the app is distributed. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra ID App Registration Mandate for iOS Intune Mobile App - Mobile Publishing \(KB1640759\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1640759). \(You must have an account and log in to view this ServiceNow KB.\)

After the build successfully completes and your app is ready for testing, see [Test and publish a new branded iOS app for public distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/testpubnu-iosapp-pubdist.md).
