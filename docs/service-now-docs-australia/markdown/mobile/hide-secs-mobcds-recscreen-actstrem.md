# Hide seconds in date/time fields on mobile cards, record screen details pages, or activity streams

Set the **mobileCardsShowSeconds**, **recordScreenDetailsShowSeconds**, or the **activityStreamShowSeconds** mobile properties to `False` to hide the display of seconds in date/time fields.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following mobile properties are set to `True` by default for the date/time fields in mobile cards, record screen details pages, and activity streams:

-   **mobileCardsShowSeconds**
-   **recordScreenDetailsShowSeconds**
-   **activityStreamShowSeconds**

When these properties are set to `True`, seconds display in the date/time fields. To hide the display of seconds in date/time fields for mobile cards, record screen details pages, and activity streams, set these properties to `False` on your ServiceNow® instance.

These mobile properties are available in ServiceNow mobile app versions 18.2 and later. For more information about ServiceNow mobile app versions, see [Mobile app version history for iOS and Android](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/mobile-release-notes/mobile-apps.html).
