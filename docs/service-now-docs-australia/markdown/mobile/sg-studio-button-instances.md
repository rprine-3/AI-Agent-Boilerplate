# Associate a function with a location in the app

For each function you create for an app, you must associate it with a specific location. You can associate most functions with a top menu, a swipe, or a specific field.

## Launcher screen header functions

<table id="table_sgr_glt_1nb"><tbody><tr><td>

Launcher screen header functions allow your users to navigate to a specific parametrized record screen. Some common examples include navigating to a users profile, or navigating to a cart.

 For details on creating parametrized record screens, see [Configure a parameterized record screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/configure-param-form-applet.md).

 For details on how to use these record screens in a launcher screen header, see [Configure a launcher screen header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/create-alp-header.md).

</table>## Chart header functions

<table id="table_kxn_4jt_1nb"><tbody><tr><td>

Chart header functions enable your users to navigate to a specific set of records from a chart screen. When a user is viewing a chart, they can click on the chart header function \(\[Omitted image "chart-function-icon.png"\] Alt text: chart function icon\) on the top-right corner of the screen, to view a list of all the records that are within the chart. .

</table>## Field functions

<table id="table_n1w_ptw_wlb"><tbody><tr><td>

Field functions enable your end users to change the value of a field. Field functions only apply to items on the details screen in a displayed area.

 1.  In Mobile App Builder, open a details screen that you want to add a field function to. Make sure that there are screen fields in your details screen that you can add field functions to, and a Table selected.
2.  For each screen field on your details screen, you can add a field function under **Field function instances** field. You can't reuse previous function instance records.
3.  In the **Display label** field of the new Function instance record, add the name of the function to display.
4.  Select **Save**.

 For more information on how to create field functions, see [Configure a details screen for a record screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/configure-form-details-screen.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Footer functions

<table id="table_vgx_qtw_wlb"><tbody><tr><td>

Footer functions enable your end users to add an action on the bottom of a record screen.

 Supported screens for the footer function are: record details screen, record embedded section screen, dynamic segments in a record screen, map screen, and list screens.

 1.  In Mobile App Builder open a screen that you want to add a footer function to.
2.  In the Footer function instance section, select **New** to create a function instance. You cannot reuse previous function instance records.
3.  In the **Display label** field of the new Function instance record, add the name of the function to display.

<table id="table_cx1_g3t_1nb"><tbody><tr><td>

On tap functions are configured on list item config records, which are used in any screen that needs to display a list of records. 1.  In Mobile App Builder open a list screen that you want to add an on tap function.
2.  Select the List item config record field. For example, this field is found in a stream record within a screen segment record.
3.  In the list item config record, locate the **On tap** field and select **Use a function instance**.

    -   Select T**railing swipe function instances** for users to initiate swipe functions dragging to the right from the edge of a card.
