# Enable external users to access attachments

Enable users who have been assigned the snc\_external role to be able to view, upload, and download attachments on their ServiceNow mobile app.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When you assign the snc\_external role to users who are external to your organization, they can't access resources with their ServiceNow mobile app unless explicitly enabled. For more information about the snc\_external role, see [Explicit Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/explicit-roles.md).

You can use the mobile property **allow\_snc\_external\_attachment\_access** to remove restrictions on attachments for users assigned the snc\_external role. When the **allow\_snc\_external\_attachment\_access** mobile property is set `true`, external users can use the mobile offline mode and access attachments from the following components and locations:

-   [Activity streams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_activity-streams.md)
-   [Legacy parameter screen \(UI parameters\), Quebec and earlier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-input-screen.md)
-   [Input form screen \(sys\_sg\_parameter\_screen table\), Rome and later](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-input-screen.md)
-   [Details screen using the Attachment list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-attachments.md)
-   [Offline mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-offline-mode.md)

The **allow\_snc\_external\_attachment\_access** mobile property is turned off by default and external users can't access attachments.

Mobile properties are configured as records in the sys\_sg\_properties table on the ServiceNow Mobile Platform server. The ServiceNow instance sends the mobile property to mobile apps after authentication. Then the property turns on or turns off a feature on the mobile app.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_sg\_properties.list**.

    The Mobile Properties list appears.

2.  In the Mobile Properties list, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td><td>

Name of the mobile property record. Enter `allow_snc_external_attachment_access` to make this feature configurable. The **allow\_snc\_external\_attachment\_access** property is turned off by default and you must create it on your instance to configure it. It isn't visible on the instance until you create it.**Note:** The record name is case-sensitive and must be entered as `allow_snc_external_attachment_access`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application scope where the mobile property is applied. To select a different application scope, select the globe icon \(\[Omitted image "globe-icon.png"\] Alt text: Globe UI icon.\) on the instance banner. Then select **Application scope: _application\_scope_**. For information about how mobile properties are affected by application scope, see [Mobile properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-properties.md).

 Mobile properties with this checkbox enabled are excluded from the **/user\_client** API response.

Mobile App Config

</td><td>

Mobile app configuration for which you want to use the mobile property. This setting limits the mobile property behavior to users who have access to this mobile app configuration.
