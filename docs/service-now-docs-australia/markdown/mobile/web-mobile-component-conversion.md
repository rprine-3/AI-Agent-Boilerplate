# Web to mobile component conversion

Use guided UI to configure native mobile components using an existing web component as a starting reference.

Web to mobile streamlines the component creation process by enabling you to select an existing web component to serve as a template instead of creating a record screen from scratch. Currently, web conversion only supports generating a record screen with a details screen segment.

## Selecting a Card

Choose what card will serve as the template for your mobile record screen. You can choose from three different options and preview how each will look before confirming your selection.

-   **Use an existing card**

    Select an existing card to use for your record. You can preview the card and make changes before confirming your selection.

-   **Use a generic card**

    Start with a basic card template that has the essential components to get you started. You can preview the card and make changes before confirming your selection.

-   **Use ServiceNow Otto®**

    Use AI-powered ServiceNow Otto to create a card for your record screen. Otto will use semantic search to populate the card with the fields that best match your web component. You can preview the generated card and make changes before confirming your selection. If you want to see more options, you can ask Otto to regenerate the card with different fields.


Records created using Otto will have a sparkle icon \(\[Omitted image "na-sparkle.png"\] Alt text:\)next to their name to indicate they were generated using AI. Once the records have been edited and reviewed, the indicator will disappear.

## Previewing your generated record

\[Omitted image "web-mobile-preview.png"\] Alt text: Visual preview of your new mobile component.

The web to mobile selection page presents a list of all available tables and web forms that can be used as templates. When selecting a web component to serve as the template, a preview of the new record is generated.

You can freely switch between the existing card, generic card, and Otto generated card previews to compare them and see which option looks best. Selecting **Looks good, continue** will generate the relevant records using the selected card.
