# Create appearance templates for cards for a mobile campaign

Create item card templates that contain information about the appearance of each type of card displayed in a mobile campaign.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When creating cards, you need to assign an item view. Item views provide information about a card's appearance. Therefore, for each card style you want to use, you need a create a separate item view even if the card type is the same. For example, if you want some image cards to have light text on a dark background and other image cards to have dark text on a light background, you would need to create a separate item view for each of those styles.

## Procedure

1.  In the web-based UI, enter `sys_sg_item_view.list` in the filter navigator to open a list of item views.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_psj_wlf_mmb"><thead><tr><th>
