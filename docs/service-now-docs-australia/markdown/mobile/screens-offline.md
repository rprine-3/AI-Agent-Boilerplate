# Supported screens for offline mode

Consider which screen types to use in offline mode.

## Consider which screen types to use in offline mode

Screens are the building blocks of your mobile experience. Each screen defines what information is shown, what actions are available, and how users navigate between tasks. Screen types are designed for different kinds of action.

|Screen type|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|List screen|Browse through a list of records, such as incidents, work orders, or approvals. Tap any record to open its details.|
|Record screen|Shows the details of a single record, like a specific work order or task. Read information, view related tasks, add attachments, or post comments from this screen.|
|Input form screen|Fill in information, answer questions, or submit data through input fields, checkboxes, sliders, and more.|
|Launcher screen|Displays shortcuts, quick actions, or grouped sections of information.|

## How screens relate to mobile apps and offline mode

Each mobile app has its own configuration. Within that configuration, you decide which screens to include in the app.

Offline mode is supported in the following screens. For more information about screen types in mobile, see [Mobile screen types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-applet.md).
