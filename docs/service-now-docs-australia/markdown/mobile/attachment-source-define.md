# Define attachment sources available to users

Control the origin of where images and files are sourced from, including a phone's gallery, camera, or file system. This capability confirms that images can’t be reused and verifies that they aren't AI-generated.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can limit the origins of attachments to ensure that images are sourced from one or all of the following:

-   On-site via a camera
-   From the user’s phone gallery
-   From the user’s file system

This feature is supported for all attachment locations including: activity stream, functions, and input form screen.

**Note:** This feature is also supported for scripted screens within Mobile App Bridge and the Cabrillo JS module.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the attachment location for where you want to control the origin of the attachment source.
