# Configure a smart button

Smart buttons are actions that allow you to perform another action, such as sending an email, making a phone call, pulling up a location, or navigating directly to a URL.

## Before you begin

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select **Functions** from the menu and then select **New**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Context

</td><td>

Context for your smart button. Select from:-   **Record**

Use **Record** context navigation functions in situations where the navigation depends on information from a record. For example, you want to navigate from the **Assigned to** field in an incident record to the assignee's user record.

Use **Global** context navigation functions in situations where the navigation does not depend on information from a record.

 **Note:** Smart buttons using the **Address** type must use the **Record** context. The **Context** field returns an error if you select **Global** context for an **Address** type smart button

Conditions \(optional\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Condition Type

</td><td>

Type of condition to use. Create conditions to limit when the smart button appears. For example, if you are creating a Phone type of smart button, you could create a condition to require a value in the phone number field.

 The following condition types appear if **Context** is set to **Record** and a **Table** is selected:

 -   **Declarative**: Adds a condition builder to the form. For more information, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).
-   **Script**: Adds a script condition field to the form.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Conditions

</td><td>

This option appears if **Context** is set to **Global**. This is a condition that must be met for the function to be visible in the app for the user to click on.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Button attributes

</td><td>

\(Optional\) Specifies an additional attribute for your smart button. Select **New** to create one of the following button attributes:

 -   **alerts\_require\_dismissal**: When set to `true`, this button attribute enables the banner messages to persist until the user dismisses it. By default, banner messages are automatically dismissed.
-   **used\_for\_deeplink**: When set to `true`, this button attribute specifies that the button is used for deep linking. For more information, see [Deep linking for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/deep-link-mobile.md).
-   **trigger\_offline\_cache\_download**: When set to `true`, this button attribute triggers offline cache generation. After the cache is successfully generated, a download of it is triggered.
-   **check\_acl\_on\_url\_parameter\_field**: When this button attribute is selected any field in the URL string is checked against the ACL \(Access Control List\). To opt-out of the check, mark the parameter as false. For example, a string like `{{meeting_id}}`. If a field does not pass this check, the field value is not included in the URL. If set to false, the URL parameter field is not checked against the ACL for backward compatibility.
-   **hidden\_attachment\_sources**: Enter values in the **Value** field from where you don’t want images sourced from. Values can be `camera`, `files` or `gallery`, or any combination separated by commas. If this field is left blank, then images and files can be sourced from all locations. For more information, see [Define attachment sources available to users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/attachment-source-define.md).

## Result

## What to do next

After you create a smart button function, you must associate it with a specific location in the mobile app. You can add a smart button function to a top menu, a swipe action, or to a specific field. For more information on associating the smart button function to a location, see [Associate a function with a location in the app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-button-instances.md).
