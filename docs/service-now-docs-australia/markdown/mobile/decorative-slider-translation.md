# Configure translated values for decorative slider

Add translated values to your decorative slider.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

You first need to create a decorative slider before you can add translated values. For more information, see [Configure a decorative slider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/decorative-slider.md).

Access your decorative slider record from your input form screen and keep a record of all the Label values contained within the JSON script. These are the name values that you will be identifying for translation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Input record in the navigation tree within Mobile App Builder, which contains the decorative slider input attribute for translating.

    **Note:** For instructions on creating a decorative slider, see [Configure a decorative slider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/decorative-slider.md).

2.  Select **New** from the Inputs attribute area.

3.  Enable the **Translated value attribute** field.

4.  Enter the `Label` name for each of your entries in your JSON script.

    In the JSON example provided, the Label names are: `Critically low`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.

    **Note:** The **Translated value** field is automatically populated with the value entered in the **Name** field.

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each Label name you have in your JSON script.

7.  Select **Save**.

8.  Select the more menu option \(\[Omitted image "mab-option-menu.png"\] Alt text: Mobile App Builder option menu.\) and select **Open in platform**.

9.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_translated.list**.

    The Translated Name / Field table displays.

10. Select **New** in the Inputs attribute table, and then complete the table as follows.

    1.  In the **Label \(translate\)** field, enter the translated word that corresponds to the word in the **Value** field. For example, for an Italian translation, the **Value** field may contain the word **high**, the **Label \(translate\)** field would contain the word **alto**.
    2.  In the Language field, enter the abbreviation for translated language you want the word to appear. For example, **it** for Italian or **es** for Spanish. For more information on abbreviations for languages, see [Languages table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_LanguagesTable.md).
    3.  In the **Element** field, enter the text `translated_value`.
    4.  In the **Value** field, enter the word that needs translating.

        **Note:** The word in the **Value** field must correspond to the words defined in **Label** value within the JSON script.

    5.  In the **Table** field, enter the following `Input Attribute [sys_sg_input_attribute]`.
    6.  Leave the **ID** field empty.
    7.  Select **Submit**.
    8.  Repeat all the steps in step 10, for each Label value defined in the JSON. You will also need to create a new record in the Translated Name/Field table for each Label value that requires translation into an alternative language.
