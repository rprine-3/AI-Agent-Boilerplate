# Mapping specific mobile screens for universal linking

Configure universal links for screen mapping so a user is redirected to a previously styled record screen or list screen. Use this option to provide a customized experience for the user.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When creating universal links, you define the screen type and the data the user sees after they tap the mobile banner. See, [Create path segment records and supported URL records for universal linking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/universal-linking-web-banner.md). Also there is an option to create a screen mapping for universal links. Users click these links to see a preconfigured screen based on a defined table.

**Note:** Universal linking mapping does not apply to browser screens, as there are no options for styling and configuring a web page.

## Procedure

1.  In the web-based UI, navigate to **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile Universal Liking** &gt; **Screen Mappings**.

2.  Select **New** to create a universal link screen mapping.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_uy4_1xw_spb"><thead><tr><th>
