# Use your navigation function as a footer function

Footer functions enable your end users to take an action on a details segment of a form. You can use the navigation function you created to give your users access to the application launcher from within the details segment of your forms. Unlike the top menu function, the form footer button is visible at the bottom of the form.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Screens** category, and then select the screen where you want to add the footer function.

4.  In the **Footer function instances** section of the screen record, select **New**.

5.  Complete the following fields as necessary.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|The name of your footer function.|
    |Description|Additional information about the function.|
    |Display label|The label for this footer function. Use a value to inform your users of what the action does. In this case, you could use the name of the destination screen launcher.|
    |Order|Optional field that you can use to set the order that the UI functions appear. If you have multiple functions, set **Order**.|
