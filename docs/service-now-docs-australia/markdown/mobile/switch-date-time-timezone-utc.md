# Switch the date/time fields between device time zone and UTC

Use the **ShowDateTimeInUTC** mobile property to determine whether the date/time field values in the Now Mobile app are displayed in the time zone of the user's device \(default\) or are converted to UTC.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The **ShowDateTimeInUTC** mobile property value is **false** and not defined by default. When set to **false** or not defined, the Now Mobile app displays the time and date according to the time zone of a user’s device. Instead, set **ShowDateTimeInUTC** to **true** to display the time and date according to Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\).

Both [Mobile Card Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-card-builder.md) and the following mobile screens support the **ShowDateTimeInUTC** property:

-   [Input form screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-input-screen.md)
-   [Record screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/form-screen.md)

Mobile properties are configured as records in the sys\_sg\_properties table on the ServiceNow® Platform server. The ServiceNow instance sends the mobile property to mobile apps after authentication. Then the property turns on or turns off a feature on the mobile app.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_sg\_properties.list**.

2.  In the Mobile Properties list, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
