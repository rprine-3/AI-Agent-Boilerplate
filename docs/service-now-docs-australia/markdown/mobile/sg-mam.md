</table>## Microsoft Intune

**Important:**

Microsoft requires iOS Intune apps to be registered with Microsoft Entra ID \(formerly Microsoft Entra ID\) in the second half of the calendar year 2024. Apps that are not registered will fail the Microsoft Intune login flow.

What this means for publicly distributed and privately distributed iOS Intune apps:

-   Publicly distributed iOS apps must be registered in your Microsoft tenant after the build is created and before distribution of the app.
-   Privately distributed iOS apps must get your Microsoft Entra ID administrator's consent. This can be done at any point in the app build process, but must be done before distribution of the app.

For more information, see the following resources:

-   [Microsoft website explaining the requirement and the timeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/whats-new#wrapped-ios-apps-and-ios-apps-using-the-intune-app-sdk-will-require-azure-ad-app-registration).
