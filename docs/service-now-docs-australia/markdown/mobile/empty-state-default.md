# Configure an empty state

Configure an empty state to inform users that a page currently does not contain data. Add an image, text, and buttons to customize the empty state and improve the user experience.

## Before you begin

Whether creating a default or specific empty state, the following items might be required if you plan to display an image or button:

-   An image from the Attachments \[sys\_attachment\] table.
-   Defined button actions from the Function \[sys\_sg\_button\] table. For more information, see [Configure a smart button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-config-smart-button.md).

Role required: admin

    1.  Select **All mobile records** in the menu.

    2.  From the Record type drop-down menu, select **Empty state \[sys\_sg\_empty\_state\]**, and then select **New**.
