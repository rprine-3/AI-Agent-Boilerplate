# Mobile screen types

Learn how to use screens in ServiceNow mobile. Use screens to make your mobile app functionality available to your end users.

## Screen types

Screens are made up of one or more embedded screens, which are screens embedded with a record screen. Each screen has configurable components, conditional formatting, sorting order, and filters.

You can choose one of the available screen types within Mobile App Builder. Each screen type provides a unique experience or work flow, typically one per navigation tab, which your users can access on their mobile app The screen types may include other optional screens for your users to access for additional information. All screens display information that is based on records in a data item.

Mobile web screen

 Use a mobile web screen to open a URL from within a ServiceNow app. You can configure relative URLs to open pages within the ServiceNow platform, or an external link. For example, a user can see a knowledge article on the instance via the Service Portal.

Input form screen

 Input form screens display inputs to allow your users to quickly enter information into mobile apps. Use input form screens to create or edit records, complete surveys, or any other situation where your users need to enter information.
