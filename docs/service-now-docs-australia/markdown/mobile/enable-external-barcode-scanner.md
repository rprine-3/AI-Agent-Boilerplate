# Enable barcode scanning with an external scanner

Set the **externalScanEnabled** mobile property to `True` to enable barcode scanning with an external scanner while the device camera is available in other parts of the mobile app.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When the **externalScanEnabled** mobile property is set to `True`, you can use an external scanner without denying access to the camera for the mobile app.

By default, the **externalScanEnabled** mobile property isn't configured, which turns off this feature.

In ServiceNow® mobile apps version 19.0 and later, when you configure the **externalScanEnabled** property on your ServiceNow instance, it enables a toggle switch on the barcode scan screen. This switch can be used to select the device camera or an external device.

**Important:**

External barcode scanning devices must be configured with a 'tab' character appended to the end of each barcode. Multi-scan and group scans use the tab suffix character to automatically advance to the next field.

Please refer to the user manual of your device to learn how to configure the tab suffix. For example:

-   For all Zebra scanners, see [Add a Tab Key after Scanning a Barcode](https://supportcommunity.zebra.com/s/article/Add-a-Tab-Key-After-Scanning-a-Bar-Code?language=en_US).
-   For Zebra DS2278 Bluetooth scanner, see [Tab Key](https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/support-dam/en/documentation/unrestricted/guide/product/ds2278-prg-en.pdf).
-   For Zebra TC52X, TC78x, and MC 900 \(phone with built-in scanner\), see [DataWedge: Append Send Enter or Tab Key after Scanning](https://supportcommunity.zebra.com/s/article/DataWedge-for-Android-Send-Enter-or-Tab-after-scanning?language=en_US).
-   For Honeywell CT40 \(phone with built-in scanner\), see [Article 000076406](https://sps-support.honeywell.com/s/article/How-to-add-remove-a-suffix-on-an-Android-device-running-CommonES-version-3-or-greater) in the Honeywell knowledge base.
