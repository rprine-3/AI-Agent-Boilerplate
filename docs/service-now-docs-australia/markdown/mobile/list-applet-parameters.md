# Parametrized list screens

Learn how to use parameters to pass information into a list screen.

Use parameters to pass information into a list screen. For example, a user views a grouped list showing records grouped by priority. When a user selects a priority, a list containing records matching that priority displays. This second list needs to know which priority the user selected to display the appropriate records. The system accomplishes this task by passing a parameter. The first list stores the selected priority value in a parameter. The second list uses the information in that parameter to display the appropriate records.
