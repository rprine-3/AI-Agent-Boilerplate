# Configure a font icon to use a theme variable to define its color

Specify the CSS custom property of a sys\_ux\_theme record to define the color of a font icon.

## Before you begin

You must know the sys\_ux\_theme record for the theme variable that you want to use to define your font icon color. The value you need for the theme variable is the CSS custom property in the sys\_ux\_theme properties table.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Theme variables can only be applied to font icons.

You can configure an icon within the work flow of configuring a screen or you can configure an icon by selecting the **Cards &amp; icons** category from the Mobile App Builder menu. This procedure uses the **Cards &amp; icons** category.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Cards &amp; icons** category, and then select **New**.

4.  In the Create a card or icon dialog box, select **Icon**, and then select **Continue**.

5.  In the Icon form, enter a **Name** for the icon.

    Make sure you choose a name that makes it easy to identify the icon.

6.  From the Type drop-down list, select **Font**.

7.  In the Set appearance section, enter the following information in the **Style** and **Value** fields to configure the font icon that uses a theme variable to define its color.

    Select the plus icon to add a row.

<table id="table_mzt_jgj_vwb"><thead><tr><th>

Style

</th><th>

Value

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Enter `FontName`

</td><td>

Enter one of the following font families:

 -   `now-mobile-icons`

These icons are designed to be used in screens. Use them for lists and section destinations that go to list screens and browser screens. Use these icons to represent a work flow or a screen that you want users to navigate to.

-   `now-mobile-icons-cards`

Use these icons in the body of cards.

-   `now-mobile-icons-buttons`

These icons are designed to be used for functions. They can be used on buttons that are located on cards or for quick actions.

-   `now-mobile-icons-ALPnavbar`

These icons appear in the upper right corner of your mobile screen and are used as navigation to another screen.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enter `Value`

</td><td>

Enter the code that identifies the icon in the font family you want to use. For example, `e903` is the code for the solid cart icon in the **now-mobile-icons-buttons** font family.

 For lists of font family icon codes, see \[add link to reference topics\].

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enter `FontColorVariable` to specify a theme variable for the color of your icon.

 This configuration is optional. If you do not specify a color, the default icon color is black. If you want to use a hex color code, see \[link to 'Configure font type icons'\], which contains information about configuring icon color using hex color codes.

</td><td>

Enter the theme variable for the color you want to use. For example, the following CSS custom property:

 `--now-accordion-color`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enter `Name`

</td><td>

Enter the name listed for the icon in the font family. For example, if you wanted to use the shopping cart icon in the **now-mobile-icons** family, you would enter `Cart`.
