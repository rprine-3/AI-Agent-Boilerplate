# Configure different mobile attachment capabilities on Android devices based on user roles

Use a combination of system properties and mobile properties to enable different users on Android devices to share, download, or view attachments in external applications based on roles.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Make sure to select **Global** as the application scope.

Identify 2 groups of users:

<table id="table_sf3_lwf_kfc"><thead><tr><th>

Group A: users that CAN:

</th><th>

Group B: users that CAN'T:

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

-   Share and download attachments
-   View attachments in external applications

</td><td>

-   Share and download attachments
-   View attachments in external applications

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## About this task

After you identify the two groups of users, assign different roles to each group of users. You can assign more than one role to each group of users. For information about creating and assigning roles to users, see [Create a role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateARole.md).

**Note:** This feature is available on Android clients, version 19.5.1 and later.

## Procedure

1.  Set the system property **glide.sg.block\_mobile\_attachments\_external\_viewing** to `true`.

    For more information, see [Control whether users can view attachments in external applications on Android devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/vu-attach-extapp-android.md).

2.  Set the system property **glide.sg.block\_mobile\_attachments\_sharing** to `true`.

    For more information, see [Block users from downloading or sharing attachments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/block-users-download-shar-attach.md).

3.  On your ServiceNow® instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_sg\_properties\_list.do**.

    The Mobile Properties list appears.

4.  In the Mobile Properties list, select **New**.

    The Mobile Properties form appears.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.
