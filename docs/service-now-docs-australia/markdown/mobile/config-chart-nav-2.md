# Add a navigation function to an analytics preview

Configure your analytics preview to use a navigation function. This function directs your users to your chart screen from the analytics preview on your screen launcher.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

These steps detail instructions for adding your navigation function to an existing chart analytics preview. To utlize the navigation function, you must have configured a screen launcher with an analytics preview and a navigation to a chart screen. For details on that process, see [Create a mobile analytics preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-dashboard-preview.md) and [Create a navigation function to a chart screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/config-chart-nav.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you're working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select **All mobile records** from the menu.

4.  From the **Record type** field, select Analytics preview **\[sys\_sg\_chart\]**, and then select the analytics preview record you created in the topic [Create a mobile analytics preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-dashboard-preview.md).

5.  Navigate to the Destination screen navigation section and select the navigation function you created in the topic, [Create a navigation function to a chart screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/config-chart-nav.md).

6.  Select **Save**.


## Result

With this procedure, you’ve created the infrastructure of a mobile analytics preview and a navigation to a data visualization.

## What to do next

The final process involves adding the analytics preview to the launcher screen UI section. For more information, see, [Configure an analytics UI section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-ui-section-config-reports.md).

An additional configuration is available, where users view a list of records when they tap the data visualization. For more information, see [Create a parameterized list for your chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/nav-chart-to-list-1.md).
