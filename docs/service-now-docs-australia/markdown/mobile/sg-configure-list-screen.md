    All necessary downstream records are automatically generated for you and you’ll be taken to the list screen record configuration form. Optional configuration options are available under the **Advanced settings** section.

    **Note:** Selecting **Cancel** takes you back to the **Screens** selection page.

    Automatically generated records are marked with a blue spark icon in the configuration tree.

For more information, see [Configure a record screen for use with a list screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-configure-form-applet.md).
-   **Configure mobile functions for your list screen** - The List screen can include top menu functions and footer functions to determine the type of action users can perform on a list screen. As an admin, you configure this option in the List screen record. For more information see, [Mobile functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-mobile-button-types.md) and [Associate a function with a location in the app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-button-instances.md).
-   **Configure role access for records in your list screen** - Use the role access option to configure the records in your list screen to only display to selected roles. As an admin, you configure this option in the List screen record.
