# Configure an empty state for a list screen

Configure an empty state to display on empty list screens, to provide information to further direct users. These features are configured in the web-based UI instead of in the Mobile App Builder.

## Before you begin

You should already have an empty state configured for list screens that do not contain any data. For more information, see [Configure an empty state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/empty-state-default.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the web-based UI, enter `sys_sg_list_screen.list` in the filter navigator.

2.  Select a list screen to display the specific empty state.

3.  In the **Empty State** field, select an empty state to associate with the list screen.

4.  Right-click in the header and select **Save**.
