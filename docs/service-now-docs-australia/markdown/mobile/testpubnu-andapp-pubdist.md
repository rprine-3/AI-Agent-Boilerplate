# Test and publish a new branded Android app for public distribution

Learn the next steps to test and publish a new branded Android app for public distribution after you request it in Mobile Publishing.

## 1. Test the app

After the build successfully completes and your app is ready for testing:

1.  Navigate to the Request details page by selecting **All** &gt; **Mobile Branding** &gt; **Manage Mobile Publishing Apps** &gt; **Your recent app requests**.
2.  Select the card for your mobile app build request. The Request details page appears.
3.  Select the **Android testing file** link and the AAB file is downloaded to your local system for testing:

4.  Upload the AAB file directly to Google Play so you can use the Google Play internal testing tool.

    See [Google documentation](https://play.google.com/console/about/internal-testing/) for information about internal testing on Google Play.

5.  Check the following items on your app:
    -   App has the correct name, icon, splash screen, branding, and theming. For more information, see [Create a theme with Theme Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/tb-create-theme.md).
    -   App uses the default instance you specified for login if you selected the instance pre-fill option when you requested the branded app.
    -   EULA and privacy policy listed in the mobile app **Settings** tab under **Legal** link to the policies you specified.

## 2. Set up the app

After testing completes successfully, you can set up your app for use. These configurations are optional.

1.  Set up push notifications by adding your Google Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTPv1 Oauth token to your app type's push application record.

    See [KB1639289](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fkb%3Fid%3Dkb_article_view%26sys_kb_id%3D68456c07471d86d030fba325126d43e5) for detailed instructions.

2.  \(Optional\) If you set up push notifications, test them using an out-of-the-box push notification.

    See [KB0829093](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=b5e4111cdba5d010feb1a851ca961909) for detailed instructions.

3.  Set up deep links for your app by configuring an `assetlinks.json` file on each instance.

    See [KB1648690](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1648690) for detailed instructions.


## 3. Approve or reject the app

Make sure the app meets your branding requirements:

-   **Reject** the app to edit the branding, app name, app type, or any third-party information. Use the **Duplicate** option to copy information over to a new app request after you have rejected the app.
-   **Approve** the build to move forward with publishing the app to your end users.

## 4. Customize your app's workflows

Use Mobile App Builder to customize your app. See [Mobile App Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mab-concept.md) for detailed information about how you can customize your branded app.

## 5. Publish and distribute your app

After you have tested your app, set it up, and customized its workflows, you are ready to publish your branded Android for public distribution. Deploy your AAB file to the Google Play console, or your enterprise mobility management \(EMM\) provider:

-   **Upload your app to the Google Play Console:**

    To upload your public branded Android app to the Google Play Console, see [Google documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/upload-bundle). Also see [KB1710255](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1710255) and [KB1157062](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=a2a066bedb5155d0d0dc3feb68961951) for information about required actions to publish a public Android app on the Google Play Store and for ServiceNow® guidance on creating your Google Play console listing metadata.

-   **BlackBerry Portal:**

    To publish your public branded Android app to the BlackBerry Portal if you are using BlackBerry mobile application management \(MAM\), see [KB0813295](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0813295)

-   **Microsoft Intune:**

    To sync your public branded Android app from Google to Microsoft Intune, see [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-add-android-for-work).


## 6. Keep your app updated

Update your app before you update your ServiceNow family version, or at least once per year to keep your push notifications working and to leverage the most up to date ServiceNow mobile features.
