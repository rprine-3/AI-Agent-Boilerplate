# Configure input sources in an input form screen

Configure the actions that you want to appear on an Input field to trigger a UI rule. These input source actions are shown above the keyboard, or next to the selected input. Use it to configure summarization actions for GenAI.

## Before you begin

You must create an input form screen before you can create actions. For information about creating an input form screen, see [Configure an input form screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-screen-config.md).

Role required: admin

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you're working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Screens** category and then select the input form screen for which you want to configure variables.

4.  Scroll down to the Actions section of the form, and select **New** to create a variable.
