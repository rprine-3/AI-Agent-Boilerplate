# Configure input form actions in an input form screen

Add a button next to input form fields to give users the ability to perform various input actions. These actions include adding a comment, adding one or more attachments, and navigating to other screens.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

This topic describes how to configure input actions for your various input fields. These configurations should be performed within the general setup of input form screens. Additional input action configurations are only available when `Screen` is selected in the **Presentation style** field of the Input form screen. For more information, see [Configure an input form screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-screen-config.md).

**InputActionType**: Input actions are actions that can be triggered in the more menu icon \[Omitted image "icon-ifs-input-more-iOS.png"\] Alt text: More menu icon. displayed by the side of an input value field. The actions are: `attachments`, `comment`, or `button` \(navigation function\).

**ButtonId**: The navigation function associated with the input action. This navigation input action can be either a `global` or `record` context. The *ButtonId* is the sys\_id of a record from the Button \[sys\_sg\_button\] table.

**HiddenAttachmentSources**: Ability to prevent the upload of specific attachment sources from the user. The user can upload only images either from the phone’s camera or the gallery.

**DataSourceID**: The data source used for loading data from the database. Used for comment and attachment input action.

**Note:** An *ElementIdentifier* attribute is also required. For more information, see [Data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/data-sources.md).

**ElementIdentifier**: The unique ID contained within a data source, used for loading data from the database. Used for comment and attachment input action.

**Note:** A *DataSourceID* attribute is also required. For more information, see [Data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/data-sources.md).

**UserActionID**: A unique value that identifies this action record. It's needed to associate the action with a UI rule.

**Note:** This field is available when the **Input type** field is `Input source`.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d70905e532">

4.  Select **New** in the Action attributes area.
5.  Select **ButtonId** in the **Name** field.

**Note:** If the navigation function you selected has a Record context \(as opposed to a Global context\), you must map it to the specific record using data sources.

If the *ButtonId* refers to a button with a record context, it defaults to the context of the input form. However, you can override this default context by using the data source to link to a different record context.

7.  Select **Save**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>13. Select **Save**.


## What to do next

To open the input form screen with attachments and comments already loaded from the instance \[instance\] table, you must configure the attributes *DataSourceId* and *ElementIdentifier*. For example, in a scenario where multiple users work on the same form, the data source loading mechanism validates that the latest data is displayed to the next user on the input form screen. For a navigation function with a record context, the record context is defined in the data source script. The script maps to the sys\_id of the record that contains a context for the navigation. For more information, see [Configure data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/data-sources-config.md).
