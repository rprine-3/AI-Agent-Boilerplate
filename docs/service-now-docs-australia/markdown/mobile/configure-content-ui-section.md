## What to do next

The content UI section you created can now contain a mobile campaign. For full instructions, see [Configure mobile campaign components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-campaign-create.md).

After creating content UI sections, you must associate the UI sections to a launcher screen so they're displayed. For more information, see [Add a UI section to the launcher screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/ui-section-to-launcher-screen.md).
