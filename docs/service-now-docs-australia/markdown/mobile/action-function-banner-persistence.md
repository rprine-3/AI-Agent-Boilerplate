# Define banner display persistence

Define if a message or banner displayed on a mobile device requires the user to acknowledge the receipt of the message.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Configure specific messages to remain on a screen until the user actively dismisses the message. By default, messages fade after a few seconds.

When a function button has multiple messages associated to it, then all associated messages are consolidated into a single message. If one of these messages contains a persistence attribute, then the single consolidated message adopts the persistence behavior.

Only one banner message is displayed at a time. Newer banner messages replace existing banner messages. This replacement occurs even if the original existing banner contains persistent attributes.

|Banner display for iOS|Banner display for Android|Banner variants according to message|
