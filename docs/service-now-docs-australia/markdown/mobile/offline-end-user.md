# Offline mode for mobile

Access and submit actions to records in your mobile apps, even if you don't have an internet connection.

Plan ahead when you use offline mode. If you're working in an area with no internet access, download what you want to work on ahead of time while you're still connected to the internet.

When you're in offline mode, the changes that you make to your records are logged in your outbox. Your outbox tracks all the actions that you made on your cached records. After your device has internet access, you can synchronize your device with the instance. The cached changes in your outbox update to the instance.

For information on configuring mobile offline, see [Offline mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-offline-mode.md).

## Enable offline mode

Enable offline mode in your **Settings** tab. Tap **Offline** and then toggle on **Offline Mode**.

If you have not already downloaded the offline cache, you see a dialog box that asks you to download it. Tap **Download cache** and then select **Offline mode**.

## Navigate the mobile app in offline mode

When you're in offline mode, a banner that reads Offline Mode displays across the top of all screens.

</table>Depending on how your administrator configures the mobile app, you're unable to submit certain actions while you're in offline mode. These actions are hidden from the user interface.

When you submit an action while you're in offline mode, the change gets marked with a cloud offline icon. Changes remain marked until your device synchronizes to the server.

## Disable offline mode and synchronize outbox

To turn off offline mode and sync pending actions, do the following:

-   Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Offline** in the mobile app. Then deselect **Offline Mode**.
-   Tap **Sync all** from the outbox items list.

Once connectivity is restored, a pop-up displays prompting you to select **Go Online and Sync** to upload any pending changes from the outbox.

**Note:** After the synchronization completes, you're back online and your offline cache is deleted.

</table>## Cache expiration

Your administrator configures a default length of time after which your offline cache expires.

When a cache expires, you must go online and sync your changes. Warning messages appear periodically to remind you to synchronize your cache before it expires.

**Note:** Always synchronize your cache before and after going offline.

## Resolve synchronization errors

Problematic changes that you made in offline mode don't synchronize to the instance. They remain in the outbox until they are resolved.

You can't synchronize changes that contradict changes made by other users while you were offline. For example, you may receive an error message if you try to synchronize changes to a record that another user closed while you were working in offline mode.

To view the errors in your cached changes, navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Offline** &gt; **Outbox**. Error messages indicate where errors occurred in your cached records while you were offline. You can resolve any of the listed issues directly from your outbox. Tap **Resolve** to fix the error or tap **Delete** to remove the issue from the list.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>You can either tap **Resolve** to fix the error or tap **Delete** to remove the issue from the list.

## Scheduled offline caching

\[Omitted image "offline-mode-user-setting.png"\] Alt text: Offline mode user settings

Enable scheduled offline caching to automatically download your cache according to your work schedule. Scheduled caching works in the background, so you can continue to use the app while the download completes. You can enable or disable this feature in your app settings.

**Note:** To download content only when connected to Wi-Fi, enable the **Wi-Fi only** option.
