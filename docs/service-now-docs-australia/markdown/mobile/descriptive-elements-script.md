# Configure descriptive elements for input form screens

Add descriptive elements, such as an image, simple text, rich text, or a mobile card, before an input field within an input form screen. This additional on-screen information provides a context to your users, enabling them to better understand what is required as they enter data into an input form.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** Image, text, and rich text descriptive elements are configured in the Mobile App Builder, whereas card descriptive elements are configured in the ServiceNow AI Platform. For the configuration of card descriptive elements see, [Configure a card descriptive element for input form screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/descriptive-elements-card.md).

## About this task

You can add descriptive elements to input fields, sections that contain input fields, or input form sections without any inputs. Descriptive elements can be a selection of simple text, rich text, or an image that precedes an input.

You must have the following elements configured before you create descriptive elements:

-   A data source that contains at least one element identifier. Data sources facilitate the mapping of the descriptive element to the input form screen. For more information, see [Data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/data-sources.md).
-   A record section that can either be an input or an input form section:
    -   An input form section is a group of inputs in a defined area of the input form screen, usually with a defined header.
    -   Inputs are individual fields for users to complete within the input form screen. Inputs can be located either within a section or independent of a section.

**Note:** There can be multiple descriptive elements for each input or for each input form section. However, you must create a separate record for each descriptive element of every input.

The following stages are required when creating a descriptive element: First, declare what the descriptive element is and what it's related to. Next, determine whether the descriptive element is associated with an input or an input form section. Then, create attributes for each type of descriptive element you have selected. Finally, map the descriptive element into an input form screen UI element.

|Descriptive elements of image and rich text on an input form screen|Descriptive elements of image and plain text on an input form screen|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|\[Omitted image "des-elements2-callouts.png"\] Alt text: Descriptive elements of an image and rich text in an input form screen.|\[Omitted image "des-elements1-callouts.png"\] Alt text: Descriptive elements of an image and plain text in an input form screen.|

-   **_ElementIdentifier_**

The unique identifier for each UI element. This attribute must be used for descriptive elements.

**Note:** This identifier is listed as *valuesMapper.addRecordMapping* in the data source script

-   **_MergeWithNextUIElement_**

This is how the descriptive element appears on the input form screen. Mark as `true` to create a gap between inputs or input sections.

**Note:** The following default values exist:

    -   The **Parent table** of type `Input` has a value of `false`.
    -   The **Parent table** of type `Input form section` has a value of `true`.
