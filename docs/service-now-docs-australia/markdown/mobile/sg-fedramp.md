# Mobile encryption security compliance

Learn about how ServiceNow mobile apps comply with encryption security standards for the FedRAMP and DISA environments.

ServiceNow GovCommunityCloud \(GCC\) compliance is designed for U.S. Federal, State, and local government customers. This environment is FedRAMP High and DoD Impact Level 4 authorized and compliant. Each ServiceNow mobile app \(Now Mobile, Mobile Agent, and Mobile Onboarding\) use FIPS 140-2 validated encryption modules.

 As part of using these validated modules, ServiceNow mobile apps include the following:

 -   **Encryption**

ServiceNow uses FIPS 140-2 validated encryption when connecting to FedRAMP and DISA instances.

-   **Enforced security feature enablement**

Enforced device PIN or biometric enablement when connecting to FedRAMP and DISA instances.

-   **Encryption for locally stored data**

Locally stored app data such as user preferences and offline data are encrypted.

-   **Blur feature**

The blur feature is automatically enabled when the app is in the background.

</table>## iOS FIPS 140-2 Compliance

-   On iOS devices, ServiceNow mobile apps use the Apple validated cryptographic modules. These modules are available on all devices using iOS 11 and up.

-   To enforce iOS FIPS 140-2 encryption, the ServiceNow mobile apps require that a user’s device has a pass code enabled when connecting to a FedRAMP or DISA instance.

-   All locally stored mobile app data such as user preferences and offline data use FIPS 140-2 validated encryption when pass code enablement is confirmed.


For more information on the Apple validated cryptographic modules, see [Apple Platform Certifications](https://support.apple.com/guide/certifications/welcome/web)

## Android FIPS 140-2 Compliance

-   On Android devices, ServiceNow mobile apps are integrated with a third party SDK that uses a FIPS 140-2 validated module.

-   With this SDK, Android versions of ServiceNow mobile apps are FIPS 140-2 compliant for data at rest. All locally stored app data such as user preferences and offline data use the same level of encryption.
-   ServiceNow mobile apps also require that a device pass code is enabled when a user connects to a FedRAMP or DISA instance.

    **Note:** This feature requires Android version 7.0 Nougat and up.


For more information on the certificate used with the third party SDK, see [https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/3220](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/3220)

## Mobile system properties related to compliance

-   **Enforcing FIPS 140-2 Encryption**

    Use the **glide.sg.device\_encryption\_enabled** system property to enforce encryption and require that a device pass code is configured. This system property is automatically added and defaults to `true` for FedRAMP and DISA instances.

    For non-FedRAMP and non-DISA instances, this property defaults to `false`. Enable this property on these instances to take advantage of encryption and device pass code enablement.

-   **Disabling offline mode**

    On FedRAMP and DISA instances, offline mode is disabled by default when the offline mode plugin is installed. To enable offline mode on a FedRAMP or DISA instance, an administrator must create the **glide.sg.offline.enabled** system property on the \[sys\_properties\] table, and set the value of this property to `true`.

    For commercial instances, offline mode is enabled by default when the offline mode plugin is installed. To disable offline mode on a commercial instance, an administrator must create the **glide.sg.offline.enabled** system property on the \[sys\_properties\] table, and set the value of this property to `false`.

    For more information on offline mode, see [Offline mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-offline-mode.md).

-   **Screen blur on background**

    Use the **glide.sg.blur\_ui\_when\_backgrounded** system property to blur the app screen when in background. This property was introduced in the Madrid release.

    **Important:**

    -   The **glide.sg.blur\_ui\_when\_backgrounded** system property is supported on both iOS and Android devices.
    -   By default, the value for this property is set to `false`, which turns it off.
    -   For Android devices, when this property is enabled by setting the value to `true`, the following restrictions apply:

        -   The screen share feature isn't supported and the shared app screen appears black.
        -   Users are prevented from taking screenshots.
        These restrictions don't apply to iOS devices when the **glide.sg.blur\_ui\_when\_backgrounded** property is enabled.

    This property is not overridden for existing customers who upgrade to the Paris release.


## FedRAMP

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program \(FedRAMP\) creates a set of processes to ensure cloud security for the government. For more detail on this program, see [https://www.fedramp.gov/](https://www.fedramp.gov/).
