# Request a new branded Android app for public distribution

Request, test, and publish a custom Android app that has your unique company identity. Then make the app available for public distribution on the Google Play Store.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Mobile Publishing enables you to request a branded Android app that can be distributed on the public Google Play Store. After you complete the request form, your ServiceNow® instance builds the app and provides a link from where you can download an Android App Bundle file \(`.aab`\). Then you download the AAB file and test it. When testing completes successfully, you approve the build and can deploy your branded Android app with the public Google Play Store. For information about AAB files, see the [Google documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle).

If you provided a developer verification snippet, a signed Android Package file \(`.apk`\) containing the snippet is also made available for download alongside the AAB file.

**Note:** Publicly distributed Android app builds take one week from submission to be ready for testing. ServiceNow can't expedite this timeline because it's determined by Google.

Ensure that the images or text in the icons are at least 550 pixels from the edge. This distance accounts for the rounded corners in Android icons.

\[Omitted image "logo-padding.png"\] Alt text: Ensure logos are 550 pixels from the edge of the image to avoid a cut off appearance.

Images that do not follow this guideline may appear cut off, as shown in this example.

\[Omitted image "cut-off-icon.png"\] Alt text: Example icon with cut off logo and text.

</table>9.  Select **Next**.

10. In the Review and submit form, review the selections you made in Steps 1-8.

11. If all the selections are what you want, select **Submit** to submit your branded app build request.


## Result

After you complete the request form and submit it, your ServiceNow instance builds the app.

To view the status of the build:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Mobile Branding** &gt; **Manage Mobile Publishing Apps**.
2.  In **Your recent app requests** section, select the card for your branded app request to view its status on the **Request details** page.

When it completes, you receive an email notification about the status of the build. A link is provided from where you can download an Android App Bundle file \(`.aab`\). If you provided a developer verification snippet, a signed Android Package file \(`.apk`\) containing the snippet is also made available for download alongside the AAB file.

**Note:**

-   You can only submit one build at a time. You can't submit another build until the current build is canceled, failed, or completed.
-   It usually takes about a week or less to build the Android branded application. Sometimes it might take only a few hours. However ServiceNow can't expedite the timeline because it's determined by Google.

## What to do next

After the build successfully completes and your app is ready for testing, see [Test and publish a new branded Android app for public distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/testpubnu-andapp-pubdist.md).
