Install an iOS push certificate to use push notifications on your branded ServiceNow mobile apps for iOS.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

To use push notifications on your branded ServiceNow mobile apps for iOS, you must upload your Apple certificates p12 file, and enter your key store password into your instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Push** &gt; **Push Application**.

2.  Open the record for the push application you want to modify.

    -   Open **ServiceNow Mobile Application** for the Mobile Agent app.
    -   Open **ServiceNow Request Application** for the Now Mobile app.
    If you are using a branded mobile application, select the record for the branded app. For example, select **ServiceNow Intune Mobile Application** if you are using the Microsoft Intune branded application.

3.  In the **Push** field, change the value from **REST API** to **Direct**.

4.  In the Apple-Certificate Based Authentication tab, click the reference icon \(\[Omitted image "reference-lookup-icon.png"\] Alt text: Reference icon\) next to the **Certificate** field.

5.  In the X.509 Certificates list pop-up, click **New**.

6.  In the X.509 Certificates form, fill in the fields.

New .p12 files cannot be generated without an updated or new build.
