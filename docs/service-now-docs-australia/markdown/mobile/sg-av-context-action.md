# Configure a contextual link to Virtual Agent

Use Mobile App Builder to create a contextual link in your mobile application so that your users can connect to Virtual Agent and receive information that pertains to their issues. By using a contextual link, your users automatically receive the information that you define about the relevant record.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Before you can create a virtual link to a Virtual Agent feature, you must have the Glide Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\) installed on your instance. For more details, see Virtual Agent.

Perform the following steps in Mobile App Builder.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Functions** category, and then select **New**.

4.  Select the **Action Item**, and then select **New**.

5.  Complete the following fields as needed.

<table id="table_lvf_xd1_n2b"><thead><tr><th>

Different fields appear on the action item form depending on the type of action you select.

Use current record as a condition

</td><td>

Whether you want a separate set of query conditions for the action item. If selected, the Query conditions field is disabled.

Marking **Use current record as condition as true** allows you to do this without creating a parameter.
