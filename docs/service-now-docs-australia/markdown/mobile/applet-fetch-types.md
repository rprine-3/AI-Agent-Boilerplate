# Mobile fetch types

Fetch type settings determine when data is loaded in your screens. Change your fetch type to optimize load time performance for your screens.

Usage

Prefetch

</td><td>

Prefetch is the default fetch type for new screens, except form and details. This option pre-loads record screen data while when your user accesses a list, calendar, or record screen. Lists may take longer to load, but form load time is faster.

 **Note:** As of the Yokohama family release, the prefetch fetch type no longer pre-loads embedded record screen data in a list screen. Instead, it is a redirect that enhances the transition between online and offline states.

</td><td>

This fetch type is the default for most screens. Use this fetch type when the form and form segments do not take much additional time to load.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Background

</td><td>

The app makes a background network request to load embedded screens or form segments. Embedded screens and form segments load instantly once the background request completes.

</td><td>

Use this fetch type when a screen is not the first loaded, but one your users are likely to navigate to. For example, a related list associated with a form.

</td></tr><tr><td>

On Demand

</td><td>

The app makes a network request to load the screen only when your users navigate to it.

</td><td>

Use this fetch type when a screen is not expected to be used often.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Dynamic

</td><td>

The screens for the first 10 rows load as described in the **prefetch** type. After 10 first rows, the app loads screens as defined in the**on demand** fetch type. This option is the default for form and details screens. You can change the number of rows loaded with **prefetch** by changing the value of the **Dynamic prefetch count** field.

</td><td>

Use this fetch type when large lists load too slowly using the **prefetch** fetch type.
