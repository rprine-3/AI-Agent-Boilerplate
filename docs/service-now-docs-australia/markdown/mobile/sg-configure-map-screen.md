# Configure a map screen

Configure a map screen so that your users can see location-based information on a map from their mobile app. The map highlights points of interest, and users can switch between a map view and list view to help them understand the information displayed on a map.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the  **Screens**  category, and then select  **New**.

4.  Select the  **Map** option in the Create a screen page, and then select  **Continue**.

5.  In the New map screen record, complete the fields as needed.

</table>6.  From the Icon section either create a new icon or choose an existing icon. This icon displays if you add your map screen to a launcher screen UI section.

7.  Create a screen segment to continue adding look-and-feel map elements to the screen. You can only create a single segment within each map screen.

    1.  From the **Screen segment** field, select the **+New** button.

        The New screen segment form displays.

    2.  In the New screen segment record, complete the fields as needed.

<table id="table_wsj_1gg_ytb"><thead><tr><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">

**Properties**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</table>8.  Create a stream of records that connect data items and list item configuration records to the screen.

    **Note:** Streams are records that connect data items and list item configuration records to the screen. You can configure multiple item streams within a map. Use this option to define different attributes within a map. For example, you can define different pin colors for each item stream, one for incidents and one for work order tasks.

    1.  From the Streams section, select the **+New** button.

        The location item stream displays.

    2.  In the **Name** field, enter a name of the location item stream.

    3.  In the settings section, do the following steps:

        1.  From the **Table** field, select the table to define location-based map pins and cards.
        2.  \(Optional\) In the **Interleaved** field, select the field that determines how to order your data items. This option is relevant if you have more than one item stream.

            **Note:** You select the data item later in this procedure.

        3.  From the **Location** field, select a reference to the location table. The selected option shows as a location on the map.
        4.  Select a pin color by either selecting a color from the grid or enter a hexadecimal value, and then select **Save**.
9.  Choose an existing data item or create a new data item. To create a new data item, see [Data items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-data-item.md).

    The data item returns data from a single table to be used for the map location item stream.

10. Choose an existing list item configuration that determines how each record appears in the list and the actions associated with it.

11. Select **Save**.


## Result

The configured map screen displays information from your data item plotted on a map, along with a list view to display details on each item.
