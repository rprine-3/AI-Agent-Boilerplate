# Keep native apps active during authentication on Android devices

Use the **preventAppKillOnAuth** property on your ServiceNow instance to help prevent Android devices from killing the mobile app when put to background during login. Use this configuration to allow for a smoother authentication experience by keeping the app active until users complete or cancel the login process.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** The **preventAppKillOnAuth** may need to be set only if you're experiencing login issues, where the app restarts after being put in the background and then is resumed. After such restarts, the app can fail to redirect to the native mobile interface after login. This issue was found to occur on OEM devices like Redmi, POCO, and Oppo.

The **preventAppKillOnAuth** property is a pre-authenticated mobile setting that when set to true signals to the system that an important task is in progress. This setting maintains that the mobile app remains alive during the authentication process even when moved to the background.

Mobile properties are configured as records in the sys\_sg\_properties table on the  ServiceNow Mobile Platform server.

**Note:**  The **preventAppKillOnAuth** property is supported from the 20.6.0 mobile client release.

-   **Example**

    When you open an authenticator app to retrieve code or approve a login request, the ServiceNow mobile app moves to the background. In such a situation the Android OS may terminate the app in the following circumstances:

    -   If the device is running low on memory.
    -   If the battery saver mode enabled.
    -   If the system settings has a limit to the number of background apps enabled to run simultaneously.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_sg\_properties.list**.

    The Mobile Properties list displays.

2.  In the Mobile Properties list, select **New**.

    The Mobile Properties form displays.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields as required.
