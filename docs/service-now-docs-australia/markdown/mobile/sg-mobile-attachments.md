# Manage attachments on details screens

Add, remove, rename, and view attachments in your mobile record screens.

## Enable attachments on your mobile record screens

You can enable attachments on a mobile record screen. Navigate to your record screen in Mobile App Builder. Find and select the **Activity Stream** entry in the configuration tree. Then, select **Show "Attachment" button** option in the **Settings** section of the configuration panel.

For details on the record screen configuration, see [Configure a record screen for use with a list screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-configure-form-applet.md).

## View the attachment list on your record screens

When enabled by an administrator, the attachment list appears at the bottom of the **Details** tab of your mobile record screens. The attachment list shows a preview of each attachment that is associated with the current record. If there are no attachments, you see "No attachment" instead of the attachment list.

The following file types are supported for previewing files:

-   image files — .png, .svg, .webp, .jpg, and .jpeg
-   video files — .mp4, .mov, and .m4v
-   document files — .pdf, .xlsx, .doc, .ppt, .csv, .xls, .txt, and .docx

**Note:**

-   Audio files are not supported.
-   Some of the above file types require an external app to be installed on the device to open the file. For example, Android users can't open .docx files if Microsoft Word isn't installed on their device.
-   Some other file types might work intermittently on iOS and Android devices, but ServiceNow does not support these other file types. ServiceNow only supports the above listed file types on both iOS and Android devices.
