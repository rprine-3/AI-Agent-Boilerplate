-   **[Dynamic variable support in record screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/record-screen-script-type.md)**  
Use the script screen field in record screens to display dynamic field values. The script runs to determine the field value before it displays in your form. The value returned by the script doesn't replace the database value. For example, you can display translated content for dynamic variables within an email.
-   **[Configure the script field for records screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/record-screen-script-type-config.md)**  
Configure script screen fields to display calculated or personalized content in your mobile forms, without modifying the underlying database values.
