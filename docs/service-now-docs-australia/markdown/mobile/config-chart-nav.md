# Create a navigation function to a chart screen

Configure a navigation function to direct your users to your chart screen.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or delegated developer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you're working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Functions** category, and then select **New**.

 Use record context navigation functions in situations where the navigation depends on information from a record.

Use global context navigation functions in a situation where the navigation doesn’t depend on information from a record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Button attributes

</td><td>

Specifies an additional attribute for a button. Select **New** to configure this option. You can select from the following button attributes:

 -   **alerts\_require\_dismissal:** The button attribute when set to true enables the banner messages to persist until the user dismisses it. By default, banner messages are automatically dismissed.
-   **used\_for\_deeplink:** The button attribute when set to true determines that the button is used for deep linking. For more information, see [Deep linking for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/deep-link-mobile.md).
-   **trigger\_offline\_cache\_download:** The button attribute when set to `true` triggers offline cache generation. After the cache is successfully generated, a download of it is triggered.
-   **check\_acl\_on\_url\_parameter\_field:** When this button attribute is selected and set to `true`, any field in the URL string is checked against the ACL \(access control list\). For example, a string like `{{meeting_id}}`. If a field doesn't pass this check, the field value isn't included in the URL. By default, the URL parameter field isn't checked against the ACL for backward compatibility.
