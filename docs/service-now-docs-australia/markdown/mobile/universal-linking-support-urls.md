# Mobile universal linking for supported URLs

Use mobile universal linking to display a web banner on specified platform web pages to encourage users to work within a ServiceNow mobile app. Configure the supported URLs that facilitate this functionality to ensure that the banners are displayed on the correct web pages. These URLs also direct users to a defined location within the appropriate mobile app.

Each time a user accesses a web page using their mobile web browser, the instance checks the URL against all the records in the path segment table and the supported URLs table. When there’s a match, the instance displays a web banner. After the user taps on the banner, the instance directs the user to the appropriate screen on a designated mobile app. This screen displays the selected data. When configuring a URL record for universal linking, the path, query keys, and query values of the URL must be an exact match of the web page.

## Structural layout of URLs used for mobile universal linking

Supported URLs can comprise of elements like host, path, query keys, and query values. These URLs are created in the universal link path segment table and the universal link supported URL table, as described in [Create path segment records and supported URL records for universal linking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/universal-linking-web-banner.md). You can make your URL as general or specific as you require. A more general the URL definition means that the banner is displayed over a larger number of web pages.

**Note:** When creating supported URLs, you must know what path segment, query keys, and query values you want the system to look for.

An example URL structure is `https://<baseURl>/sample_path.do/query_key_01=XYZ/query_key01=value_ABC`. The table describes the parts to create in a path segment record and a supported URL record.

|URL part|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|`sample_path`|Due to its generic nature, the path segment defines the category of the URL and is used to quickly filter out any unmatched records. The path segment record uses regular expressions to match URL texts.|
|`query_key`|Query keys are an extension of the URL that help define specific content.|
|`value`|Values can be added to the query keys, to further streamline the web pages you want to match.|
