# Menu options in the categories home screen

Familiarize yourself with the various menu options in the Mobile App Builder categories home page.

-   **Mobile app configs**

    The Mobile app configs category is the configuration option for ServiceNow applications on iOS and Android mobile devices. Select an option to personalize the app theme, set user access permissions, and create a navigation bar. You must select one configuration per app type. This category is based on the \[sys\_sg\_native\_client\] table.

    **Note:** You can open an existing Mobile Onboarding app configured from a previous release. However, you cannot create a new Mobile Onboarding app configuration.

</table>-   **Screens**

    Screens are the essence of the mobile app experience, enabling you to deliver unique and customized capabilities to provide different user experiences.

    Cards consist of layouts that show visuals, text, and data. Icons are symbols that act as actions or shortcuts when connected to other screens. With both of these items, you can create rich, interactive mobile experiences. This category is based on the tables \[sys\_sg\_icon\], \[sys\_sg\_view\_config\], \[sys\_sg\_view\_template\], and \[sys\_sg\_item\_view\].

    Data items provide the data presented in a screen. Select the table you want data from and define the conditions that must be met for the data to be displayed. This category is based on the \[sys\_sg\_data\_item\] table.

</table>-   **All mobile records**

    Use the **All mobile records** category to quickly find records within specific tables without the need to drill down into multiple layers of the ServiceNow AI Platform configuration tree. For example, a filter record can be selected here instead of having to select a list screen record and then drill down to the filter record.

<table id="table_pz3_xbr_qqb"><tbody><tr><td>

Use the **Record type** field to search and select the table you require. The results display a list of records of the selected record type. Use the search box \(\[Omitted image "mab-search-in-category.png"\] Alt text: Search option for category results.\) to filter the records from the list.
