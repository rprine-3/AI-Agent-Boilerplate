# Create a mobile pop-up

Learn how to display configurable mobile pop-ups based on real-time conditions. You can display these pop-ups at the mobile app login phase or after a button tap.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Before configuring your mobile pop-ups, consider the following:

-   Mobile cards are used in the display of pop-ups. You can either design one of your own mobile cards or use one of the template cards provided. For more information, see [Mobile Card Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-card-builder.md).
-   Supported button types that trigger pop-ups are action item and navigation. For more information, see [Action functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-actions.md).
-   All button locations are supported. For example, swipe, top menu action, and footer function.
-   Buttons are supported in the following UI sections, record, icon, media, and content. For more information, see [Launcher screen UI sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/alp-ui-sections.md).
-   Mobile pop-ups aren't supported in offline.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

    **Note:** Two mobile pop-up card templates are provided with the base system. These templates are called Pop-up 01 and Pop-up 02.

15. Assign configurable functions or predefined functions to a button on a mobile pop-up card.

    **Note:** For more information about configurable functions, see [Mobile functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-mobile-button-types.md) and [Configure a card action using Mobile Card Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/create-mca-with-mcb.md). Also, see the What to do next section in this topic.

16. Select **Save**.


## What to do next

You can add two types of functions to a button on a mobile pop-up card, configurable functions and predefined functions. Configurable functions enable developers to customize function behavior and functionality. Predefined functions have dedicated functionality, purpose built for mobile pop-ups. The following predefined functions are available:

-   Cancel: Dismisses the pop-up without performing any additional action.
-   Continue: Submits or proceeds with the original function from which the pop-up was triggered.
-   Logout: Logs out the user from the current instance and is navigated to the instance list page.

For more information, see [Mobile functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-mobile-button-types.md) and [Configure a card action using Mobile Card Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/create-mca-with-mcb.md).

-   **[Assign predefined functions to mobile pop-ups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/popups-system-button.md)**  
Use predefined functions within mobile pop-ups to perform actions like dismiss the pop-up, proceed with the suggested instruction, or log out of the instance.
