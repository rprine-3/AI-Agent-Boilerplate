# Configure an action function

Action functions enable the user to change something in the database. For example, making an update or adding a comment to a record requires an action function.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application screen.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select **Functions** in the menu, and then select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Context

</td><td>

The level to apply the action to. -   **Record**: Applies an action at the record level. For example, use this option to create a button that changes the state of a record. You can set the context to Record for actions on a particular field, a particular record, or swipe actions. If the action function includes a UI parameter with the **Input source** field set to **Auto fill**, you must specify the table in the **Table** field.
-   **Global**: Applies an action at the global, or list level. For example, use this option to add a button that creates a record. Do not use the Global setting for actions that are in the context of a record, or actions that include a UI parameter with the **Input source** field set to **Auto fill**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Button attributes

</td><td>

Specifies an additional attribute for a button. Select **New** to configure this option. You can select from the following button attributes:-   **alerts\_require\_dismissal**: The button attribute when set to `true` enables the banner messages to persist until the user dismisses it. By default, banner messages are automatically dismissed.
-   **used\_for\_deeplink**: The button attribute when set to `true` determines that the button is used for deep linking. For more information, see [Deep linking for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/deep-link-mobile.md).
-   **trigger\_offline\_cache\_download**: The button attribute when set to `true` triggers offline cache generation. After the cache is successfully generated, a download of it is triggered.
-   **check\_acl\_on\_url\_parameter\_field**: When this button attribute is selected any field in the URL string is checked against the ACL \(Access Control List\). To opt-out of the check, mark the parameter as false. For example, a string like `{{meeting_id}}`. If a field does not pass this check, the field value is not included in the URL. If set to false, the URL parameter field is not checked against the ACL for backward compatibility.
-   **refresh\_parameter\_screen\_after\_action **: When enabled for write-back action buttons in input form screens, the input form automatically reloads after the action completes. This attribute keeps field values current and prevents you from working with stale data. The default value is false.

**Note:** To keep the fields up to date with the latest database values, you must configure either a data source or an auto-fill variable for the relevant fields. This ensures the fields display the value that was just inserted or updated in the database. For more information, see [Loading mechanisms for input form screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/loading-mechanisms.md).

-   **retain\_parent\_parameter\_screen **: When enabled for write-back actions in input form screens, the button keeps the user on the current input form instead of opening a new one. This attribute is required when configuring input form actions. For more information, see [Input form actions in an input form screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/input-form-screen-input-actions.md).
-   **consolidate\_consecutive\_outbox\_items **: When enabled for write-back buttons in offline mode, the attribute combines multiple consecutive saves of the same action on the same record \(same action, record, table, and form\) into a single outbox item instead of queuing each save separately. This setting controls offline outbox consolidation behavior. The default value is false.

</table>    **Note:** While all the options in the **Action completion** area of the form can be set, their actions might overlap with each other. Make sure that you test the settings so the results produce the outcomes that you expect.

5.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

After you create an action function, you must associate it with a specific location in the mobile app. You can add an action function to a top menu, a swipe action, or to a specific field. For more information on associating the action function to a location, see [Associate a function with a location in the app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-button-instances.md).
