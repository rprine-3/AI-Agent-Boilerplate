# Launcher screen UI sections

UI sections contain the screens, analytics previews, and record information on your launcher screens.

## UI sections

Use UI sections to display screens and record information on your launcher screens. UI sections serve as containers for different types of data displayed within your launcher screens.

Types of UI sections include:

<table id="table_zcp_23n_rhb"><tbody><tr><td>

\[Omitted image "chart-section-1.png"\] Alt text: Analytics section

</td><td>

An analytics section helps you to visualize your data. Use the two sub-types, **Chart** and **Single Score** UI sections to display a preview of a single score report, time series report, or **Performance Analytics** widget.

 **Chart** and **Single Score** previews are displayed as cards. When a user taps a chart, they open the analytics screen which displays more information on the report or widget.

 For information on configuring analytics sections see [Configure an analytics UI section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-ui-section-config-reports.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[Omitted image "campaigns-3-diff-egs.png"\] Alt text: Content UI Section displaying video, text, and image cards in a carousel format

</td><td>

Use a **Content** section to display a combination of video, image, and text cards in a carousel format, at the top of your screen. Users can interact with the promotional displays by either viewing videos, being redirected to web pages, or navigating to defined areas on their mobile device.For more information on mobile campaign configuration, see [Configure a content UI section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/configure-content-ui-section.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[Omitted image "item-section-1.png"\] Alt text: Record section

</td><td>

Use a **Record** section to display record information on a card. Records from the selected list screen are displayed as cards. The fields on the cards can be configured. Users tap on an item to see additional record information in a separate record screen. Users can also tap an item to take actions.

 Use the record section for records which require the user’s attention, such as high priority or overdue items, and unassigned tasks. Record sections can also be used to display employee records. Choose from a **Horizontal** or **Vertical** layout when creating your record section.

 -   **Horizontal layout**

Use horizontal record sections to display a set number of items you want the user to see. Users can scroll through cards horizontally, and can select **See All** to view the complete list in another screen.

-   **Vertical layout**

Use vertical sections when you have more room and want to display a set number of records within the screen. Vertical record sections are good for records like critical tasks where you want the user to see details as soon as they land on the page


 For details on creating record sections, see [Configure record sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-ui-section-config-item.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[Omitted image "media-section-1.png"\] Alt text: Media UI section

</td><td>

Use **Media** sections to display a single image or video on your launcher screen. Users can tap a media section to navigate to another screen or to navigate to a static URL.

 Media sections can display a single line header, and up to two lines of additional text. You can define a navigation function and the text to appear on the navigation button.

 Media sections are also a way to add a static company logo to the top of your launcher screen.

 For information on configuring media sections see [Configure a media UI section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-ui-section-config-media.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[Omitted image "navig-ui-alp-sections.png"\] Alt text: Navigation section pointing to a screen and launcher screens

</td><td>

Use **Icon** sections to display screens, launcher screens, and functions using the icon defined for each. Users can tap on an icon to list, maps, reports, calendars, or any other screen or launcher screen type. You can select a **Horizontal** or **Vertical** layout for your icons. -   **Horizontal layout**

Use this section type to display many screens or launcher screens in one horizontal view. Limit the name character count to 20 or fewer characters so it does not get cut off. Use this section type to group related screen or launcher screens that do not require counts.

-   **Vertical layout**

When displayed vertically, you can use the **Display feed count** option to display a count of records within each screen. Use this type for actionable items such as approvals or requests. For details on creating navigation sections, see
