# Configure user type icons

Configure user icons that can be used to launch the user profile of the logged in user in mobile apps.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can configure an icon within the work flow of configuring a screen in Mobile App Builder or you can configure an icon by selecting the **Cards &amp; icons** category from the menu. This procedure uses the **Cards &amp; icons** category.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Cards &amp; icons** category, and then select **New**.

4.  In the Create a card or icon dialog box, select **Icon**, and then select **Continue**.

5.  In the Icon form, enter a **Name** for the icon.

    Make sure you choose a name that makes it easy to identify the icon.

6.  From the Type drop-down list, select **User**.

7.  In the Set appearance section, enter the following information in the **Style** and **Value** fields to configure the user icon.

    |Style|Value|
