# Configure input form sections

Input form sections are reusable components consisting of grouped inputs. You can associate these sections with any number of input form pages.

## Before you begin

You must create an input form screen that contains inputs before you create sections. For information about creating an input form screen and inputs, see [Configure an input form screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-screen-config.md) and [Configure input form screen inputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/param-screen-config-inputs.md).

    |Label|The display name for your input form section.|
    |Active|Sets whether the section displays.|
    |**Settings**|
    |Order|Enter a number to define the placement order of this section within the page.|

7.  In the Input form section area, **Choose** an existing input form section or select **New** to create an input form section.

    The Input Form Section page appears.

8.  Complete the following fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|The name of your section.|
    |Inputs|The inputs that appear in your section. Select an existing input or select **New** to create an input.|
    |Variables|The information that is collected automatically or that is defined by default for the input.|

9.  Select **Save**.

10. Map inputs to designated sections.

    1.  Select the input form screen where you want to use the section you configured.

        The input form screen appears.

    2.  Scroll down to the Inputs section and select the input you want to map to a section.

    3.  In the Input form, scroll down to the Input placement section, and make sure that the Input form screen you want to use is selected.

## What to do next

There is an option that enables you to control the visibility of an entire section if it contains only descriptive elements and no input fields.

1.  In the web-based UI go to **All** and enter `sys_sg_section_attribute`.
2.  Select **New** and in the **Name** field add the attribute name `HideIfDescriptiveOnly`.
3.  In the **Value** field enter the either true or false. If left blank the default value is false and the descriptive element is shown even if there isn't an input value field.
4.  Select **Save**.
