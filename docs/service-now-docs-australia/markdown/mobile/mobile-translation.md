# Create translation records for mobile

Create records on the Translated Name / Field table to translate elements of your mobile app that aren't natively translated.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Use these steps to add translations for your mobile device that aren't already translated by your mobile device's native translation settings. To see which elements must be manually translated, switch your mobile device's native language to the language you're working on. Then view your mobile apps to see which values remain in English. To translate the remaining values, follow the procedural steps in the next section.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Localization** &gt; **Translated Name / Fields**

2.  Select **New** to create a Translated Name / Fields record.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_tfs_qpw_mhc"><thead><tr><th>
