## About this task

This task is an example of embedding a seismic page, which contains the playbook experience, within a mobile app by using Mobile App Bridge.

Configure mobile web screens to leverage the ServiceNow platform playbook feature on mobile devices. A playbook guides technicians when troubleshooting issues or helps them learn to install new parts. For more information about the playbook feature, see .

Configuring seismic pages with Mobile App Bridge involves the following tools and tasks:

-   Create a Now Experience Framework page in  by leveraging the Mobile App Bridge.
-   Create a mobile web screen using Mobile App Builder \(MAB\).
-   Add the Now Experience Framework page to mobile devices by specifying the page URL in the **URL** field of the MAB mobile web screen configuration form.

For detailed information about adding a playbook to Mobile App Bridge so that you can configure a playbook on mobile devices on the ServiceNow Mobile Platform, see [Embed a playbook in ServiceNow® mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/embed-playbook-mobile.md).
