# Configure the navigation bar and navigation tabs

Configure the navigation bar that appears at the bottom of the mobile app. Use navigation bar tabs to navigate to screens, launcher screens, as well as saved records, settings, and notifications pages.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Add a navigation bar to your mobile app, and add various types of navigation tabs relevant to your users’ requirements. You can either choose preconfigured tabs or create a tab based on an existing template. There are slightly different configurations for the launcher screen and screen tabs in comparison to the saved, notifications, and the settings tabs.

Screen and launcher screen navigation tabs can also contain a badge count. This badge is a number that displays next to the navigation tab, according to defined conditions. For example, the badge count can display information like the number of records in a list, or records in a record section.

The following is a short summary of each of the navigation tab types:

-   Launcher: Use this option to navigate to a launcher screen.
-   Screen: Use this option to navigate to a screen that shows record data or UI sections.
-   Saved: This option opens a page showing the user’s saved records.
-   Notifications: This option opens the Notifications page showing user-related notifications within the mobile app experience.
-   Settings: This option opens the Settings page where the user controls their mobile experience.

**Note:** Your navigation bar should only contain one of each of the following tab types, saved, notifications, and settings tabs. For more information, see the General guidelines for the navigation bar section in the topic [Navigation bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-tab-bar.md).
