# Configure the blur app option to improve security

As a security feature, administrators can configure the mobile app to blur or appear blackened, depending on the operating system, when not in focus on a mobile device. When you double-click the home button on your mobile device to close apps or navigate back to where you left off, the ServiceNow app appears blurred or blackened.
