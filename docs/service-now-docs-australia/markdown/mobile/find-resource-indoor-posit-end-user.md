# Find resources with indoor positioning

When indoor positioning is enabled on your device, you can get step-by-step interactive directions to resources in a building that has been mapped for this feature.

## Before you begin

Your ServiceNow instance admin must configure indoor positioning before you can enable it on your device.

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Open your ServiceNow mobile app on your device.

2.  Search for a resource.

    For example, you can search for a person, a conference room, or other indoor resource.

3.  When you’ve located the resource, select **Get directions**.

    The map shows where the person or resource is on the map. The mobile app prompts for whether the device can use your location.

4.  Respond to the request to use your location.

    Choose from the following options.

    |Location option|Description|
    |---------------|-----------|
    |Allow Once|Your location appears on the map with an icon \(\[Omitted image "blue-dot-icon.png"\] Alt text: Blue dot indicating user's position on the indoor wayfinding map\).
