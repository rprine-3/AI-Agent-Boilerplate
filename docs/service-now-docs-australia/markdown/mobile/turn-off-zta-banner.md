# Turn off the Zero Trust Access banner on mobile apps

Learn how to turn off the banner on mobile app screens where Zero Trust Access \(ZTA\) is enabled.

## Before you begin

Role required: Security admin

## About this task

When ZTA is enabled on your ServiceNow instance, end users see a banner at the top of their mobile app screen each time the network connection state changes. For example, when the end user logs in or when the mobile access token expires, and the instance requests a refreshed token. This can occur several times due to internal app management and end users see this banner every time. While this informs the user when their network connection changes, it can make it difficult to use the mobile app.

To enhance usability of the mobile app, admins can set the **disableZTABanner** mobile property to on the instance. When this property is set to `True`, display of the banner is suppressed on mobile app screens.

**Important:** By default, this mobile property isn’t set and produces the same behavior as setting the property to `False` where the ZTA banner displays for all connection`True` state changes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_sg\_properties.list**.

    The Mobile Properties list appears.

2.  In the Mobile Properties list, select **New**.

    The Mobile Properties form appears.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
