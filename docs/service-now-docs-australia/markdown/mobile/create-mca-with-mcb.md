## About this task

When creating mobile cards, you may want to add buttons to enable your users to perform various actions. Usually the process of configuring card actions occurs when creating a card template within the Mobile Card Builder. This topic details the process of configuring card actions as a standalone procedure.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile Card Builder**.

2.  In the Mobile Card Builder menu, select **Templates**.

3.  Select the card template where you want to add a card action and select **Open**, or create a new card template using the **Create blank template** button.

4.  Select a plus icon \[Omitted image "mcb-plus-icon.png"\] Alt text: Plus icon. to select a new component to add to your mobile card.

    \[Omitted image "mcb-new-component-2.png"\] Alt text: Adding a component in card builder.

5.  Select **Button** from the displayed components.

    The Component configuration menu displays options related to button configuration.

6.  Select the display options to define the appearance of your buttons.

    Button configuration options include:

    -   The height and width of a button
    -   The addition of a border and rounded edges
    -   The size of margins to provide padding between other components
7.  Select the format and label properties of the button.

    The available options are:

    -   Label - A button with text only, for example an OK button. Enter the text required for the button.
    -   Icon - A button with an icon only, for example a trash icon \(\[Omitted image "trash-mcb.png"\] Alt text: Trash icon for card action.\) to denote a delete button. Select an icon from the menu.
    -   Label and Icon - A button with text and an icon, for example an edit button \(\[Omitted image "edit-mcb.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon with text and image.\). Enter the desired text and select the image from the fields.
8.  Select if you want the button to contain a single action or multiple actions.

    The actions listed in the functions menu come from the Function \[sys\_sg\_button\] table.

    -   Single - Search in the function menu to allocate a single action to a button.
    -   Multi - Creates a single button which, when tapped, reveals additional card actions in a menu at the bottom of the screen. Select **Add Menu Item** and from the displayed menu add as many card actions as required. Select **Finish** after you configure each card action.

        Drag the order icon \(\[Omitted image "order-mcb.png"\] Alt text: Order icon.\) to change the order of the card actions. You can also edit and delete the card actions at any point.
