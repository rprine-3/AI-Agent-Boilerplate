# Enable enhanced barcode scanning

Add the **EnableCameraFocusEnhancement** and the **EnableMaxCameraResolution** mobile properties to enhance barcode scanning for Android devices.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Important:**

To scan barcodes as accurately as possible, make sure that you:

-   Scan in a well-lit environment. Both Android and iOS mobile devices have flashlight apps that you can use to make sure your device's camera has adequate light to scan barcodes accurately.
-   Keep the device camera in a steady position while scanning. If the camera is shaking, barcode scans will become blurred and inaccurate.

You can enable enhanced barcode scanning on your instance for Android devices by adding the following mobile properties:
