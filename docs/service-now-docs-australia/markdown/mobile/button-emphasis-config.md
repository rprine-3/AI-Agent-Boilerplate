# Configure button emphasis according to function location

Configure button emphasis in different locations within your mobile app to help users identify the type of functions they can activate.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Important:** Use legacy mobile theming on Tokyo and earlier ServiceNow® instances. For Utah and later releases, see [Next Experience theming for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/explore-ne-theming.md).

## About this task

Button emphasis configuration is performed in web-based UI. For more information, see [Associate a function with a location in the app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-studio-button-instances.md). Starting from San Diego additional colors are included in the release, and button emphasis is supported in additional locations. These colors are configured in the web-based UI for the listed screen locations.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**.

2.  In the filter navigator, enter `sys_sg_button_instance.list`, to open the Function instances table.

3.  Select either a new or existing record.

4.  Select a button emphasis for the chosen function location type.
