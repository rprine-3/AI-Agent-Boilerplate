# Publish mobile apps with custom branding

The ServiceNow® Mobile Publishing application enables you to publish secure and branded mobile applications. These mobile apps use your unique company identity and management method.

ServiceNow offers the following ways to customize your mobile apps:

-   Branding: Determines what users see before they reach the login screen.
-   Theming: Determines what users see after they log in.

Mobile Publishing enables you to brand your mobile apps. You can use Mobile Publishing to create a visually distinct version of ServiceNow mobile apps with custom branding that reflects your unique company identity. Configure each of your mobile apps with a unique name, splash screen, icon, Mobile Device Management \(MDM\) vendor, and colors.

For information about using theming to further customize your apps, see:

-   [Next Experience theming for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/explore-ne-theming.md)
-   [Legacy mobile theming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-themes.md)

In addition to branding and theming your mobile apps, you can also customize app behavior to make them more efficient for your end-users to use. For example, you can request a custom branded mobile app and configure an auto-populated URL so your end-users don't need to type the instance URL during login. This can be configured in the **Login management** section of the **Request a new app** form. For more information, see the [Request, test, and publish a branded mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/request-test-pub-branded-mob-app.md) section that contains instructions for requesting custom branded apps for both the iOS and the Android platforms.

For more information about the considerations for using Mobile Publishing and configuring it, see [Mobile Publishing resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-publishing-resources.md).

**Note:** Mobile Publishing is supported on both production and sub-production ServiceNow instances.

The ServiceNow publishing program complies with the suggested practices from Google and Apple for branded app releases. The program gives you a guided path to achieve your branding goals.

## Licensing

Mobile Publishing is a paid plugin. It is included in the Pro, Enterprise, and App Engine subscription levels \(SKU's\) of ServiceNow. Alternatively, you can purchase the plugin on the ServiceNow Store and add it to your ServiceNow subscription. Navigate to the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home), log in with your credentials, and then search for `mobile publishing`.

## Custom-type mobile apps
