# Configure a slider option for a number input

Create a slider option for a number input on your input form screen. Sliders help users visualize the input range and reduce errors by limiting choices to defined minimum and maximum values.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

This task assumes that you already have the basis of an input form screen configured before adding the slider option for a number input. For more information, see [Configure an input form screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-screen-config.md).

## About this task

Creating a slider render type is more involved than for the other render types: integer, line, percentage. The configuration involves the creation of multiple input attributes, some are required and others are optional. To create a slider option for a number input, you must have at least the following configurations:

-   RenderType is Slider
-   Min input attribute
-   Max input attribute
-   StepSize input attribute

You can add additional number input attributes to the ones listed. For a complete list, check the Number inputs section in [Input form screen attributes for inputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/parameter-screen-var-attr.md).

To view how different types of sliders display, see [Slider types and their input attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/slider-input-attributes.md).

5.  Scroll down to the Inputs section of the form and then either select an input to modify it or select  **New**  to create an input.

    The Input form appears. For more information about configuring inputs, see [Configure input form screen inputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/param-screen-config-inputs.md).

6.  In the **Input type** field within the **Settings** area, select **Number**.

7.  Complete any other fields as required and select **Save**.

8.  Select **RenderType** from the **Name** field, select **Slider** from the **Value** field, then select **Save**.

9.  Select the Input record from the navigation tree, then select **New** in the Input attributes area.

10. From the **Name** field, select **Min** and enter the lowest value to be displayed at the start of your slider, then select **Save**.

11. Select the Input record from the navigation tree, then select **New** in the Input attributes area.

12. From the **Name** field, select **Max** and enter the highest value to be displayed at the end of your slider, then select **Save**.

13. Select the Input record from the navigation tree, then select **New** in the Input attributes area.

14. From the **Name** field, select **StepSize** and enter a number that represents each incremental number on the slider, then select **Save**.

    **Note:** The steps must be a number divisible between the max and min size input attributes.
