# Configure chart views for accessibility

Give users the option to change chart views from color segments to black and white patterns. This option can be used for accessibility purposes.

## Before you begin

## About this task

To grant users the option to view charts in black and white patterns or colored segments, for all chart types.

## Procedure

1.  Type `sys_properties.list` in the Filter Navigator.

2.  Click **New**, and then enter the following values:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|**glide.sg.chart\_accessibility.enabled**|
    |Type|true \| false|
    |Value|true|


## Result

Users can select the display option best suited for their requirements.
