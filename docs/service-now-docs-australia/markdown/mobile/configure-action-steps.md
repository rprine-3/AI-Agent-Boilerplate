# Configure action steps within an action item

For an action item to perform multiple processes you must define separate action steps.

## Before you begin

To add action steps to an action item, the action item **Type** field must be **MultiStep**.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use action steps when you must perform multiple actions after an action item is executed. You can also use action steps when an action must be performed in offline mode. For more information about working in offline mode, see [Configure data items in offline mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/config-offline-data-item.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** and in the filter enter `sys_sg_write_back_action_step.list`

2.  From the Actions steps form, select **New**.

3.  In the Action step new record form, complete the fields as needed.

<table id="table_arb_2lx_ztb"><thead><tr><th>

Whether you want a separate set of query conditions for the action step. If selected, the **Query conditions** field is inactive. For update or delete actions, you must define the record you are updating or deleting by providing a sys\_id. Marking **Use current record as condition** as true allows you to update or delete actions without creating a parameter.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execution script

</td><td>

The script executed by the action. This field only appears if you select **Script** in the **Type** field.

 To use an input from an input form screen in your scripts, use `parm_input.<InputName>`
