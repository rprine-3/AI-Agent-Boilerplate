# Configure mobile access for IP-restricted networks

Configure mobile access to ServiceNow instances that use adaptive authentication, which restricts access outside a defined IP address range.

## Before you begin

To configure mobile access for IP-restricted networks, adaptive authentication must be activated on your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Activate adaptive authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/adaptive-authentication-plugin.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

For more information about adaptive authentication, see [Adaptive authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/adaptive-authentication.md), which describes this policy framework that is used to enforce authentication controls.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_properties.list**.

2.  Make sure that the application scope is set to **Global** by selecting the globe icon \(\[Omitted image "globe-icon.png"\] Alt text: Globe UI icon.\) in the upper right.

    If the application scope is not set to **Global**, then select the application scope setting and select **Global** from the list.

3.  Search for and make sure that the values for the following properties are set to `true`.

    -   **glide.authenticate.auth.policy.enabled**
    -   **glide.authenticate.preauth.allow.trusted.device**
    This step verifies that an adaptive authentication policy is activated on your ServiceNow instance.

4.  Search for the [adaptive authentication mobile system property names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/adapt-auth-mob-apps-sys-props.md).

    To edit the values for a property, double-click its name and fill in the fields in the System Property New record form as needed. If you can't find a property, select **New** to add it.

    Enter information on the form as needed.
