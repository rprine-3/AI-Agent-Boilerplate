# Configure a custom filter

Manually create a filter experience for your users. Custom filters can include fields that are not in the list pattern.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

This procedure can be used to configure a custom filter for list screens and map screens. The following information applies to list screens, but the same settings are available to configure custom filters for map screens in Mobile App Builder as well.

For information about configuring map screens, see [Configure a map screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-configure-map-screen.md).

**Note:** By default, there are filters that are based on the fields which are displayed in mobile views.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Screens** category and select the list screen where you want to configure a custom filter.

4.  In the List Screen form, scroll down to the **Screen Settings** section and verify that the **Hide filters** toggle is turned off.

    **Note:**

    -   Turning off the **Hide filters** toggle makes sure that filters are visible in your app.
    -   Enabling filters also enables sorting functionality for list and map screens.
5.  In the List Screen form, scroll down to the **Custom filter** section and select **New**.

6.  In the Filter form, complete the fields as needed.

</table>7.  In the Filter Category form, create filter categories to help users filter records by specific list streams by completing the fields as needed.

8.  In the Filter Condition form, complete the following fields as needed to create filter conditions to help users filter information on a screen after they set their preferred filtering criteria.

    **Note:** At least one filter condition or one item sorting must be defined for the custom filter to work.

<table id="table_akj_lgv_lwb"><thead><tr><th>

Condition type

</td><td>

**Condition type** sets the data type of the database field on which you want to filter. **Condition type** requires two attributes:

 -   Operator attributes, which determine how the filter operates on the data.
-   Display Type attributes, which determine how the data that is returned by the Operator attribute gets displayed in your mobile app.
 Select one of the Condition types from the drop-down list. See [Filter condition attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/filter-condition-attributes.md) where the default Operator and Display Type attributes are listed for each Condition type. The default values are marked with an asterisk \(\*\).

 **Note:** If your requirements are satisfied with the default attributes and values, then you don't need to configure attributes any further. Selecting the **Condition type** is all you need to do. If you need to customize your filtering options, you can configure them in Step 10 below.
