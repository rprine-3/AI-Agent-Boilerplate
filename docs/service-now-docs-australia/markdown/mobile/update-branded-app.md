# Update a branded app

Request and publish an update to a ServiceNow® mobile app that has been branded with your unique company identity. Updates can only be requested for approved, completed builds of branded apps.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Mobile Publishing enables you to request an updated version of your branded iOS or Android app that you can distribute publicly or privately. You can request an update for the following branded app options:

-   New version of the ServiceNow mobile app.
-   Requester contact information such as first name, family name, and email address.
-   Change whether you want to use your custom End-User License Agreement \(EULA\) and privacy policy or the default ServiceNow EULA and privacy policy.
-   For iOS apps that use private distribution, you can add or delete testers for [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) notifications.

**Important:** Only the above information can be changed on completed builds of branded apps. If you must change any other options, you must request a new branded app with Mobile Publishing.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Mobile Branding** &gt; **Manage Mobile Publishing Apps**.

2.  In **Your recent app requests** section of the page, select the completed branded mobile app build that you want to update.

3.  On the **Request details** page for the branded mobile app, select **Duplicate**.

    The **Review and submit** page appears for the branded mobile app.

4.  On the Review and submit form, fill in the following fields to update the app.

 **Note:**

-   This functionality can only be edited when you submit a new branded app request or when you update a branded app.
-   If you’re updating an iOS branded app, you must download the Apple App Site Association \(AASA\) JSON file after you submit this request and install the file on all instances in the URL list.

Pre-populate instance

</td><td>

Turn on this toggle to build an instance URL into your branded app so end-users don't need to enter the instance URL during login. Enter a default app instance URL that is secure and uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure \(`https://`\).

 **Note:**

-   This instance URL can only be added when you submit a new branded app request or when you update a branded app.
-   Don’t select this option if you’re using AppConfig to preconfigure a default instance URL through an EMM suite or an embedded MAM SDK app. For more information, see [AppConfig for Mobile Apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/appconfig.md).

## Result

After you complete the request form and submit it, your ServiceNow instance builds the updated branded app. When it completes, you receive an email notification about the status of the build. A link is provided from where you can download the app file.

**Note:**

-   You can only submit one build at a time. You can’t submit another build until the current build is canceled, failed, or completed.
-   Check the following table for estimated times to build your updated branded app.

    |App operating system|Public distribution|Private distribution|
    |--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
    |iOS|1 week approximately|2–4 weeks \*|
    |Android|1 week or less|1 week or less|

    \* Privately distributed iOS apps must be inspected by Apple's human reviewers and can take 2–4 weeks until they’re ready for testing. If you are on a tight timeline, submit your privately distributed Android app first so that you can test it while you submit and wait for the iOS app build to complete

-   ServiceNow can't expedite delivery timelines because they’re determined by Apple or Google.
