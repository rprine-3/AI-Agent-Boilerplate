# Storing media locally when taken from ServiceNow mobile apps

Provide users with the option to save and retrieve pictures and videos taken with the camera on their mobile app, onto their device. By default, these images are saved for 24 hours on the phone’s local storage. You can set the storage time to be from 1 to 168 hours \(1 week\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Users must have the passcode feature enabled on their device. A passcode is a security measure to protect your users’ phone and its data.

## About this task

Media captured using the camera within a ServiceNow mobile app may not upload onto the app successfully. Instead of losing this data, the parameter  **storeFailedAttachmentsLocally ** enables you to reattempt uploading media when an initial upload fails. The parameter **failedAttachmentsRetentionTime** defines for how long the media is saved on your local device.

By default, these images and videos are saved for 24 hours on the phone’s local storage. You can set the storage time to be from 1 to168 hours \(1 week\).
