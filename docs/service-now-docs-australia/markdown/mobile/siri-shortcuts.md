# Siri shortcuts

Configure Siri shortcuts to give your users quick access to common app functions app using their iOS devices.

By default, your iOS users can use the following pre-configured shortcuts in the Now Mobile app:

-   Open a chat window \(see below note\)
-   Browser items and services
-   Open my tasks
-   Open my requests
-   Search in the ServiceNow instance \(see below note\)

**Note:**

-   To open a chat window in the Mobile Agent app, users can access Agent Chat if the following conditions are met:
    -   The Agent Chat plugin \(com.glide.interaction.awa\) must be installed on your instance. For details on configuration, see .
    -   The mobile app must have a chat launcher quick action enabled. For details on enabling chat launcher, see [Enable Live Agent in the Now Mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/va-in-me.md).
-   To search in the ServiceNow instance, the following conditions must be met:
    -   The instance must have global search set up. For details on configuration, see [Global search for mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-search-config.md).
    -   The global search must be configured on the first tab in the mobile app.
