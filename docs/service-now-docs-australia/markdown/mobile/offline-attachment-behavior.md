# Attachment behavior in offline mode

Learn about the size and type limits applied to attachments in the offline cache.

Attachments can be added to input forms, record screens, activity streams, and details views. Applying size and type limits to attachments keep the offline cache small, preventing unnecessary or oversized files from overloading the device. The total storage allocated for attachments on a user's device is limited to 2,048 MB.

The following system properties are available when managing attachments in offline mode.

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|glide.sg.ofﬂine.attachment.allowed\_content\_types|A comma-separated list of allowed ﬁle types for attachments in ofﬂine mode.|
|glide.sg.ofﬂine.attachment.max\_size|Set the Maximum size per downloaded attachment.|
|glide.sg.ofﬂine.attachment.max\_total\_bytes|Total attachment storage limit.|
