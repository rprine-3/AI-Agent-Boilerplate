# Mobile push notification components

Configure mobile push notifications to target a specific screen in one of the ServiceNow Mobile Platform applications.

This configuration determines the structure of the notification, the text the user receives, who should receive the message, and what triggers the delivery of a notification. Users tap the notification and the associated deep link then directs the user to the desired screen.

1.  Push notification message content
2.  Push notification message

Configure each component of the push notification because each component is dependent on the other. For example, you must configure push notification content to create a push notification message. Likewise, a push notification event requires a push notification message.

The push notification message content contains the location users are directed to when they tap on the notification, as well as the appearance and layout of the notification.

 For more information on content configuration, see [Configure push notification message content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/config-push-notification-message-content.md).

 Optionally, you can display up to three additional fields in a notification. These fields are visible within the **Notifications** navigation bar tab in a mobile app.

 **Note:**

Mobile UI styles are available for these additional fields. For more information around styling, see [Mobile UI styles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-ui-styles.md).
