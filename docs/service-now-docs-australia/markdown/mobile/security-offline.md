# Security and compliance in offline mode

Learn how to manage offline mode access and determine which users can use it, helping to secure sensitive data.

Offline mode stores data locally on the device. Configure offline rules to align data access with your security requirements. Use the glide.sg.offline.roles system property to restrict offline access to users who require it, limiting the amount of sensitive data stored on devices in the field.

The following system properties are available when managing attachments in offline mode:

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|glide.sg.ofﬂine.roles|A comma-separated list of role names that are allowed to work in ofﬂine mode.|
|glide.sg.ofﬂine.expiration|Defines how long an offline cache remains valid on the device.|

For more information on these and other related offline system properties, see [System properties in offline mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-system-properties.md).
