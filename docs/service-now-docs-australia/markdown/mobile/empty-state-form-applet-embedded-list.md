# Configure an empty state for an embedded list in a record screen

Configure an empty state to display on empty record screens to provide information to further direct users. The display of an empty state for an embedded list in a record screen takes priority over an empty state defined for a list screen.

## Before you begin

You should already have an empty state configured for record screens that do not contain any data. For more information, see [Configure an empty state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/empty-state-default.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the web-based UI, enter `sys_sg_item_stream_segment.list` in the filter navigator.

2.  Select a list stream screen segment to display the empty state.

3.  In the **Empty State** field, select an empty state to associate with the list stream screen segment.

4.  Right-click in the header and select **Save**.
