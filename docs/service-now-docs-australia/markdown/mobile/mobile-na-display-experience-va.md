# Mobile Now Assist display experience for Virtual Agent

Choose how you want Now Assist to display in your mobile app.

**Note:** To configure Now Assist in Native Mobile Virtual Agent, you must upgrade your mobile client to 19.3.0+.

## Standard chat

Configure the standard chat experience for Now Assist in Virtual Agent to enable you to access Now Assist from a Now Assist icon on your mobile app home page. Tapping the icon opens a Now Assist chat that provides synthesized generated responses to your questions. The generated responses display in-line citations to show where information was gathered from, as well as a list of any promoted actions you can take in response to the request. Only the first six lines of the response are shown, with the remaining lines accessible under the **Read More** button. For more information, see .

In this example, asking Now Assist about booking travel provides a summary of the steps required to book a trip. It also offers the option to request a business travel support letter, request travel help, and to view more information about international travel.
