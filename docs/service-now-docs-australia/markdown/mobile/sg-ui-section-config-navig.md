## What to do next

After creating icon UI sections, you must associate the UI sections to a launcher screen so they're displayed. For more information, see [Add a UI section to the launcher screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/ui-section-to-launcher-screen.md).
