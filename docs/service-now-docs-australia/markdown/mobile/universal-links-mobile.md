# Universal linking for mobile

Mobile universal links enable you to drive users to specific screens within a mobile app, that they would not be able to access via the ServiceNow platform web experience.

Mobile universal linking is a method to redirect your users from using the ServiceNow platform web experience on their mobile device. Instead it promotes using the faster, more responsive, and location-specific ServiceNow Mobile Platform experience via mobile apps. Universal linking works by presenting the user with a web banner at the top of designated screens, while they work within a ServiceNow platform web experience. For the user to proceed, they must select **View** in the banner, where the following occurs:

-   If the user has already installed the required ServiceNow mobile app and is logged in to the instance - then the user is directed to a defined location within the specific mobile app.
-   If the user has already installed the required ServiceNow mobile app and is not logged in to the instance - then the user is required to log in to the instance and is then directed to a defined location within the specified mobile app.
-   If the user has not installed the required ServiceNow mobile app - they are directed to either the Apple Store or Google Play Store, and must download the ServiceNow app. Once the app is downloaded, the user must log in to the instance and is then directed to a defined location within the newly installed app.

After the user taps **View** in the banner, direct them to any record screen, form screen, or browser screen within a specified mobile app. For form and record screens, you can direct the user to a specific location based on a defined table.
