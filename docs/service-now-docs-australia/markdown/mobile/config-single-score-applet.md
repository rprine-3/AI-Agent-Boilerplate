# Create a chart screen for a data visualization

Configure a chart screen to give your users access to pre-configured mobile dashboard views for several types of data visualizations.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or delegated developer

You must have an existing data visualization to display on your screen. If you haven’t yet configured a data visualization, see the following documentation topics: [Platform Analytics overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md) and [Data visualizations in Platform Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center-data-visualizations.md).

In addition, you also need a mobile analytics preview contained within a mobile dashboard preview. For more information, see [Create a mobile analytics preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-mobile-dashboard-preview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select the **Screens** category, and then select **New**.

4.  Select the **Chart** option in the Create a screen page, and then select **Continue**.
