# Configure a card descriptive element for input form screens

Add a card descriptive element before an input ﬁeld, within an input form screen. This additional on-screen information provides a context to your users, enabling them to better understand what is required as they enter data into an input form.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Card descriptive elements are configured in the ServiceNow AI Platform, whereas image, text and rich text descriptive elements are configured in the Mobile App Builder. For the configuration of image, text, or rich text descriptive elements see, [Configure descriptive elements for input form screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/descriptive-elements-script.md).

Role required: admin

To use a mobile card within a descriptive element, a mobile card must be configured. For more information, see [Mobile Card Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-card-builder.md).

When using a preconfigured mobile card, consider the following:

-   If the card you select for the descriptive element contains a button, the button text is visible, but the button isn't enabled.
-   If the card you select for the descriptive element contains an image, the image doesn't display.
-   The card you use from the Card \[sys\_sg\_view\_config\] table must be set to **Active**, so that the text elements defined in the text slots display.

## About this task

<table id="table_sw1_f1b_cgc"><tbody><tr><td>

You can add card descriptive elements to input ﬁelds, sections that contain input ﬁelds, or input form sections without any inputs. Descriptive elements can be a selection of simple text, rich text, an image or a mobile card that precedes an input. This topic deals with the configuration of descriptive element of type card. For the configuration of image, text, or rich text descriptive elements see, [Configure descriptive elements for input form screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/descriptive-elements-script.md).
