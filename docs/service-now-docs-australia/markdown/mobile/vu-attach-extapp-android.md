# Control whether users can view attachments in external applications on Android devices

Set the **glide.sg.block\_mobile\_attachments\_external\_viewing** system property to true to prevent Android users from opening attachments in third-party applications.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

When **glide.sg.block\_mobile\_attachments\_external\_viewing** system property is set to `true`, all attachments that are supported to be opened in the internal native viewer are opened there so the user can't open the attachment in a third-party application.

**Note:** This system property only applies to Android devices and has no effect on iOS devices. The **glide.sg.block\_mobile\_attachments\_external\_viewing** system property is available to use on Android clients, version 19.5.1 and later.

The supported file types that can be opened in the internal, native viewer on the Android OS are:

-   Images
-   Videos
-   PDFs

When a user attempts to open an attachment that isn't supported, an error message displays. For example:

\[Omitted image "mobile-attachment-error.png"\] Alt text: mobile attachment error message

**Note:** The following supported file types can be opened in the internal, native viewer on iOS devices:

-   iWork and Microsoft Office documents
-   Images
-   Live photos
-   Text files
-   PDFs
-   Audio files
-   Video files

However, the **glide.sg.block\_mobile\_attachments\_external\_viewing** property has no effect on iOS devices.
