# Component recommendations with ServiceNow Otto

ServiceNow Otto® reduces manual work and saves you time by recommending components based on context like the current record name and configuration tree information when you’re configuring records.

**Note:** For mobile component recommendations to be enabled on your platform, your instance must be on Tokyo or later, and the instance must be licensed for Otto. Additionally, the instance must have ServiceNow Otto for AI Search licensed and installed.

Using Otto, Mobile App Builder displays recommended components that are relevant to the selected setting. Settings that have component recommendations available are marked with a Otto icon. If a setting doesn’t have any relevant recommendations available, the icon appears grayed-out and isn't selectable.

The following record types are compatible with component recommendations:

-   Card templates
-   Cards
-   Icon
-   Function
-   Data item
-   List stream

Component recommendations are suggested based on information such as the record's name and description, as well as a semantic search of existing records that are related to the current record type, such as list screen or function.

Selecting the Otto icon opens the Recommendations pop-up and lists the recommended components. You can select **Preview** to open a read-only preview of the selected component in a new tab, or select **Select** to add the component to your record. To see more than just the recommended components, you can select **View all records** to view all other available options.
