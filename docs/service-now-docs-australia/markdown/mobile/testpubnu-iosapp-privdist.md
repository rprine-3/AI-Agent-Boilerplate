# Test and publish a new branded iOS app for private distribution

Learn the next steps to test and publish a new branded iOS app for private distribution after you request it in Mobile Publishing.

## 1. Test the app

After the build successfully completes and your app is ready for testing:

1.  \(Optional\) If you use Microsoft Intune mobile application management \(MAM\), Microsoft requires that iOS apps be registered with Microsoft Entra ID before anyone can log into the iOS app. For private distribution, ServiceNow® handles app registration with Microsoft Entra ID after you give consent to allow the Mobile Publishing app to connect to your Microsoft tenant.

    For more information, see the following ServiceNow® mobile Knowledge Base articles:

    -   [KB1640759](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1640759)
    -   [KB1641110](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fkb%3Fid%3Dkb_article_view%26sys_kb_id%3D50a4ef5c47b98614c4e1a325126d4300)
2.  Navigate to the Request details page of Mobile Publishing by selecting **All** &gt; **Mobile Branding** &gt; **Manage Mobile Publishing Apps** &gt; **Your recent app requests**.
3.  Select the card for your mobile app build request. The Request details page appears.
4.  Your testers receive an email from Apple TestFlight with a link to test your branded app.

    **Note:** This email also contains the push certificate password that you must use to set up push notifications in the following section.

    Use TestFlight to check the following:

    -   App has the correct name, icon, splash screen, branding, and theming. For more information, see [Configuring Next Experience with Theme Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configuring-next-experience-with-theme-builder.md).
    -   App uses the default instance you specified for login if you selected the instance pre-fill option when requesting the branded app.
    -   EULA and privacy policy listed in the mobile app **Settings** tab under **Legal** link to the policies you specified.
    See [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) for information about using TestFlight.


## 2. Set up the app

After your Testflight testers have validated the branding and functionality of your app, you can set up your app for use. These configurations are optional.

1.  Set up push notifications by downloading the Apple push certificate \(`p12` file\) from your app's **Build History** and upload it to your app's push application record:
    1.  Access the Push Applications table on your instance by navigating to **All** &gt; **Push Application**.
    2.  Configure your push applications. For instructions, see [Configure push applications for iOS branded apps using certificate based authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/sg-push-setup-ios.md).

        **Note:** The push certificate password is sent in the email from ServiceNow with the subject of "Ready For Testing - ServiceNow Mobile Publishing App." This email is sent from "mobilepublishing@servicenow.com"

    3.  \(Optional\) Test your push notifications by using out-of-the-box configurations. For more information, see [KB0829093](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0829093).
2.  \(Optional\) Set up deep links and universal links for your app by downloading the universal links file \(AASA\) in the **Your app's info** tab under the **App info** section.
    -   See [KB1273622](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=3c08eadcdb556154fd8d2b69139619b3) for more information about deep links and universal links.
    -   See [KB0831613](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0831613) for information about how to upload your universal link AASA file.

## 3. Approve or reject the app

Once the status of your app is **Ready for testing**, you have 90 days to make sure the app meets your branding requirements:

-   **Reject** the app to edit the branding, app name, app type, or any third-party information. Use the **Duplicate** option to copy information over to a new app request after you have rejected the app.
-   **Approve** the build to move forward with publishing the app to your end users.

## 4. Customize your app's workflows

Use Mobile App Builder to customize your app. See [Mobile App Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mab-concept.md) for detailed information about how you can customize your branded app.

## 5. Publish and distribute your app

After you have tested your app, set it up, customized its workflows, and approved it, you are ready to publish your branded iOS app for private distribution.

Apple conducts a final review where your build status will show **Deployment in progress** after which ServiceNow automatically sends the app to your Apple Business Manager \(ABM\) account.

## 6. Keep your app updated

Update your app before you update your ServiceNow family version, or at least once per year to keep your push notifications working and to leverage the most up to date ServiceNow mobile features.
