# Set up offline mode for mobile apps

Setup offline mode for your mobile applications so that users can work without an internet connection.

## Before you begin

Role required: mobile\_admin, admin

## About this task

Decide which mobile apps support offline mode to set the foundation for the entire offline experience. The offline capability defined at the app level, whether for the Mobile Agent app, Now Mobile app, or a custom apps, determine whether that app can function without network connectivity. All screens and functions configured as offline within the app inherit this setting, ensuring a consistent experience across navigation tabs, layouts, and UI sections.

**Note:** Offline mode must be enabled at the app level for any screens or functions configured as offline to be available to users without network connectivity.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Mobile** &gt; **Mobile App Builder**.

    The Mobile App Builder opens in a new browser tab and displays the application scope selection screen.

2.  Search for the application scope you are working in and then select the name of the application scope.

    The Mobile App Builder categories home screen displays.

3.  Select **Mobile app configs**, and then select the mobile app record you wish to configure offline mode in.

4.  Under **Mobile push application**, select which app type the offline scheduled download should be associated with.
