When a requester completes the pre-chat survey, the user is transferred either to a live agent if Agent Chat is set as the fulfiller interface or a virtual agent if Virtual Agent is set as the fulfiller. The user's pre-chat responses are stored as context in the chat interaction record. Before entering into a chat conversation, the assigned agent can review the context of the issue.
