# Proactive triggers and Virtual Agent notifications in enhanced chat

Proactive triggers and Virtual Agent notifications can be selected and completed in a Virtual Agent conversation.

Proactive triggers and simple Virtual Agent notifications are displayed the same way on the portal as a pop-up rectangle box.

Proactive triggers and Virtual Agent notifications only display on the portal pages with the chat button and are unavailable in the full-page experience view. Selecting a proactive trigger redirects you to a new chat. If you switch to a new chat while another active chat is ongoing, a pop-up message on the chats icon \[Omitted image "nass-chats-icon.png"\] Alt text: Chats icon. appears: `Your previous chat was saved. You can revisit all of your past chats and continue ones that are still active.`For more information on Proactive Triggers, see [Exploring Proactive Triggers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/product-support-for-technology/proactive-triggers.md).

Virtual Agent notifications display as an unread message and after you select the notification, the notification displays in the chat conversation. For Virtual Agent notifications, the **sn\_nowassist\_va.nass\_notification\_enabled** system property defaults to `true` in System Properties \(sys\_properties.list\). When **sn\_nowassist\_va.nass\_notification\_enabled** is set to `true`, Virtual Agent notifications appear on your portal home page. Selecting a notification redirects you to the conversation in a chat. Simple \(nonactionable\) notifications are displayed in the navigation area's **Chats** &gt; **Updates** section. Actionable notifications are displayed in the navigation area's **Chats** &gt; **Active** section. These actionable notifications create a chat with the notification title as the chat title. Selecting an actionable notification loads the conversation with the notification and associated actions. If you don't act and initiate a search, after viewing the search results, you can switch back to the notification that triggered the conversation by entering `Show notifications`. Entering `Show notifications` in a non-notification conversation results in a message indicating that there are no actionable notifications to view. To view your actionable notifications, it’s best to select the chats icon \(\[Omitted image "nass-chats-icon.png"\] Alt text: Chats icon.\). When you select a notification, the unread badge count on the chats icon \(\[Omitted image "nass-chats-icon.png"\] Alt text: Chats icon.\) goes down. After you have worked with the actionable notification, the notification moves to the **Chats** &gt; **Closed** section. For more information on configuring Notifications, see [Configuring Virtual Agent notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configuring-va-notifications.md) and [Configure a delivery channel for Virtual Agent notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configure-delivery-channel.md).
