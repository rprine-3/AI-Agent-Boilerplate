# Configure disambiguation

Configure the disambiguation property that controls when the assistant asks clarifying questions before responding to a ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent or ServiceNow Otto panel user request.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Disambiguation or clarification helps the assistant handle situations where the user's request is ambiguous. Rather than returning an overwhelming list of results, the assistant evaluates the request using a confidence scoring system and asks clarifying questions if needed.

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator field, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  In the selection fields, select **Name** from the drop-down list and enter `sn_aia.type_2_disamb` in the Search field.

3.  Configure the disambiguation property:

    If you have

    -   ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent or
    -   ServiceNow Otto panel standard chat or
    -   ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat
    then use this configuration:

<table id="table_qhd_z5b_gkc"><thead><tr><th>

</th><th>

</th><th>

Default value

</th><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_aia.type\_2\_disamb

</td><td>

off/low/high

</td><td>

off

</td><td>

-   off - clarification is disabled. The assistant responds directly to all queries without asking follow-up questions.
-   low - clarification is triggered for highly ambiguous queries.
-   high - clarification is triggered more frequently, covering a broader range of ambiguous queries.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    If you have ServiceNow Otto panel premium chat, then use this configuration:
