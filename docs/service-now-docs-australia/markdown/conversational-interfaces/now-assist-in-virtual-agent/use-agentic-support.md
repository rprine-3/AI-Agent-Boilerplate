# Use agentic support for a chat assistant

Let the assistant use AI agents and agentic orchestration. AI agent skills are prompt-based and can perform complex tasks. Admins can choose between agentic or standard search Q&amp;A modes.

## Before you begin

See [Create a chat assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/create-assistant.md).

Agentic orchestration is a design approach that helps AI systems coordinate and manage multiple components such as AI agents, knowledge bases, and Q&amp;A modules to accomplish complex multi-step tasks. These components work together, make real-time decisions, and adapt workflows based on context, ensuring responses use the most relevant skills and content.

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

Select the operational mode of an assistant. For more information about agentic AI, see [Explore AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-ai-agents.md).

## Procedure

1.  Use AI agent skills and agentic orchestration.

    The option to toggle on **Prioritize AI agents during skills discovery** only appears for existing customers that previously had the AI agent skill turned off for the assistant. Turning it on is an irreversible action. Agentic orchestration is a prerequisite to assign AI agents to an assistant.

2.  Select **Prioritize AI agents during skills discovery**.

    For new customers, when a new assistant is created, AI agent skills and orchestration are already turned on. However, you can opt out. When **Prioritize AI agents during skills discovery** is selected, all AI agents are prioritized over other assets for the assistant.

3.  Select **Save and continue.**
