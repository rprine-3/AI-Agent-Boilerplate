# Related dashboards page

The Related Dashboards page in Assistant analytics dashboard provides a centralized location to view and manage dashboards created in the Platform Analytics experience and shared across your organization.

## Overview of Related Dashboards page

The dashboard library in the Related Dashboards page includes dashboards that have been added by default or custom dashboards contributed by admins, making them available to users with appropriate permissions. You can pin favorite dashboards for quick access, search and filter the library, view, add, edit, and remove dashboards from the dashboard library.

To access the dashboard library, navigate to **All** &gt; **Assistant Analytics** and select Related Dashboards in the left navigation. The dashboard is accessible to the virtual\_agent\_admin and sn\_na\_analytics.ai\_engmt\_viewer roles.
