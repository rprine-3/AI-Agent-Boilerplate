# Sentiment page in Assistant analytics

Analyze user sentiment through customer satisfaction \(inferred CSAT\) score and CSAT factors such as empathy, frustration and confusion, transfers and escalations from conversations with assistants to improve the quality of user interactions.

The Sentiment dashboard page aggregates metrics related to user satisfaction, emotional feedback, empathy levels, and conversation outcomes. These metrics enable you to monitor inferred CSAT, track transfers and escalations, analyze empathy distribution, and review negative emotion trends. The insights from these metrics support targeted improvements to assistant behavior, response quality, and overall user experience.

The visualizations on the Sentiment page help you with the following.

-   Monitor user satisfaction and sentiment trends to identify strengths and areas for improvement in assistant interactions.
-   Track emotional feedback and empathy levels, enabling you to address frustration, confusion, and other negative emotions.
-   Analyze conversation outcomes and recommended next steps to guide assistant optimization and enhance resolution rates.

-   **Overall Sentiment**

    This area of the dashboard shows the overall average inferred CSAT score for analyzed conversations in the selected date range. The CSAT score is measured on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 represents the lowest satisfaction and 5 represents the highest. Use this metric to track changes in sentiment over time and evaluate the impact of assistant updates.

-   **Conversations Analyzed**

    This area of the dashboard shows the total number of conversations analyzed for sentiment in the selected date range. This number indicates the breadth of data supporting CSAT scores.

-   **High Empathy Rate**

    This area of the dashboard shows the percentage of conversations where high empathy was detected in assistant responses. It's calculated as \(\(Number of conversations with high empathy\)/\(Total number of conversations analyzed\)\) x 100. High empathy rate is an indication of the assistant's ability to respond with empathy to users queries.

    \[Omitted image "NAinVA-assistant-designer-analytics-sentiment-high-empathy.png"\] Alt text: High Empathy Rate.

-   **Conversations with Negative Emotions**

    This area of the dashboard shows the percentage of conversations where negative emotional feedback in terms of confusion or frustration was detected. It's calculated as \(\(Number of conversations with Frustration or Confusion\)/\(Total number of conversations analyzed\)\) x 100. This metric highlights the prevalence of negative experiences in assistant interactions. Use the metric to monitor and reduce negative emotion rates through targeted assistant improvements.

-   **Average Inferred CSAT Over Time**

    This area of the dashboard shows daily average of inferred CSAT scores in the selected data range. The CSAT scores are measured on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 represents the lowest satisfaction and 5 represents the highest. This chart highlights periods of improvement or decline in user sentiment.

-   **Average Inferred CSAT \(Virtual Agent\)**

    This area of the dashboard shows the average Inferred CSAT score for Virtual Agent interactions in the selected period. For conversations involving both Virtual Agent and live agent, this score reflects only the Virtual Agent CSAT. Scored on a 5-point scale, 0 = least satisfied and 5 = most satisfied. Use this metric to benchmark assistant performance and prioritize improvements where satisfaction is lowest.

For conversations involving both Virtual Agent and live agent, this score reflects only the live agent CSAT. Scored on a 5-point scale, 0 = least satisfied and 5 = most satisfied. Use this metric to benchmark assistant performance and prioritize improvements where satisfaction is lowest.

-   **Average Inferred CSAT \(Session\)**

    This area of the dashboard shows the average Inferred CSAT score for all interactions handled by Virtual Agent or a combination of Virtual Agent and live agent in the selected period. Scored on a 5-point scale, 0 = least satisfied and 5 = most satisfied.
