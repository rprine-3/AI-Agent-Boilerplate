# Exploring ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent

ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent uses large language models \(LLMs\) and generative AI skills to improve deflection rates and reduce the amount of time-consuming work that Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) topic discovery requires.

ServiceNow Otto capabilities bring generative AI to Virtual Agent. Using LLMs for topic discovery simplifies the amount of setup and configuration required for Virtual Agent. Topics that use keyword and Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) discovery often require months of development and the involvement of dedicated subject matter experts. Unusual issues or questions may lead a user to contact a live agent instead. You can continue to use your existing NLU topics and migrate them into new LLM topics using the topic migration feature within Assistant Designer Asset library. For more information on topic migration, see [Migrating NLU/keyword Virtual Agent topics to LLM topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/llm-topic-migration.md).

Use the guided setup to configure ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent in a few minutes. No expertise is necessary to launch the experience. For more information, see [Configuring assistants overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/configure-now-assist-va.md).

ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent is available through portals on the chat widget, the mobile app, and Microsoft Teams.

## Search in ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent

ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent enhance the user experience by combining AI Search with chat. These skills can increase issue resolution in Virtual Agent and reduce deflections to a live agent.

The following figure shows how the requester uses natural language rather than keywords in the chat. Now LLM Service determines the most likely option based on the requester's input and sends a synthesized response with possible action items. Queries can apply to both information searches and service catalog requests.

ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent shows users the best possible answer to a query, in the form of actionable options displayed along with the results. The bot may generate answers based on what it found, or return actionable options or links. Users have the option to see more results as needed.

## Service Catalog access

ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent also gives users access to available options in the Service Catalog. Users can request an item, such as a mobile phone. The user can then provide more information to refine the search. For example, they may refine their request to a blue 256-GB iPhone. They can even request a new item instead, all in the same conversation, and the generative AI creates its responses using natural language.

For full catalog functionality in the chat window, enable the generative AI experience for catalog item request submissions.
