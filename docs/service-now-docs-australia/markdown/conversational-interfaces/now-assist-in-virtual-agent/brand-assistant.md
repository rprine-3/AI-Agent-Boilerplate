See [Display your assistant on a portal, channel, or mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/display-assistant-portal-channel.md) for ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent assistants.

## About this task

If you haven’t selected a display experience, branding options aren’t shown.

-   For ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent, branding is available for standard chat, enhanced chat, and premium chat.
-   For ServiceNow Otto panel - Platform assistant, branding is available for premium chat but does not include chat menu items.
-   For the default Employee Slate assistant, branding is available for premium chat.
-   Branding is not available for ServiceNow Otto panel - Developer assistant.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Branding** section, select a default branding or an existing customized branding.

    **Note:** To create and edit additional settings, select the **Conversational interfaces console** link. For more information, see [Set up your Virtual Agent bot's branding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/ac-configure-chat-branding.md).

    If your display experience has standard or enhanced chat, the **Standard chat and enhanced chat** section is shown. The branding preview is for illustration purposes only.

    \[Omitted image "sno-branding-0826.png"\] Alt text: Preview pane of a standard chat assistant.

    Standard and enhanced chat use the same branding profile configuration. Your selection is reflected on your branding settings. For the same assistant, standard and enhanced chat share the same chat header, logo, and menu items. These elements are connected by default.

    The shared chat header logo is determined by the selected standard chat branding profile. You can't configure a separate chat header logo for each experience. Updating the chat header logo in one experience updates it for the other.

    To create and edit additional brand settings, navigate to **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Branding**.

    Learn more about customizing the look-and-feel of enhanced chat by navigating to [Theming for ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent enhanced and premium chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/theming-na-full-page-experience.md).

    If your display experience has premium chat, the **Premium chat** section is shown.

    \[Omitted image "sno-branding-premium-0826.png"\] Alt text: Choose a chat header, chat logo, and chat menu items for premium chat.

    1.  Choose your chat header and update the chat logo. The default chat header name is the name of the assistant. The size of the chat logo should be 144 x 144 pixels. Image file types include: .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, .jpeg, .ico, and .svg.
    2.  Add chat menu items to ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent assistant or the default Employee Slate assistant.

        **Note:** Chat menu items aren't available for ServiceNow Otto panel - Platform assistant.

        By default, chat, phone, and email are listed. Select the ellipsis to edit or remove a chat menu item.

        When editing the chat \(live agent\) option, you can select the check box so that users can see the estimated wait time for the next live agent.

        -   Link
        -   Text
        -   Chat: Only one chat type menu item is allowed per assistant.
        For each chat menu item type that you add, fill out the label and value fields. Decide whether you want to use the default icon or select a custom icon. Accepted file format for the icon is .svg only. Suggested size is 40 pixels x 40 pixels.

    **Note:** The preview pane changes depending on the tone and length selected. It is used for illustrative purposes only and doesn’t reflect the actual conversation that the LLM would generate.

3.  Select **Save and continue**.
