## Japanese language considerations

Japanese language support for voice assistants enables Japanese-speaking users to experience natural, culturally appropriate interactions with AI voice agents.

-   **Key considerations**

    Formality and honorifics: Voice assistants use appropriate levels of formal Japanese speech \(keigo\) correctly and consistently throughout interactions.

    User addressing: Voice agents address users according to Japanese cultural and linguistic norms.

    Natural expressions: Responses sound more natural to native speakers while remaining concise, avoiding overly literal translations.

    Support for Kanji, Kana, and Furigana in transcriptions.

-   **Alphanumeric content processing**

    To ensure accurate pronunciation in Japanese text-to-speech \(TTS\), alphanumeric expressions in tool call results are pre-processed as follows:

    **Alphabet classification**

    Alphabetic characters are classified to determine whether they should be:

    -   Read as a word \(for example, "OK" read as "オーケー"\)
    -   Read letter-by-letter \(for example, "ID" read as "アイディー"\)
    **Number classification**

    Numeric values are classified by type to ensure correct pronunciation:

    -   Dates and times
    -   Durations
    -   Currency amounts
    -   Measurements
    -   Record numbers
    -   Phone numbers
    -   Other numeric values
    **Kana transliteration**

    After classification, all alphanumeric expressions are transliterated into kana \(Japanese phonetic characters\) for accurate TTS pronunciation.
