# Define post-chat survey configurations

Control the post-chat questionnaire displayed to your requesters to gather feedback on their experience with live agents. You configure the post-chat surveys to be used for chat queues defined in Advanced Work Assignment.

## Before you begin

-   Activate the Agent Chat plugin \(com.glide.interaction.awa\) if Advanced Work Assignment is not already installed.
-   In AWA, [configure the chat service channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-service-channel.md) and the [work item queues](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-queue.md).
-   Determine the post-chat survey to be displayed to your requesters.
    -   Review the existing chat surveys available in the Assessment Metric Types \[asmt\_metric\_type\] table by navigating to **All** &gt; **Survey View** &gt; **View Surveys**. You can use a pre-built feedback survey, such as the survey for Virtual Agent feedback \(a pre-built Virtual Agent setup topic\).
    -   If you need different post-chat surveys, create them using Survey Designer. For details, see [Create chat surveys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/create-chat-surveys.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Queues**.

2.  Select the queue \(that uses the Chat service channel\) to which the post-chat survey configuration applies.

3.  Go to the **Post Chat Survey** related list, and then select **New**.

    If the Post Chat Survey list doesn't display, you may need to add it to the form.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

## Result

When a live agent ends the chat session, the post-chat survey \(configured for the chat queue\) is presented to the requester. When the requester submits the post-chat survey, the chat session ends for the requester. The Interaction Related Records list stores the post-survey chat results and creates a related record that links the assessment to the live agent \(fulfiller\).
