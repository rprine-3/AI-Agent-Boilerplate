</table>**Note:**

Simplify user administration by creating groups that contain all the roles necessary for specific personas rather than to individual users. You can then assign individual users to those groups. When users transition to new roles, you can then re-assign their group memberships, and avoid scenarios where users retain unexpected roles.

For details on the administration of users, groups, and roles, see [User Administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_UserAdministration.md).
