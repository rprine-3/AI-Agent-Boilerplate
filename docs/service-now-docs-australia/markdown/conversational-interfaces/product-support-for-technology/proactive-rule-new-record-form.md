What initiates the trigger

</td></tr><tr><td>

Trigger type

</td><td>

System API or web browsing URL for the type of trigger. Select the lookup list icon \(\[Omitted image "look-up-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon.\) to view your default choices.

 If enabled, your default system API choice is **Search Event**. This trigger type triggers an action when no search results are found on the Service Portal or Employee Service Center.

**Tip:** Ensure that your Proactive Trigger business rule \(**Proactive Trigger on Search**\), trigger type \(**Search Event**\), rule \(**Search - No Search Result**\), and action \(**No Search Result Message**\) have the **Active** option turned on so that this rule runs effectively. These parameters default to inactive.

 Your default web browsing URL choices are:

 -   **Catalog item**: Triggers an action based on the catalog item's reference fields.
-   **Knowledge**: Triggers an action based on the knowledge article's reference fields.
-   **Portal home**: Triggers an action based on the portal home page's reference fields.
-   **URL**: Triggers an action based on the defined URL.

Define the URL components as shown in this example.

\[Omitted image "url-trigger-type.png"\] Alt text: URL trigger type format example.

**Important:**

    -   If you're using the Virtual Agent web client outside of the ServiceNow instance \(for example, as part of a third-party website\), use the URL trigger type. Don't use any of the other trigger types.
    -   The URL trigger type applies only if no other available trigger types match the URL.

 If you don’t see the trigger type that you need using the lookup list icon \(\[Omitted image "look-up-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon.\), you can create your own custom trigger type. For more information about custom trigger types, see [Create custom trigger types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/product-support-for-technology/create-custom-trigger-types.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Conditions

</td><td>

Conditions that must be met for the trigger type to run as defined by the admin. Conditions vary by trigger type. Specify the Proactive Triggers conditions that you want to use.For more information about using conditions, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).

 **Note:** Rule conditions are case-sensitive and must match. For example, if you want to use the name of a catalog item, such as the iPhone condition, entering "iphone" doesn't give you the results that you want.

\[Omitted image "specify-conditions.png"\] Alt text: Proactive Triggers conditions.

**Note:** When specifying the conditions that must be met for a trigger type, be careful not to specify conflicting trigger types and conditions. Conflicting URL trigger types and conditions can cause errors. For more information, see [Manage Proactive Triggers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/product-support-for-technology/manage-proactive-triggers-2.md).

Option for using scripts to define the condition.\[Omitted image "specify-advanced-conditions.png"\] Alt text: Specify advanced conditions.
