# Virtual Agent roles

Virtual Agent adds several roles for users operating as Virtual Agent administrators.

To learn more about managing subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md) and contact your account representative.

## Role description

Roles that are installed with Virtual Agent are listed below with the following information:

-   **Role title \[name\]**

    Name of the role. Text within brackets matches the **Name** field in the Roles \[sys\_user\_role\] table.

-   **Description**

    Description of the role and its intended use.

-   **Contains Roles**

    List of roles contained within the role.

-   **Groups**

    List of groups this role is assigned to by default.

-   **Considerations**

    Warnings or other considerations for administrators.


## Installed roles

**Note:**

Simplify user administration by creating groups that contain all the roles necessary for specific personas rather than to individual users. You can then assign individual users to those groups. When users transition to new roles, you can then re-assign their group memberships, and avoid scenarios where users retain unexpected roles.

For details on the administration of users, groups, and roles, see [User Administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_UserAdministration.md).
