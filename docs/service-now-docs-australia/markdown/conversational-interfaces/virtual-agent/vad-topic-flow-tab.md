# Topic Flow tab

Use the topic **Flow** tab to build the conversation flow. Use the controls for user inputs, bot responses, and utilities to define the flow.

## Flow tab \(default view\)

\[Omitted image "DesignerTextNodeCalloutSections-2.png"\] Alt text: View of Virtual Agent Designer topic Flow tab with 10 callouts highlighted. For the text description, see the table that follows.

**Note:** An updated Assistant Designer Asset library user interface is available when you install ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent. This content assumes that you can see the list view. If ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent is not installed, you see the legacy UI and topics page. For more information, see [Virtual Agent Designer legacy topics page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/vad-prev-topics-page.md).

Collapsible sidebar with Components and Variables tabs.The Components tab shows a list of controls that you can drag onto the canvas to build a conversation. The following types of controls are available:

-   [User Input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-user-inputs.md): Controls used to prompt and capture information from the user in a conversation. When ServiceNow Otto is enabled and you're working with a large language model \(LLM\) topic, the LLM User Input section indicates which controls are LLM compatible.
-   [Bot Response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-bot-responses.md): Controls for showing virtual agent responses in a conversation.
-   [Utilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-utilities.md): Controls for performing actions within a topic, such as running a script, adding different conversation paths \(branches\) in a topic, or adding topic blocks.

The Variables tab includes inputs and scripts.\[Omitted image "variables-tab.png"\] Alt text: Variables tab showing Input and Scripts in topic being viewed in Assistant Designer Asset library.

-   **Input section**
    -   Live Agent variables specified on the topic **Properties** tab to provide contextual information from the virtual agent session to the live agent.
    -   Input variables defined by User Input controls and Utilities that are added to the flow on the canvas.
    -   "Nodeless" NLU entities added by the topic author that are used as slot-filled input variables for the topic.
-   **Script section**

The Script section includes the scripts found in nodes on the canvas. The topic author can add further script variables to store values outside of control variables. Scripting variables enable more complex scripting scenarios.

</table>## LLM components guided tour

When you create or open a non-read-only LLM topic, a dialog box appears and displays an option to take a guided tour of the LLM components in Virtual Agent Designer. Select the close icon to close the window or **Start guided tour** to be shown the various components. You can also take a tour by selecting **Guided tour for LLM enabled nodes** in the Helpful resources tab.

To stop seeing the dialog box open each time you open an LLM topic, select **Do not show this again** before closing the dialog box or starting the tour. To restore the dialog box, navigate to **All**, then enter `sys_cb_user_preference_list.do`. On the Designer User Preferences page, find the **LLM\_INTRO\_MODAL\_ENABLED** preference. Open its **Value** field and set it to `true`.

\[Omitted image "vad-llm-intro-popup.png"\] Alt text: Introducing LLM components dialog box with the Do not show this again and Start guided tour options.

## Incomplete property warnings

Controls on the canvas have required properties. If required properties are missing, Virtual Agent Designer displays the total number of missing required properties and the controls that are missing them. All incomplete warnings must be addressed to test or publish the topic.

In the following example, the topic is missing two required properties. Two nodes are affected, and each is missing one property. The Text response node is missing the Message response.

\[Omitted image "vad-flow-tab-missing-properties-warnings.png"\] Alt text: Virtual Agent Designer Flow tab view with incomplete properties. Number of incomplete nodes is shown in the canvas. The sidebar and each node show the number of incomplete entries.

Point to the incomplete message to see a tooltip that describes what is missing.

\[Omitted image "vad-flow-tab-missing-properties-tooltip.png"\] Alt text: Virtual Agent Designer properties, with incomplete message selected to show missing items in the node.
