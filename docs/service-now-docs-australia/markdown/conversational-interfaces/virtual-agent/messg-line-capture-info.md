# Capturing information from a user in a LINE chat conversation

Use the collection of input controls provided by the Virtual Agent Designer to prompt and capture information from the user in a LINE chat conversation.

Virtual Agent Designer is a diagram tool for creating and managing topics, which are blueprints for conversations between a virtual agent and user. For more information, see [Using Virtual Agent Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/conversation-designer-virtual-agent.md).

## User notification consent

Users must opt in to receive notifications. No notifications can be delivered until the user grants consent.

There are two ways for users to grant consent to receive notifications:

-   The user can enter `Notification` into the LINE chat with your business. The user gets a bot response with the option to subscribe or unsubscribe from receiving notifications for your business on LINE.
-   As an administrator, you can set up the option for users to subscribe or unsubscribe from notifications from your portal. See [Subscription-based notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_SubscriptionBasedNotifications.md) for more information.
