# Override Slack integration

Override Virtual Agent integration with Slack.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

Before Utah release, an admin was able to override a Slack installation that is associated with a particular instance with a different ServiceNow instance.

Starting from Utah release, if your Slack workspace is already associated with another ServiceNow instance, but you intend to associate it with a new instance, then you must reach out to the administrator to first uninstall it from the previously associated instance.

**Important:** The instructions in [Remove ServiceNow Virtual Agent integration with Slack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/uninstall-virtual-agent-slack.md) are only applicable when both instances are compatible with Utah and the above releases. If one of your ServiceNow instances is on the Utah release and another on a release prior to Utah, follow the steps below.

## Procedure

1.  In the left navigation filter of your ServiceNow instance, enter `sys_properties_list`.

2.  Search and open the **sn\_va\_slack.enable\_slack\_override** system property.

    **Note:** If you don't find this system property, you \(as an admin\) must create one.

3.  Set the system property value to **true** to enable the **Override** button.

    By default, the value of the system property is **false**.

4.  Select **Override** to associate the instance with a new tenant.
