# Set a default NLU context value for multiple active conversations

Use consumer account context values to define where Virtual Agent messages are directed by default when using the multiple active conversations feature.

## Before you begin

Define values for portal consumer contexts. For more information, see [Set NLU portal consumer context values for multiple active conversations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/t_set-portal-consumer-context-values-multiple-active-conversations.md).

Configure context values that align Virtual Agent and your portals. See [Configure Agent Chat in a portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-va-in-sp.md) for more information.

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin.

## About this task

You can create as many context values as you need. One consumer account context must always be set to `Yes` to provide a default content area. The default acts as a fallback for the chat widget when the portal setup doesn’t include context. The default is also used as the context for mobile conversations, which only support one conversation at a time. Context values are stored in the Conversation Consumer Account Context \[sys\_cs\_consumer\_account\_context\] table. \(The CS Consumer Account \[sys\_cs\_consumer\_account\] table [Installed with Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/installed-wth-virtual-agent.md) shows whether third-party users in your instance have a context assigned to them.\)

**Note:** These instructions are for configuring Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) conversations. Large language model \(LLM\) conversations are configured for multiple active conversations based on portals, with no configuration necessary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Virtual Agent**.

2.  Under **multiple active conversations**, select **View settings**.

    **Note:** The delivered default value for consumer account contexts is `sp`.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

## What to do next

Activate the multiple active conversations system.
