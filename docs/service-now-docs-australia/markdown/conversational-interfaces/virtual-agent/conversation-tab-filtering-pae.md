# Use filters in the Conversation tab

You can filter out conversation for a deeper understanding.

## Filtering using the Filter Editor

To filter the conversations, select filter icon and select **Advanced view** button to use the filter editor. You can either select an existing filter from the list or create a new filter condition.

The filter editor consists of the following:

-   Field: A list based on relevant tables. For more information about the field options, see [Field options in the Filter Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/conversation-tab-filtering-pae.md).
-   Operator: A list of operators that is contextually generated based on the selected field.
-   Value: A text entry field or a list that is contextually generated based on the selected field.

To add a dependent condition in the filter editor, either select **or** or **and**. To filter the conversations list using the condition, select **Update**.

To remove a condition, select the delete icon \[Omitted image "delete-icon.png"\] Alt text: Delete icon. next to the condition.

To save a condition that you created in the condition builder, select **Save filter**. In the Save Filter pop-up window, specify a name for the filter. You can also set permissions for the filter in the Save Filter window. Users having the Chat Analytics Viewer \(chat\_analytics\_viewer\) role can select and modify saved filters.
