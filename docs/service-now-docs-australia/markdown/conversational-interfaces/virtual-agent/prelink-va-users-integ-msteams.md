# Installing Microsoft Teams for all Virtual Agent users

Pre-link your Virtual Agent requesters to a ServiceNow instance before they run the Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams. Batch pre-linking enables your Virtual Agent users to immediately chat with a virtual agent and receive notifications without going through the initial authentication linking process.

## Before you begin

**Note:** In order to send notifications to users, the app must be installed to all users. The recommended approach for installing the app to users is [Microsoft Teams App Setup Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies). When a user gets added to the policy, Microsoft will install the app to the user, and send us an `installationUpdate` event. When the event is received, the conversation with the user starts and contains the welcome message.

To install the app otherwise, use the following directions.

To install the app otherwise, use the following directions.

-   [Install Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/teams-install.md), with the **Automatically Link ServiceNow user profiles** option enabled.
-   [Set up Microsoft Teams Graph spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/set-up-msteams.md).
-   [Set up Microsoft Active Directory spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/set-up-ad.md).

Roles required:

-   virtual\_agent\_admin
-   external\_app\_install\_admin
-   One of the following Microsoft Teams administrator roles:
    -   Global Administrator
    -   Application Administrator
    -   Cloud Application Administrator
-   admin or schedule\_admin to change the scheduled job script

## About this task

When the **Automatically Link ServiceNow user profiles** option is enabled on the Settings page of the Manage Microsoft Teams channel, a batch of up to 10,000 users is automatically pre-linked to a ServiceNow instance. Your existing users are pre-linked during the initial run. Newly added users are pre-linked during subsequent daily runs.

To prevent automatic batch pre-linking, disable the **Automatically Link ServiceNow user profiles** option on the Messaging Apps Integration UI page.

Batch pre-linking of your Virtual Agent users to a ServiceNow instance before integrating with Microsoft Teams includes the following benefits:

-   Notifications are proactively sent by Virtual Agent to users when their identity in Microsoft Teams is associated with their identity in a ServiceNow instance. This is also true when the user is already linked with ServiceNow Virtual Agent.
-   If a user is pre-linked, and when Microsoft Teams notifications are enabled in the app, notifications are pushed to the app even when a user is not logged into a Microsoft Teams account.

Batch pre-linking happens automatically via the **MS Teams Daily Pre Install Job** scheduled job. This job runs by default daily at 1:00 a.m., but you can change the time, if desired. To modify the default scheduled job run time or time zone, access the **MS Teams Daily Pre Install Job** Scheduled Script Execution form.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Search for the **MS Teams Daily Pre Install Job** scheduled job and select to open the Scheduled Script Execution form for the selected record.

3.  In the **Run** field, change the run time to your desired time.

4.  For a description of the other fields that you can change in this form, including **Time zone**, see [Automatically run a script of your choosing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ScheduleAScriptExecution.md).

5.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

You can also customize the auto-linking process for Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams.
