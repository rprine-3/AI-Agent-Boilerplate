# Using Virtual Agent Topic Recommendations

Use the Topic Recommendations app to identify pre-built Virtual Agent topics that can be quickly implemented in your organization. Topic Recommendations uses Intent Discovery to analyze data from your organization and to find relevant pre-built topics that your organization can benefit from, and new topics that would be useful to create.

The Topic Recommendations app lets you evaluate the common use cases that Virtual Agent can help resolve or deflect. You can use Topic Recommendations with Virtual Agent topics that use either keyword or NLU topic discovery. Use it to do the following:

1.  Choose the ServiceNow data to analyze \(configure analysis\).
2.  Analyze your existing data \(run the analysis you configured\).
3.  Review the analysis results and use pre-built solutions:
    -   Duplicate a pre-built topic suggestion, such as a topic from ITSM Virtual Agent Conversations \(available from the ServiceNow Store\).
    -   \[NLU only\] Add an intent to your model and a new empty topic. You must provide the flow for the new topic in Virtual Agent Designer.

The Topic Recommendations app requires NLU Workbench and ITSM Virtual Agent Conversations from the ServiceNow Store. The Australia release of Topic Recommendations supports only ITSM Virtual Agent recommendations. Although Topic Recommendations uses NLU Workbench for machine learning purposes, it does not require that NLU be enabled in Virtual Agent.
