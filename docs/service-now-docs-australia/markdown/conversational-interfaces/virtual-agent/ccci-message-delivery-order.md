# Message delivery order

Control message delivery order by enabling the **Maintain message ordering** option in the Provider Channel \[sys\_cs\_provider\] table. You can view the message order and status in the Custom Adapter Message \[sys\_cs\_ca\_message\] table.

When you enable the **Maintain messaging order** option in the Provider Channel table, a Sender Subflow occurs only after the previous Sender Subflow completes to ensure that messages are delivered in the order that they were sent.

Messages are stored in the Custom Adapter Message \[sys\_cs\_ca\_message\] table, which is cleaned nightly. If the Custom Chat Integration Framework client is not receiving any messages, you can use this table to check the message delivery status:

-   Processing
-   Pending - not yet processed
-   Completed
-   Error - problem with processing an outbound message, possibly due to Integration Hub issues that could occur when the Sender Subflow is invoked
