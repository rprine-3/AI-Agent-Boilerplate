# Activate Virtual Agent

You can activate the Glide Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\) if you have the admin role. This plugin automatically activates other necessary plugins if they are not already active.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You must have a subscription for Virtual Agent before you can activate the Glide Virtual Agent plugin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Glide Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel. For more information, see [Request a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_RequestAPlugin.md).

3.  Select **Install**, and then in the Activate Plugin dialog box, select **Activate**.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`


## What to do next

Activate [additional Virtual Agent plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/additional-va-plugins.md) for related features, such as the plugins for predefined Virtual Agent topics.
