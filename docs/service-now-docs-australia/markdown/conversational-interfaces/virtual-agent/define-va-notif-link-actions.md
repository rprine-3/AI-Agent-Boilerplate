# Define the Virtual Agent link actions to notification content

Create the link actions for Virtual Agent notification content to be delivered in a chat or messaging channel as actionable notifications.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that you have activated the Glide Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\).

    **Note:** Only Virtual Agent Pro customers can associate actions with notification contents and receive actionable notifications.

-   Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin.

## About this task

Notification content, with no associated link actions, is delivered as a non-actionable notification.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Provider** &gt; **Notifications** and select the notification for which you're defining the link actions.

2.  In the Link Actions related list, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_jbc_wtb_lpb"><thead><tr><th>

</table>4.  Select **Submit**.

5.  To define another link action for the notification content, repeat steps 3 and 4.

    **Note:** Only a single notification with active content is supported for a provider. However, if the content for the notification is not active, you can define the secondary content for the notification and make that content active.

6.  To remove the **Skip** action from an actionable notification, do the following steps:

    1.  Select the notification and open the Link Actions to Content related list.

    2.  Select the Actionable Content and select the **Disable skip** option.

        **Note:** This option only displays when the Content Type is Virtual Agent.
