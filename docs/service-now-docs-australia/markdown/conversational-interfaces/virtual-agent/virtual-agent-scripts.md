# Virtual Agent scripts

Use ServiceNow® Virtual Agent script methods and variables to write chat scripts, such as response, trigger, and flow scripts. Variables can also provide context for your live support topics and conversations.

Virtual Agent scripts can provide context for topics, such as retaining information about a user or a user's input. You can use this information to personalize a conversation, such as to present a scripted greeting or confirmation. Scripts can also specify certain actions to be performed on information that was obtained during a conversation. These actions can be used for creating or updating ServiceNow records.

Scripts run on the server in the scope in which a topic is defined. All scope protections apply. If you're developing a conversation for a scoped application, you must use the scoped API. You can use most APIs that run in server scripts.

## User input and ServiceNow record variables

In Virtual Agent, the following variables are available for use in scripts that you create for a topic.

-   **User input variables**

    When you add an input control to a topic, the system automatically creates a variable to store the user input \(a string, Boolean value, and so on.\). The syntax is `vaInputs.myvar` where `myvar` is the name that you assigned to the input node.

    For example, a text input prompt with the name `First prompt` has a system-defined variable called `vaInputs.first_prompt`. Spaces in the name are replaced with an underscore character, and uppercase characters are changed to lowercase.

-   **ServiceNow record variables**

    If you create a script for a topic that queries a ServiceNow table, then the record object \(GlideRecord\) returned is automatically available for use in the topic. The variable syntax is `vaInputs.myvar` where `myvar` is the record object. For details on querying ServiceNow tables to return a record object, see [Querying tables in script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_UsingGlideRecordToQueryTables.md).

    Use dot-walking in variables that contain a ServiceNow record to specify a particular field in the table. The syntax is `vaInputs.myvar.field`. For details on dot-walking within a script, see [Dot-walking examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/dot-walking-examples.md).

-   **Accessing user input and ServiceNow record variables**

    Use vaInputs objects to access ServiceNow record variables in scripts. For example, the `vaInputs.myvar == "expected value"`. To access values from user inputs that are not records, use `vaInputs.myvar.getValue()`.

    The following methods are available.

<table id="table_uht_pzs_cpb"><thead><tr><th>

Method

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

vaInputs.myvar == "expected value"

</td><td>

Evaluates whether `myvar` matches an expected value. **Note:** Values for user input variables are assigned using user input controls. These values can’t be changed in your scripts.

 -   The Australia release supports additional data types. For more information, see [Input data types in Virtual Agent topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-data-types.md).
-   By default, the user variable is available and is a reference to the sys\_user record for the user.


</td></tr><tr><td>

vaInputs.myvar.getValue\(\);

</td><td>

Returns the value.

</td></tr><tr><td>

vaInputs.myvar.getDisplayValue\(\);

</td><td>

Returns the display value if the stored value is not a ServiceNow record. For variables that contain ServiceNow records, this method returns the display value, as defined by the display field for that table.

 The following example shows the label and choice values for a user input. In this case, `myVar.getValue()` would return a value of 10, 20, or 30, while `myVar.getDisplayValue()` would return Apple, Orange, or Pear.

 \[Omitted image "va-value-vs-display.ong.png"\] Alt text: Label fields include Apple, Orange, and Pear for the choices. The values for each are 10, 20, and 30.

</td></tr><tr><td>

vaInputs.myvar.getDefaultValue\(\);

</td><td>

Returns the default value in a confirmation message.

</td></tr><tr><td>

vaInputs.myvar.getDefaultDisplayValue\(\);

</td><td>

Returns the display value for the default value in a confirmation message.

</td></tr><tr><td>

vaInputs.myvar.unbindEntity\(\);

</td><td>

Removes the value of input variables that the NLU prediction service slot-filled with extracted entities \(unbinds it from the initial input value\). For example, if the user decides to change their choice on a confirmation prompt, you can unbind the entity's value from the input variable. The user will then be prompted again when they loop back to the corresponding input node.

 **Note:** NLU must be enabled on the topic. In the Assistant Designer, select the **Properties** tab to set up NLU. For information about defining NLU entities, see [Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/entities.md).

## Script variables

You can define script variables for information that is not stored in ServiceNow tables but that can be used to share that information elsewhere in a topic. Script variables are similar to workflow scratchpad variables that store primitives such as integers, Boolean values, or strings. A string value can be either a static or dynamic scripted value. Use the Variables sidebar to define script variables for a topic in Assistant Designer.

\[Omitted image "ScriptVariablesExample.png"\] Alt text: Sidebar in theAssistant Designer canvas for manually adding script variables that are used in topic scripts.

**Note:** Script variables are intended for use by topic authors with advanced scripting skills.

The variable syntax is `vaVars.myvar`, where `myvar` is the name that you assign to the variable. For example, you can assign a value to the variable using `vaVars.myvar = value;`. Unlike user input variables, script variables can be assigned values in a script.

For information about defining a script variable in a topic, see [Define script variables for a topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/define-script-variables-topic.md).

## Context variables

Context variables work in a global scope whereas system variables work within the scope of the topic. You can use context variables in system parameters within the web client URL. These variables can be used anywhere in the conversation using the `vaContext` object. Use these options to create links to Virtual Agent with predefined variables.

The following example link contains a parameter, `sysparm_city=milan`. In addition to opening a Virtual Agent conversation, using this link creates a variable called `city` with a value of `milan`. This variable can be accessed in a script using `vaContext.city`.

```
https://<instance>.service-now.com/$sn-va-web-client-app.do?sysparm_city=milan
```

A number of Live Agent variables are available for use in topic scripts. These variables include the following:

-   *application*
-   *language*
-   *portal*
-   *search\_text*
-   *short\_description*

The variable syntax is `vaContext.LiveAgent_myvar`, where `myvar` is one of the available [live agent context variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/live-agent-chat-context-vars.md). Access the variable using `vaContext.LiveAgent_myvar = value;`.

To use Live Agent variables in topic scripts, open the topic in Assistant Designer. On the **Properties** tab, select the pencil icon next to **Live Agent Variables** to add them to the topic.

For information about live agent context variables that are included with Virtual Agent, see [Live agent chat context variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/live-agent-chat-context-vars.md).

|Method|Description|
|------|-----------|
|vaVars.global\_utterance|Updates when skill picker renders and an utterance is typed in.|

## vaSystem methods

You can use methods in the vaSystem object to do various tasks. Some of these tasks include the following:

-   Attach images to records.
-   Access the search string that was used to find the current topic.
-   Verify that a live agent is available to receive a conversation.
-   Connect the user to a live agent.

**Note:** The use of undocumented system methods is not recommended, as they are unsupported and may be discontinued or altered at any time without prior notice.
