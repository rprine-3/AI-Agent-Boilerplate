# Create and integrate a self-configured bot for a single tenant page

Create a self-configured single tenant bot with Microsoft Teams for integration with Virtual Agent.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin and Microsoft Azure admin.

## About this task

Creating and integrating a single tenant bot is similar to creating a GCC-H or DoD bot, with minor adjustments.

## Procedure

1.  Follow the instructions in [Create a bot in Microsoft Teams for GCC-H or DoD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/create-msteams-bot-gcch.md), with the following changes.

    1.  Follow steps 1 through 4 as normal.

    2.  In step 5, select **Single tenant**.

    3.  Follow the remaining steps as normal.

2.  Follow the instructions in [Integrate your self-configured bot with Microsoft Teams for GCC-H or DoD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/link-msteams-bot-snow.md), with the following changes.

    1.  Follow steps 1 through 6 as normal.

    2.  In step 7, select **Single tenant**, and add your tenant ID, but keep the `.com` domain, for example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token`.

    3.  Follow steps 8 through 10 as normal.


## Result

Your single-tenant bot is ready for use in Virtual Agent.
