# Custom control utility

Use the Custom Control utility in a Virtual Agent topic or topic block to reference a custom input control or a custom response control. Custom controls complement the controls provided in Assistant Designer.

## Custom control utility properties

Specify the properties of the custom input control or custom response control that you are adding to a topic or topic block. For more information about custom controls and their use, see [Customizing Virtual Agent with custom controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/custom-controls.md).

**Note:** Custom controls do not work on Internet Explorer version 11.
