# Configure promoted topics for Conversational Integration with Slack

Configure promoted topics to push out important, common topics for users' quick consumption during a conversation with the Slack bot. You can configure up to six different promoted topics to be displayed on the Slack channel greeting message.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or virtual\_agent\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  On the Virtual Agent settings page, navigate to Custom greetings and setup, and then select **View All**.

    The promoted topics that you have previously configured reside in the default chat experience. For more information, see [Promote or demote LLM conversational subflows, actions, and topics in Assistant Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/promote-demote-va-topics.md). If the default chat experience is the only record that you have on your instance, the promoted topics will be applied to the chat widget, Microsoft Teams, and Slack \(unless you configure something unique for Slack as instructed in this topic.\)

    If you want to set up unique promoted topics for Slack that are different from the chat widget, continue to the next step.

3.  On the Custom Greetings &amp; Setup page, select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ekz_gnx_b5b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Condition

</td><td>

Condition that defines the condition mode for the chat experience.Set up a simple condition with **\[devicetype\] \[is\] \[slack\]**.

 **Note:** If you set up **\[devicetype\] \[is\] \[teams\]** in the Condition pop up with a higher order than the default chat experience, then Slack picks up the setup topics and promoted topics defined in this experience.

This change will not affect chat widget, which is still going to inherit the setup topics and promoted topics defined in the default chat experience.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select **Create custom experience**.

6.  Add promoted topics in the Slack chat experience form that you created.

    Review the character length of your promoted topics before adding them for Slack. When the text in the topic gets closer to ~30 characters, the text may get truncated. For more information, see [Slack document](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#button).

    1.  On the Slack chat experience form, select the **Promoted Topics** tab and select **Add topic**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_gkr_sqx_b5b"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>        **Note:** Similar to the chat widget, you can configure a maximum of six promoted topics for the Slack channel.

    3.  Select **Save.**


## What to do next

Start a conversation with the Slack bot and you should be able to see the promoted topics after the greeting message that you have setup for the Slack channel.

In you have not configured the promoted topics for Slack, then the promoted topics from the default chat experience are displayed.
