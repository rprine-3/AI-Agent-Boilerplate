# Branch a Virtual Agent conversation with a Decision utility

Your conversations may need to branch depending on end user input or choices. Use the Decision utility to branch the conversation when certain conditions are met.

## Before you begin

For more information about the Decision utility, see [Decision utility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-decision.md).

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Assistant Designer**.

2.  Select the **Asset library** tab.

3.  In the Asset library, open a topic and view the **Flow** tab.

4.  Drag the **Decision** utility onto the canvas.

    The **Decision** utility node added to the canvas has a single branch named **Always** by default.

    **Note:** If you insert a **Boolean** user input control, you're prompted to add a **Decision** utility directly after the Boolean node on the canvas. Selecting **Yes** on the Boolean node's Decision utility prompt automatically generates two branches named **True** and **False**. The two branches conditions are automatically set through the condition builder.

5.  Select the plus sign \(**+**\) under the node.

    A second branch named **Always** is added below the Decision utility node.

6.  Select the plus sign \(**+**\) under the node to add additional branches.

7.  Select a branch label, and then specify the branch properties in the form.
