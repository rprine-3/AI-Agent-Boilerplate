# Using catalogs and autopilot in Virtual Agent

Use catalogs to search for and request services and products in Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\)/Keyword chat widget conversations.

The catalog feature lets you use natural language to search for and request service items in a Virtual Agent conversation that uses Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\)/Keyword topic discovery. The Virtual Agent recognizes your request and presents you with the best answer. You complete the entire order in the chat, without going to a new page.

For example, if you enter `iPad`, the Virtual Agent shows you the service catalog info for an iPad. You can request the item, ask for more information on the item before deciding, or ask for something else.

\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-01.png"\] Alt text: Enter a search term to have Virtual Agent present the most likely result for a catalog item. \[Omitted image "va-catalogs-02.png"\] Alt text: You can request an item, learn more about it, or ask for something else. \[Omitted image "va-catalogs-03.png"\] Alt text: If you request the item, you select any options before completing the order.

If you choose to order the item, you select any available options. When you complete the order, the catalog card closes, and Virtual Agent replaces it with a Requested Item record and a link. Selecting the link takes you to the record.

\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-04.png"\] Alt text: The Virtual Agent shows you a link to a record for the item request.\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-05.png"\] Alt text: All data relevant to your order is displayed in the requested item record.

If you cancel the order instead, you receive a message confirming the cancellation. For example, if you enter `iPhone` and request the item, then cancel the order, the request closes and the Virtual Agent doesn't create a record.

\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-06.png"\] Alt text: The user requests an iPhone.\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-07.png"\] Alt text: While completing the request, the user chooses to cancel the order instead.\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-08.png"\] Alt text: The request is closed with a message informing the user that the order is Canceled.

**Note:** Catalogs for Virtual Agent are separate from ServiceNow Otto and Multi-turn catalog ordering. For more information on how catalog search results work based on AI Search, see [Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/genius-results-ais.md). For information on Multi-turn catalog ordering instead, see [Using ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/using-now-assist-in-va.md).

## Catalog live agent autopilot experience

Autopilot is available for live agents in the CSM Workspace. This allows the live agent to assist a customer with a catalog order, and view all information on the customer's transaction.

To use the feature, the live agent enters `/autopilot "[topic]"`, substituting `[topic]` for the catalog item topic name. The catalog item appears in the customer's chat window. They choose any preferences for the order as usual. The live agent can see the full catalog order in the chat panel, but can't change any details of the order themselves.

\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-autopilot-2.png"\] Alt text: CSM Workspace view next to customer chat window. The live agent has activated autopilot.

Once the customer completes the order, the chat panel displays the Requested Item record as usual. The live agent sees the full transcript of the customer's transaction, including the full catalog card and Requested Item record.

\[Omitted image "va-catalogs-autopilot-3.png"\] Alt text: CSM Workspace view next to customer chat window. The customer sees only the Requested Item card, while the live agent sees the internal transcript and full chat record.
