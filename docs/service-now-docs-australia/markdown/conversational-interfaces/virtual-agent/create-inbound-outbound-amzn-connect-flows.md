# Create inbound and outbound Amazon Connect contact flows

Create the inbound and outbound Amazon Connect contact flows to set up IVR \(Interactive Voice Response\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

        **Note:** Ensure that the region that you selected matches across the Amazon Connect setup.

    2.  In the Amazon Lex section, search and select your bot \(for example: SN\_CI\_CC\_LexBot\) in the **Bot** drop-down, select **SN\_CI\_CC\_LexBot\_Prod\_Alias** file from the **Alias** drop-down, and click **Add Amazon Lex Bot**.

    7.  After the JSON is uploaded, locate and click the **Loop prompts** tile.

    8.  On the Loop prompts pop-up, select an audio file of your choice with the `.wav` extension \(for example: SN\_CI\_CC\_Inbound\_Prompt.wav\) from the Audio recording drop-down and click **Save**.

        **Note:** Ensure that the `.wav` audio file which you upload, does not exceed more than five-minutes duration.
