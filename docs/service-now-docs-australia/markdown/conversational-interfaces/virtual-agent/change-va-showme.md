# Change text in the Show me everything button

Configure the text in the **Show me everything** button displayed in the chat window to control the display of the initial greetings and the **Show me everything** button in Virtual Agent conversations. Edit the message in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, or in a copy of the Greetings setup topic.

## Before you begin

If you’re updating the Greetings setup topic in Assistant Designer Asset library, first [Create a copy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/duplicate-virtual-agent-topic.md) of the Greetings setup topic, since the prebuilt Greetings setup topic is read-only.

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

You can change the Virtual Agent greeting message by updating the default greeting through the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, or in the Greetings setup topic in Assistant Designer Asset library.

If you change the message in the System Properties table, the default greetings setup topic shows the updated message. Any custom greetings topics that don't override the default **Show me everything** also show the message. If you change the greeting message through Assistant Designer Asset library, you can make more targeted changes, such as a message for an HR-based greeting topic.

The Greetings setup topic contains the Send Topic Picker script action, which controls the text in the **Show me everything** button. To change the text, edit the Send Topic Picker script action in the copy of the Greetings setup topic.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** and use one of the following methods.

<table id="choicetable_llf_w4t_d1c"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d62428e132">

6.  In the Script action properties sheet, select the Script icon \[Omitted image "icon-script.png"\] Alt text: Script icon. to open the **Action expression** script.
7.  Change the `greetingMessage` text string as needed, and select **Save**. For example, to change the button text to **Show more**, you would change the script as follows:

    ```
(function execute() {
    var greetingMessage = vaSystem.getTopicSelectionMessage();
    vaSystem.sendTopicPickerControl(greetingMessage, "Show more");
})()
    ```

8.  Preview the change in the chat window by selecting **Test** in the header bar. The button text change displays as follows:

9.  Select **Save** in the header bar.
10. When you're ready to make the topic active, select **Publish**.
