# Testing assistants

Simulate and test assistant conversations from Asset library.

You can test assistants directly from the Asset library.

2.  Select the **Asset library** tab.
3.  Select the **LLM** option.
4.  From the Assistant list, select the assistant that you want to test. The assets available to the selected assistant is shown under All assets.
5.  Select **Test assistant**.

    **Note:** You can test both active and inactive assistants.

Depending on the chat experience set up for the assistant, you can test using [Standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/nava-standard-chat.md) experience or [Enhanced chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/nava-enhanced-chat.md) experience. For more information about setting up the chat experience for an assistant, see [Manage an assistant chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/manage-assistant-chat-experience.md).

**Note:** The ServiceNow Otto Panel - Platform \(default\) assistant can also use the [Premium chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/nava-integrated-chat.md) experience. The premium experience is configured by default.

**Note:** Enhanced chat experience is the default for Assistant Designer test panels. To change the default experience to standard chat, set the value of the system property **sn\_nowassist\_va.standard\_chat\_enabled** to true.

For all the ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent assistants and the ServiceNow Otto Panel - Platform Assistant, when testing the assistant:

-   If the assistant has the Standard Chat experience configured for any display location, you can choose between Standard Chat, Enhanced Chat, or Integrated Chat.
-   If the assistant only has the Enhanced Chat or Integrated Chat experience configured across all display locations, when you select **Test Assistant**, you can choose between those options.

For the ServiceNow Otto Panel - Developer Assistant, when testing the assistant by selecting **Test Assistant**, you're directed to test the Standard Chat experience.
