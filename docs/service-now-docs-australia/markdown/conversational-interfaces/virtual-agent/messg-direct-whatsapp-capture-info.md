# Capturing information from a user in a WhatsApp chat conversation

Use the collection of input controls provided by the Virtual Agent Designer to prompt and capture information from a requester in a WhatsApp chat conversation.

Virtual Agent Designer is a diagram tool for creating and managing topics, which are blueprints for conversations between a virtual agent and user. For more information, see [Getting started with the Asset library in Assistant Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/conversation-designer-virtual-agent.md).

## User notification consent

Users must opt in to receive notifications. No notifications can be delivered until the user grants consent.

There are two ways for users to grant consent to receive notifications:

-   The user can enter `Notification` into the WhatsApp chat with your business. The user gets a bot response with the option to subscribe or unsubscribe from receiving notifications for your business on WhatsApp.
-   As the administrator, you can set up the option for users to subscribe or unsubscribe from notifications from your portal. See [Subscription-based notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_SubscriptionBasedNotifications.md) for more information.

## User input controls

The Conversational Integration with WhatsApp \(WhatsApp Cloud API\) application supports the following user input controls in Virtual Agent Designer.

|User input control|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|Text|User enters a plain text string in the conversation.|
|Static Choice|User selects an item from a predefined list.|
|Boolean|User enters a Boolean response to the bot. For example, the user can reply `Yes` or `No` in a chat conversation.|

|Dynamic choice|User selects an item from a dynamic list \(partial support\).|
|Date Time|User selects a calendar date, time \(hours and minutes\), or both.|
