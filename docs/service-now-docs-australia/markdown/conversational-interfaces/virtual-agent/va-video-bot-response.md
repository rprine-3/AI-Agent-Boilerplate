# Video bot response control

Use the Video bot response control in a Virtual Agent topic to include a video in the conversation.

The Video bot response control includes a navigation button, which gives users time to watch the video. If you want the user to the watch the video before continuing with the conversation, use this navigation button.

When users have finished watching the video, they can select the navigation button to continue with the conversation.

**Note:** Topic authors can also use the [Card bot response control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-card-output.md) to include a video in conversations. However, the Card bot response control doesn't include the navigation button, which gives users time to watch the video.
