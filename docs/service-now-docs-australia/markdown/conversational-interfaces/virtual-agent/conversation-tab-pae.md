# Conversations tab

Use the **Conversations** tab to view the list of Virtual Agent conversations and details of each conversation that occurred during the selected date range.

All conversations from the Conversation table \[sys\_cs\_conversation\], that run on the Virtual Agent Designer are listed on the Conversations page, except for notifications, open \(ongoing\) conversations, and previews.

To tag a conversation as a favorite, select the star icon on the side panel. You can list all conversations that are marked as favorite using the Filter Editor.

Virtual Agent conversations and analytics data is retained for a period of two years.

To access the **Conversations** tab, you must have the Chat Analytics Viewer \(chat\_analytics\_viewer\) role.
