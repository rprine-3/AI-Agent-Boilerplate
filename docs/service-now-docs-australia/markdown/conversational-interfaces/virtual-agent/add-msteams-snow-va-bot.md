# Integrate ServiceNow Virtual Agent with Microsoft Teams

Add the Now Virtual Agent bot to your ServiceNow instance to integrate with Microsoft Teams.

## Before you begin

Install the Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams plugin \(sn\_va\_teams\) on your ServiceNow instance before adding any integrations.

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

**Note:** This activity requires the Application Administrator or Global Administrator roles, but only to accept one-time permissions for the application on behalf of the customer.

## About this task

Any time you create and publish a bot, every user receives all changes you've made. If you create a self-configured bot, the configuration includes a snapshot of the Microsoft Teams integration. Only the changes you make are added when you download the manifest. Re-upload your manifest to push through the changes. You can then use the bot when you publish it in the Microsoft Teams store page. The store page describes how to use the Now Virtual Agent app. If you install the Now Virtual Agent production bot, it will stay up-to-date on all the changes you make.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  In **General Settings** under **Channels and integrations**, select **View All**.

    The Channels and integrations page opens.

3.  Under the Available Channels section in the Microsoft Teams tile, select **Add Integrations**.

    **Note:** The **Add Integrations** drop-down menu is available only after installing the Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams plugin \(sn\_va\_teams\) on your ServiceNow instance.

6.  Log in to the selected Microsoft Teams account.

7.  In the ServiceNow Virtual Agent screen, select **Accept** to accept the permissions for the app. \[Omitted image "va-teams-permissions.png"\] Alt text: Logging into the Microsoft Teams account to integrate with your Now Virtual Agent requires you to accept the requested permissions.

8.  If the selected tenant has already been assigned to Virtual Agent, you must first uninstall from the previously associated instance.

    **Note:** Starting from Tokyo release, if your Microsoft Teams tenant is already associated with another ServiceNow instance. If you intend to associate it with a new instance, then you're asked to contact the administrator to first uninstall it from the previously associated instance.

    The Microsoft Teams application appears in the list of integrations.
