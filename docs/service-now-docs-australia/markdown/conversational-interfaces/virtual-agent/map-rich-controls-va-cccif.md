# Map rich controls to the channel in your custom chat integration

Create records for rich controls in the Custom Adapter Configurations \[sys\_cs\_custom\_adapter\_config\] table. If a rich control is missing an outbound transformer implementation, a response is not served to the end user and that user may get an unsatisfactory chat experience.

## Before you begin

[Create a channel identifier for your custom chat integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/create-channel-id-va-cccif.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

You must create a mapping for any rich controls your conversations will use in the channel. For example, you may need a mapping for **DefaultText**, which supports input and output text response, along with file upload and image response. If your channel doesn't support a control, then you won't need to map it. For example, SMS doesn't support video responses. For a description of each default rich control, see [Default input and output rich controls for a custom chat integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/default-rich-controls-va-cccif.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**, and then enter `sys_cs_custom_adapter_config.list` in the filter.

2.  On the Custom Adapter Configurations page, click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_zbd_nsp_b4b"><thead><tr><th>

For more information about the types of controls, see [Default input and output rich controls for a custom chat integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/default-rich-controls-va-cccif.md).

</td><td>

Name of the inbound transformer action script for this rich control. For example: `sn_va_sms_twilio.va_sms_twilio_adapter_input_text_inbound_transformer`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Outbound transformation action

Name of the outbound transformer action script for this rich control. For example: `sn_va_sms_twilio.va_sms_twilio_adapter_input_text_outbound_transformer`
