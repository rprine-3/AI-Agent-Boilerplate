# Delete a Virtual Agent topic

Delete a Virtual Agent topic that is no longer needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

**Note:** An updated Assistant Designer Asset library user interface is available when you install ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent. This content assumes that you can see the list view. If ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent is not installed, you see the legacy UI and topics page. For more information, see [Virtual Agent Designer legacy topics page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/vad-prev-topics-page.md).

## About this task

You can delete a topic using the **Delete** option in the Assistant Designer Asset library or in the header bar for the topic.

**Note:**

Sometimes, certain categories of topics can’t be deleted, such as the Greeting, Survey, Live Agent, Error, Explore help, and Closing setup topics. Delete option is disabled for subflows, actions, and custom skills.

If you want to remove a topic from your Virtual Agent clients but don't want to delete it, consider making the topic inactive instead.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Assistant Designer**.

2.  Select the **Asset library** tab.

3.  Use one of the following methods based on either a record on the home page or the header inside a topic.
