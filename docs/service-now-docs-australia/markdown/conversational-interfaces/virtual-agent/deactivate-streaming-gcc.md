# Deactivate streaming for all GCC customers in Microsoft Teams

Control streaming in Microsoft Teams for any and all Government Community Cloud \(GCC\) varieties.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or virtual\_agent\_admin.

## About this task

**Note:** Custom Engine Agent \(CEA\) is replacing Declarative Agent \(DA\), the prior Microsoft Copilot integration. The CEA enables Virtual Agent to be discoverable by Microsoft Copilot, with full functional access to ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent and multi-turn conversations.

You must have version 10.1.1 or higher of the Microsoft Teams plugin to have CEA support. In version 10.2 of the Microsoft Teams plugin, streaming is inactive by default and CEA is active by default.

You can deactivate streaming as needed with this procedure, by setting values in the Now Assist Channel Configs \[sys\_now\_assist\_channel\_config\] and Custom Adapter Properties \[sys\_cs\_custom\_adapter\_property\] tables. You can use these instructions with all Government Community Cloud types: GCC, GCC-H, and GCC-DoD.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_now\_assist\_channel\_config.list**.

2.  In the entry for **Teams**, set the **Streaming Ready** value to `false`.\[Omitted image "disable-gcc-streaming-01.png"\] Alt text: Now Assist Channel Configs table with Teams Device Type entry highlighted.

3.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_cs\_custom\_adapter\_property.list**.

4.  In the search bar, select the search value **for text** from the drop-down menu, and enter `sys_cs_custom_adapter_property`.

    One or more records for `sys_cs_custom_adapter_property` appear.

5.  Set the **Value** for each record to `false`.\[Omitted image "disable-gcc-streaming-02.png"\] Alt text: Custom Adapter Properties table showing search result for publish\_checkpoint\_messages records.


## Result

Streaming is disabled for your version of GCC in your instance.

If you want to reactivate streaming, repeat these steps, but set the **Value** for all entries to `true`.
