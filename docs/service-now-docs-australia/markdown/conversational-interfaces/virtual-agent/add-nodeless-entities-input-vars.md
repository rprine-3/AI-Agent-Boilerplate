# Add nodeless NLU entities as input variables to a topic

You can add nodeless NLU entities as input variables to a topic if NLU is enabled for Virtual Agent. These variables can be slot-filled from NLU service provider predictions or provided outside of the scope of the topic.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

If a custom control prompts a user for a date and the user mentioned a date in their initial utterance, you can capture that without re-prompting the user. To prompt the user when not slot-filled, use input controls.

For more information about NLU entities, see [Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/entities.md). For more information about system entities, see [NLU system entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/nlu-system-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Assistant Designer**.

2.  Select the **Asset library** tab.

3.  In the Asset library, set the topic discovery switch to **NLU/Keyword**.

4.  Open a topic and view the **Flow** tab.

5.  In the sidebar, select the Variables tab, and select the **Input** icon \[Omitted image "icon-plus-clear.png"\].

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ncp_hnp_frb"><thead><tr><th>

 For details, see [Input data types in Virtual Agent topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-data-types.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the variable for the entity.Variable names must be unique within the scope of a topic. The name appears as a variable when used in dot walking.

</td></tr><tr><td>

NLU Entity

</td><td>

The NLU entity associated with the node.This could be a pre-built Virtual Agent entity that you import into the model, a system entity \(such as DURATION, TIME, or MONEY\), or a custom entity that you created.

String data type properties

</td></tr><tr><td>

Input format

</td><td>

Text format that is validated when a user enters certain text items. If the user doesn't enter the expected format, an error message indicates that the format is not valid and asks the user to reenter the text.

 Choose the format of the text item to be validated:

-   Text: Any text string \(no validation\)
-   Email: Format that consists of an email prefix \(user name\), @ symbol, and domain.
-   IP address \(IPV4, IPV6\): Data communication delivery format for Internet Protocol version 4 or version 6.
-   Phone number \(E.164\): Internationally recognized standard phone number format.
-   URL: Web address format
-   Custom: Script that provides a text validation rule for a custom text format and the related error messages displayed when the expected format is not entered.
**Note:** For phone and IP address format examples, see [E.164 phone formats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_ConfigureE.164PhoneNumberFields.md) and [IP address field types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r-IPAddressFieldType.md).

</td><td>

Type of dynamic variable to be used. Select one of the following options: -   **Record**: Returns records from the table selected. The values for these options are GlideRecord objects.
-   **Script**: Expression that returns an array of options.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Table\[Record values only\]

</td><td>

If you selected **Record** as the method to populate choices, select the table to be searched.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter choices\[Record values only\]

</td><td>

Select one of the following:-   **Condition Builder**: Creates a filter used to select a subset of records from the table.
-   **Script**: Defines the enumeration list for the options \(choice list\) to be displayed. The name value pair is stored as a string object.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>7.  Select **Save**.

    NLU entities appear alongside topic input variables in the Variables sidebar.

    **Note:**

    You can remove a slot-filled value to prompt the user again \(unbind it from the initial input value\).
