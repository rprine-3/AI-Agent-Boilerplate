# HTML bot response control

Use the HTML bot response control to display static HTML text in the Virtual Agent bot response.

**Note:** If you created conversations in earlier releases that use this bot response control to generate card layouts, consider updating your conversations to use the [Card bot response control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-card-output.md). The Card displays information from a record in your instance and contains a link to that related record.

## Security considerations for HTML markup

For security reasons, an HTML sanitizer script runs automatically and checks all HTML markup used in the instance, including Virtual Agent conversations. The sanitizer script removes elements or attributes that might enable cross-site scripting attacks. You can edit the HTML sanitizer script to change the list of markup items to be preserved or removed. For details, see [HTML sanitizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_HTMLSanitizer.md). For examples of adding markup items to the exclusion or inclusion lists, see [Configure HTML sanitizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_ConfigureHTMLSanitizer.md).

To disable the HTML sanitizer script only for Virtual Agent conversations, add the **com.glide.cs.html.sanitizer.enabled** system property and set the value to false. For details about creating a system property, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).

**Note:** As shown in the examples, HTML output can vary in third-party messaging applications. Determine an appropriate **Height** and **Width** area by setting initial height and width values, previewing the HTML output in the messaging applications you intend to use, and then adjusting the height and width values.

## Example HTML bot response output

The HTML bot response shows a static HTML as a chat response. This example includes an image, headings, and paragraph text. The web UI presents this content as HTML. The Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Workplace user interfaces display the same content as a PNG image. URL links within the HTML are extracted and displayed below the image. The URL can be either an absolute or a relative link. If you use a relative link, it must be relative to the ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** Asset library controls may display and function differently in other channels.
