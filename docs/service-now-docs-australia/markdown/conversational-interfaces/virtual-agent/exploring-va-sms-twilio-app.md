# Exploring Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio

Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio enables users to initiate conversations with Virtual Agent by messaging your Twilio phone number.

**Note:** Do not use the same ServiceNowTwilioDirect or Twilio Notify phone number for Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio. Instead, use separate Twilio numbers for Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio and ServiceNowTwilioDirect.

\[Omitted image "sms-twilio-app.png"\] Alt text: The user texts, "I have an issue." Virtual Agent asks for additional information and offers 4 choices for the user to select: Product issue, Order support, Billing, and Other.

If a bot transfers the conversation to a live agent, the agent can respond to SMS messages in Agent Workspace.

After you set up the Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio, you can create SMS conversation topics in Virtual Agent Designer. For more information about using the tool, see [Getting started with the Asset library in Assistant Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/conversation-designer-virtual-agent.md).

## User subscriptions for SMS update notifications

Beginning with version 1.1.1, your users with ServiceNow accounts \(sys\_user profiles\) can choose to start or stop receiving SMS updates in their conversations.

**Note:** Notifications in messaging channels can be sent to users with ServiceNow accounts. Other recipients, such as consumer and customer contacts, are considered to be guests and cannot receive notifications on messaging channels.

To comply with privacy regulations, user notifications are turned off by default. Users can opt in or change their settings in the following ways:

-   To check SMS notification settings for the account, send this text: `Notification`
-   To receive SMS notifications, send this text: `START`
-   To stop receiving SMS notifications, send this text: `STOP`

\[Omitted image "sms-notifications-start-stop.png"\] Alt text: The user enters "notifications" to view settings, which are currently on. The user enters STOP, and the bot unsubscribes them. When the user enters START, the bot confirms the re-subscription.
