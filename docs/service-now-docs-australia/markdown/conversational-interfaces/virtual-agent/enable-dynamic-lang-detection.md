# Enable Dynamic Translation for languages in Virtual Agent

Enable Dynamic Translation for one or more languages in Chat Settings for Virtual Agent.

## Before you begin

Install and configure the plugins for Dynamic Translation, as described in [Prerequisites for using Dynamic Translation in Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/prereq-using-dt-va.md). If these prerequisites aren’t completed, the Multi language support card described in the following steps doesn’t appear.

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Select **Virtual Agent**.

3.  On the Multi language support card, do the following:

    1.  Turn on the **Language Detection** toggle switch to enable it.

        Turning on this toggle is applicable to both NLU and LLM conversations.

    2.  Turn on the **Dynamic language translation** toggle switch to enable it.

        Turning on this toggle is only applicable to NLU conversations. For more information about turning on translation for LLM conversations, see [Configure multilingual service for ServiceNow Otto applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/enable-dynamic-translation-for-now-assist-applications.md).

    3.  Select **View All**.

    The Multi-language support page opens. All languages that are installed on the instance are listed.

4.  In the **Dynamic Translation Enabled** column, select **false** for the language you want to enable.

    2.  Select **Dynamic Translation Enabled**.

    3.  Select **Update**.

    4.  Return to the Multi-language support page and repeat these steps for any other language you want to enable.

5.  Enable language detection for guest users.

    If this system property is set to **off**, Dynamic Translation will not work for guest users.

    1.  Navigate to **All**, and then enter `sys_properties.list` in the filter.

    2.  In the **Name** field, search for **com.glide.cs.guest\_session\_resumable**.

    3.  In the **Value** column, change the setting to `true`.
