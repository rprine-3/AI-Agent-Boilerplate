    For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

Role required: external\_app\_install\_admin or va\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Set up required on the meta developer account and Facebook business account.

    1.  Create a Meta developer app by completing the prerequisites and step 1 in the [WhatsApp Cloud API Get Started](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/get-started) guide.

    2.  Copy the App Secret:

        -   On the Meta application dashboard, navigate to **App Settings** &gt; **Basic**.
        -   Note the App Secret.

            You would later use this token to authenticate the WhatsApp account on your ServiceNow instance.

    3.  Copy the Phone number ID:

        -   Navigate to **WhatsApp** &gt; **API Setup**.
        -   From the Send and receive messages section, select your WhatsApp-enabled phone number from the **From dropdown** list.

            You would need this ID to configure the provider record in your ServiceNow instance.

    4.  Create a system user access token in Meta Business Manager.

    For more information on how to create a system user access token, see [Generating System User Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens#generating-system-user-access-tokens). Grant the required permissions while creating the access token and copy the access token.

    You would need this token to configure the Token Verification record in your ServiceNow instance.

2.  To receive messages from WhatsApp in your ServiceNow instance, verify and configure the webhook URL.

    1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    2.  Locate and open the **sn\_va\_whatsapp.webhook\_verify\_token** property.

    3.  In the Value field, enter a chosen password or secret.

    4.  Select **Save**.

    5.  In the Meta developer console, navigate to **WhatsApp** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **WhatsApp Configuration**.

    6.  Under the webhook section, in the callback URL field, enter the URL in the format `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/api/sn_va_whatsapp/va_whatsapp_adapter`.

    7.  In the Verify token field, enter the chosen password you configured in the ServiceNow instance in step \(c\).

    8.  Select **Verify and save**.

    9.  In the Webhook fields section, enable the **Subscribe** toggle switch to subscribe to messages.

3.  To authenticate incoming hash messages from the WhatsApp account, create a Hash Message Verification record that stores the authentication token.
