# Fine-tune Virtual Agent settings and topics for the best Alexa voice chat experience

Fine-tune your Virtual Agent settings and topics provided by the Virtual Agent Designer for the best voice chat experience with Alexa.

-   Virtual Agent Designer is a diagram tool for creating and managing topics, which are blueprints for conversation between a Virtual Agent and a user. For more information, see [Getting started with the Asset library in Assistant Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/conversation-designer-virtual-agent.md).

    **Note:** Be sure that you specify Alexa as the applicable channel in the **Additional channel support** field if you want the topics that you designed using the Virtual Agent Designer to work on Alexa. For more information about the channel selection, see [Deploying Virtual Agent topics in other channels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-integrations.md).

-   Bot messages help you to interact with Alexa. You can change the bot messages for interaction in a voice chat conversation. To access the bot messages, enter `sys_cs_provider_application.list` in the navigation filter and navigate to your Alexa application profile to find the bot messages.

    \[Omitted image "alexa-bot-messages.png"\] Alt text: Provider Channel Identity settings window for Alexa, next to Alexa Provider Channel Identity window with Bot Messages highlighted.

-   You can change the greeting message and other messages only for the voice channels using the Custom Greeting and Setup page. For example, you can create a custom topic, edit it, and assign it to be used if the end user is on a voice channel. For more information about accessing the Custom Chat and to change the greeting section of the message, see [Configure a Virtual Agent chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configure-default-chat-experience.md).

-   You can also change the system-generated messages by entering `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter, and filter them by the criteria `com.glide.cs` to confirm that these messages work for voice channels. You can review the following key messages:

    -   com.glide.cs.topic\_picker\_msg
    -   com.glide.cs.no\_topic\_found\_message
    -   com.glide.cs.no\_topic\_sorry\_message
    -   com.glide.cs.link\_account\_msg
    -   com.glide.cs.topic\_choice\_list\_message
    -   com.glide.cs.topic\_confirmation\_message
    **Note:** Most of the messages unique to the voice channels are listed in the Bot Messages section of the Provider Channel Identity record.

    For more information, see [Change the Virtual Agent greeting messages in the Greeting setup topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-welcome-topic-selection-msgs.md).

-   Most components work for screen-based and screen-less devices accessed in Alexa. However, some components are not compatible especially for the screen-less devices.

    **Note:** On the screen-based Alexa enabled devices, the presentation of cards and images has limitations as per the Alexa skill kit specification.

    The Conversational Integration with Alexa application supports the following user input controls in Virtual Agent Designer.

    **Note:** Conversational Integration with Alexa also supports touch input for screen-based devices.
