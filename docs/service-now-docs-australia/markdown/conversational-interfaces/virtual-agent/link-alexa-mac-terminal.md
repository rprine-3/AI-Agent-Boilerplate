# Link Alexa events using the macOS Terminal

Link Alexa events using your macOS Terminal to complete the Alexa account linking process with your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Copy the Skill ID of your skill from the Alexa developer console. The Skill ID is the same inbound ID used in the sys\_cs\_provider\_application record.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  On your macOS, open the Terminal.

2.  Execute the `npm install -g ask-cli` command.

    Executing this command installs the Alexa command-line interface on your machine if it was not previously installed.

3.  Execute the `ask configure` command.

4.  Log in with your Amazon developer account credentials when prompted.

    **Note:** Choose **No** if you are asked the question **Do you want to link your AWS account in order to host your Alexa skills?**

5.  To download the manifest file, execute the `ask smapi get-skill-manifest -s {<provide skillId>} > skill.json` command.

6.  To edit the `skill.json` file, add the following JSON script inside the manifest object.

    ```
    "events": { 
          "endpoint": { 
            "uri": <provide lambda ID>.  
          }, 
          "subscriptions": [ 
            { 
              "eventName": "SKILL_ENABLED" 
            }, 
            { 
              "eventName": "SKILL_DISABLED" 
            }, 
            { 
              "eventName": "SKILL_PERMISSION_ACCEPTED" 
            }, 
            { 
              "eventName": "SKILL_PERMISSION_CHANGED" 
            }, 
            { 
              "eventName": "SKILL_ACCOUNT_LINKED" 
            } 
          ] 
        },
    ```

    **Note:** Be sure to edit the URL endpoint with the Lambda ID. You can copy one of the endpoints from the `skill.json` file and replace it with the Lambda ID. You can also fetch it from the Alexa console from **Build** &gt; **Endpoints**.

7.  To upload the updated manifest file, execute the `ask smapi update-skill-manifest -s {<provide skillId>} --manifest "$(cat skill.json)` command.


## Result

Your Alexa account is linked with your ServiceNow instance.

Your Alexa account is linked with your ServiceNow instance.
