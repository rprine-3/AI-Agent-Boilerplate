## Procedure

1.  Connect your company's Twilio account with your ServiceNow instance.

    1.  Log in to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).

    2.  From the Project Info pane of the Console Dashboard page, note down the authentication token.

        You will later use this token to authenticate the Twilio account on your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see the [Twilio documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs).

    3.  To specify the webhook URL, in the Twilio console, navigate to **Programmable Messaging** &gt; **Senders** &gt; **WhatsApp Senders**.

        To enable your Twilio account to send messages to your ServiceNow instance, enter the webhook URL in the following format: `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/api/sn_va_whatsapp_twi/message`.

    4.  Click your WhatsApp-enabled Twilio phone number.

    5.  In the **A MESSAGE COMES IN** field of the Configure WhatsApp Number dialog box, enter the webhook URL of your ServiceNow instance and click **Configure**.

2.  To authenticate incoming hash messages from the Twilio account, create a Hash Message Verification record that stores the Twilio authentication token.

    1.  In the navigation filter of your ServiceNow instance, enter `hash_message_verification.list`.

    2.  In the Hash Message Verifications list, click **New**.

    3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
