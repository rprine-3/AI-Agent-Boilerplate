# Virtual Agent interaction records

Each time a Virtual Agent conversation occurs, an interaction record captures the entire conversation in the Interactions \[interaction\] table. The record includes all topic elements used in the conversation, as well as live agent transfers.

## Interactions \[interaction\] table

Each conversation in an instance generates an interaction record in the Interactions \[interactions\] table, which logs the conversation between a requester and Virtual Agent. The interaction records include conversations that occur across the supported chat channels: chat widget, native mobile app, and messaging integrations.

**Note:** The Interactions table is part of the Interaction Management plugin \(com.glide.interaction\). Virtual Agent, Agent Chat, and Connect Support use this plugin.

These interaction records provide administrators, Virtual Agent administrators, support agents, and support managers with a convenient way to review what happened during a conversation. The records also provide a quick way to see the type of conversations that occur: Virtual Agent, live agent transfers to Agent Chat, and live agent transfers to Connect Support.

\[Omitted image "VA-interactions-table.png"\] Alt text: Key fields in the Interactions table, such as the Virtual Agent and Agent Chat fields that indicate the type of conversation.

**Note:** Conversation transcripts are available only for Virtual Agent records that have Virtual Agent conversations and live agent transfers to Agent Chat.

-   When a conversation transcript for live chat exceeds 4000 characters, the transcript is handled as an attachment to the interaction record.
-   File attachments that the user uploads are recorded in the Attachments \[sys\_attachment\] table, which corresponds to the interaction record. Attachments are automatically displayed in the activity stream.
-   For Virtual Agent conversations that have live agent transfers to Connect Support, only the Virtual Agent conversation is included in the interaction transcript. Live agent conversations in Connect Support are recorded in the activity stream.

## Key fields in the Interactions table

To view the Interactions table, navigate to **All**, and then enter `interaction.list` in the navigation filter. You can configure the fields displayed in the table using the [list collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/t_UseSlushbuckets.md) \(slushbucket\).

Agent average response time

</td><td>

Average time based on how long the agent takes to respond to each message sent by a requester. For example:

 ```
00:00 Requester: I have a question.
00:01 Agent: What is it?
00:04 Requester: How do I reset my password?
00:05 Requester: I forgot it and can't access my account.
00:07 Agent: Here is the answer.
```

 Pair \#1 00:01-00:00 = 00:01

 Pair \#2 00:07-00:04 = 00:03

 \(00:01 + 00:03\) / 2 = 00:02 average

</table>## Reasons for Closed Complete and Closed Abandoned states

Virtual Agent closes completed and abandoned conversations for various reasons, depending on whether the conversation is for Virtual Agent \(VA\) only, Virtual Agent with Live Agent \(VA-LA\), or Live Agent \(LA\).

\[Omitted image "va-interactions-reasons.png"\] Alt text: Interactions table that shows the State Reason column for Closed Abandoned and Closed Complete states.

The **State Reason** field provides details on the different ways in which a conversation ends. The following table describes the reasons and also the related message displayed for dashboard analytics. For details about how Virtual Agent and Agent Chat handle idle conversations and the corresponding default timeout periods, see [Closing Virtual Agent and Agent Chat conversations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-open-conversations.md).

</table>## Detailed view of a Virtual Agent interaction record

From the Interactions table, you can open a specific record to see additional details about the Virtual Agent interaction: a transcript of the conversation, related tasks, and interaction logs.

**Note:** If a field is not visible, you can add it to the form view. For more information, see [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md).

-   **Conversation transcript**

    The transcript shows the dialog exchange between the agent \(virtual or live\) and requester, as well as the time stamp for each dialog turn.

    \[Omitted image "VA-interaction-record.png"\] Alt text: A Virtual Agent chat transcript in a Virtual Agent interaction record.

-   **Related Tasks**

    Any cases, incidents, or requests created or updated during the conversation are automatically attached to the interaction record as a Related Task. To ensure that these tasks are included with the interaction record, design your conversation topics using certain Assistant Designer utilities and the system method vaSystem.attachRecordToConversation. For details, see [Topic design considerations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-interactions.md) below.

    \[Omitted image "VA-interaction-relatedtask.png"\] Alt text: The Related Tasks tab on the Interactions record shows the incident record that was created during the interaction.

-   **Interaction Logs**

    The **Interaction Logs** tab lists all the topics that run in a conversation, including the setup topics and the topics executed by topic discovery or by user selection. Each topic element is assigned a number that indicates the sequential order in which the topics run.

    \[Omitted image "VA-interaction-log-table.png"\] Alt text: The Interaction Logs tab on the Interactions record shows the topics that were run during the user interaction.


## Security considerations

Information in conversation transcripts is viewable to all users. If you need to control access to records containing sensitive information, you can use scoped access control lists \(ACLs\) and lock scripted access to those records by using the Restricted Caller Access \(RCA\) feature. For details, see Set application scope, application resource, and event access and [Manage Restricted Caller Access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/t_ConfigureSIM.md).

## Topic design considerations

If your Virtual Agent conversations create or update incidents, cases, or requests, consider designing your topics with the following [Virtual Agent Designer utilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-utilities.md) and system method:

-   [Action utility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-action.md) to create or update incidents or cases
-   [Lookup utility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-lookup.md) to view information
-   System method vaSystem.attachRecordToConversation\(String tableName, String sysId\) to attach the task to the interaction record

Use these utilities and system method so that incidents, cases, or requests created during a Virtual Agent conversation are included in the **Related Tasks** list of the interaction record.

**Note:** Records created or updated using the [Script Action utility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-script-action.md) are not captured as related tasks in the interaction record.
