# Using user search metrics with Virtual Agent

By using user search metrics with the Virtual Agent application, you can see your users' queries and the results from their searches. With these metrics, you can identify the areas where you can improve Virtual Agent to offer more meaningful search results.

Use the **User Search Metrics** tab in the Conversational Analytics dashboard to view key indicators about the queries that users searched on and the corresponding search results. By using this tab, you can get the answers to the following questions:

-   Which search results were not useful to the users?
-   Which queries did not have any search results?
-   Which were the most common queries from users?
-   Which search results did the users select most often?

To access the **User Search Metrics** tab, you must have the chat analytics admin role or the chat analytics viewer role. The following example shows the data included in the **User Search Metrics** tab.

## AI Search

Virtual Agent topics may use AI search to suggest helpful resources to the user. When a user enters a query, AI search provides the most relevant results by using intelligent query features. To know more about AI search, see [AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/overview-ais.md) . To integrate Virtual Agent with AI Search, see [Improving the user experience with AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-ai-search.md).

## Contextual Search

Contextual search matches keywords to an existing database search to find potential matches to a query. Virtual Agent topics may use contextual search to resolve queries. For more information, see [Maximizing code reuse with topic blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/topic-blocks-overview.md).

## Topic Links

Some Virtual Agent topics have links to useful resources that are embedded within them. When a user invokes one of these topics, the link shows up without having to do any back-end search.

## User Search information

The following table describes user search indicators visualized on the **User Search Metrics** tab.
