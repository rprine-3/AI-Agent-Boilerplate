# Contextual actions for custom chat integrations

Commands with a pre-defined behavior can be mapped to certain user-friendly keywords and passed as user input. This input is mapped to supported contextual actions for the most appropriate response in the chat.

## Getting started with contextual actions

User inputs can be mapped to a contextual action in two ways.

-   UI-based mapping of comma-separated keywords to available contextual actions. For example: Hi, Hola - Start Conversation
-   Script-based mapping of user actions to available contextual actions. For example: User clicks "Start" menu - Start Conversation

## Available contextual actions

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Agent|Command to request transfer to a live agent|
|Bye|Command to end a conversation with a live agent or a virtual agent whenever you are outside of a topic-selection prompt|
|Help|Command to request help using the bot|
|Hi|Command to start or end a conversation|
|Logout|Command to unlink the user messaging account from ServiceNow|
|Notifications|Command to subscribe or unsubscribe from receiving notifications|
|Restart|Command to end a bot conversation that is either in progress or runs into an error, and then begin a new conversation|
