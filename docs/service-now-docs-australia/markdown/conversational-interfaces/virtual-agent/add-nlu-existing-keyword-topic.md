# Add NLU to an existing keyword topic

Create and map an NLU model group and intent for the topic from Assistant Designer Asset library.

## Before you begin

[Configure NLU on the instance in Virtual Agent General Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configure-nlu-settings.md).

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Assisant Designer**.

2.  Select the **Asset library** tab.

3.  Set the discovery type toggle switch to **NLU/Keyword**.

4.  Open an existing topic.

5.  Select the **Properties** tab.

6.  In the **NLU Model** field, do one of the following:

    **Note:** If the **NLU model** field does not appear and you have ServiceNow Otto enabled, ensure that you haven't selected an LLM topic. Navigate back to the Topics page and select a topic that has the **Model Type** set to **NLU/Keywords**.

    -   Choose an existing model.
    -   Select **Create Model** to create a new model group.

        1.  In the **Model Name** field, enter a name for the new model group.
        2.  In the **Intent name** field, accept the default value or enter a name for the new intent.
        **Note:** New models are created in **Draft** state.

7.  In the **Associated Intent** field, do one of the following:

    -   Choose an existing intent.
    -   Select **Create intent** to create a new intent.

        In the **Intent Name** field, accept the default value or enter a name for the new intent.

8.  In the **Keywords** field, enter key phrases or terms that users enter to initiate the conversation with the Virtual Agent.

    Press **Enter** after each phrase. Keywords are also used for languages that are currently not available in NLU.

9.  Select the **NLU Intent** tab, and then add utterances and associate entities with them.

    For more information about adding utterances, see [Create an NLU intent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-nlu-intent.md). For more information about defining entities, see [Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/entities.md).

10. Make any other changes on the **Flow** tab, such as associating entities with a node or adding entities as input variables for the topic.

11. When you're finished with the topic, select **Save** in the topic header bar.


## Result

The modified topic is in the inactive state until you publish it.
