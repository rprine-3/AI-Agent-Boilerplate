# Configure a Virtual Agent chat experience

Change the preconfigured Virtual Agent default chat experience or create a custom chat experience for your users. You can configure setup topics, specify promoted topics, and if needed, change the search profile.

## Before you begin

If you want to specify custom setup topics or promoted topics that are displayed to your users in the chat window, make those topics active \(published\) so that they're available for configuration in the chat experience.

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

The default chat experience provides the default settings for the setup topics and the Virtual Agent search configurations in your instance. A custom chat experience uses the default settings from the default chat experience, but you can override them as needed. Defining a chat experience includes the following steps:

1.  Configure setup topics.
    -   Activate setup topics that are not initially enabled, such as the Anything else, Survey topic, and AI Search Fallback topic types.

        **Note:** If you upgraded from the Quebec release, the AI Search Fallback topic is deactivated by default. Enable it to return AI Search results as a fallback when Virtual Agent can't determine intents, topics, or keywords.

    -   If you want setup topics to be included in topic discovery and listed in the All topics menu, be sure to include those setup topics in the default or a custom chat experience.
    -   Deactivate setup topics if you don't want them to run in your conversations.
2.  Promote up to six topics that are initially displayed to your users, above the **Show me everything** button in the chat window. Promoted topics are supported only on the web and mobile clients.
3.  Change the Search Application configuration in the Search Profile, if needed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Select **Virtual Agent** and under Custom Greetings and Setup, select **View All**.

3.  Define the chat experience.

    Do one of the following:

    -   To change the setup topics, promoted topics, or AI Search setting in the default chat experience, proceed to Step 5 or 6, depending on what you want to change.

        **Note:** The settings for the default chat experience are preconfigured \(read-only\).

    -   To define a new experience, select **New** and complete the fields in Custom Greetings and Setup. Then proceed to Step 4.
    -   To edit a custom experience, select the custom experience record and select **Edit** to update Custom Greetings and Setup.

</table>4.  Select **Create custom experience** if this is a new custom chat experience.

    -   The settings for the setup and promoted topics are empty. The setup topics and promoted topics specified for the default chat experience are used automatically, unless you override them by adding new topics or changing them in your custom experience.
    -   To change the setup topics, promoted topics, or AI search settings in the default experience, proceed to the next steps.
5.  Select the **Setup Topics** tab.

    The default experience for new instances automatically includes most of the pre-built setup topics in your conversations, except for the Anything else and Survey topics. If you upgraded from the Quebec or Rome release, the AI Search fallback topic type is also not active.

    **Note:** the Live Agent and Virtual Agent Feedback topics are not listed in the Virtual Agent topic picker \(All Topics\) menu by default. You must associate a setup topic type to a setup topic as part of the default or custom chat experience.
