# Control topic visibility in Virtual Agent messaging channels

Suppress the display of a topic in a Virtual Agent messaging channel by using a condition script that excludes the topic from a channel.

## Before you begin

Roles required:

-   virtual\_agent\_admin or admin
-   Administrator for third-party applications

## About this task

In your condition script for the topic, use a context variable to identify the messaging channel that excludes this topic.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Assistant Designer**.

2.  Select the **Asset library** tab.

3.  Select the topic for updating or select **+Create** to start a new topic.

4.  Navigate to the **Properties** page, and open **Who can access this topic** under Advanced properties.

5.  In the Context section, select **Condition** followed by **Add Condition**.

6.  Enter a condition script that identifies the messaging channel \(Slack, Microsoft Teams, Workplace from Facebook, or Facebook Messenger\) from which the topic will be excluded.

    You can use the following example script, which contains the **vaContext.deviceType** variable, to identify the messaging channel that excludes the topic: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Workplace, and Facebook Messenger.

    ```
    (function execute()
    { if(vaContext.deviceType === 'Slack' || vaContext.deviceType === 'Teams' || vaContext.deviceType=='Facebook' || vaContext.deviceType=='Messenger'){
    return false;
    }
    return true;
    })()
    ```

7.  To save the topic properties, click **Save**.


## Result

Publishing the topic deploys it to the Virtual Agent messaging channels, except for the Virtual Agent channels that you specified in the topic condition script. A keyword or an intent \(if using NLU/Keyword\) does not trigger the topic.
