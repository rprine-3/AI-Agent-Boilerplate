# Card bot response control

Use the Card bot response control in a Virtual Agent topic to upload and display selected information from a record on your instance. You can include rich content, such as a video or image.

A card can contain record information, an image, or a YouTube video content in a compact format. The compact format is designed for readability within the chat window.

The Card bot response can show the following types of content:

-   Record: Displays content from a single record on your instance. This record can be referenced from variables in the flow or queried using a script returning a single Glide record from a selected table. The record content includes the display field for the table at the top of the card, followed by other fields specified by the properties of the bot response.
-   Image: Displays a large or small image that you provide, along with a title and description. The property sheet provides a pre-configured template for the card layout. Specify the title, description, and the image source.
-   YouTube video: Displays in an inline video player if supported on the channel. The image is displayed along with a title, description, and hyperlink to relevant content.

    In the Australia release, only YouTube videos are supported.

    **Tip:** You can also use the [Video bot response control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-video-bot-response.md) to include YouTube videos in conversations. The Video bot response control includes a navigation button that pauses the conversation. If you want the user to watch the video before continuing with the conversation, use this navigation button. When users have finished watching the video, they can click this navigation button to continue with the conversation.


**Note:** If you previously created conversations that use the [HTML bot response control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-html-output.md) to generate card layouts, consider updating your conversations to use the Card bot response control. The Card displays information from a record in your instance and contains a link to that related record. Or, it can display images and can include rich content such as a video.

If you upload an image, the selected image is uploaded to the server and is stored in the Images \[sys\_db\_image\] table and in the update sets. When the image is stored in the Images table and the update sets, you can use the image in a production or non-production instance, as needed.

</table>## Example Glide record query

```
(function execute(table) {
    /* Write a glide record query, and return the glide record.
       For example:
       
       var now_GR = new GlideRecord(table);
       gr.addEncodedQuery('active=true^number=INC0010099');
       gr.query();
       if(gr.next()) {
          return gr;
    }
    */
})(table)

```

In this example, the script creates a GlideRecord object, populates this object using a query that should return a single result, then returns the object. The **Table** property defines the table used in this query.
