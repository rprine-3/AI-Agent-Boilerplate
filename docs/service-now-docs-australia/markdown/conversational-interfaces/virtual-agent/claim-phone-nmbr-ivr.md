# Claim a phone number

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Log into your AWS Console and look for the Amazon Connect Instance you created.

2.  Log in as an administrator into your Amazon Connect instance.

3.  Navigate to **Channels** &gt; **Phone numbers** and click **Claim a number**.

4.  On the Claim Phone number form, select either the **Toll free** Country or the **DID \(Direct Inward Dialing\)** Prefix and select the number.

5.  Claim a phone number to the SN\_CI\_CC\_Inbound\_Contact\_Flow from the Phone numbers section in the navigator.

6.  Provide a description of your choice in the **Description** field, select SN\_CI\_CC\_Inbound\_Contact\_Flow from the **Contact flow / IVR** drop-down, and click **Save**.

    After the number is published, customers can make a call and start conversations with the Virtual Agent.

7.  Navigate to **Routing** &gt; **Queues** and select **BasicQueue**.

8.  On the Edit BasicQueue page, under Settings, specify a name for **Default caller ID name**.

9.  For the **Outbound caller ID number**, select the Phone number you claimed in Step 4.

10. Select **SN\_CI\_CC\_Outbound\_Contact\_Flow** for the **Outbound whisper flow**.

11. Click **Save**.
