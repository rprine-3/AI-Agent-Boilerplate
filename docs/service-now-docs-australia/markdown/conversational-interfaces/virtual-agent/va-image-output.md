Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Node name

</td><td>

Name that identifies this Image bot response control node in the topic flow.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Image URL link

</td><td>

The URL link to an image file you want to include in the conversation. To set a value, do one of the following:-   Specify the image URL by using the text field, data pill, or script.
-   Upload an image by clicking **Upload Image**.

 If you upload an image, then the selected image is uploaded to the server and is stored in the Images \[sys\_db\_image\] table and in the update sets. When the image is stored in the Images table and the update sets, then you can use the image in a production or non-production instance, as needed.

 After the image is uploaded, the URL link is included in the**Response Properties** sheet:

 \[Omitted image "va-upload-image-with-link-example.png"\] Alt text: Uploaded link shown in the property sheet.

 Click the link to view the image.

 The URL is generated dynamically. The name of the instance is inserted at the front of the URL path.

 You can change or delete the link to the image. If you delete the link on this property sheet, only the reference to the URL is deleted. The image remains on the server for future use.
