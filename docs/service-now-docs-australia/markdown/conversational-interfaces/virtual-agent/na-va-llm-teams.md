# Using ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent conversations with Microsoft Teams

The ServiceNow Otto provides you with the large language model \(LLM\)-based conversational experience during your conversations with a Now Virtual Agent bot or a Self-configured bot that is integrated with Microsoft Teams.

To enable a bot with LLM-based capabilities and experience LLM-based conversations with ServiceNow Otto, you must first integrate your Now Virtual Agent bot or a Self-configured bot with Microsoft Teams.

## Integrating Microsoft Teams with Virtual Agent

You can integrate Virtual Agent with Microsoft Teams either with your Now Virtual Agent bot or the Self-configured bot.

To integrate Microsoft Teams with the Now Virtual Agent, see [Integrate Virtual Agent with Microsoft Teams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-integ-msteams.md).

To integrate Microsoft Teams with a Self-configured bot, see [Integrating Virtual Agent with Microsoft Teams using the self-configured bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-integ-teams-self-configured-bot.md).

## Conversational experience with ServiceNow Otto in Microsoft Teams

The ServiceNow Otto provides a new AI Search experience in channels with the following features:

    You can navigate through multiple pages of choices and search for specific items or users, using the Search bar.

    When you select an LLM-enabled topic, the Search bar is displayed along with the available choices related to the selected topic and the **More options** button. You can either search for an item or user using the Search bar or pick an item or user from the available choices. If you want to look for more available options, you can navigate to the next page using the **More Options** button. If you would like to go back to the previously listed choices, you can use the **Previous Options** button.

    If you have searched for a user or an item, the choices related to your search term are displayed. You can either select from the choices available or reset the search and pagination.

    **Tip:** You can reset the Pagination and Search by selecting Enter in the Search bar.

    The Pagination and Search capabilities are managed by the following provider properties:

    -   **picker\_pagination\_experience\_supported**: Enables the pagination experience in your LLM conversations with ServiceNow Otto. The default value of this property is **true**.
    -   **picker\_pagination\_limit**: Sets the page limit value for an adapter for displaying the choices. The maximum page limit value that can be set for an adapter is **100**.

        For example, if a topic has fewer than 100 choices available and the limit is set to 100, then the **More Options** button is not displayed. If a topic has more than 100 choices available when the limit is to 100, then the **More Options** button is displayed.

-   **Generative AI QnA card**

    Use this feature to ask questions and get answers from ServiceNow Otto through LLM in a card format. The response is displayed with a sparkle image, the legal disclaimer, and the citation about the question asked.
