# Resolve Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) topic discovery issues

If an intent is not being chosen when expected, you can troubleshoot NLU prediction errors.

## Quick troubleshooting tips

If a Virtual Agent is not being discovered, check the following:

-   **Is NLU enabled for the session language?**

    Enable the language in Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) settings for Virtual Agent. For details, see [Enable NLU languages in Virtual Agent settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/enable-langs-va-gen-settings.md).

-   **Is the NLU Model trained and published for the session language?**

    Your topic may not be using the latest changes to your model. For ServiceNow® NLU, see [Train and try your NLU model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-train-nlu-model.md) and [Publish a Virtual Agent topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/publish-virtual-agent-topic.md).

-   **Is the Virtual Agent topic published, discoverable, and bound to a published NLU Model and Intent for the session language?**

    The topic should be bound to a single model and intent for a given language. Ensure there are no duplicate intents bound to other topics. Make sure that the topic, model, and intent are in the same domain. For more information, see [Publish a Virtual Agent topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/publish-virtual-agent-topic.md).

-   **Are any roles or conditions specified for the Virtual Agent topic on the Properties tab in Virtual Agent Designer?**

    If the topic is shown only for certain roles or for certain conditions, this can impede topic discovery. For details, see [Topic Properties tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/vad-topic-properties-tab.md).

-   **Why did Virtual Agent discover my topic in Spanish but not in French?**

    There are several possibilities:

    -   Not all languages are supported by all NLU providers. For details, see [Language support for NLU services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/language-support-nlu-services.md).
    -   Not all topics are bound to a language-specific NLU model and intent.

        For example, Topic A may be mapped as follows:

        -   Bound to Model A and Intent A for English
        -   Bound to Model A and Intent A for Spanish
        -   NOT bound to a model or intent for French
        In this scenario, create a French model and intent for the topic. For more information, see [Multilingual model management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/multilingual-model-managent.md).

-   **Why did a topic variable NOT slot fill?**

    Check the following:

    -   The topic's user input node was not configured with an associated entity. Use the **NLU entity** property for the node in Virtual Agent Designer.

        \[Omitted image "input-node-nlu-entity-field.png"\] Alt text: Specify an existing entity in the NLU entity list.

    -   The prediction result contained an NLU entity with a confidence score that was less than the configured confidence threshold.
    -   The NLU entity value for the node was invalid. For example, you can't apply the word "red" to a Date/Time entity type.
-   **Test discovery from the topic.**

    Do one of the following:

    -   In the Asset library, slide the discovery type toggle switch to **NLU/Keyword**, then select **Test NLU/Keyword Topics**. Enter your utterance, and watch the **Analysis** tab.
    -   Open the topic in Virtual Agent Designer, then select **Test**. In the Test window, select the **Include topic discovery** check box. Enter your utterance, and watch the **Analysis** tab.
    For details, see [Testing NLU/Keyword topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-designer-testing.md). For an understanding of how topic discovery works, see [Natural Language Understanding topic discovery logic in Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/how-topic-discovery-works.md).

-   **Is "Setup Topic" the topic in question?**

    If so, it needs to be configured in Conversational Interfaces Chat Settings for it to be discovered. For details, see [Configure a Virtual Agent chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configure-default-chat-experience.md).

-   **Questions or issues with mid-topic switching.**
    -   **Why did the conversation return to Topic A after Virtual Agent switched to Topic B?**

        The **Resume topic flow after topic switching** attribute is enabled on the topic. You can find this toggle switch on the **Properties** tab under **Advanced properties** &gt; **Additional**.

    -   **Why did the conversation NOT return to Topic A after Virtual Agent switched to Topic B?**

        The **Resume topic flow after topic switching** attribute is disabled on the topic. You can find this toggle switch on the **Properties** tab under **Advanced properties** &gt; **Additional**.

    -   **If Virtual Agent doesn't find an intent, will it use a keyword search in mid-topic?**

        No.

    -   **Are Topic A's variables available to Topic B after switching?**

        No.

    -   **Are Topic B's variables available to Topic A when Topic A resumes?**

        No.


For additional troubleshooting, check the information in the following tables.

## Check NLU prediction information in the Open NLU tables

When reviewing or debugging topics that use Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\), you can use various Open NLU tables to view the NLU prediction results for your topics. For example, the Open NLU Predict Intent Feedbacks and Open NLU Predict Entity Feedbacks tables provide detailed information on the NLU processing performed by applications \(such as Virtual Agent\) to determine topic intent and entities \(slot filling\).

-   **Open NLU Predict Intent Feedbacks table**

    The Open NLU Predict Intent Feedbacks \[open\_nlu\_predict\_intent\_feedback\] table shows the intent processing that an application \(in this case Virtual Agent\) performs in response to an NLU intent prediction result. The goal for Virtual Agent is to map a predicted NLU intent to a Virtual Agent topic. Whenever Virtual Agent suggests a topic, a record of the prediction result is added to this table. If Virtual Agent doesn't find a topic, no prediction occurs, and a record marked **Skipped** is added to this table.

    To view the table, navigate to **All**, and then enter `open_nlu_predict_intent_feedback.list` in the navigation filter.

</table>-   **Open NLU Predict Logs**

    The Open NLU Predict Logs \[open\_nlu\_predict\_log\] table provides a consolidated overview of the NLU prediction records for topics. Each record in the log identifies the utterance and corresponding intents \(topics\) and entities determined by the NLU service. Each record also includes the NLU prediction scores calculated during topic discovery \(intent matching\) and entity extraction.

    **Note:** NLU prediction node logs are generated automatically. If you're using node logs for debugging but you want to suppress the automatic generation of NLU prediction node logs, add the **com.glide.opennlu.predict.node\_logging\_enabled** system property and set the value to false.
