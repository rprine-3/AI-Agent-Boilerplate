# File Picker user input control

Use the File Picker user input control in a Virtual Agent topic to prompt a user to upload an image or any file type. After the user uploads an image file, the image appears immediately in the Virtual Agent client.

## File Picker user input control properties

All file types are supported by the file picker, except the SVG format for image files. Although the image can be high resolution, the image displayed in the Virtual Agent client is scaled based on the aspect ratio. Images scale to fit within the chat window.

In Microsoft Teams, a file can be uploaded through the paper clip \(attachment\) icon, or using drag-and-drop. Copying and pasting only works for image files. Users can share attachments on Microsoft Teams through the Virtual Agent file picker user input control, and by sending attachments while chatting with a live agent.

The live agent picker scenario:

-   Doesn't support the SVG format for image files.
-   Supports a combination of text, files, and emojis. However, orders may show up differently between how a user sends these items versus how an agent views these items.
-   Doesn't support formatted text.

When a file upload is in progress, you can't upload or enter text for the file picker control. The uploaded files go through a virus scan and validation.

You can link an uploaded file to a case you create using the Record Action utility. For more information, see [Record Action utility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-record-action-util.md).

The following table lists the details about the properties of the File Picker.

Confirmation messages

</td></tr><tr><td>

Input completion confirmation

</td><td>

Bot response shown to the user when the node interaction is complete. The message can be either a text string or a script that returns text. For example, if you're using dot-walking: `Thanks, (Input Variables > Username)!` Or if you're using a script, the acknowledgement might be: `Thanks, {{vaInputs.username}}!`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default value confirmation

</td><td>

Message that asks the user to verify that the value in the **Default value** field is correct. This message is used instead of a value in the **Prompt** field. It can contain either a text string or a script that returns text. For example, if you're using dot-walking: `Are you (Input Variables > Username)?` Or if you're using a script, the confirmation message might be: `Are you {{vaScripts.lastUsername}}?`.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Hide or skip this node

</td></tr><tr><td>

Conditionally show this node if

</td><td>

No-code condition statement or low-code script that specifies a condition for presenting this node in the conversation. The condition must evaluate to true.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow user to skip this node if

</td><td>

No-code condition statement or low-code script that specifies a condition for letting users skip this node in the conversation. The condition must evaluate to true. You can set this field using either the condition builder or a script.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Skip reprompting if

</td><td>

No-code condition statement or low-code script that specifies a condition for letting users skip reprompting in the conversation. When a preceding node is revisited through a topic loopback or Dialog Act, Virtual Agent bypasses this node and automatically retains its original value.
