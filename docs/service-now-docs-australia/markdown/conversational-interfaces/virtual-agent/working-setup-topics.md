# Working with setup topics

Setup topics are part of a standard conversation structure applied to all your conversations, such as the welcome greeting or fallback responses. Setup topics run at the appropriate spot in a conversation based on the context, keywords, or utterances entered by the user, and any conditions that are specified for the setup topic.

You define setup topics in a Virtual Agent chat experience using the Custom Greetings and Setup option. A chat experience sets the context in which users run Virtual Agent. This context includes:

-   Setup topics applied to bot conversations.
-   A small list of topics, called promoted topics, initially displayed in the chat window.
-   AI Search configuration used to display AI Search results for your users.

For more information on chat experiences, see [Customizing a Virtual Agent chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-conversation-settings.md). For details on configuring a chat experience, see [Configure a Virtual Agent chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configure-default-chat-experience.md).

**Note:** Setup topics in conversations are discoverable \(via topic discovery\) only when they're [configured in a Virtual Agent chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configure-default-chat-experience.md) using the **Custom Greetings and Setup** option. If any setup topics are not included in a chat experience, those setup topics are not listed in the chat window's All Topics menu \(topic picker\) and cannot be discovered by Virtual Agent.

Setup topics run during a conversation as follows.

1.  Conversation beginning: Virtual Agent presents the Greeting topic and the list of available topics \(Virtual Agent capabilities\) that the user can select.

    **Note:** If you want the chat window to immediately take users to a live agent, do not select the Live Agent Support topic as a greeting. Instead, use the system method to [transfer to a live agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/transfer-to-live-agent.md).

2.  Conversation body: These setup topics are presented at different points in the conversation depending on the context:
    -   User requests help: Virtual Agent presents the Explore help topic \(Virtual Agent capabilities\).
    -   User enters a request or keyword that Virtual Agent doesn't understand: Virtual Agent presents the Fallback topic, unless the AI Search fallback topic is enabled.
    -   If the AI Search Fallback topic is enabled and the user enters a request or keyword but Virtual Agent can't find a matching topic or keyword, or finds too many topics to determine the matching topic: Virtual Agent runs AI Search to generate relevant search results for the user. If the AI Search results do not help the user, or if the AI Search Fallback setup topic is not activated, Virtual Agent runs the Fallback topic.
    -   An unrecoverable system error occurs during conversation: Virtual Agent runs the Error Handling topic, and then transfers the user to a live agent.
    -   User requests a transfer to live agent: Virtual Agent runs the Live Agent topic, which transfers the user to a live agent.
    -   After a task or user request is completed: Virtual Agent runs the Anything else topic to ask if the user wants to continue with another request or task.
3.  Conversation ending:
    -   If the user doesn't want further assistance after a task or the request is completed, Virtual Agent presents the Survey topic for feedback on the conversational experience.
    -   After the survey, Virtual Agent confirms that the feedback has been received, and runs the Closing topic to end the conversation.

The default setup topics are read-only and have topic names with a period at the end of the setup topic name, such as **Greeting**. You can create your own custom setup topics by duplicating a setup topic and changing it as needed. You can also change prompts or add other controls to the topic, just as you might when creating other topics.

If you want a closing message to be different from the default Closing topic, create a custom setup topic that contains the revised closing text. You also need to create an intent for that custom setup topic in the NLU model for setup topics, or define topic keywords in the Topic Properties page. You can then select the custom setup topic to be used in a custom chat experience instead of using a default setup topic.

The following table provides examples of the pre-built setup topics in the default chat experience.

 After the users provide their feedback, a message confirms that their feedback has been received:

 **Note:** To change the probability \(percentage\) that the survey setup topic occurs in your conversations, change the value in the **com.glide.cs.survey.probability** system property. To display the survey setup topic randomly in 50% of your Virtual Agent conversations, set the **Value** to 0.50.
