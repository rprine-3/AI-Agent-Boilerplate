# Grouped Choice user input control

Use the Grouped Choice user input control in a Virtual Agent topic to list multiple groups of choices in one message.

## Grouped Choice list display

The Grouped Choice list prompts users to select related choices in one message through the default **Select a choice** button. You can enable multi-select for each choice's group and also provide images and short descriptions to create a richer user experience. Users are presented with groups of choices where they're required to submit one selection before returning to the Virtual Agent topic.

Inputs are recorded on the Interactions \[interactions\] table. For more information, see [Virtual Agent interaction records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-interactions.md).
