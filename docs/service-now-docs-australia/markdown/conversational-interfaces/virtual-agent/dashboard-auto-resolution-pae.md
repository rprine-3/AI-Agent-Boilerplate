# Issue auto-resolution tab

The **Issue auto-resolution** tab helps you understand how well your Virtual Agent \(VA\) chatbot anticipates user needs. It displays information about the number of user issues intercepted by the auto-resolution service and resolved by VA.

Issue auto-resolution takes place when a user is diverted to VA from a non-conversational interface. For example, a user might request a new keyboard through a service portal or email. The auto-resolution service can detect the user request and use VA to resolve the user's request in a VA chatbot session. For more information, see [Auto Resolution for Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/auto-resolution-va.md).

The indicators in the **Issue auto-resolution** tab display how well the auto-resolution service is working. This tab is available only when Issue Auto Resolution is enabled and the **Auto Resolution Configuration** record is set as active.

To access the **Issue auto-resolution** tab, you must have the chat analytics admin role or the chat analytics viewer role.
