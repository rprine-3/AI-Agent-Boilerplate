# Topic Properties tab

Use the **Topic Properties** tab to identify a topic and how it's used. You can control who uses the topic and what channels it can run in.

The properties that you can specify depend on the method of topic discovery.

Two methods are available in Assistant Designer: large language model \(LLM\) or Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\)/Keyword.

For example, if you enable NLU/Keyword in Virtual Agent settings, the topic **Properties** tab includes fields for identifying the NLU model and intent for the topic.

For more information, see [Creating a Virtual Agent topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/create-virtual-agent-topic.md).
