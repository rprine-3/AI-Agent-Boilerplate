# Integrate Virtual Agent with Google Chat

Add either the Now Virtual Agent bot or self-configured bot to your ServiceNow instance to integrate with Google Chat.

## Before you begin

Install the Google Chat plugin \[sn\_va\_google-chat\] on your ServiceNow instance before adding any integrations.

For more information on Now Virtual Agent integrations with Google Chat, see [Exploring Conversational Integration with Google Chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/exploring-ci-google-chat.md).

Role required: admin or virtual\_agent\_admin.

## About this task

**Note:** The two bot types for integrating Virtual Agent with other channels have notable differences. Use the appropriate bot for your instance.

-   The Virtual Agent bot is prebuilt, and is faster and easier to deploy, but is limited to one instance per tenant.
-   The self-configured bot takes more time to create and deploy, but you have full control over the bot's registration, and it's available for multiple instances per tenant.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Channels and Integrations**.

2.  In the Available Channels section, select the **Add Integration** drop-down menu on the Google Chat tile.\[Omitted image "add-google-chat-integration.png"\] Alt text: Google chat tile with integration options under drop-down menu.

    **Note:** The Google Chat tile and its **Add Integration** drop-down menu is available only after installing the Google Chat plugin \(sn\_va\_google-chat\) on your ServiceNow instance.

3.  Sign in to your Google Chat account to complete the integration.

    **Note:** If you're using the self-configured bot, do not check the **Join spaces and group conversations** box in the Enabled APIs &amp; services tab. Conversational Integration with Google Chat only supports 1-on-1 conversations.


## Result

If an automated welcome message displays in the chat window, Google Chat is ready to use with Virtual Agent in your instance.
