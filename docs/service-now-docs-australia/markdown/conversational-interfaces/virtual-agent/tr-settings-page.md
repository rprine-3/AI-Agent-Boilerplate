# Topic Recommendations settings

Use the Topic Recommendations settings page to configure analysis reports based on your ServiceNow® data.

You can find the Topic Recommendations settings in the Conversational Interfaces Chat Settings \(**All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**\) under Virtual Agent. When you first install Topic Recommendations, nothing is configured, so the settings page appears empty.

\[Omitted image "tr-settings-new-install.png"\] Alt text: The Topic Recommendations settings page is empty until you configure reports.

Once configured, you can view or edit analysis reports on this page.

\[Omitted image "tr-settings-configured.png"\] Alt text: The Topic Recommendations settings page with two configured reports by data source: sc\_request and incident.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter by

</td><td>

Condition builder for filtering the records to be analyzed. Click **Set conditions** to open the condition builder.The default filter is **\[Created\] \[after\] \[Last 90 days\]**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Frequency

</td><td>

The schedule for running the analysis, which is triggered through the Run Topic Recommendation Reports scheduled job:-   None
-   Every Month
-   Every 3 Months
-   Every 6 Months
-   Every 12 Months

**Note:** If you're using a non-production instance for testing, set the analysis schedule in your production instance so that it and your analysis history are retained. The intent discovery process works best in a single instance, where data is not promoted between instances.
