# Hide or reveal the Show me everything button

Set properties to hide or reveal the Show me everything button in Virtual Agent LLM \(large language model\) conversations.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

Duplicate the Virtual Agent greeting Setup topic you want to use for your conversation. For example, **Now Assist - Greeting**. For more information, see [Duplicating a Virtual Agent topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/duplicate-virtual-agent-topic.md).

## About this task

The greeting topic of a Virtual Agent includes a **Show me everything** button by default. This button displays the full list of available Virtual Agent topics, and a search filter. Use the following instructions to hide the **Show me everything** button in your Virtual Agent conversations.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Assistant Designer**.

2.  Select the **Asset library** tab.

3.  Open the greeting Setup topic you've duplicated.

    The topic opens in Assistant Designer Asset library.

4.  In the Flow tab, select the **Send skill picker** node.\[Omitted image "sme-button-greeting-topic-flow.png"\] Alt text: Topic flow tab with Send skill picker node highlighted on canvas.

    The **Script action utility** control for the **Send skill picker** node opens in the property sheet.

5.  In the property sheet, select the **Script that defines the operation of the node** button \[Omitted image "icon-script.png"\] Alt text:.

    The **Action expression** script window opens.

6.  In Line 3 of the script, set the `"hideShowMeEverything"` value from `false` to true.\[Omitted image "sme-button-action-expression-window.png"\] Alt text: Send skill picker node Action Expression window with hideShowMeEverything value set to true.

7.  Select **Save**, then select **Publish**.

    The greeting Setup topic activates, and the **Show me everything** button disappears from the Virtual Agent chat where the topic is used.


## What to do next

To reveal the **Show me everything** button again, set the `"hideShowMeEverything"` value from `true` to false.

The duplicated greeting Setup topic is associated with the LLM assistant as the original topic. You can associate the duplicate with another LLM assistant.
