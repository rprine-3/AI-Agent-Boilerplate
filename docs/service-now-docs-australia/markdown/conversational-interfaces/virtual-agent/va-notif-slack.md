# Virtual Agent notifications supported in Slack

Slack app supports Virtual Agent notifications during conversations.

-   Subscription management
    -   Requesters - Use the **notification** \(or **notifications**\) command to subscribe to or unsubscribe from notifications.
    -   Admins - Enable notifications for messaging users in the Messaging Apps Integration page.
-   Notification content - Create notifications with rich content, images, and action buttons. Actionable notifications enable recipients to perform certain actions and respond to the notification, such as adding a comment or requesting a live agent.
-   Notification delivery
    -   Message notifications are delivered immediately to end users, even if the user is chatting with a virtual or live agent.
    -   Actionable notifications are delivered only when the user is not in an active conversation with a virtual or live agent. Users can choose to:
        -   Review the notifications later by using the **show notification** command.

            For example, with the **show notification** command, users can select the notification they want to view.

            \[Omitted image "Show-Notification-Buttons-slack.png"\] Alt text: The user enters "show notification" in the Slack window, and the bot responds with, "Thanks, select the notification you'd like to view," followed by two choices.

        -   Perform or skip the actions for the notification. If users decide to skip the actions, users can return later to the notification by using the **show notification** command.
