# Install the Conversational Integration with Slack

You can install the Conversational Integration with Slack \(sn\_va\_slack\) application if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   If you're using an earlier release of Virtual Agent, you must upgrade to the Australia release to use the features supported in this channel integration.
-   Conversational Integration with Slack requires the Glide Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\) to activate full functionality in Virtual Agent or the Virtual Agent Lite plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot.lite\) to activate a limited version of Virtual Agent. Activate the appropriate plugin before you install the integration.
-   Install the Conversational Integration with Slack app from the ServiceNow® Store.

    **Important:** Installing the Conversational Integration with Slack app from the ServiceNow Store activates the app for integration on your ServiceNow instance. If you have not installed the integration app, the Slack app is listed in the Available Channels section.

    After you install the Conversational Integration with Slack plugin \(sn\_va\_slack\), Slack is seen in the Integrations section, and you can proceed with the configuration.


Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin and external\_app\_install\_admin or admin

## About this task

Review these guidelines for using Virtual Agent with Slack or with Slack Enterprise Grid.

-   The Slack app creates a one-to-one association between the ServiceNow instance that you are installing from and the Slack workspace in which the integration runs.
    -   Use a separate Slack workspace for each instance that you plan to install the integration in.
    -   If you use a non-production instance for testing, use a Self-configured bot.

        For more information, see [Integrate your ServiceNow instance with a self-configured bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/integ-slack-self-config-bot.md).

-   Slack Enterprise Grid – If you have Slack Enterprise Grid workspaces, your end users can move between workspaces and use the Virtual Agent bot from any workspace.
    -   If you use a non-production instance for testing, use a workspace in a different grid or use a non-grid workspace.
    -   After installing this store release:
        -   Your messaging users are automatically linked to their ServiceNow accounts.
        -   If you clone an instance for non-production testing, be sure to run the installation again on the cloned target.
