# Debug a Virtual Agent topic

Investigate and resolve unexpected behavior in your custom Virtual Agent topics, topic blocks, and controls.

For information about topic discovery issues, see [LLM topic discovery in Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-llm.md) and [Resolve Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) topic discovery issues](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-topic-discovery-issues.md).

## Duplicate a live topic before debugging and changing it

Duplicate a topic rather than update a live topic. The unmodified original topic can serve as both a reference and a backup, and retaining the original enables you to restore the topic quickly. Remember to deactivate the original topic before publishing the duplicate.

## Debug a topic while testing your conversations

As you create or update a topic in Virtual Agent Designer, use the **Test** button in the topic header bar to preview the conversation. The chat test window shows the conversation as it appears within Service Portal. Elements in your conversation might appear differently in third-party messaging applications. Test your conversations in any third-party applications where you intend to deploy Virtual Agent.

The test chat window displays four tabs that provide detailed information for debugging and refining your topic: **Analyze test phrases**, **Variables**, **Context**, and **Logs**. For details on these tabs, see [Testing NLU/Keyword topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-designer-testing.md). The following example shows the processing messages and errors logged during testing.

## Watch for warnings on controls within your topic

\[Omitted image "va-control-warning.png"\] Alt text: Number of warnings shown in red on the canvas and on the individual controls. For the Text User Input control, Node Name and Prompt are mandatory

Controls that are missing necessary information show a red incomplete badge in the upper left corner of the control. The badge shows a number indicating the number of issues in that control. Select this badge to see a list of the issues in the control.

Another warning badge appears in the upper left corner of the canvas to indicate the number of issues within the entire topic.

## Check for errors when a topic preview does not run

Additional information appears in a Validation Issues tab on the sidebar of the Virtual Agent Designer canvas when an error prevents the topic from running. The total number of Issues are listed, along with details and a hyperlink for each node. Select a hyperlink to go to the node, and use the information provided to correct any errors in your conversation. You can close the tab without correcting the issues, but until the issues are corrected, the Validation Issues tab appears when you select **Publish**. The Validation Issues tab closes if you select **Publish** after correcting all issues.

</table>## Review topics that run in a conversation flow

Each Virtual Agent \(VA\) conversation in an instance automatically generates an interaction record in the Interactions \[interactions\] table, which logs the conversation between a requester and virtual and live agent. You can review the transcript of the conversation between the requester and virtual agent, including live agent transfers \(if using Agent Chat\). For details, see [Virtual Agent interaction records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-interactions.md).
