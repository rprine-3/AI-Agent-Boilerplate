# Define Virtual Agent notification contents

Create the content for a Virtual Agent notification delivered in a chat or messaging channel.

## Before you begin

-   Images for image cards must be 400 pixels wide or larger and must be in .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, .ico, or .svg format.
-   If you're upgrading from an earlier release and want ACLs observed for data displayed in record cards and parameter substitutions in chat notifications, set the **com.glide.cs.notification\_record\_access\_check** system property to true. The default value for this system property is false, which means that data is delivered regardless of the user's access level.

    **Note:** This property does not apply to advanced notifications.

-   Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

You can personalize Virtual Agent notifications by using parameter substitution to add dynamic content to the message header and message. When adding dynamic content to your notifications, you specify the variables that identify the record values to be included in the content. You can add dynamic content to the following types of notifications:

-   Record-based notifications - Use the `${<variable_name>}` format in your content to specify a variable that represents a record value from the table used for the notification. For example, if you want to customize the message heading for a notification that uses the Incident table and you want to include the incident **Priority** in the message, use the **Select variable** column to select the variable for incident priority.
-   Event-based notifications - Use the `${event.parm1}` and `${event.parm2}` format to specify event-specific parameters that pass record information in the notification content. To learn more about event parameters and how they work, see [Events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/events.md).
-   Advanced notifications - Modify a script provided for advanced notifications to specify dynamic content from different data sources and identify third-party services, such as URL shortening for streamlining links in the content.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Provider** &gt; **Notifications** and select the notification for which you're defining or updating content.

    -   If you're defining new content, navigate to the **Notification Contents** related list, select **New Provider Content**, and go to step 3.
    -   If you're updating content, navigate to the **Notification Contents** related list, select the content to be updated, and go to step 4.
