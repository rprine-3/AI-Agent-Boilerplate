# Auto-generate the manifest file for uploading on Microsoft Teams

Auto-generate the manifest file and customize the branding of your Microsoft Teams app so that you can make Virtual Agent available in your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

An automated manifest file generator on the new Microsoft Teams UI automatically fills in the bot ID and updates the other settings \(such as branding\) based on your input. The manifest file generator also enables a one-select download of the manifest package.

-   Before you generate a manifest file, you must create a self-configured bot \(or ensure that one has already been created\) in the ServiceNow instance. You can then generate a manifest package for each self-configured bot that you create​.
-   After you save the manifest form, you can download the manifest zip package, which contains the following three files:

    -   manifest.json
    -   color.png
    -   outline.png
    You can edit the manifest form and redownload it as many times as you want.​


**Note:** This feature is only applicable when you’re setting up the Virtual Agent integration with Microsoft Teams. If you intend to use ServiceNow for Microsoft Teams with ITSM or HR capabilities, select the **Learn more** link next to **Planning to enable additional ITSM and HR integrations** on the Bot Configuration page. That way, you can configure the manifest in a separate module instead of continuing to configure the manifest here. For more information, see [Create and download the manifest file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/download-manifest-file-mt.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  In **General Settings**, in the Channels and routing section, select **View All**.

3.  On the Channels and integrations page, in the Microsoft Teams tile, select **Manage**.

4.  In the Self-configured bot section, select the **Manage Bot** icon \[Omitted image "manage-bot-icon.png"\] Alt text: Manage Bot icon..

    If you haven't enabled Message Extension and you're accessing it for the first time, you see a Turn on new feature alert message. This message informs you that the Message Extension feature for your Microsoft Teams integration is now available to be turned on.

5.  On the **Configuration** tab, select **Edit configuration** and on the form, fill in the fields.

Message Extension or Copilot

</td><td>

This section allows you to activate Message extension if your bot is set up for NLU/Keyword, or activate Copilot if your bot is set up for for LLM. \(For more information on activating LLM for your bot, see [Display your assistant on a portal, channel, or mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/display-assistant-portal-channel.md).\)-   The Message extension check box appears if you configure your bot for NLU/Keyword. Message extension lets users search and share the results through the compose message area of the Microsoft Teams client.

If you're using this bot for Microsoft Copilot, then ensure that you enable **Message Extension**. \[Omitted image "message-extension-teams.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent conversation with Microsoft Copilot displaying the Message Extension enabled.

By enabling Message Extension for an app or bot, you will see the same app or bot in the message extension area while your conversation with the ServiceNow Otto using Microsoft Copilot.

-   Copilot: if you have configured your bot for LLM, this option replaces Message extension. Custom Engine Agent \(CEA\) replaces the Declarative Agent \(DA\) and allows you to use ServiceNow Otto functionality in Copilot.

The Sample Prompts window appears when you select the Copilot check box. Enter your prompts to your bot here to have the LLM follow those instructions.
