# Use system-derived entities in an NLU topic

Associate system-derived entities such as such as date, time, duration, or location with a node in a topic.

## Before you begin

Create the Booking Reservations NLU model and system entities \(`FromLocation` and `ToLocation`\) as described in [Create a system-derived entity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-system-derived-entity.md). In this example procedure, you will create a topic that can slot fill locations that are used in an utterance.

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  [Create a new topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/create-virtual-agent-topic.md) called `Booking Reservations`.

    When completing the **Properties** tab, make sure that you choose the Booking Reservations NLU model that you created in an earlier exercise.

2.  Drag a Text bot response component onto the canvas, and then select it.

    In the properties sheet, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Node name|Type `Intro`.|
    |Response Message|Type `Let's get you booked on a flight`.|

    \[Omitted image "sys-entities-example-1.png"\] Alt text: In the Text response properties, the Node name is "Intro," and the Response Message is, "Let's get you booked on a flight."

3.  Drag a Text user input component onto the canvas.

    In the properties sheet, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_p4m_fzy_2qb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Node name

</td><td>

Type `Fromwhere`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Prompt

</td><td>

Type `Where are you departing from?`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Input format

</td><td>

Select **Text**. This doesn't restrict the input format.

</td></tr><tr><td>

NLU entity

</td><td>

Select `FromLocation`.This list only shows existing entities, such as system entities or entities that you created for the model.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Do not ask users to confirm recognized entity

</td><td>

Select this option to avoid having Virtual Agent ask the user to confirm the location.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    \[Omitted image "sys-entities-example-2.png"\] Alt text: In the Fromwhere Text user input node, the prompt reads, "Where are you departing from?" The NLU entity used is FromLocation. Topic switching is enabled.

4.  Drag another Text user input component onto the canvas.

    In the properties sheet, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_bh3_y1z_2qb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Node name

</td><td>

Type `Towhere`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Type `Where are you heading?`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Input format

</td><td>

Select **Text**. This doesn't restrict the input format.

</td></tr><tr><td>

NLU Entity

</td><td>

Select `ToLocation`.This list only shows existing entities, such as system entities or entities that you created for the model.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Do not ask users to confirm recognized entity

</td><td>

Select this option to avoid having Virtual Agent ask the user to confirm the location.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable NLU to switch topics

</td><td>

Slide this toggle switch to enable topic switching.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    \[Omitted image "sys-entities-example-3.png"\] Alt text: In the Towhere Text user input node, the prompt reads, "Where are you heading?" The NLU entity used is ToLocation. Topic switching is enabled.

5.  Drag another Text bot response component onto the canvas, and then select it.

    In the properties sheet, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Node name|Type `Confirmation`.|
    |Response Message|Type `Great! I have you booked on a flight from [Fromwhere] to [Towhere]. Bon voyage!` Use dot-walking to replace `[Fromwhere]` and `[Towhere]` with the input variables you created in the previous nodes.|

    \[Omitted image "sys-entities-example-4.png"\] Alt text: The Confirmation node displays the message, "Great! I have you booked on a flight from blank to blank," which will be slot-filled from the Fromwhere and Towhere input variables.

6.  Click **Save**.


## What to do next

Use additional system-derived entities for your Booking a Reservation topic. For example, you can use system-derived entities to capture the dates that the user wants to travel.
