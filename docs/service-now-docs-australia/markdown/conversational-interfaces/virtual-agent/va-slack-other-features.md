# Virtual Agent features supported in Slack conversations

Virtual Agent features, such as AI Search results, Virtual Agent notifications, and controls for creating Virtual Agent conversations are supported in Slack bot conversations.

**Note:** Conversational Integration with Slack is not supported for on-prem instances.

This section highlights key Virtual Agent features that are supported in the Conversational Integration with Slack app.

## AI Search results

Virtual Agent can generate AI Search results that are displayed as Genius result cards and multiple-link outputs in conversations. The default AI Search configuration for Virtual Agent enables search results for Q&amp;A \(knowledge base\) and catalog items.

For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/now-assist-ais.md).

## Trusted domains

In custom chat integrations, the values specified in the Trusted media domains field of the Provider Channel Identities table \[sys\_cs\_provider\_application\] take precedence over values in the Connections table \[sys\_cs\_provider\], and therefore overrides.

## Chat localization into conversation language

Starting with version 5.0.1, chat gets localized into the customer-specified language set in the Slack UI, though the session language is different.

Translation of responses to the conversation language is done using the function `gs::getMessageLang(str, lang)`, where the language retrieved from Slack is passed through this function as a parameter. The translation process works with the following three use cases, as follows:

-   The requested language plugin is available in the ServiceNow instance.

    When the requested language plugin is available in the ServiceNow instance, the session language honors the conversation language set by the user.

-   The requested language plugin is absent, but a fallback language is configured​.

    When the requested language plugin is absent, the fallback language specified in the \[sys\_language\] table is used for the translation process. However, for the fallback mechanism to work, you must enable the **glide\_i18n.language\_fallback\_enabled** system property. By default, the value of the property is **false**. Set it to **true** to enable the fallback mechanism. For more information, see [Set a fallback language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/set-fallback-language.md).

-   The requested language plugin is absent, but a fallback language is not configured.

    When the requested language plugin is absent and fallback is not configured, the default translation language will be English.
