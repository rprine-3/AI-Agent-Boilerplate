# Use filters in the Users tab

You can use filters to get a deeper understanding of User data.

## Filter using the filter editor

The filter editor enables you to filter users based on one or more conditions. You can either select an existing filter from the list or create a new filter using the editor.

The filter editor consists of the following:

-   Field: A list based on relevant tables.
-   Operator: A list of operations that is contextually generated based on the selected field.
-   Value: A text entry field or a list that is contextually generated based on the selected field.

To remove a condition, select the delete icon \[Omitted image "delete-icon.png"\] Alt text: Delete icon. next to the condition. To add dependent conditions in the condition builder, either select **or** or **and**. To filter the conversations list using the condition, select **Update**.

To save a condition that you created in the filter editor, select **Save filter**. In the Save Filter pop-up window, specify a name for the filter. You can also set permissions for the filter in the Save Filter window. Users having the Chat Analytics Viewer \(chat\_analytics\_viewer\) role can select and modify your saved filters.
