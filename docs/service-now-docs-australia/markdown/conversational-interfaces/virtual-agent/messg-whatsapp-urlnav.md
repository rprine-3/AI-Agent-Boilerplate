# Set the URL navigation for WhatsApp chat

When agents share links in their WhatsApp chat conversations, customize the portal that those links point to. For example, you can configure links to point to your brand’s portal, or to the ServiceNow portal.

Activate the Consumer Service Portal plugin \(`com.glide.service-portal.consumer-portal`\).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter of your ServiceNow instance, enter `sys_cs_provider_application_list.do` and click **New**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the channel you are using. Enter `WhatsApp`.|
    |Provider|Name of the provider. Enter `WhatsApp`.|
    |Default Portal|Portal to be used in the mapping. Select a portal from the list of portals.|
