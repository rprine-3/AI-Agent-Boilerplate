Input mapping

</td><td>

The variables to be used as input to the selected action. The contents of this area change according to the action you selected. Options may include string input, referenced records, scripts, and so forth. For options that require a password, enable the **Include a password input** toggle switch to prompt the user for a password. Secure inputs must use the password2 data type. Input is securely masked and not viewable by others.

**Note:**

If a field is locked and you can’t enter a string, the pill picker value must match the field type. For example, if the field type is document\_id, the referenced value type must also be document\_id. If no matching field exists, reference a field created in another FDIH action output or use a script.
