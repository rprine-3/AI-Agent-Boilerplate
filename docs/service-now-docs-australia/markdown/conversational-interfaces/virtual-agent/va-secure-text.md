# Secure Text user input control

The Secure Text control provides a means to encrypt sensitive information provided as simple text or other formats. Use this control to encrypt sensitive information in topics that use large language model \(LLM\) discovery.

Use this control to gather and encrypt user information for topics using large language model \(LLM\) topic discovery. The Secure Text input also avoids sensitive information from being sent through an LLM.

## Secure Text user input control properties

<table id="table_khb_p5y_11c"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Node name

</td><td>

Name that identifies this Secure Text user input control node in the topic flow.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Prompt

</td><td>

Text string or script that returns text. This value is used only when the default value isn’t specified. For example: `What is your password?`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Input format

</td><td>

Text format that is validated when a user enters certain text items. When the input isn’t valid, the bot asks the user to reenter the text.

 Choose the format of the text item to be validated:

 -   Text: Any text string \(no validation\).
-   Email: Format that consists of an email prefix \(user name\), the @ symbol, and domain.
-   IP address \(IPV4, IPV6\): Data communication delivery format for internet Protocol version 4 or version 6.
-   Phone number \(E.164\): Internationally recognized standard phone number format.
-   URL: Web address format.
-   Custom: A script that provides a validation rule for a custom text format. The script should include related error messages that are displayed when the expected format isn’t entered.

 For phone and IP address format examples, see [E.164 phone formats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_ConfigureE.164PhoneNumberFields.md) and [IP address field types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r-IPAddressFieldType.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Hash function

</td><td>

The method digest algorithm based on the standard WS-Security specification.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Encryption salt

</td><td>

Random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Advanced

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default value

</td><td>

A value for the user response to the prompt. For example, if you already know the user name, the default value might be `(Script Variables > Last username)`.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Confirmation messages

</td></tr><tr><td>

Input completion confirmation

</td><td>

Bot response shown to the user when the node interaction is complete. The message can be either a text string or a script that returns text. For example, if you're using dot-walking: `Thanks, (Input Variables > Username)!` Or if you're using a script, the acknowledgement might be: `Thanks, {{vaInputs.username}}!`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default value confirmation

</td><td>

Message that asks the user to verify that the value in the Default value field is correct. This message is used instead of a value in the Prompt field. For example: `Are you (Script Variables > Username)?`

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Hide or skip this node

</td></tr><tr><td>

Conditionally show this node

</td><td>

No-code condition statement or low-code script that specifies a condition for presenting this node in the conversation. The condition must evaluate to true.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow user to skip this node

</td><td>

No-code condition statement or low-code script that specifies a condition for letting users skip this node in the conversation. The condition must evaluate to true. You can set this field using either the condition builder or a script.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Skip reprompting

</td><td>

No-code condition statement or low-code script that specifies a condition for letting users skip reprompting in the conversation. When a preceding node is revisited through a topic loopback or [Dialog Act](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/c_dialog-acts.md), the Virtual Agent bypasses this node and automatically retain its original value.
