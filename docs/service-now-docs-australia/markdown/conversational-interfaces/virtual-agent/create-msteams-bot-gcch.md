5.  Under **Microsoft App ID**, select the type of application from the Type of App list.

    You can create a multi tenant app or a single tenant app.

6.  Select the **Creation type** radio button.

    **Note:** If an existing app is being used, make sure that the type of app is the same as the type of bot you’re creating. This verification is important because a multi tenant app will work with a multi tenant Microsoft Teams bot and vice versa.

7.  Select **Review + create**.

8.  Review the Basic bot details provided and select **Create**.

    When the bot is successfully created, you will receive the `Deployment succeeded` message.

9.  On the left navigation, select **Channels** and select the Microsoft Teams icon under **Add a featured channel**.

    \[Omitted image "msteams-channel.png"\] Alt text: MS Teams Channels tab view, with Channels tab and Configure Microsoft Teams channel highlighted.

10. On the Terms of Service pop-up, select **Save** and select **Agree**.

    **Note:** In the **Messaging endpoint** field, provide the instance URL address.

    For example: `https://<instancename>.service-now.com/api/now/v1/cs/adapter/msft/events`.

    The domain might not be `service-now.com` and could be different. For example, the domain for GCC is `servicenowservices.com`.

    Replace the &lt;instancename&gt; with the name of your ServiceNow instance where you are integrating with Microsoft Teams.

12. On the left navigation, select **Overview**.

    You can also get to the Overview page by navigating to **Azure Services** &gt; **Azure Active Directory** &gt; **Manage** &gt; **App Registrations** and locate your application from the list to retrieve the following details.

13. Perform the following steps to retrieve the secret value code:

    1.  Copy the **Application \(client\) ID** and **Directory \(tenant\) ID** of your application and make a note of it.

    2.  On the left navigation bar under **Manage**, select **Certificates &amp; Secrets**.

    3.  Select **+ New client secret**, add your **Description** and **Expiration**, and select **Add**.

    4.  Copy the secret value code in the **Value** field and make a note of it.

        **Note:** The secret value code is visible only once.
