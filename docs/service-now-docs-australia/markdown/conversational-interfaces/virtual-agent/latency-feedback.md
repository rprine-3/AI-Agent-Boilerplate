# Latency feedback in Virtual Agent

The **com.glide.cs.message.processing.enabled** system property notifies requesters whenever the generative AI large language model \(LLM\) is processing their request in the Virtual Agent chat widget and ServiceNow Otto panel.

## Latency feedback messages

The **com.glide.cs.message.processing.enabled** property is off by default, but can be turned on in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table. After turning on this system property, users receive a temporary response to indicate that the LLM call is running and that their request is being processed. Message examples include:

-   `Thinking...`
-   `Looking into your request...`
-   `Reviewing key details...`
-   `Gathering the needed info...`

The latency feedback messages can’t be customized and disappears after the LLM generates a response.
