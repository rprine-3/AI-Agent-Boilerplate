# Capturing information from a user in a Facebook Messenger chat conversation

Use the collection of input controls provided by the Virtual Agent Designer to prompt and capture information from the user in a Facebook Messenger chat conversation.

Virtual Agent Designer is a diagram tool for creating and managing topics, which are blueprints for conversations between a virtual agent and user. For more information, see [Getting started with the Asset library in Assistant Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/conversation-designer-virtual-agent.md).

The Conversational Integration with Facebook Messenger application supports the following user input controls in Virtual Agent Designer.

If there are more than 13 quick replies, the pagination format is used to view more options. The default value of the maximum number of replies for a page is set in the **sn\_va\_fb\_messenger.max\_quick\_replies** system property \(location: System Property \[sys\_properties\] table\).
