# Exploring Virtual Agent

The ServiceNow Virtual Agent platform provides user assistance through conversations within an intelligent messaging interface. Design and build automated conversations with an out-of-the-box system that help your users quickly obtain information, make decisions, and perform common work tasks with Virtual Agent.

## Overview of Virtual Agent

Virtual Agent helps solve ordinary issues and delivers results for common requests, leaving your agents and technicians free to focus on more complex user issues. You can change the look and feel of the chat experience to suit each audience for your business, including running your chatbot in a variety of common or custom messaging channels. Use the Assistant Designer Analytics tab to monitor your bot's success.

Your developers have access to large language model \(LLM\) topic discovery. Assistant Designer includes LLM controls that make topic authoring easier so that you can deliver self-service solutions more quickly.

\[Omitted image "mmasset0022339.svg"\] Alt text: Virtual Agent increases deflection and improves self-service in a customizable environment. With ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent, development time is faster and uses generative AI LLM topic discovery.

## AI agents in Virtual Agent

Virtual Agent supports AI agents. When a user asks a question in chat, the agent understands the query and can reason, plan, and execute using tools such as the following:

-   AI agents
-   Virtual Agent topics
-   Conversational actions and subflows
-   Catalogs
-   Knowledge articles
-   Generative AI skills

Virtual Agent supports multi-intent queries with AI agents if there are associated AI agents per user query.

## Prebuilt Virtual Agent topics

Prebuilt Virtual Agent topics are available from the ServiceNow Store. These topics are designed to handle common issues that can occur and are customized for ServiceNow workflows. Available plugins include the following:

-   [ITSM Virtual Agent conversations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/itsm-virtual-agent.md)
-   Customer Service Virtual Agent conversations
-   [HR Service Delivery Virtual Agent conversations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/hr-virtual-agent-conversations.md)
