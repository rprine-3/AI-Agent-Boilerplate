## Example Text bot response script

In this example, the script returns a string that greets the user. The **gs.getUser\(\).getFirstName\(\)** property is used to append the first name of the current user.

```
(function execute() {
    return 'Hello ' + gs.getUser().getFirstName();
})()
```

In this example, the script returns links to three instances in the response. Use **Markdown** to include multiple links in the script.

```
(function execute() {
    var output = 'Hello\n';
    output += '\n- [Instance 1](http://instance1.com)';
    output += '\n- [Instance 2](http://instance2.com)';
    output += '\n- [Instance 3](http://instance3.com)';
    return output;
})()
```
