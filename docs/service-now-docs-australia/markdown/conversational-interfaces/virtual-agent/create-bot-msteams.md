# Create a bot in Microsoft Teams

You must create a bot in Microsoft Teams to be able to integrate with the Virtual Agent.

## Before you begin

Role required: Microsoft Teams admin, Global Administrator, or roles containing Application Administrator.

## Procedure

1.  Login into [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) and navigate to [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com).

2.  On the Developer Portal page, navigate to the **Tools** &gt; **Bot Management**.

3.  Select **Create a New bot** and provide a bot name of your choice and select **Add**.

4.  Open the bot that you created and select the **Configure** tab.

5.  Under Endpoint address, specify the following URL:

    For example: `https://<instancename>.service-now.com/api/now/v1/cs/adapter/msft/events`

    **Note:** Replace the &lt;instancename&gt; with the name of your ServiceNow instance where you are integrating with Microsoft Teams. In case of multi-instance single tenant integration, use the secondary ServiceNow instance for integrating with a bot on Microsoft Teams tenant.

6.  Select **Save**.

7.  Navigate to **Client secrets** and select **Add a client secret for your bot**.

8.  Copy the value of the client secret from the **New client secret generated** pop-up for later use as it is displayed only during this step and select **OK**.

9.  Navigate to **Developer Portal** &gt; **Tools** &gt; **Bot management** and copy the Bot ID of the bot you created.

10. Retrieve the following details of your bot in Microsoft Teams to integrate with Virtual Agent.

    -   Tenant ID: Follow the instructions on [Microsoft Teams documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant), to fetch the Tenant ID.
    -   Client ID \(App ID\): Client ID is the Bot Id that you have copied as mentioned in Step 8.
    -   Client Secret: It is the secret that you have copied as mentioned in Step 7.
    -   Bot Name: The name of the bot that you entered in Step 3.
    -   Select the **Single tenant** check box.

        **Note:** If you created your bot before October 2025, you don't need to select the **Single tenant** check box.

11. Press **Enter** to save.
