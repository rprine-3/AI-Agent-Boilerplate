# Modify models

Test and modify the Virtual Agent models so they more accurately predict user intents.

## Before you begin

Role required: Chat Analytics Admin

## About this task

Many ServiceNow products, such as ITSM, HRSD, and CSM include NLU models for Virtual Agent \(VA\) topics. The NLU plugin contains entities that are common across all products. You can modify those models. To learn how to train and test the models used for VA conversations, see [Natural Language Understanding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/nlu-landing.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Analytics** and select the **NLU Prediction** tab.

2.  Select **View more**.

    The Models page opens that displays the models that predict intents in your setup.

3.  If none of the models contain intents and utterances you'd like in your setup, select **Create Model** and follow the instructions in [Create an NLU model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-nlu-modelx.md).

4.  Click a model to display the intents the model predicts.

5.  Click an intent to display the utterances associated with it.

    \[Omitted image "dashboard-intents-utterances.png"\] Alt text: NLU Workbench Intent utterances tab.

6.  To create a new intent and add it to the model:

    1.  Select **New Intent**.

        The **Create a new intent** dialog box opens.

    2.  Enter the name of the new intent in **Intent Name**, a description of it in the **Description** field, and select **Save**.

        A page for your new intent opens.

        \[Omitted image "dashboard-intent-added.png"\] Alt text: NLU Workbench intent utterances tab showing utterance added.

    3.  Enter an utterance for your new intent and select **Add**.

        You can repeat this step multiple times to add multiple utterances.

7.  Import one or more intents by selecting **Import Intents**.

    The **Import Intents** dialog box opens, which displays the intents you can import.\[Omitted image "dashboard-import-intents.png"\] Alt text: Import intents dialog box with SubmitRequest intent selected.

    1.  Find the intent\(s\) to import by entering a search term, or by clicking an arrowhead to display the intents in a folder, and then selecting one or more check boxes.
    2.  Select **Import**.
8.  If you added or imported intents:

    1.  Select **Train** to add the intents to the model.

    2.  Select **Train** to train the model.

        If successful, a banner at the top reads, **The model has been successfully trained.**

9.  To test all the utterances, select **Test** and enter a sentence a user might enter in a chat to see if NLU understands the intent of your sentence.

    \[Omitted image "dashboard-test-utterance.png"\] Alt text: NLU Workbench Intents tab and Test model tab displaying test utterance.

10. If the models fail to predict the intent, add additional intents to the model, or utterances to the intents, as described in step 6.
