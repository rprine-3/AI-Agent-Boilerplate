# Synthesized response in Slack conversations

Synthesized responses in Slack conversations are results that are summarized as a single response, allowing users to see information in a conversational way.

With synthesized responses, the response contains the most relevant items and information, such as:

-   Returning multiple Genius Results and topics in carousel format.
-   Providing unified search across topics and catalog items.
-   Providing a Knowledge Base Q&amp;A pipeline that enables multiple snippets from multiple Knowledge Base articles to be passed to the LLM as the context for answer generation.

The overall synthesized response helps users experience a conversational flow that understands query intent, searches across records of various types, and summarizes results in a unified, easy-to-consume response.

When you ask a question in Slack with ServiceNow Otto enabled, you receive a summary of the response with catalog items and topics, followed by the citation links. For example, if you enter `laptop` in your conversations, you see the responses in a synthesized format.

When you select the **View other options** button, you get the list of available Knowledge Base articles and catalogs, which you can select and then view details.

## Streaming synthesized response

Streaming synthesized responses in Slack conversations provides a faster interaction and more engaged user experience with real-time updates while the messages are processed. To learn more about response streaming, see [Chat streaming responses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/streaming-responses-requestor.md) and [Manage an assistant chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-in-virtual-agent/manage-assistant-chat-experience.md).

To enable response streaming in Slack conversations, see [Enable ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent in Slack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/enable-na-llm-slack.md). With response streaming enabled in Slack conversations, you can experience the following enhancements:

-   Reduced latency in conversations
-   Increased engagement
-   Ability to handle longer or more complex queries effectively
