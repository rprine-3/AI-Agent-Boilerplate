# Override Microsoft Teams integration

Override Virtual Agent integration with Microsoft Teams.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or virtual\_agent\_admin

## About this task

Before Tokyo release, an admin was able to override a Microsoft Teams installation that is associated with an instance with a different ServiceNow instance.

Starting from Tokyo release, if you intend to associate your Microsoft Teams tenant with a new ServiceNow instance, contact the administrator to uninstall the tenant from the previously associated instance.\[Omitted image "msteams-new-proceed-uninstall.png"\] Alt text: Microsoft Teams integration removal message.

**Important:** The instructions in [Remove Conversational Integration with Microsoft Teams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/uninstall_va_msteams.md) are only applicable when both instances are compatible with Tokyo and following releases. If one of your ServiceNow instances is on the Tokyo release and another on a release prior to Tokyo, use the following steps.

## Procedure

1.  In the left navigation filter of your ServiceNow instance, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Search and open the **sn\_va\_teams.enable\_va\_override** system property.

    **Note:** If you don't find this system property, you \(as an admin\) must create one.

3.  Set the system property value to **true** to enable the **Override** button.

    **Note:** By default, the value of the system property is **false**.

4.  Select **Override** to associate the instance with a new tenant.\[Omitted image "msteams-new-override.png"\] Alt text: Microsoft Teams override installation.
