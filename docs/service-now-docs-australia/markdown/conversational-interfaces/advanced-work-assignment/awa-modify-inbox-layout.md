# Create or change an inbox layout

Create or change the card layout for inbox items for a given service channel. Card layouts are displayed in the agent inbox view of Agent Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: awa\_admin or admin. Users with the awa\_manager or agent role can review inbox layouts.

## About this task

Cards represent work items in an agent's inbox in Agent Workspace. Each channel has a default layout for these cards, which can display up to five fields from the related table record. Use the Inbox Layout form to change a default layout, such as the name, short description, and the specific fields displayed on the card, for example channel and contact or consumer name. You can also specify certain conditions that determine when the card layout is used.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the service channel settings through one of the following navigation paths:

    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Home**.

        In the Essential settings section, select **Set up service channels**.

    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Service Channels**.
2.  Select the service channel to be updated.

3.  In the Service Channel form, select the **Inbox Layouts** related link.

    -   To create a layout, select **New**.
