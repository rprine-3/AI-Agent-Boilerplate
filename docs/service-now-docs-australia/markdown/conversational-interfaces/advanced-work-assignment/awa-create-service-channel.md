# Create or configure a service channel

Create or configure a service channel that is used in Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\).

## Before you begin

Role required: awa\_admin or admin

## About this task

You can specify additional conditions to filter the work items that are handled in the channel, change the agent capacity \(workload\) for the channel, set the inbox layouts that your agents use in Workspace, and view associated work item queues.

If you activate the corresponding plugins or install the corresponding store applications, AWA provides base system channels for these services:

-   Cases plugin \(com.snc\_csm.awa\)
-   Chats plugin \(com.glide.interaction.awa\)
-   Chats - Asynchronous plugin \(com.glide.interaction.awa\)
-   Conversational Integration with Facebook Messenger application \(sn\_va\_fb\_messenger\)
-   Incidents plugin \(com.snc.incident.awa\)
-   Conversational Integration with LINE application \(sn\_va\_line\)
-   Walk-up interactions plugin \(com.snc.walkup\)
-   Conversational Integration with WhatsApp \(powered by Twilio\) application \(sn\_va\_whatsapp\_twi\)

For each channel, you can change certain default settings, such as the default capacity \(workload\) for agents. You can also use the related lists to review associated queues, define the associated inbox layouts \(work item cards\) that are displayed in Workspace, and override the agent capacity value.

You can also create a service channel record from the Service Channel module, but you must [create a queue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-queue.md), [assignment rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-create-assignment-rule.md), and [eligible assignment pool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-specify-assignment-eligibility.md) to route work through the service channel. For more information, see [Set up a custom service channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/setup-custom-channel.md).

In addition to task-based and interaction-based tables, AWA now supports routing of non-task and non-interaction tables such as Lead, Opportunity, Quote, and Order. Before configuring a service channel for one of these tables, ensure that the table has a corresponding record in the Document Type \[awa\_document\_type\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the service channel settings through one of the following navigation paths:

    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Home**.

        In the Essential settings section, select **Set up service channels**.

    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Service Channels**.
2.  Choose a situation.

    -   To create a service channel, select **New**.
    -   To update a service channel, select the service channel record that you want to update.
3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    The channel is added to or updated in the Service Channels \[awa\_service\_channel\] table.


## What to do next

For service channels that use history-based affinity routing, AWA reads the assigned-to field from the service channel configuration to determine prior agent assignments. If no assigned-to field is configured on the service channel, AWA defaults to the assigned\_to field. This applies to all table types, including non-task and non-interaction tables.
