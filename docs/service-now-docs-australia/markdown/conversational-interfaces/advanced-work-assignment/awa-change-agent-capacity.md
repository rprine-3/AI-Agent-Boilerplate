    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Home**.

        In the Essential settings section, select **Set up service channels**.

    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Service Channels**.
2.  Select the service channel.

3.  In the **Agent Capacity Override** related list, select **New**.
