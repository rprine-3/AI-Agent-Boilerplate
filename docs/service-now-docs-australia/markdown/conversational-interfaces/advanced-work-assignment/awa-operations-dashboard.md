## Use case

This dashboard provides support managers with an overview of incoming work items and the availability of agents to handle them. Managers can monitor these daily trends to determine if adjustments should be made to the routing criteria, agent capacity values, and other settings that determine how work is pushed to agents.

## Breakdowns

Breakdowns divide information into different categories. To analyze data according to different categories, select a breakdown from the dashboard menu:

-   Service Channel
-   Queue

For more information on analyzing data with breakdowns, see [Using breakdowns on dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_SpecialDashboards.md).
