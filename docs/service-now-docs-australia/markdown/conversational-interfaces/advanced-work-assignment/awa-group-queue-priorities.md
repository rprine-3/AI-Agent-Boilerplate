# AWA group queue priorities

Use the group queue priority feature to set a queue or work item preference for a given group of agents. For a given group or agent with limited capacity, this feature controls which queues should be preferred if matching work items are found in both.

For each group defined across the eligibility pools for a given queue, a corresponding group queue priority record will automatically be created for that group and queue combination. The order defaults to 100.

## Example

The admin has configured two AWA queues: chat queue and P1 chat queue.

-   Chat queue has one eligibility pool with two groups: Spanish agent group and English agent group.
-   P1 chat queue has one eligibility pool with one group: English agent group.

The admin creates three group queue priority records, each with the default order of 100:

|Group|Queue|Order|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Spanish agent group|Chat queue|100|
|English agent group|Chat queue|100|
|English agent group|P1 chat queue|100|

Since both group queue priority records for the English agent groups have the same order of 100, work items across both queues are equally considered during assignment.

If the admin then changes the order of one of the group queue priority records to 200:

|Group|Queue|Order|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Spanish agent group|Chat queue|100|
|English agent group|Chat queue|200|
|English agent group|P1 chat queue|100|

The English agent group now has a group queue priority hierarchy of two levels:

1.  Level 1: Work items in the P1 chat queue
2.  Level 2: Work items in the chat queue

With the above hierarchy, agents in the English agent group will prefer work items in the P1 chat queue over the chat queue. The assignment engine prioritizes assigning P1 chat queue work items to the English agent group. It only assigns regular chat queue work items to this group if agents still have free capacity.

## Group queue priority processing: tiers

AWA uses tiers as a series of assignment rounds. In each round, AWA expands the pool of eligible agents based on group queue priority tiers. Each tier represents a set of groups at the same level and indicates how those groups prioritize a queue relative to other queues they qualify for.

|Group|Queue|Order|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Spanish agent group|Chat queue|100|
|English agent group|Chat queue|200|
|English agent group|P1 chat queue|100|

For the above group queue priority configuration, the tiers are organized as follows:

1.  Tier 1:
    1.  Consider English agent group for P1 chat queue
    2.  Consider Spanish agent group for chat queue
2.  Tier 2: Consider English agent group for chat queue

The ordering within each tier is negligible since all work items across queues in the same tier are equally considered.

The above tier ordering translates into the following rounds of assignment:

1.  Assignment run \#1
    1.  Assign work items in P1 chat queue, with agents from English agent group
    2.  Assign work items in chat queue, with agents from Spanish agent group
2.  Assignment run \#2: Assign work items in chat queue, with agents from English agent group

## Side effect of tier organization

A side effect of the tier setup is that the Spanish agent group may receive more work items under the chat queue. This is due to the system considering the group earlier during the first run of assignment. Agents from the English agent group may be assigned work items in the P1 chat queue during the first assignment run. As a result, they will have less capacity to handle work items assigned in the second assignment run. Both factors influence the likelihood of groups in later tiers in receiving work items.

These side effects are important because the group queue priority setup hierarchy across different groups may also affect the distribution of work items within a queue.

Consider a more complex scenario where three groups are all eligible for three different queues, with the following group queue priority setup:

|Group|Queue|Order|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|A|10|
|1|B|20|
|1|C|30|
|2|A|300|
|2|B|100|
|2|C|200|
|3|A|2|
|3|B|3|
|3|C|1|

The assignment process is organized into three tiers, since the maximum hierarchy across all three groups is three levels. There will be three runs of assignment:

1.  Assignment Run \#1
    1.  Queue A, with agents from group 1
    2.  Queue B, with agents from group 2
    3.  Queue C, with agents from group 3
2.  Assignment Run \#2
    1.  Queue A, with agents from group 3
    2.  Queue B, with agents from group 1
    3.  Queue C, with agents from group 2
3.  Assignment Run \#3
    1.  Queue A, with agents from group 2
    2.  Queue B, with agents from group 3
    3.  Queue C, with agents from group 1

If each group has one agent having capacity 2, where agent 1 is in group 1, agent 2 is in group 2, and agent 3 is in group 3, then assignments are made in the following manner:
