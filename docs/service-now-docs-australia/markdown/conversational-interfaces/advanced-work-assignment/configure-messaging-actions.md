# Configure messaging actions

Create or modify messaging actions that are performed when an event occurs. These actions apply only to messaging.

## Before you begin

Activate the Conversational Messaging plugin \(com.glide.messaging.awa\). For information on activating this plugin, see [Activate Messaging Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/activate-messaging-actions.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

-   For the Requester Message without Agent Response event, the default length of time that elapses before an agent is sent a reminder is 30 minutes.
-   For the Agent Message without Requester Response event, the default length of time that elapses before the conversation is set to the Closed Abandoned state is 2 days.

    If you're using both Virtual Agent and Live Agent, the system closes an abandoned live conversation based on the lowest timeout value for closing conversations. Be aware that other conversation timeout behavior can affect idle live chat timeouts, regardless of the **Duration** and **Action** that you specify. For details, see [Closing Virtual Agent and Agent Chat conversations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/va-open-conversations.md).
