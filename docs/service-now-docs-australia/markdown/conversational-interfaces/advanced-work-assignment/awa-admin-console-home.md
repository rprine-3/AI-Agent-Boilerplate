# Advanced Work Assignment home page

Explore, implement, and maintain ServiceNow® Advanced Work Assignment using a home-page experience. Discover AWA, install relevant plugins, and configure settings for AWA through the Advanced Work Assignment home page available to admins.

## Advanced Work Assignment home page advantages

The Advanced Work Assignment home page makes it easy for you to get started and work toward achieving positive outcomes with your implementation. The Advanced Work Assignment home is ideal for first-time users who have never installed or configured Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\), to experienced users looking to expand capabilities and maintain existing implementations.

AWA home provides the following features:

-   Cards that guide you through the order of essential settings, like creating service channels, configuring queues, and adding assignment rules. Cards that redirect you to additional and advanced settings, such as configuring presence states, setting up reject reasons, determining universal capacity, setting up agent affinity, and establishing shift-based assignments.
-   Lists of installed and available plugins.
-   Quickly install plugins through the plugin page. The plugin page appears in either a new window or tab after selecting any **Get \[plugin\]** button. The plugin page opened dialog box appears on the home page, where you can select **Not Now** to continue with your current home page experience or **Done** to refresh the home page after your plugin's installation.
-   Access to helpful resources and videos to help you learn more about configuring and managing AWA.

Navigate to **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Home** to start exploring AWA features.

**Important:** The AWA home page appears after you have installed and updated the Omni-Experience Standard Feature Set to the latest version through the ServiceNow Store. Existing customers don't need to install it from the store. However, subsequent updates are available there. Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Planning, installing, and exploring AWA

If you've never installed AWA, the Advanced Work Assignment home page prompts you to do so first. Before implementing AWA, take some time to reflect on a few important questions in the Think through these questions with your team Think through these questions with your team list. These questions are meant to help you envision the AWA experience that you need and want for your business. Expand the available questions to explore more thoughtful considerations, such as what queues would work best for your team and what skills does your team have.

The layout of the home page may vary, depending on which features you've installed and configured.

    Install the Advanced Work Assignment plugin to begin. Select **Get Advanced Work Assignment plugin** to install it.

    **Note:** Only users with the sys\_admin role can install a plugin from the Advanced Work Assignment home page.

After the Advanced Work Assignment plugin is installed, all AWA home page options are available in the application navigator for users with the admin and awa\_admin roles.
