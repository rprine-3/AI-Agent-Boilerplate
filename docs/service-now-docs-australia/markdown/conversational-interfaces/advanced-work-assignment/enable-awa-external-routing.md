# Enable external routing for queues

Configure Advanced Work Assignment to route work items in the queue using external routing.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have reviewed the functionality of external routing and configured the necessary APIs. For more information, see [External routing overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-external-routing-overview.md).

Role required: awa\_external\_user

**Note:** With the installation of the External Routing Support plugin \(com.glide.awa-external\), the awa\_external\_user role is available by default.

## About this task

From Xanadu release, you can add the **External** field to the AWA queue form view. The **External** field is not available by default, but it is available with the installation of the External Routing Support plugin \(com.glide.awa-external\) in Xanadu release. The **External** field can be added to the queue UI form only when the plugin is installed in your instance.

The installation of the External Routing Support plugin \(com.glide.awa-external\), adds demo data for the following:

-   An AWA External Provider \(awa\_external\_provider\).
-   A sys\_alias representing an endpoint for the external provider API.
-   A set of awa\_external\_event\_definition records demonstration reasonable payloads for each event type.

**Note:**

-   If the customer modifies the default AWA Queue form view, the **External** field is not added to the form even if the external routing plugin is installed as the installation does not override the customer configurations and it must be manually added to the form.
-   Installing AWA without this plugin still enables AWA and Agent Chat to function normally, and does not result in any errors or warning logs due to code attempting to access tables or fields that do not exist.

If External \(with external partner\) and internal AWA queues are mixed up with the respective service channel in an External Partner outbound payload-defined configuration, then a warning message is displayed.

## Procedure

2.  Select **New** for an External Routing Queue form.

3.  Check the **External** check box to use external routing.

    **Note:**

    -   If the **External** field doesn't appear, select the update personalized list icon \(\[Omitted image "gear.png"\] Alt text: Update personalized list icon\) and add the **External** field to the screen.
    -   If you don't want to use external routing, clear the **External** check box.
