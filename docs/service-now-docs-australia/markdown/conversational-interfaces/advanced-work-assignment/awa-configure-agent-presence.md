# Configure agent presence states

Create or modify the availability states that agents use to indicate whether they can receive work or are offline or away. Agents set these states in their Workspace Inbox.

## Before you begin

Role required: awa\_admin or admin. Users with the awa\_manager and awa\_agent roles can review the presence states.

## About this task

The default presence states are Available, Away, AI Available, and Offline. For the Available state, be sure to enable it \(using the Active check box\) so that AWA can route work to agents.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Home** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Presence States**.

2.  Choose a situation.

    -   To create a presence state, select **New**.
    -   To update a presence state, select the presence record you want to update.
3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_m12_pyk_t2b"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Enables this presence state for agents.**Note:** For the default Available state, be sure to enable this **Active** check box so that work items are routed to available agents. If the **Active** state is not enabled, AWA does not route work items to agents.

If this check box is selected, the agent's presence will not be automatically set to "offline" based on inactivity and it must be manually set by the [AWA Agent API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/agent-api.md). You may need to configure the form to add this field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apply to all groups

</td><td>

Indicates all groups can use this presence state. To specify only certain groups that can use this presence state, unselect this check box to display the **Apply to groups** list. You may need to configure the form to add this field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>4.  Select **Submit** for a new presence state or **Update** if modifying an existing presence state.

    The presence state is added to or updated in the Presence States \[awa\_presence\_state\] table. The presence state is also listed in the Availability section of the Agent Workspace Inbox for the agents belonging to the groups and channels that use this state.
