# Customize how change requests appear in an agent inbox

Customize how change requests appear in an agent inbox so that agents receive enough information to decide whether to accept or reject the work item.

## Before you begin

Role required: awa\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the service channel settings through one of the following navigation paths:

    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Home**.

        In the Essential settings section, select **Set up service channels**.

    -   **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Service Channels**.
2.  Select the **Change Request** service channel record.

3.  On the Change Request service channel form, go to the **Inbox Layouts** related list and open **Default Change Request layout**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    -   Field 1: Number
    -   Field 2: Short description
    -   Field 3: Type
5.  Click **Update**.


## Result

When you create a change request, the item is routed through the Change Request service channel and assigned to the agent in the Change Management assignment group who is available to receive the change request. When the assignee checks their agent inbox, the change request appears with the option for the agent to either reject or accept the work item.
