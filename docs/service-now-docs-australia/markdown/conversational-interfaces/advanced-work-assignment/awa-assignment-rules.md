This field appears only when the **Enable shift-based assignment** option is selected.

Available options:

    -   Least time left in shift: Assign a work item to an agent from a group of available agents based on the least amount of time available in their shifts.
    -   Most time left in shift: Assign a work item to an agent from a group of available agents based on the maximum time available in their shifts.
-   Time required: Time required to complete a work item.
-   Available continuously for the required time: Assign work items to agents who are continuously available for the required time period without any breaks in a shift. Agents who don’t have the minimum time required in their shifts aren’t considered for work item assignments.

**Note:** The **Shift handling** field is available only if the Advanced Work Assignment plugin \(com.glide.awa\) is activated and the Workforce Optimization for Customer Service plugin \(com.snc.wfo.csm\) or the Workforce Optimization for ITSM plugin \(com.snc.wfo\_itsm\) plugin, or both, is activated. As a manager, you must have planned schedules for agents to assign them shifts.
