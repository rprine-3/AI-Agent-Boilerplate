    **Note:** This step is only applicable if you’re configuring an assistant using Now Assist in Virtual Agent enhanced chat or enhanced chat's full-page experience.

    1.  Select **Configure** &gt; **Form Layout** from the Additional Actions icon \(\[Omitted image "additional-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions icon\).

    2.  Move the following Available fields to the Selected fields, and then **Save**:

11. Do one of the following to apply the branding configuration:

    -   Apply the branding configuration to a Service Portal Agent Chat Configuration. In the server script that passes page and widget data to an Agent Chat \(Virtual Agent or Live Agent\) conversation, specify the branding key to be used. Items passed in this script are available to all pages in the portal. For details on setting up Service Portal Agent Chat, see [Add your bot to a portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/ac-configure-bot-portal.md).

        For example, the following Service Portal Agent Chat Configuration for the Knowledge Portal uses the chat branding key `custom_1`.

        \[Omitted image "va-sp-chat-config.png"\] Alt text: Service Portal Agent Chat Configuration record example.

        **Note:** There are other Service Portal Agent Chat features that you can configure, such as [customizing the Agent Chat button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-va-in-sp.md) in your portal. For more information on customizing the Agent Chat widget in Service Portal, see [Configure Agent Chat in Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-va-in-sp.md).

    -   Apply the branding configuration to a destination page. Enter the system parameter `sysparm_branding_key` with the branding key in the chat widget URL. For example:

        `https://<*your-instance-name*>service-now.com/$sn-va-web-client-app.do?sysparm_branding_key=acme`

        In this example, `acme` is the key of the branding configuration to be used.

    -   Apply the branding configuration to an embedded chat widget. Enter the system parameter `sysparm_branding_key` with the branding key in the URL for the embedded chat widget. For example:

        `https://<*your-instance-name*>service-now.com/$sn-va-web-client-app_embed.do?sysparm_branding_key=acme`

        In this example, `acme` is the key of the branding configuration to be used.

12. If you're using [Conversation Autopilot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/agent-chat/ci-agent-chat-using.md) with your branded bot, specify the branded bot name displayed in the chat window during Autopilot sessions by changing system properties as follows.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

    2.  Under the **System actions** section, select **View All** next to **System messages**.

    3.  Change the **Value** field of the **com.glide.cs.autopilot.client\_initiated\_header** system property to specify the branded bot name instead of the Virtual Agent bot name displayed in the header of the chat window.

        \[Omitted image "autopilot-header.png"\] Alt text: Bot name highlighted in header of chat window during Conversation Autopilot session.

    4.  Update the **com.glide.cs.autopilot.client\_initiated\_message** system property to specify the branded bot name displayed to the requester during the conversation.
