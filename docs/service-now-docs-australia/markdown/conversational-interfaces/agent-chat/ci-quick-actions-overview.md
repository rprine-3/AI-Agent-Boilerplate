# Configuring quick actions

Quick actions are shortcuts that perform Agent Chat tasks. Agents can work more efficiently with customers by using quick actions because they don't have to enter as many characters to perform a task.

## Activate quick actions

To enable your agents to use quick actions, you must activate the and [related plugins for Advanced Work Assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/advanced-work-assignment/awa-related-plugins.md), which is required for chat in Workspace.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Quick Actions** &gt; **Actions**, and then select **New**.

</td><td>

Work item that the quick action is available for. Filter the table that you select in the **Table** field to qualify a certain kind of work item.

 For example, to make the quick action available only for conversations that are assigned to Beth Anglin, you would first select the Interaction \[interaction\] table in the **Table**. Then, in the **Applies to** field, you would create the following filter: **\[Assigned to\] \[is\] \[Beth Anglin\]**.

-   The *params* array, if you defined quick action parameters
 If provided, all free-form text entered after all the other parameters are captured as the last item in the *params* array.

 Set the value of *answer* as follows:

```
answer = {
                success: <Boolean>,
                message: <success_or_error_message>
};
```

 **Note:** If you do not script a message, the agent receives a default message instead.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Select **Submit**.


### What to do next

If your quick action requires a secondary menu, define a quick action parameter so that agents can further control the quick action. For more information, see [Define a quick action parameter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/agent-chat/ci-quick-actions-overview.md).

Optionally, you can make the quick action available in Agent Chat as a button. For more information, see [Configuring a quick action button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/agent-chat/ci-quick-actions-overview.md).

 This field appears when you select **Basic** in the **Query mode** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Query Script
