# Configuring Sensitive Data Handler

Detect and mask sensitive information that is shared in Agent Chat or Virtual Agent conversations.

## Before you begin

**Note:** This feature is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer available for installation but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

Install the Data Privacy application as a replacement. For more information, see [Data Privacy for Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/data-privacy-for-virtual-agent.md).

Activate the Sensitive Data Handler plugin \(com.glide.sensitive\_data\_handling\).

Role required: admin, virtual\_agent\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Under **Sensitive data detection**, select **View all**.

3.  Slide the **Active** toggle switch to enable sensitive data detection.

4.  Select the appropriate conversation flow:

    1.  Requester to agent - detect and mask sensitive data entered by the requester in an Agent Chat conversation.
    2.  Agent to requester - detect and mask sensitive data entered by the agent in an Agent Chat conversation.
    3.  Requester to Virtual Agent - detect and mask sensitive data entered by the requester during a Virtual Agent conversation.
    **Note:** You must select at least one conversation flow.

5.  The Regular Expressions tab displays the existing expressions:
