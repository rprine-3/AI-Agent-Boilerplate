# Setting up conversation history

Enable and customize the conversation history options that are available on the conversation history screen.

## Before you begin

Conversation history provides the capability to easily access historical conversations on the same channel. The agent can be more efficient by reviewing those conversations without opening multiple tabs and reviewing the transcripts. This page provides options to enable conversation history and to configure how many to display and optional filtered view for the agents.

Role required: admin

2.  Select **Agent Chat** and then on the Agent Experience card, select **View Settings** next to Conversation History.

3.  To turn on conversation history, toggle on the Activate switch.

4.  In the Number of conversations to display field, enter the number of previous conversations that should display on the screen.

    The maximum number of conversations that can display is 25.

5.  To create a conversation history filter, select **New**.
