# Configure asynchronous chat for the web channel

Set the chat widget as a messaging channel for asynchronous chat.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

The base system web channel, mweb, is automatically configured as a chat channel for web and mobile clients. To use the web channel as a messaging channel, change the channel **Type** in the Messaging Channel \[sys\_cs\_channel\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** and in the Navigation filter, enter `sys_cs_channel.list`.

2.  In the Messaging Channel form, select the mweb record and double click the **Type** field.

3.  Change the Type to Messaging.

4.  Save the value.


## Result

The mweb channel is set to messaging mode. To help manage long-running conversations, the system automatically performs certain messaging actions in messaging mode:

-   Requester message without agent response \(agent experience\): If an agent hasn't responded to a requester within 30 minutes, the agent receives a reminder that a message from an end user needs a response.
-   Agent message without requester response: If a requester hasn't responded to an agent message after two days, the conversation state in the Interaction record is automatically set to closed abandoned.
