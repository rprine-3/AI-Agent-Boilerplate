# Live agent chat context variables

Use chat context variables to pass certain information from the topic to share with a live agent or to control how bot conversations are routed to live agents. Virtual Agent includes some default variables, and you can define new ones.

**Note:** The Interaction table is part of the interaction management framework, which is activated through the Interactions Management plugin \(com.glide.interaction\). This plugin is included with the Agent Chat \(com.glide.interaction.awa\) and Connect Support \(com.glide.connect.support\) plugins.
