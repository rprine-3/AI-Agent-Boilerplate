# Exploring Sidebar

Using Sidebar, agents can have real-time collaboration with others as a standalone conversation or based around a Workspace record. These Sidebar discussions facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge to help resolve issues faster and with higher-quality outcomes.

## Sidebar overview

An agent can initiate a Sidebar discussion as a standalone conversation or from a Workspace record. Agents enter preliminary information and context and adding subject matter experts. For Sidebar discussions created from a Workspace record, the agent can create multiple discussions for a record.

## Sidebar workspaces

Sidebar is supported in these workspaces:

-   Customer Service Management \(CSM\) Configurable Workspace.
-   CSM Manager Workspace
-   Human Resources \(HR\) Agent Workspace
-   IT Service Management \(ITSM\) Manager Workspace
-   Security Incident Response Workspace
-   Vendor Management Workspace

For information on adding the **Discuss** button to a supported workspace, see [Adding the Discuss button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/sidebar/add-sidebar-button.md).

For information on adding the **Discuss** button to any workspace not listed \(such as the Service Operation Workspace\), see [KB article KB1213249](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1213249).

The overflow menu can hold up to 25 docked windows and this limit is configurable. If there are more docked windows than can be displayed as tabs in the overflow menu, a tab with a number indicates how many extra docked windows aren't displayed.


## Threaded replies

Use threaded replies to keep related messages grouped within Sidebar discussions. When you respond using a threaded reply, your message is added to the specific message you're replying to, rather than the main discussion.

To start a threaded reply to a message:

1.  Select reply arrow \(\[Omitted image "threaded-reply-arrow.png"\] Alt text: Reply arrow icon.\) next to the message you want to reply to:

    \[Omitted image "sidebar-threaded-1.png"\] Alt text: Start of a threaded reply in a Sidebar discussion.

2.  The panel displays "Thread" followed by the discussion subject. Type your message in the text input box:

    \[Omitted image "sidebar-threaded-2.png"\] Alt text: Typing the text of a threaded reply.

3.  Select the send arrow \(\[Omitted image "threaded-send-arrow.png"\] Alt text: Send arrow icon.\).
4.  Your messages appear under the parent message:

    \[Omitted image "sidebar-threaded-3.png"\] Alt text: Typing the text of a threaded reply.

5.  If threaded reply has multiple messages, you can expand them to view all of the messages or you can collapse them and the number of messages displays instead.

    \[Omitted image "sidebar-threaded-4.png"\] Alt text: Multiple messages collapsed in a threaded reply.


**Note:** If you delete a message with threaded replies, a warning appears letting you know that all its threaded replies will also be deleted.
