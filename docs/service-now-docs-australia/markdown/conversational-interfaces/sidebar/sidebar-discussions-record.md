# Create a Sidebar discussion for a record

Collaborate with others by creating a Sidebar discussion for a task or interaction record. These discussions can be created from a Next Experience page or Core UI record page.

## Before you begin

Role required: users with access to the record associated with the Sidebar discussion

**Note:** To avoid incompatibilities with newer features, use Sidebar only on records that have an associated record number.

## Procedure

1.  Start a Sidebar discussion from a Next Experience page or a Core UI record:

<table id="table_bgq_wvw_n2c"><thead><tr><th>

Next Experience page

</th><th>

Core UI record

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

1.  From the top menu, select the Sidebar discussion icon \(\[Omitted image "sidebar-chat-icon.png"\] Alt text: Sidebar icon.\) to display the Sidebar discussions window.

\[Omitted image "sidebar-discussions-menu-example.png"\] Alt text: Sidebar discussions menu.

2.  To display an existing Sidebar discussion, select it on the Sidebar discussion menu.
3.  Start a new Sidebar discussion by selecting **New discussion** to display the Start a Sidebar discussion window.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Record number

</td><td>

Record number associated with the Sidebar discussion.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Subject

</td><td>

This field is pre-populated with the record's short description. If the Subject starts with a number in parentheses, that number indicates what number this discussion is for the record. For example, if the subject line has "\(2\) Email issue," the "2" indicates the second discussion for the email issue record. You can edit or add to the Subject field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Add participants

</td><td>

Select the user or user group to include in the discussion. If an assignment group was entered for this case/interaction/incident, this field is pre-populated with its members. -   If you select individual users, only those users with access to the record can be added as participants.
-   If you select a user group, only those users within the group who have access to the record are added as participants.
