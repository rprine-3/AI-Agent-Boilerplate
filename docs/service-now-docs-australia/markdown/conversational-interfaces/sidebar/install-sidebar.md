# Installing Sidebar

You can install Sidebar, which is part of the Omni-Experience Standard Feature Set, if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow® Store applications have valid ServiceNow® entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following items are installed with Sidebar:

-   Plugins
-   Roles
-   Tables

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  To find the Sidebar application, enter `omni-experience standard feature set` in the filter criteria.

    If you cannot find the application, you might have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    Dependent plugins and applications are listed if they will be installed, are currently installed, or need to be installed. If any plugins or applications need to be installed, you must install them before you can install Sidebar feature.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select the **Load demo data** check box.

    Demo data are the sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load the demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

5.  Select **Install**.

6.  If you want to use the Search KB quick action, enable AI Search.
