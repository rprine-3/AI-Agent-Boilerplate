4.  From the Open create collab chat modal Action Assignment, scroll down to Related Links and select the UX Add-on Event Mappings tab.

5.  Open the UX Add-on Event Mapping record and verify if the Application field uses the Common Page Template.

6.  Create a new UX Add-on Event Mapping by copying all field values from the base level Open create collab chat record including Source element ID, Source declarative Action, Target Event and Target Payload Mapping.
