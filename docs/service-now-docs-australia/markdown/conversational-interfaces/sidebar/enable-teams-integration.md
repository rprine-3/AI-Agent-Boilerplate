# Enable or configure the Microsoft Teams integration

Enable or configure the Microsoft Teams integration as part of integrating Sidebar with Microsoft Teams.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Select Sidebar.

3.  On the Integrations card:

    -   If Sidebar and Microsoft Teams are not already integrated, select **Set up**.
    -   If Sidebar and Microsoft Teams are already integrated, select **View configuration** from the Manage drop-down list.
4.  On the Microsoft Teams Integration screen, slide the activate toggle to allow or prevent Microsoft Teams users from participating in Sidebar discussions.

    -   When this is switched on, Microsoft Teams users that previously had access to Sidebar will regain access and any Microsoft Teams users that are newly included will gain access to Sidebar.
    -   When this is switched off:
        -   Microsoft Teams users that previously had access to Sidebar will no longer have access to Sidebar.
        -   Any Microsoft Teams users that are newly included will not gain access to Sidebar.
        -   Existing discussions will become inactive in Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams users will still be able to access older messages in a Microsoft Teams group chat, but any messages sent in those group chats will not be sent to Sidebar.
        -   Existing discussions will remain active for Sidebar users.
5.  Enter **Client Secret**, **Callback URL**, and **Redirect URL**.
