# View unread email counters on interaction tabs

Unread email counters display on email interaction tabs in CSM Configurable Workspace to help agents track new email activity across multiple interactions.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Unread email counters help agents manage multiple email interactions efficiently by providing visual notification of new activity without requiring agents to switch between tabs. This enables agents to prioritize responses and maintain context while working on the current interaction.

When new emails arrive for an email interaction in an inactive tab, a counter increments on the tab. The counter clears when you select the tab. Hover over the tab to preview the latest email without switching to that interaction.

Example: You have multiple email interactions open in tabs. A customer replies to an interaction in an inactive tab. The tab displays an unread counter, such as \(2\), indicating new activity without requiring you to switch tabs. Complete the following configuration steps to enable unread email counters on interaction tabs.
