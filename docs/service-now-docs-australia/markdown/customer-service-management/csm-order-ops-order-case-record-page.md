## Composing emails, comments, and work notes

The Order case record page uses modeless dialogs to create and post comments and work notes to the activity stream and to compose and send emails.

A modeless dialog is a window that appears in a workspace as an overlay on top of the main window content. This overlay enables users to interact with the window content and the overlay content at the same time.

The Compose group of actions on the Order case record page includes:

-   Compose Comments
-   Compose Email
-   Compose Work Notes\(Private\)

These actions launch the corresponding modeless dialogs \(the behavior is the same as the Front-line case page\).

The email templates should be accessed from email dialog.

For more information about composing emails, comments, and work notes, see [Modeless dialogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page-modeless-dialogs.md).
