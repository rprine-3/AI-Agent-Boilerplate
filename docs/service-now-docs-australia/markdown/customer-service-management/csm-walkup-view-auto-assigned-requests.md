# Manage automatically assigned Walk-up Experience interactions

Technicians supporting CSM Walk-up Experience locations can view and manage interactions automatically pushed to the CRM Workspace inbox.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_csm\_walkup.walkup\_technician

## About this task

Walk-up Experience interactions can be automatically pushed to a personal inbox in CRM Workspace based on agent schedules and assignment rule configurations in the Advanced Work Assignment feature. Technicians fulfill interactions on a first-come-first-served basis as they appear in the inbox.

To manually assign and manage interactions using the CSM Walk-up Experience Technician modules found in the application navigator, refer to [Manage Walk-up Experience interactions manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-walkup-view-assigned-requests.md).

Technicians set a status in the CRM Workspace inbox to indicate readiness to accept interactions. Status choices are **Available**, **Away**, and **Offline**.

Even though interactions are automatically pushed to the walk-up inbox, agents can work with anyone in the walk-up queue at any time.

View walk-up queue interactions assigned to you automatically in your walk-up inbox or in your **My Assigned Walk-ups** list. You can also view all **Open - Unassigned** interactions for the queue you support.

With CRM Workspace you can view lists of all your related walk-up interactions and appointments, your cases, customer accounts and contacts, incidents, requests, and more using one convenient interface. The Walk-up Experience related interaction list includes the following items:

<table id="table_x1b_z4b_qdb"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

My Assigned Walk-ups

</td><td>

Interactions you assign to yourself when you accept an active interaction or that are assigned to you. Agents assign interactions to themselves when they accept a queued interaction. Managers can assign interactions to specific agents.

 These interactions are in a Work in Progress state. Once assigned, an agent can transfer the interaction to another agent or queue to complete the work, if necessary.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Open — Unassigned

</td><td>

All open but unassigned interactions associated with your specific walk-up queue location. When a guest checks into a walk-up queue, an interaction is created. The interaction is Queued until an agent accepts it or is assigned the interaction. At that point, the state changes to Work in Progress.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed Walk-ups

</td><td>

All Closed Complete and Closed Abandoned interactions assigned to a specific walk-up location queue. Agents can abandon an interaction when a guest leaves the queue before receiving support.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Procedure

1.  To begin supporting a walk-up queue guest, open CRM Workspace.

2.  Select **Inbox** and ensure your status is set to **Available**.

    You can view interactions in your inbox that are automatically assigned to you.

3.  Select the interaction at the top of the list and begin resolving the issue or fulfilling the request.

    When you create an associated case, a **New Case** tab opens next to the **Details** tab of the original interaction. Fill out the new case form. Select **Save** to save the new case.

    If an interaction requires an unusual amount of time to resolve or fulfill, you can place the interaction on hold. The requester does not lose position in the queue and you can help another requester simultaneously. Placing an interaction on hold does not affect your capacity for new interactions.

    1.  To put an interaction on hold, select **Put on Hold**.

    2.  You can associate the interaction with another record by selecting **Associate Record** from the more UI actions icon in the interaction header.

    3.  If you cannot resolve an issue, select **Create Case** in the interaction header.

        When you create an associated case, a **New Case** tab opens next to the **Details** tab of the original interaction. Fill out the new case form. Select **Save** to save the new case.

4.  When you finish resolving the interaction, select **Close** in the interaction header.

    Closing an interaction affects your capacity and can result in new interactions being pushed to your inbox.
