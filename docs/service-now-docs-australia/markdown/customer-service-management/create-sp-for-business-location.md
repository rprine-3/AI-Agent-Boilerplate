# Create and manage sold products for a business organization

Staff members with the location agent role can manage sold products for their business organizations \(formerly business locations\).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_manager, sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_agent, or admin

## About this task

Staff members with the sn\_customerservice\_manager role can create sold products by choosing the appropriate product model. In contrast, staff members with the sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_agent role can only view the list of sold products installed at any service organization.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Business Organizations** &gt; **Internal/External Organizations**.

2.  Select either an internal or an external organization.

3.  In the Sold Products related lists, select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_hc5_l4g_c5b"><thead><tr><th>

Internal or external entity that is involved in providing service to the customer.**Note:** The sold products are closely tied to the service organization. As an example, if you select a service organization, all the parent sold products come from the same service organization.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select **Submit**.

    A sold product record is created for the selected business organization.
