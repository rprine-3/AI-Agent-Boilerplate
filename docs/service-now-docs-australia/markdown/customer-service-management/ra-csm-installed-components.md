</table>Granular admin users can be granted delegated developer privileges and other required roles to manage and configure metadata in scoped applications instead of assigning high-privileged admin roles. By granting granular admin users with the Manage Update Set permission, you can allow them to create and manage records within a specific application scope and track those changes in the appropriate update set. The metadata\_scope\_viewer role allows these granular admins to view the Application field on metadata records within scoped applications. Other than the roles in the preceding table, you can delegate deployment tasks to developers or non-admin users. For more information on the delegated development, see [Delegated Development](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-landing.md).

## Guidances

The Recommended Actions application includes the guidances described in the following table.

<table id="table_e4p_rjl_d5b"><thead><tr><th>

Guidance

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

The state of the current case changes to resolved.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Communicate Workaround

</td><td>

Enables agents to communicate a workaround from a recommended problem record by clicking a **Communicate workaround** button on a card, which opens the guidance in the side panel.

 The guidance shows the workaround from the problem record and provides a note field for the agent to add additional notes. The workaround and notes are added in the work notes and the problem record is linked to the current case.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create case task

</td><td>

Enables agents to create a case task for the current case by clicking a **Create** button on a card, which opens the guidance in the side panel where the agent can enter a subject for a new case task and submit it.
