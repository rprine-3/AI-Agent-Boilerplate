This page view enables agents to manage chats and displays information, such as customer history and interaction details, that help agents to resolve issues.

Use the CSM centered chat interaction record template to create chat interaction record page variants and customize them as needed. For more information, see [Creating pages and page variants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-ws-create-page-variant.md).
