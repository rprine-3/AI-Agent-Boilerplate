# Associate related record definitions with a related record context

Associate the desired related record definitions with a context record to determine which related records appear for the selected record type.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

A related record context includes the following information:

-   The table that stores the record type for the context \(source record or playbook activity\).
-   Conditions to apply to the selected table which determine if the associated related record definitions are executed at runtime.
-   The related record definitions to execute.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Dynamic Related Record** &gt; **Related Record Contexts**.

2.  Click the desired context.

3.  In the Context Related Record Definitions related list, click **New**.

    You may need to change the application in order to see the **New** button:

    1.  Click the system settings icon in the upper right corner.
    2.  Click **Developer**.
    3.  Select the **Application** and close the pop-up window.
4.  Click the lookup icon in the **Related record definition list**.

5.  Select a definition from the Related Record Definitions list.

6.  Assign an order number to the definition in the **Order** field.

    The order determines where the related record type appears in the filter list in the Related Records tab.

7.  Click **Submit**.
