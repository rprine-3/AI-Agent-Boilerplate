# Display form ribbon and header values in side panel

Configure the form ribbon and the secondary values that appear in a form header to display in the Contextual side panel in CRM Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_admin, ui\_builder\_admin, admin

## About this task

**Note:** This task applies to CRM Workspace.

The form ribbon includes components that provide agents with an overview of case details, such as a customer summary and a case timeline.

The form header for the Case form can display two levels of field values from the Case table. The primary value is the case short description. The secondary values include the account and contact or consumer, the case priority, and the case state.

You can use properties to determine where the form ribbon and secondary values are displayed: at the top of the record or in the Contextual side panel. Two properties are available for the standard record page and two are available for the interaction record.

These properties can operate independently. For example, you can display the form ribbon in the Contextual side panel and the secondary values in the form header.

**Note:** The form ribbon properties apply to pages that have active ribbon configurations. If a page does not have a ribbon configuration, or has an inactive ribbon configuration, there is no information for the system to display in either location.
