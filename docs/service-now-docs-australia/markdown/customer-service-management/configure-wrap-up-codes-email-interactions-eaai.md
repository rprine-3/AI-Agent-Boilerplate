# Configure wrap-up codes for email interactions

Configure internal wrap-up codes that agents use to categorize email interactions when closing them. Wrap-up codes work with both AWA-routed and CCaaS-routed email interactions.

## Before you begin

Default wrap-up codes are read-only. The system uses ACLs to restrict list-edit operations and data policies to restrict edits in form view. You can’t configure multiple default wrap-up codes for different use cases. For more information on wrap-up codes, see [Wrap-up codes for email interactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/wrap-up-codes-email-interactions-r.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Interaction** &gt; **Wrap Up Codes**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Enter the required details.

4.  Select the **Active** check box.

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The wrap-up code is created. To make it available to agents, associate it with the email interaction wrap-up configuration. See [Associate wrap-up codes with email interactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/associate-wrap-up-codes-email-interactions.md).
