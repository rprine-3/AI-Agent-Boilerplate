# Customer Service Management examples

In this example, the CSDM helps the fictitious ACME technology company use CSM to manage network monitoring services for customers.

## Example scenario: Key personas and how they benefit

ACME offers a network monitoring service to its enterprise customers who can purchase either the Platinum, Gold, or Silver offering. A customer, Boxeo, has purchased the network monitoring Platinum offering \(Sold Product\) and is using it in development and production environments \(Install Base Item\).

\[Omitted image "csm-data-model-example-v5.png"\] Alt text: CSM data model example.

The key personas \(customer service agents, network operations center \(NOC\) engineers, service owners, and customers\) can complete the following tasks:

**Customer service agents can**:

-   View the products and services that the customer has purchased \(Sold Product\) and installed \(Install Base\).

    \[Omitted image "csm-agents-identify-products.png"\] Alt text: CSM agents view products customers have purchased and installed by customers.

-   View the service offering associated with the sold product. The sold product references the service offering.

    \[Omitted image "csm-agents-sold-products.png"\] Alt text: CSM agents view service offering details for sold products.

-   View the health status of Install Base Items

    \[Omitted image "csm-agents-view-health.png"\] Alt text: CSM agents can view the health status of Install Base Items.


**NOC engineers can**: View customers affected by a service issue and inform customer service. Specifically, they can perform the following operations:

-   View the affected Install Base Items and add it to or remove it from an Account. The Install Base item references the application service \(CI\). The CI it depends on should be one of the CIs affected. The CI should also be referenced in the Alert to show that Install Base Item \(and therefore the Account or Consumer\) as affected.

-   Create a proactive case from an alert and inform the customer service team of the service issue or outage.

**Service owners can**: View the customers that are subscribed to a service offering.\[Omitted image "svc-owners-view.png"\] Alt text: Service owners can view customers subscribed to a service offering.

**Customers can**:

-   View the install base items and details.
-   View outages and service issues.

-   View products they have purchased.
-   Request services related to the products they’ve purchased.
