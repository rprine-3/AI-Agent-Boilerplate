# Automatically close customer service cases

Customer service cases in the **Resolved** state can be closed automatically if customers don’t act.

This feature uses the **Auto Close Resolved Cases** Flow Designer flow.

**Note:** This flow isn’t active by default.

The **Auto Close Resolved Cases** Flow Designer Flow identifies cases in the **Resolved** state that are waiting for a customer response and takes the following actions:

-   Sends a reminder notification to the customer after five days with no response that the case is pending solution acceptance.
-   Closes the case and sends a reminder notification to the customer after 10 days that the case has been auto-closed.

The notifications are added to the **Additional comments** field on the Case form.

The administrator can enable the **Auto Close Resolved Cases** flow and configure the timing of the reminder notifications. The default settings include two notifications that are sent at 5 days and 10 days after a case has been resolved. The administrator can also create additional notifications to the flow.

The administrator can also create a configuration that enables both the system and agents to exclude cases from auto-closure.

## Using the Auto Close field on the Case form

Customer service agents can use the **Auto Close** field on the Case form to exclude cases from auto-closure. This field is hidden by default. To use this field, configure the Case form to display the **Auto Close** field.

## Configuring business rules for auto closure

The administrator can configure business rules to enable or disable the **Auto Close** field on the Case form.
