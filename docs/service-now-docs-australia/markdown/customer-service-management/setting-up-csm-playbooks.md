# Playbooks in Customer Service Management

Playbooks provide customer service agents with step-by-step guidance for resolving specific types of cases. Agents can follow a playbook in CRM Workspace and complete guided activities to resolve customer issues.

## Playbook overview

A [playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md) is an end-to-end workflow that includes the stages, steps, and guidance to lead users through a business process. A playbook visualizes a workflow in a task-oriented view and guides users through sequences of tasks.

A playbook takes a workflow and breaks it into multiple stages. Each stage in a playbook includes a logical group of sequential activities for an agent to complete. Stages can also include automated activities, such as sending an email to a customer when a stage or activity is complete.

Playbooks include:

-   A series of steps that a user must complete in order to achieve a particular goal and the necessary guidance for completing those steps.
-   One or more stages, or groups of tasks, and sequences of activities within each stage.

Playbooks are created in the [Workflow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio.md) application. Pages that display playbooks in a workspace are created in the [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder-overview.md) application. Agents use playbooks in [CSM Configurable Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-workspaces-configure.md) to complete activities. End users can also use playbooks from service portals to create requests and provide information. For more information, see the following sections in this topic:

-   [Playbook users and tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/setting-up-csm-playbooks.md)

## Playbook users and tools

The following table describes the different user roles that are involved in the creation, configuration, and use of playbooks. It also describes the tools and applications used by each of those roles.

</table>## Creating and configuring playbooks

Creating and configuring a playbook involves different tools and applications. Playbooks are created using the Workflow Studio application. Some of the configuration for a playbook is performed in UI Builder as part of the playbook component configuration. Additional settings can be configured in the playbook experience record in the Core UI. These settings include selecting the playbook activity view and configuring playbook stage and activity visibility.
