# Case Playbook for Onboarding

Use the Case Playbook for Onboarding to manage the process for taking on new customers or enrolling customers for new products.

The onboarding playbook provides the activities and tasks that agents can perform during the onboarding process. Agents can also create and assign tasks as needed and use the playbook to communicate with the customer.

Use the Case Playbook for Onboarding for cases that were created by using the onboarding case type. This playbook is available for both CRM Workspace and CSM Agent Workspace. In the CSM Workspaces, the playbook appears in the **Playbook** tab on the case record.

**Note:** If you have the admin role, you can configure a playbook to use compact mode in CRM Workspace. Use the compact mode to move the playbook from a tab in the Workspace to a tab in the contextual side panel.

## Case Playbook for Onboarding application

The Case Playbook for Onboarding application \(com.sn\_csm\_onboarding\_caseflow\) is available from the ServiceNow® Store. For more information, see [Playbook plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/setting-up-csm-playbooks.md).

## Case Playbook for onboarding a PAD process definition

The Case Playbook for Onboarding 3.0 includes a new Process Automation Designer \(PAD\) process definition called **onboarding\_playbook\_v1**. This process definition contains the optimized stages and activities for the onboarding playbook.

Process definitions are stored in the Process Definitions table \(sys\_pd\_process\_definition\). As an admin, you can view a list of processes by doing the following task:

1.  In the application navigator, enter **sys\_pd\_process\_definition.list**.
2.  [Configure the list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_PersonalLists.md) to show the **Name** field.

Only one PAD process per playbook can be active at a time.

</table>## Using the playbook stage and activity pickers to navigate the stages and activities

The playbook stage picker enables agents to see the entire onboarding workflow. Agents can navigate the playbook stages and activities by doing the following tasks:

-   Expand and collapse the stages to show or hide the activities.
-   Use the filter in the stage picker to filter activities by the assigned user or the activity state.
-   Click an activity to display the details in the playbook work area.

## Using the Playbook Actions menu

The Playbook Actions menu in the playbook header includes the actions that agents can perform at the playbook and activity levels. The agents can select the Playbook Actions icon \(\[Omitted image "playbook-ellipses.png"\] Alt text: Playbook actions menu icon.\) to access this menu.

The Playbook Actions menu includes the following playbook-level actions:

-   **Expand All Stages**: Expands all the stages in the playbook.
-   **Collapse All Stages**: Collapses all the stages in the playbook.
-   **Request Info**: Displays a pop-up window that the agent can use to communicate with the customer and to request information about a case or case task. This action also saves the details to the case or case task activity stream. By using this action, the state of the case or case task changes to Awaiting Info and pauses the SLAs and any timers.
-   **Info Received**: Returns the case or case task to the previous state and restarts the SLAs and any timers.

**Note:** The **Request Info** and **Info Received** actions can also be configured to appear on the case task activity cards.

The activity-level actions can vary depending on the type of activity and in which stage it appears. For example, actions are available to accept cases, create related cases, create case tasks, and propose solutions.

</table>## Process-based page variant for onboarding case type

The Case Playbook for Onboarding v5.0 application includes a process-based page variant that you can activate and use with the onboarding case type in CRM Workspace. This page includes the following features:

-   Horizontal stage picker in the record that provides an end-to-end view of the onboarding process.

Agents can create tasks as needed and view and update the case details. For more information, see [Configure templates and pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-playbook-pages.md).

## Guided Playbook for Onboarding Request

The Case Playbook for onboarding has undergone modifications in Playbooks for Portals to expose the initiate stage for self-service. This change will provide the guided playbook intake process to end customers as well, previously available only to agents. The experience is initially shipped as inactive to customers.

End customers now have visibility into the entire lifecycle of the onboarding application when viewing the case application. They can perform various tasks based on the specific stage of the case lifecycle. This includes submitting new cases, checking the status of existing cases, and taking actions on tasks that require customer input as the case progresses.

Contributor users, on the other hand, have the ability to submit cases and act on tasks on behalf of the customer. During the initiate stage of the onboarding case type, end customers have the option to save their progress. Additionally, they can view the case process on the case ticket page specifically designed for onboarding cases. The flows within the system guide users through the step-by-step completion of both simple and complex processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience.

\[Omitted image "playbook-guided-onboarding-flow.png"\] Alt text: Stages and activities in guided onboarding flow

As customer, you can:

-   Locate the catalog content item 'New Guided Onboarding Request' under the 'Support' category in the service catalog.
-   Launch the playbook record generator associated with the selected content item.
-   Monitor your progress in the submission process, including the number of remaining steps and the ability to navigate back to previous steps when viewing a playbook.
-   Easily populate the required fields with the options provided and input controls.
-   Save an application or form before it is ready for submission and resume working on it at a later time.
-   Locate the draft case from the case list view to continue where you left off.
-   Click **Submit** to complete the initiation stage during the **Review Application**step.
-   Receive a notification if there are any pending tasks due to missing documents.
-   Access the case ticket page directly from the email notification, with the process tab open, displaying the **Data Capture** stage and the **Upload Documents** activity.

Known limitations:

-   If you switch to the new Process Automation Designer \(PAD\) with the existing service definition and the old record generator, you may encounter a configuration error page when attempting to create onboarding from the case type selector. You need to update the service definition's references as well to the new record generator.
-   The Portal playbook experience only supports the New PAD. Customers may encounter issues if they attempt to use the old PAD, so it is recommended not to use it. Ensure that only one PAD is active at a given time.
