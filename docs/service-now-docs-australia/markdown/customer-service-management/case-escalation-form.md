# Case and account escalation form

Customer service agents use the Escalation form to manage escalations for cases and accounts.

The Escalation form includes information about the escalation, such as the associated case or account, and the reason and justification for the escalation. It also includes information about the escalation as it progresses, including the trend and notes about the work being done to resolve the issue.

An escalation record can contain one or more associated cases. When updating escalation records, customer service agents can enter comments or work notes. For case escalations, updates are replicated to the case activity history as work notes so they aren’t visible to the customer.

The Escalation form has a **Related Cases** related list that includes the related cases for account escalations. The user can associate specific cases using this related list to indicate which cases are causing the escalation. The Escalation form also includes **Task SLAs** and **Approvers** related lists.
