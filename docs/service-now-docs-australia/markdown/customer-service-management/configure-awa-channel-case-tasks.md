# Set up an Advanced Work Assignment service channel for assigning case tasks

Set up an Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) service channel that you can use to assign case tasks to available users.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

You can use the [Advanced Work Assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-overview.md) \(AWA\) feature to automatically assign work items to users based on their availability and capacity.

AWA assigns work items using assignment groups so it's important that your users and groups are set up correctly.

-   Determine the assignment group to use in the AWA service channel configuration and add users to this group.
-   Add the **Assignment Group** field to the Case Task form view and make the field mandatory.
-   Ensure that the users in the assignment group have access to case tasks.

    **Note:** By default, CSM uses assignment groups to control visibility to case tasks. Therefore the logic to assign a case task to the correct assignment group is triggered when a case task is created.


## About this task

Setting up a service channel involves multiple steps, which are detailed in the following procedure. Once the service channel setup is complete, you can use AWA to assign newly created case tasks that:

-   Are unassigned.
-   Satisfy the conditions specified in the service channel.
-   Have the configured AWA assignment group selected in the **Assignment Group** field on the Case Task form.

## Procedure

1.  Create the case task service channel.

    1.  Navigate to **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Service Channels** and click **New**.

    2.  Fill in the fields on the Service Channel form.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Name|Name of the service channel that you are configuring. For example, Case Task.|
        |Inbox order|Order in which channel items appear in the user inbox. The **Inbox Order** field is an integer [field type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_FieldTypes.md). This field can store whole numbers.|
        |Application|Name of the application. For the Case Task channel, select Customer Service.|
        |Active|Option for activating the service channel. When you select this option, the associated queues for the service channel can start accepting work items.|
        |Short description|Brief description of the service channel.|
        |Table|Table that stores the service channel records. To route case tasks, select the Task \(sn\_customerservice\_task\) table.|
        |Assign to field|Field that references the user that the item is assigned to. For the Task table, this field is the **Assigned to** \(assigned\_to\) field.|
        |Assignment group field|Field that references the assignment group that the item is assigned to. For the Task table, this field is the **Assignment group** field.|
        |Advanced condition|If enabled, the advanced conditions that apply to the channel. For case tasks, the parent case is active: **\[Active\] \[is\] \[true\]**.|
        |Default work item size|Amount of a user's capacity that is used if this work item is assigned. The default is 1.|
        |Default capacity|Number of items automatically assigned to agents \(pending overrides\). The default for this field depends on the type of work item.|
        |Utilization condition|Condition that determines what constitutes an active item that counts toward user workload/capacity. For case tasks: **\[State\] \[is not\] \[Closed\]**.|

    3.  Click **Submit**.

        The system adds the Case Task channel to the Service Channels list.

3.  Create a queue for the case task service channel.
