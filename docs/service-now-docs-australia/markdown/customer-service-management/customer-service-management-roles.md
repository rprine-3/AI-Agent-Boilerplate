# Customer Service Management roles

The Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application uses roles to provide access to information, identify internal and external users, maintain data security, and establish different types of relationships between users. CSM is installed with certain basic and primary roles.

Customer Service Management provides several primary roles that support the following business models:

-   Business-to-business \(B2B\): With this business model, you can support accounts and contacts. Additionally, you can create relationships and account teams to support your customers.
-   Business-to-consumer \(B2C\): With this business model, you can support individual consumers.

These roles ensure access to data while maintaining data security for different types of business relationships.

Besides the Base and Primary roles \(that are based on the Base roles\), there are Explicit roles as well. You may have business requirements that can vary how you use the roles. The Explicit roles in CSM feature lets you assign both internal and external roles to external users. It is important to regularly review user role assignments to ensure that they are set according to your business requirements.

For more information about reviewing and updating user role assignments, see:

-   [Fix external user role assignments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/fixing-external-role-assignment.md)
