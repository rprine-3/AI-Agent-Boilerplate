# Attach and share article guidance

The Attach and share article guidance recommends relevant knowledge articles to customer service agents and enables them to share the selected articles in comments, work notes, or email.

The Attach and share article guidance recommends relevant knowledge articles based on the text in the case short description. Agents can view the recommended articles and share a selected article with the customer.

The agent can view the knowledge articles in a card format in the contextual side panel or expand a selected card to see an article in a detail view. The card view provides a condensed view of articles for quick scanning. The detail view provides the full content of the selected article for further reading.

Each card contains a primary action. The default primary action is [Attach and add link in comment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidances-attach-share-article.md). Secondary actions are available in the More actions menu in the upper right corner of the card:

-   [Add link in work notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidances-attach-share-article.md)
-   [Attach and add link in email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidances-attach-share-article.md)

The same primary and secondary actions are available in the expanded detail view. The system administrator can configure the primary and secondary actions in the **Recommended action specific configuration** property. For more information, see [Configuring guidances in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidances.md).

The relevancy score displays on the Attach and share article guidance in the Search tab of the Recommended Actions contextual side panel. It indicates how well a search result matches the agent’s query.

## Modal and modeless dialog experiences

The agent can share the article in a comment, a work note, or an email using the primary and secondary actions. Two different experiences are available for this guidance depending on the [record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-config-workspace-record-pages.md) you're using in the CRM Workspace:

-   **Modeless dialogs**: This experience is available for record pages that support [modeless dialogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page-modeless-dialogs.md) \(for example, the [Front-line case page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page.md)\). Modeless dialogs are windows that overlay the main window content. Agents can move modeless dialogs around the window so they can interact with the window content and overlay content at the same time.
-   **Modals**: This experience is available for record pages that support modals \(for example, the [CSM default record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-default-record-page.md)\). With modals, agents must complete the action within a modal before continuing to interact with the window content, which is the default experience.

The system administrator can configure the modal and modeless dialog experiences in the **Recommended Action Specific Configuration** property. For more information, see [Configuring guidances in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidances.md).

If a record page supports the modeless dialog experience, selecting an action on a guidance card opens the corresponding modeless dialog. If a record page does not support the modeless dialog experience, the guidance uses the modal experience.

**Note:** The result of guidance actions is the same in the modeless dialog and modal experiences, but when the actions are completed differs.

## Public and private knowledge articles recommendations for case records

Some knowledge articles that appear in the search results display a lock icon in the upper left corner. The presence or absence of the lock icon determines the audience for the article and how an agent can share the article.

The **KnowledgeGuidanceUserResolver** extension point is shipped with the base system. This extension point allows business units \(BUs\) to return the requester and primary action based on their logic by creating the implementation in this extension point. You can create an implementation by selecting the **Create Implementation** link in the **KnowledgeGuidanceUserResolver** extension point. The `CSMKnowledgeGuidanceUserResolver` implementation for the Case table and its extended tables is shipped with the base system. This implementation identifies the primary requesters for a case record based on the Contact, Partner Contact, Consumer and Internal user fields in the Case table. The primary action is determined based on the channel type of the case record.

**Note:** The Internal user field is checked only when the Service Organization \(com.snc.service\_organization\) plugin is installed.

-   **Lock icon**

    Agents can’t share locked articles with customers as the customers do not have access to these locked article. The **Attach and add link in email** and **Attach and add link in comment** actions are not available when a lock icon is present on a guidance card. The following table shows the primary and secondary actions in preview and detail view on the guidance card:
