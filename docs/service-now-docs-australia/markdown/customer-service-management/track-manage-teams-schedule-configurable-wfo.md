# Track and manage your team schedule

Create, update, or monitor the schedule for your team from one location. You can approve or reject requests for swapping shifts or time off for agents within your assignment group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.admin

## About this task

Using the calendar, you can do the following:

-   View all of your agents by assignment group.
-   Get insights into team compliance with published schedules.
-   View an agent's work schedule that is actual shift time vs clock-in and clock-out times.
-   Filter the team calendar based on the **Assignment Group**, **Location**, **Skills**, **Shift Plan**, and **Events** for a customized view.
-   Modify the agent's shift, clock-in, and clock-out timings, if necessary.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Select the Schedule \(\[Omitted image "schedule-new.png"\] Alt text: Schedule icon.\) icon.

3.  Modify an agent's shift.

    The schedule that includes this shift must be in **Preview** or **Published** state.

    1.  In the Team Calendar tab, navigate and hover over the shift for the agent that you want to modify the schedule for, in Day, Week or Month view.
    2.  In the shift pop-up window, select the **Edit** \(\[Omitted image "edit-new.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon.\) icon.
    3.  Modify the agent's shift or the shift time.

        **Note:** If the existing shift has a break, you can add more breaks to the shift.

        -   Select **Select shift times** and modify the **Start time** or **End time** fields to change the timing of the shift.
        -   Select the **Select preset shift** option and from the Shift plan list, select an existing shift to assign another shift plan to the agent. For more info on creating a shift plan, see [Create a shift plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-shift-plan-configurable-wfo-cs.md).
    4.  Select **Save**.
4.  Approve or reject an agent's time off or shift-swap with another agent.

    **Note:** You must approve a request two days before the time-off or shift-swap start date. If not, the approval is auto-rejected. An administrator can change this default setting. For more information, see Setting the due date for time-off and shift-swap request approvals in [Components installed with Workforce Optimization for Customer Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md) Overlapping time-off requests by an agent is rejected.

    |Tab|Description|
    |---|-----------|

    |**Time off requests**|Approve or reject multiple time off requests.|
    |**Shift swap requests**|Approve or reject multiple shift swap requests.|

    If you approve the request, the schedule gets updated in the team calendar based on the approvals.
