# Customize a guidance detail experience in the UI Builder

Customize how your detail experience looks in the contextual side panel or in a subtab of the Recommended Actions card using UI Builder. The detail experience can include things such as user inputs and drill down actions.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_nb\_action.next\_best\_action\_author and ui\_builder\_admin, admin

## About this task

You begin by creating a UI page variant of a guidance detail experience. When you create a UI page variant from a page template, you start with a base structure that you can customize. By configuring the components and using the component properties, you can change how your detail experience looks in the contextual side panel or in a subtab.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Recommended Actions** &gt; **Action Types** &gt; **Guidances**.

2.  Select a guidance from the Guidances list.

3.  Select **Create detail UI** to create a UI page variant of a guidance detail experience.

    This page includes an empty container with the properties listed in the following table.

    |Property|Description|
    |--------|-----------|
    |guidanceInputs|The inputs required to perform the guidance.|
    |guidanceOutputs|The outputs of the guidance.|
    |status|The status of the guidance.|
    |guidanceMessage|The message for the detail experience.|
    |guidanceActions|The guidance actions in the detail view.|
    |errorMessages|The error message to display when the recommendation fails to display.|

    The following example shows properties and their sample values for the detail experience.

    ```
    {
        "guidanceInputs": {},
        "guidanceOutputs": {
            "meta": []
        },
        "status": "waiting",
        "guidanceMessage": "",
        "guidanceActions": [
            {
                "label": "Attach",
                "action_sys_id": "1e8392aa436f0210f81d92621ab8f291",
                "variant": "primary",
                "isExecuted": false,
                "completionMessage": "Knowledge article successfully attached.",
                "action_behaviour": "contextual_side_panel",
                "primary": true
            }
        ],
        "errorMessage": "",
        "actionConfigurations": {},
        "guidanceId": "",
        "tableName": "sn_customerservice_case",
        "bare": true,
        "scrollable": "none"
    }
    
    ```

4.  Select **Edit detail in UI Builder**.

    The UI page variant opens in UI Builder, where you can add and configure components to customize the look and feel of the detail experience. For more information, see [Working with components in the UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/work-components.md).

5.  Bind the preview experience properties to your custom detail UI.

    Data bindings are located in the **Config** tab of the configuration panel in UI Builder. For more information, see [Data resources in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/data-resources.md).

6.  Add and bind scripts to components in your custom detail UI to dispatch events by using an event handler to execute, skip, or mark complete a recommendation with a corresponding payload.
