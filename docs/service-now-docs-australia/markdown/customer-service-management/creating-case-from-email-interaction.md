# Creating a case from an email interaction

Create a case from an inbound email interaction when the customer query requires further investigation. The case and interaction are linked to each other. All communication and case details are easily accessible for more efficient resolutions.

After a case is created from an email interaction, the email interaction is automatically closed.

When a case is created, sending an email to the customer creates an outbound interaction. This outbound email interaction is for reporting purposes only, and no emails are linked to it.

Closing the case also closes the outbound interaction.

## Create a case

Create a case from an inbound email interaction to make sure that issues are addressed and routed for resolution.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent, or sn\_customerservice\_manager

### About this task

When you create a case from an inbound interaction, the system links the interaction to the case. All future communication related to the case is stored within the case.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \(\[Omitted image "List\_icon\_eaai\_new.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

3.  In the Interactions section, select **My Interactions**.

4.  Open an email interaction.

5.  Select **Create case**.

    The system opens a new case form, automatically filling the Contact or Consumer field and setting the channel to Email. The system then populates the Short Description with the email subject.

6.  Enter the case details.

7.  Select **Save**.


### Result

The process generates a case from an email, linking them for future communication.
