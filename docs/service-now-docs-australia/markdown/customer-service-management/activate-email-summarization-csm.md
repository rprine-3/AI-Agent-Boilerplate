# Activate email interaction summarization for CSM

Activate the Email Interaction Summarization skill in AI Skill Kit to generate AI-powered summaries of email interactions for CSM agents, reducing the time spent reviewing full email conversation histories.

## Before you begin

Confirm the following prerequisites are met before you begin:

-   The Email Interaction for CSM plugin must be installed and active on your instance.
-   A ServiceNow Otto for CSM license must be active on your instance.

Role required: sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

## About this task

The Email Interaction Summarization skill generates summaries of email threads, helping agents quickly understand the context of a customer interaction without reading the full conversation history. Summaries are generated on demand when an agent selects the summarize option on an email interaction.

**Note:** AI-generated summaries may not capture all nuances of the email conversation. Agents must review summaries for accuracy before acting on them.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Now Assist Admin** &gt; **Now Assist Skills**.

2.  Select **Customer** &gt; **CSM**.

3.  On the **Now Assist for CSM** skills for page, locate the **Email Interaction Summarization** skill and select it to open the skill details.

4.  Select **Activate skill**.

    **Note:** By default, the skill is inactive.

5.  Complete the guided setup.

6.  In **Review and activate**, review your configuration.

7.  Select **Activate**.


## Result

The Email Interaction Summarization skill is active. Agents can select the summarize option on an email interaction to generate an on-demand summary of the email thread.
