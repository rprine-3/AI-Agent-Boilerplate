# Enable users to self-register to a community

Once users have accessed public forums and decided they want to join the community, they can self-register to the community. External user registration provides a way of validating users and requires them to accept the community Terms and Conditions.

Community administrators perform the following tasks to configure external user registration.

-   Configure the [external user registration properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/communities-properties.md).
-   [Configure moderation filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/configure-moderation-filters.md) to enter banned words for the user name.
-   [Configure the required strength for passwords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/config-pwd-strength-rqmts.md).
-   [Create an email template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateAnEmailTemplate.md) and content. The email template that you can change is **communities.ext.regn.confirm**.
-   If not already configured, [create community terms and conditions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/create-terms-conditions.md) that each community user must review and accept. Communities delivers preconfigured Terms and Conditions that you can modify according to your needs.
-   To enable external users to update their time zone when registering, add ACLs to external users in the User table \[sys\_user\].
