# Create a forum

Create a forum to provide a place for users to share content. You can configure forums for membership that registered community users request access to join. You can also configure forums to convert unstructured conversations to structured knowledge articles.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_communities.admin

## About this task

A forum can be configured in the following ways.

<table id="table_my5_tjy_3bb"><tbody><tr><td>

Public

</td><td>

Visible to all users, including non-logged in users. All users have **content\_read** access to questions and answers in public forums. Configure public forms by adding a [forum user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/add-user.md) of the type public.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Private

</td><td>

Visible only to users who have been assigned the required permissions in the forum. Configure private forums by adding a [forum user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/add-user.md) of the type custom and adding specific users or user groups to that forum user.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Membership

</td><td>

The forum title is visible to registered community users. Community users must request membership to get full access to the content in the forum. Configure membership forums by selecting the **Enable Membership for this Forum** check box.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Community** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Forums**.

2.  In the Forums list, click **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields on the **Forum New record** form.

    For field description, see [Forum form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/forum-form-fields.md).

4.  To allow registered forum users to view and request to join a forum, select the **Enable Membership for this Forum** check box and complete the following steps.

    1.  Right-click the form header and click **Save**.

        Two default permissions are added to the forum in the **Forum Permissions** related list.

        -   **Default Permission for Memberships**: Read and write access to questions and answers for users who are forum members.
        -   **Forum Visible**: Read access to the name and description of the forum for registered users. To access content, users must request forum membership.
    2.  If required, you can add a [new forum permission](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/create-forum-permission.md) and set it as the default using the sn\_communities.default\_permission\_for\_forum\_memberships property.

        If you want public users to view content in the forum to attract them to become members, create a forum permission as follows:

        -   **Forum User**: **Public**.
        -   **Permission**: **Question &amp; Answer Read**.
    3.  In the **Approval Flow for Membership** field, perform one of the following options.

<table id="choicetable_qcd_dlc_t1b"><tbody><tr><td id="d169244e252">

**Leave the __Approval Flow for Membership__ field blank.**

</td><td>

Membership requests to the forum are automatically approved.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d169244e264">

**Select the preconfigured approval flow __Forum Membership Approval__.**

</td><td>

A task is created and sent to the community or forum administrator for approval.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d169244e276">

</td><td>

A task is created and sent to the users defined in your flow for approval.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Click **Update**.
