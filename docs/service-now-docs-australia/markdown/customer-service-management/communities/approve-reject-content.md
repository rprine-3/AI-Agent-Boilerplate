# Approve or reject content

Approve or reject content that a user reported as inappropriate or that is associated with a particular community profile.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_communities.community\_moderator, sn\_communities.moderation\_admin

## About this task

A moderation task is generated when a community user reports inappropriate content or community profiles. By default, the system assigns the task to the community moderator group. You can also configure your system to always require content moderation for a particular user or group.

Each task requires the moderator to approve or reject the reported item. If the moderator rejects content, it is counted as an offense against the community user who contributed the content.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Community** &gt; **Moderation Tasks** &gt; **Assigned to me**.

2.  Click a moderation task.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
