# Community pages that support SEO data

To improve search results for community members using external search engines, the Communities application generates SEO meta tags and injects the tags into questions, topics, forums, and other page types.

**Note:** If the auto-generated SEO tags in a page does not meet your needs, you can change the SEO tags. See [Modify SEO in community pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/communities/seo-communities-modify.md).

-   community\_question
