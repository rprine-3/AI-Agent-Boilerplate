# Configure content types for a forum

Define which types of content to use in a particular forum and associate a workflow so that content is reviewed before becoming visible to other community users.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_communities.forum\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Community** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Forums**.

2.  Click a forum.

3.  In the **Content Types** related list, click **New**.

4.  In the Content Types list, select a **Content Type**.

5.  Select an **Approval Flow**.

    If you signed up before the Zurich release you will see two fields, **Approval Flow** and **Approval Workflow**. You are recommended to set only one of them. The **Approval Flow** field setting takes precedence if both are set.

6.  Click **Submit**.


## Result

The selected content type is added to the **Content Types** related list in the forum. The following secondary content types are automatically added when creating a primary content type.

|Primary content type|Secondary content type|
|--------------------|----------------------|
|Question|Answer|
|Blog, Document, Event, Video|Comment|
