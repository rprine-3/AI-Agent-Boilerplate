# Customer service email properties

Users with the system administrator role can set several properties for the Customer Service Management email communication channel.

After creating the incoming and outgoing email addresses that customers use to communicate with customer service agents, the system administrator can set the following email-specific properties.

Navigate to **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties** to access these properties.

<table id="table_ek3_ndy_nr"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>

Definition

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Case email address\[glide.cs.email.case\_queue\_address\]

</td><td>

One of the incoming email addresses that automatically creates a customer service case.For incoming email, the system checks the address to see if it matches the address in the **Case email address** property.

-   If it matches, the system creates a case
-   If it doesn't match, or the property isn't set, the system checks the Email subject prefix format for new case property instead.
-   
If yes, the system creates a customer service case. If it does not match, or if this property is not set, the system then checks the **Email subject prefix format for new case** property.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Email subject prefix format for new case \[glide.cs.email.new\_case\_prefix\]

</td><td>

The prefix included in the subject line of an email to any of the incoming email addresses that automatically creates a customer service case. This field is automatically set to **Case:** as the default prefix.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create case for non matched user\[sn\_customerservice.email.create\_case\_for\_non\_matched\_user\]

</td><td>

Enable creating of new customer service cases when a sender's email address isn't in the system yet.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of activities\[number\_of\_activities\_in\_notification\]

</td><td>

Indicates the number of activities \(emails and comments\) in the activity history that are included in the email notifications and replies. The default value is 3.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of activities in replynumber\_of\_activities\_in\_reply

By default, the email history shows the last three messages in the case record. To show every activity on a case record instead, add this script `${mail_script:get_emails_comments_activity_history}` to the email reply system property \(reply-received\) and the case commented system property \(case.commented.for.customer\).
