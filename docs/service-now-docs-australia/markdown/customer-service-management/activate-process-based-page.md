# Activate a playbook page or page variant

Activate a playbook page or page variant and set the page order. The system uses the active page with the lowest order number to display records in CRM Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin, admin

Some playbook pages and page variants are not active by default. You need to activate the pages and set the page order before using the pages in CRM Workspace.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  In the Experiences list, select **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

3.  Find one of the following pages by scrolling through the Pages and variants list to the Record section:

    -   Case playbook: horizontal stages
    -   Case playbook: vertical stages
    -   Complaint case process page
    -   Onboarding case process page
    -   Product Support process page
    **Note:** These pages may be marked as **Inactive**.

4.  Display the page settings by selecting **Settings** for the desired page or page variant.

5.  Activate the page by selecting the **Active** check box.

6.  In the **Order** field, set the order number for the page.

    Each page has an order number. The page with the lowest order number is the default page. When the system displays a record in CRM Workspace, it uses this default page to display the record information. For more information, see [Set record page order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-ws-set-record-page-order.md).

7.  In the **Variant conditions** field, specify the table value.

    Add the table values for the case types where you want to see this page variant.

8.  Select **Save**.
