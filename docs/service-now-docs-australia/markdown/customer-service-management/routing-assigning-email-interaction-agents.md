# Routing and assigning an email interaction to agents

Route and assign email interactions to the appropriate agents based on predefined rules and criteria.

When agents accept email interactions routed by Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\), the interaction state changes from New to Work in progress and it’s assigned to the agent.

For information on the configuration required to route and assign email interactions, see [Configure Advanced Work Assignment for routing email interactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-advanced-work-assignment-route-email-interactions.md).

Alternatively, agents can assign the email interactions manually.

## Assign an interaction manually

Manually assign an interaction that is in the New state to yourself or another agent.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent, sn\_customerservice\_manager, or sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent
