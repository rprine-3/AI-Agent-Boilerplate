# Recommendations in Recommended Actions

A recommendation is a way to suggest a helpful action to an agent. A recommendation includes the action and any relevant resources and inputs.

There are three types of recommendations that are provided to agents:

-   **Guidance**: An action that an agent can take or information that they can share.
-   **Decision tree**: A guided flow to troubleshoot an issue and provide a solution.
-   **Field recommendation**: A recommended value to use for a field.
-   **Playbooks**: A playbook to run for step-by-step resolution

## Creating a recommendation

When you create a recommendation, you can select the type from the New Recommendation screen. This screen lists the available types.

\[Omitted image "ra-new-recommendation-screen.png"\] Alt text: New Recommendation screen that presents available recommendation types.

Selecting a type on the New Recommendation screen takes you to the Recommendation form. The selected type is added to the **Action type** field on the Recommendation form.

## Recommendation form

The Recommendation form provides information about a recommendation, including the selected action and any inputs and resource generators that the action requires.

When you create a recommendation, you select an action type and an action. The next steps depend on the action type that you select. For example, guidances and field recommendations require action inputs while decision trees don’t.

When you create a recommendation, provide this information and save the record. After saving, you can see the Action inputs form section. Inputs are parameters that go into an action and enable agents to complete that action. You can select relevant inputs manually, from the context record, context inputs,or from the resource generator.

You can access the recommendation records by navigating to **All** &gt; **Recommended Actions** &gt; **Recommendations**. New recommendations can be created only inside the rules. For more information, see [Create a recommendation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-recommendations-create.md).
