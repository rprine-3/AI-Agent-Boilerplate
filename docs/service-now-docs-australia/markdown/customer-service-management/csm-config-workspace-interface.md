# CRM Workspace interface

The CRM Workspace interface provides agents with the tools and information they need to resolve interactions and cases.

\[Omitted image "csm-config-workspace-interface.png"\] Alt text: The CSM Configurable Workspace interface provides information such as record details, the activity stream, and tools in the contextual side panel such as recommended actions and templates.

## Multi-tab interface

Within the CRM Workspace interface, two levels of tabs enable agents to work on multiple cases, tasks, and other customer records within a single browser window.

-   Top-level tabs display case records or case type records.
-   Sub-tabs display record details in addition to related records, such as case tasks, work orders, and contact or account information.

Agents can open up to 20 tabs simultaneously in the workspace. The system automatically caches the 10 most recently used tabs for faster navigation.

Agents can use this tab configuration to quickly move between records without losing their place.

## Contextual display

Agents get a complete view of a customer's history, including interactions, products, and cases. Agents can find this information throughout the CRM Workspace interface. For example:

-   Record details: Provides customer or consumer information, details about the product or service, and a short description of the issue.
-   Contact and consumer lookup: Displays customer information in record cards and provides quick access to details such name, email, and phone.
-   Customer History: Displays customer, consumer, or account history information in the form of a filtered activity feed.
-   Activity stream: Displays a running history of updates and communications within a record such as field updates, comments, work notes, and emails.
-   Contextual side panel: Includes tabs that agents can use to view record information, SLA details, and attachments.
-   Related lists: Show records from other tables that are linked to the current record like case tasks or work orders.

## Record details

In CRM Workspace, each case or interaction record includes information about the customer or consumer, the product or service, and a short description of the issue being addressed. It can also include information about the record priority, state, and agent assignment.

Depending on the record page configuration, record details can be found in the Details tab or in a case or interaction details component. For example, the [Front-line case page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page.md) includes a case details component with the following collapsible sections:

-   Case
-   Notes
-   Closure Information
-   Related Records

The [CSM default record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-default-record-page.md) includes a Details tab as the first record sub-tab.

## Contextual side panel

The contextual side panel component includes different tools that agents can use to research and resolve customer issues. The tools available in the contextual side panel are configurable for each record page. For example, the contextual side panel in the Front-line case page includes the following tabs:

-   Record information
-   Recommended Actions search
-   Attachments
-   Form Templates
-   Response Templates
-   Email Templates
-   Related Lists

## Agent inbox

Agents see their assignments in their CRM Workspace inbox. Work assignments appear as cards in the inbox that agents can either choose to accept or reject. Agents can also set their status in the inbox, such as **Available** or **Busy**.
