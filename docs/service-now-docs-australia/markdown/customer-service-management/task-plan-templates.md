# Task Plan Templates

Use a task plan template to define the repeatable tasks and records that must be created for a business process. When the template is applied, these tasks and records are automatically created.

\[Omitted image "task-plan-template-items-list.png"\] Alt text: The template items list includes a hierarchical list of the tasks, child, cases, records, and other items that are part of the template.

A [task plan template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-task-plan-template.md) is a group of tasks and records, called template items, that are automatically created when the template is applied. A task plan template also includes conditions that determine when the template is applicable.

A [template item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-task-plan-template-item.md) can be a task, a record, or a child task. When you create a template item, you identify the type of item to be created by selecting the table where that item is to be created. For example, to create a case task, select the Task \[sn\_customerservice\_task\] table. For each template item, you can create [conditions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-task-plan-template-item-condition.md) that determine when the template item is created.

A [task plan template configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/task_plan_template_configurations.md) defines pre-set fields to streamline the process of creating task plan templates.

You can also create a hierarchy of the tasks and records to be created when the task plan template is applied by creating [child template items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-task-plan-template-child-item.md) for a template item. For example, you can create a template item that is a case record and then create child template items that are case tasks for that case record.

## Defining a process with a task plan template

Business users can define how a business process should be handled by using a task plan template. When creating a task plan template, the business owner can create the following:

-   The task plan template and the conditions for when the template applies.
-   The template items to be generated. This can include tasks, child cases, child case tasks, and other records such as work order tasks. Template items can also include attachments. These attachments are available on the tasks created from the template items.
-   The task order.
-   Conditions that specify when tasks must be created.

## Benefits of task plan templates

Task plan templates enable you to define the repeatable tasks that are routinely performed for specific business processes. When you apply the template, either to an existing case or to a new case, the system automatically creates the tasks defined in the template.

For example, a bank can use a task plan template to onboard new customers. An onboarding task plan template can include tasks similar to the following:

-   Gather customer information
-   Scan customer documents
-   Check customer credit score
-   Send welcome packet

## Task Plan Templates plugin

Users with the system administrator role can activate the Task Plan Templates \(com.sn\_task\_plan\_templates\) plugin. The Task Plan Templates application is available from the ServiceNow Store.

The Task Plan Templates application adds the Task Plan Templates module to the application navigator and includes tables and roles. For more information, see the following topics:

</table>## Applying task plan templates

You can apply task plan templates to existing cases or to new cases. When a case is created based on a task plan template, the template items are automatically created as defined in the template.

Task plan templates can be applied manually or automatically to an existing entity.

The Get Started tab in the contextual side panel in CSM Configurable Workspace displays information about task plan templates, template items, and template item conditions.

This tab is available for the following tables:
