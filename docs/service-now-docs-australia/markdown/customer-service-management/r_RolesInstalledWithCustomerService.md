# Roles installed with Customer Service Management

The Customer Service Management application uses roles to provide access to information, identify internal and external users, maintain data security, and establish different types of relationships between users.

## Primary roles

Customer Service Management provides several primary roles that support the following business models:

-   Business-to-business \(B2B\): With this business model, you can support accounts and contacts. Additionally, you can create relationships and account teams to support your customers.
-   Business-to-consumer \(B2C\): With this business model, you can support individual consumers.

These roles ensure access to data while maintaining data security for different types of business relationships.

</table>For details about these roles, see [CSM roles and descriptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/r_RolesInstalledWithCustomerService.md) below.

## Internal and external roles

Customer Service Management includes both internal and external user roles.

-   Internal roles are assigned to users within your organization. These roles are for agents and managers using the Customer Service Management application to support customers.
-   External roles are assigned to users outside your organization. These roles are for customers, customer partners, and consumers using the self-service portals.

With these roles, you can give both internal users and external users access to your instance. This role structure gives you the flexibility to provide different levels of access to different users. As an additional security measure, every user must have at least one role so that the instance can distinguish between internal and external users.

## Base roles

The primary roles available in Customer Service Management are based on the following base roles:

-   sn\_esm\_agent
-   sn\_esm\_admin
-   sn\_esm\_partner
-   sn\_esm\_partner\_admin
-   sn\_esm\_user
-   sn\_esm\_user\_admin

For more information about these roles, see [Roles installed with the Customer Service Base Entities plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/r_RolesInstalledWithCustomerService.md) below.

For more information about the CSM primary role structure and included roles, see [CSM roles and descriptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/r_RolesInstalledWithCustomerService.md) below.

## Explicit roles

You may have business requirements that change the use of these roles. In addition, the [Explicit Roles in CSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/explicit-roles-in-csm.md) feature may assign both internal and external roles to external users. It is important to regularly review user role assignments to ensure that they are set according to your business requirements.

For more information about reviewing and updating user role assignments, see:

-   **[Provide external users access to a table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/t_ProvideExternalUsersAccessToTables.md)**  
To enable users with only the snc\_external role to access the list view of a table, you must create a series of ACLs.
