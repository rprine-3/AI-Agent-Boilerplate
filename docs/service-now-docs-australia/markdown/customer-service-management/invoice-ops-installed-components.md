</table>## Service definitions and service definition categories

-   Type: Post-Sale
-   Table: Invoice Case \[sn\_csm\_invoice\_case\]
-   Products: All
-   Service definition category: Invoice

Agents can use this service definition to raise a dispute for one or more invoices or for specific lines on a single invoice.

This service definition belongs to the Invoice service definition category, which stores services for invoice-related issues. When creating an invoice case, agents can select this service definition in the [case type selector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-case-type-select-modals.md).

**Note:** The **Invoice Disputes** service definition is not active by default. To activate this service definition, the system administrator can:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Service Definitions**.
2.  Filter the list to show service definitions from the Invoice Case \[sn\_invoice\_case\] table.
3.  Select **Invoice Disputes**.
4.  Enable the **Active** check box.

</table>## Invoice case type

In addition to the fields on the customer service case record, the Invoice Case table \[sn\_csm\_invoice\_case\] includes the following fields:

-   **Invoice number**: The invoice number that the invoice case has been opened for.
-   **Request source**: The source of the invoice case. Invoice cases can be created from the following sources:
    -   Specific invoice lines, single invoice
    -   Invoice header details, multiple invoices

For more information about case types, see [Customer service case types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-service-case-types.md).

To view the Invoice case type, navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Case Types** &gt; **Manage Case Types** and select **Invoice**.

## Invoice case form views

The Case Management for Invoice Operations application includes form views to display invoice cases in CRM Workspace and in the Core UI.

This application uses the [CSM default record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-default-record-page.md) to display Invoice case records in CRM Workspace.

Invoice cases include the following related lists:

-   Invoice Case Lines: Includes the individual case line records for this invoice case.
-   Tasks: Includes tasks that have been created for this invoice case.
-   Case Line Tasks: Includes tasks that have been created for individual case lines.

For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Invoice case form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/invoice-case-form.md)
-   [Invoice case line form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/invoice-case-lines-form.md)

## Invoice case archive rules

<table id="table_bmp_vgp_2dc"><thead><tr><th>

-   Invoice case line tasks

</td></tr><tr><td>

-   Invoice case tasks
-   Invoice case line items
-   Case line characteristics
-   Invoice case line tasks

## Invoice case workflows

The Case Management for Invoice Operations application includes a subflow that provides the mapping between a customer invoice and an invoice case. The subflow **Primitives - AR Invoice to CSM Invoice case request** creates the data mapping between two different entities: 1\) the customer invoice and 2\) the invoice case.

For example, when mapping a customer invoice to an invoice case, the entities share some fields such as **Account** and **Contact**. The data mapping copies these field values from the customer invoice to the invoice case record.

To view this subflow, navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio** and select **Subflows** on the Workflow Studio homepage.
