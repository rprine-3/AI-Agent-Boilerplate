# Using remote tables and the Salesforce spoke

Create Salesforce spoke actions that you can use to test the third-party data integration. Then use these actions in the remote table definition.

-   **[Using the IntegrationHub Salesforce spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-integration-salesforce.md)**  
Use the Salesforce spoke to integrate a Salesforce account with your ServiceNow instance.
-   **[Create Salesforce spoke actions to retrieve opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-integration-salesforce-spoke.md)**  
The Salesforce spoke provides actions to retrieve metadata of the opportunity record and create a new opportunity.
-   **[Remote tables and definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-remote-tables-definition.md)**  
Once you have the spoke custom actions working, you need to create a remote table that describes the schema for the data to be retrieved from the Salesforce Opportunity table.
-   **[Example script that queries the Opportunity table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-opportunity-table-script.md)**  
This example script queries the opportunity table using the **Get All Opportunities**, **Get Opportunities for Account Id**, and **Get Opportunity Details** custom actions.
-   **[Connect Customer Account and Salesforce Opportunities using a related list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-related-list-opportunity-table.md)**  
Use a related list to link the Customer Account table with Salesforce Account Id, and the Salesforce Opportunity remote table with the same Account Id.
