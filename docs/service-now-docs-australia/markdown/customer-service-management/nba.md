With Recommended Actions:

-   Provide agents with optimal action in a context of a record.
-   Enable agents to focus their attention to the critical call-to-action.
-   Allow agents to take an action in a contextual side panel or in a subtab.
-   Enable agents to troubleshoot and provide a resolution to customers.
-   Rank actions that agents can take based on a configurable logic.
-   Recommend a value for a field on a form.
-   Enable agents to use AI search to find the most relevant resources.

## Example scenarios for implementing Recommended Actions

Use Recommended Actions to provide the following recommendations:

-   Apply resolution from a solved case: Recommend agents to apply resolution from a similar solved case and then close the case.
-   Reassign case: Recommend a field value for the Assignment group field so that the case is assigned to the relevant team.
-   View and attach article: Recommend a Knowledge article relevant to the customer issue so that agents can view and attach the article to the current case.
-   Review a refund request. Recommend a decision tree for agents to work through to determine if the customer is eligible for a refund.

For end-to-end configurations of recommended actions for specific scenarios, see [Example configurations of recommended actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/recommended-actions-use-case.md).

## Action types for Recommended Actions

Agents can enter their queries in the search bar to access AI-powered search results. The most relevant answers for the search query appear as genius result cards. Agents can take the actions from the search cards directly to resolve an issue. For more information, see [AI search in Recommended Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-ai-search.md).
