# Customer Service Management and CSDM tables

Customer Service Management manages and uses CSDM tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to Customer Service Management.

CSM references the following CSDM tables:

1.  Sold Product table \[sn\_install\_base\_sold\_product in CSM

    Represents the product purchased by an Account or Consumer, and references the Product Model table \[cmdb\_model\] or Service Model table \[cmdb\_service\_product\_model\] for a Customer \(Account or Consumer\).

2.  Install Base Item table \[sn\_install\_base\_item\] in CSM

    Represents the products installed or in use by an account or consumer. Install Base Items are CIs consumed by the customer and generally reference the Application Services table \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_discovered\] for SaaS products.

    Multiple sold products can be used on a given Install Base Item by using the Installed Products table \[sn\_install\_base\_m2m\_installed\_product\].

3.  A Service Model references the Service Offerings table \[service\_offering\]. Multiple Service Offerings can be associated with a single Service Model.
4.  After the product is sold to a customer, the Sold Product table references the Service Offering table \[service\_offering\]. This reference helps to identify the customers subscribed to an offering.
5.  Customers can request services related to the products they have purchased by linking the Catalog Items table \[sc\_cat\_item\] to the Product Model or Service Model by using the Product-to-Catalog Items Relationships table \[sn\_prod\_cat\_rel\_m2m\_product\_catalog\_item\].
6.  Account table \[customer\_account\] in CSM

    Extends the Company table. The Account table can be a customer account, a partner account, or both.

7.  Contact table \[customer\_contact\] in CSM

    Extends the User table. A user is an employee of an account. A contact record stores information about a contact, such as the name, phone number, and email address. A contact can also have a user ID and can log in to the customer portal.

8.  Consumer table \[csm\_consumer\] in CSM

    A consumer is a customer in the business-to-consumer \(B2C\) business model.


## CSDM tables used by CSM

1.  Company \[core\_company\], Business Unit \[business\_unit\], Department \[cmn\_department\], Location \[cmn\_location\], Groups \[sys\_user\_group\], Users \[sys\_user\]
2.  Product Model tables \[cmdb\_model\], and \[cmdb\_service\_product\_model\]
3.  Contract table \[ast\_contract\]
4.  Mapped service instance table \(formerly application service\) \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_discovered\]
5.  Configuration Item table \[cmdb\_ci\_\*\]
6.  Business Service table \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_business\]
7.  Business Service Offering table \[service\_offering\]
8.  Request Catalog table \[sc\_cat\_item\]
