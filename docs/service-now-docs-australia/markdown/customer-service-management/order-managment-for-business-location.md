# Order Management for business organization

Integrate Service Model Foundation with Order Management to support channel sales.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Overview of the integration

Use the Order Management Business Locations plugin \(com.snc.business\_organization\_orm\) to perform the following actions.

-   Create orders for business organizations \(formerly business locations\)
-   Modify and manage orders for the business organizations \(formerly business locations\)
-   Track seller and buyer details of the order

## Data model

The Customer Order Related Party \[sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm\_customer\_order\_related\_party\] table is a list of service organizations. You can add a related party record to the table to provide access to another party that is different from the service organization associated with the customer order. All related parties listed as **Authorized organizations** and associated with a particular customer order have access to the order, the order line items, and all other related entities. Channel partners such as referral partners, influencer partners, and more can be added as related parties to an order.
