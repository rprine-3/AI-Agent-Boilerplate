Scale Factor

</td><td>

Number of polling jobs created for a particular queue. **Note:**

Each application node gets a job and an order according to queue. The customer can increase the value up to a maximum of 3. Increasing the scale factor creates more polling jobs according to application node for that queue.

For configuring queues, Only one queue with two scale factor and a 5-second poll interval is shipped out of the base system.

For a higher load, adjust scale factors accordingly.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Poll Interval

</td><td>

The poll interval is the waiting time before the queue is processed. It determines how often the queue is polled, that is, how frequently new events are fetched. Decreasing the value to a lower number might cause acquiring most of the worker threads. Those threads are picked for RA use-case and can cause delays to other tasks on the instance.

The poll interval displays the duration in:

-   **Days**: Shows the number of days the queue has been added.
-   **Hours:** Indicates the duration \(in seconds, minutes, or hours\) that an event has been in the queue once added.
