# CSM Configurable Workspace contextual side panel components

Use the contextual side panel to quickly access tools and information directly from the record page, helping agents research and resolve customer issues without leaving the case view.

The contextual side panel is embedded within multiple [record pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-config-ws-pages-templates.md) in CRM Workspace. The side panel contains tabs with different functionality that vary depending on the record page. While the content within the side panel may be similar from one record page to another, the order and availability of the tabs may vary.

The Recommended Actions tab includes [AI search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-ai-search.md) functionality. Agents can use AI search to find relevant resources or resolutions for customer issues.

 The search feature displays an initial set of search results based on the text in the case short description. This initial set of results includes knowledge articles. Agents can also enter different search keywords and repeat the search.

 From the list of search results, agents can do the following:

-   Select a source to see search results of that type.
-   Filter the list of search results.
-   Sort the list of search results.
-   Open the search results in full view in a record sub-tab.

 Agents can take the following actions:

-   View and attach an article.
-   Perform other actions such as reading articles in full view, flagging articles, or marking articles as helpful or unhelpful.
-   View successful actions by selecting the Actions history icon.
