# Activate Customer Service Management

You can activate the Customer Service \(com.sn\_customerservice\) plugin, if you have the admin role. This plugin includes demo data and activates related plugins if they aren’t already active.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

If the related plugins aren’t already active, the Customer Service Management plugin activates them. For more information, see [Plugins activated with Customer Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/plugins-activated-with-csm.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).


## What to do next

You can activate several related plugins after activating the Customer Service Management plugin \(com.sn\_customerservice\). For details, see [Additional plugins for Customer Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/r_CustServMgmtAddtlPluginsTable.md).
