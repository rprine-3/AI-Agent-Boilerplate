## About this task

By default, the Case auto-responder recommendations notification is configured to send Auto-Responder email notifications for customer service cases logged using emails. You can configure it to include other communication channels such as web, phone, chat, social, community, alert, and virtual agent.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Notifications**.

2.  Search for `Case auto-responder recommendations`.

3.  In the **Name** column, click the **Case auto-responder recommendations** link.

4.  In the **Conditions** field, click **Add Filter Condition** or **Add "Or" Clause** to set the filter condition for a communication channel.

    **Note:** The default filter condition is **\[Channel\] \[is\] \[Email\] AND \[Active\] \[is\] \[true\]**.

    For example, to send Auto-Responder notifications for customer service cases logged using a mobile phone in addition to email, you would click **Add Filter Condition** and create the condition **\[Channel\] \[is\] \[Phone\] AND \[Active\] \[is\] \[true\]**.
