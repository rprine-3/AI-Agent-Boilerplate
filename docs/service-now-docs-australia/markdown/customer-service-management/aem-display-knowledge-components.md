# Display ServiceNow knowledge articles on an Adobe Experience Manager page

Use knowledge components available within Adobe Experience Manager \(AEM\) to access knowledge bases from the ServiceNow instance and display associated knowledge articles on an AEM-based website.

## Before you begin

-   Activate the Knowledge API plugin \(sn\_km\_api\) to use the Knowledge Management REST API endpoints for knowledge articles. For more information, see [Knowledge Management REST API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/knowledge-api.md).
-   Define the cross-origin resource sharing \(CORS\) rule to access the Knowledge API from your AEM instance. For more information, see [Define a cross-origin resource sharing rule \(CORS\) to access ServiceNow API endpoints from AEM]().

Role required: AEM author

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your AEM instance.

2.  Open your AEM page in [Edit mode](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/experience-manager/6-5/sites/authoring/using/author-environment-tools.html#main-pars_title_20).

3.  Open the [components browser](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/experience-manager/6-5/sites/authoring/using/author-environment-tools.html#main-pars_title_17).

4.  From the **All** list, select **ServiceNow**.

5.  Drag a component to the required position on the page.

    **Note:** If components are not available, update your template configuration to include the knowledge components. In addition, you must modify the properties of the site template and add each knowledge article component to the list of allowed components.

6.  Open the [component dialog for editing](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/experience-manager/6-5/sites/authoring/using/editing-content.html#ComponentEditDialog).

    **Note:** By default, the knowledge components in the Edit mode of a page in AEM aren't accessible by public users, which are anonymous AEM users who are not logged in. To change the default behavior, you must enable the **Public** property for each knowledge component.

7.  Set the Search Results component properties to display knowledge search results that include a list of knowledge articles from the knowledge bases in the ServiceNow instance.
