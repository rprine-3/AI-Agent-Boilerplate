# Add additional contacts for the sold product

Add additional contacts for the B2B \(accounts or contacts\) or B2B2C sold product by defining the type and responsibility. Once added, additional contacts have the same access to the contact associated with the sold product and the related entities.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Additional contacts can be enabled using the **Restrict Contact Access** field. For details, see [Restrict contact access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/manage-account-access-cam.md).

Role required: admin and sn\_customerservice\_manager

## About this task

The responsibility assigned to the additional contact that is associated with a sold product gets access to the sold product and the related entities, which include installed products, install base items, and cases associated with sold products.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Products** &gt; **Sold Products**.

2.  Select the desired record where you want to add additional contacts.

3.  From the Additional Contacts related list, select **New**.

    Starting with the Utah release, the Additional Contacts related list has been deprecated for new customers. For upgrade customers, the Additional Contacts related list continue to be supported along with the Sold Product Related Parties related list.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:** Added contacts can be from the same account, partner account, or from contact relationships.


## Result

Once additional contacts are added to the sold product with a proper functional role having Authorized Representative responsibility, they can perform the following actions.

-   View the list of sold products and associated install base items.
-   Create cases by selecting sold products or install bases.
-   View the list of cases related to the sold products or affected install bases.
-   View the list of installed products.
-   Access cases associated with the sold product.
-   Manage service catalog requests from the sold product.

**Note:**

-   While creating a case for a sold product, you can only see authorized contacts.
-   If you choose someone as a contact, you can only associate the sold products they have full access to on the case.
