# Configure the data collection for resources demands

Define the data you want to collect for cases, interactions, or any table to forecast the number of agents that you require for your staffing needs.

## Before you begin

You must have the MetricBase plugin \[com.snc.clotho\] enabled to use Demand Forecast in Workforce Optimization for Customer Service. For more information, see [Requesting the MetricBase product](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/request-metricbase.md).

**Note:**

-   When you change the forecast parameters or resource conversion formula, the new values for resource forecasts will not reflect on the team calendar until the **Forecast resources for future** scheduled job is executed. Your administrator can run the scheduled job on-demand to view the changes in the team calendar.
-   Once the **Historical data collection** job is run for specific data collection definitions, the column **Is historical data collected** in the Forecast Configurations \[sn\_agent\_forecast\_configuration\] table is set to **true**. Hence, the historical data collection will not run even if you add data for the past dates from the back-end. Historical data is stored for 1098 days for forecasts set at daily interval. Beyond three years, historical data is cleaned and cannot be saved.

Role required: sn\_agent\_forecast.admin

        -   If you need to add a value to be calculated for the formula, in the **Value** field, enter the value.
        -   If you want to use the performance analytics score card API or a custom API, select **Advanced,** and add the script.
        The Average Case Work Time and Average Chat Work Time forecast parameters provided by default are examples of how you can use scripts to add the parameters. For a list of parameters provided by default, see [Forecast Parameters in Scheduling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md).
