## About this task

Conversational Appointment Booking requires the following plugins. Ensure that these plugins are activated before you install Conversational Appointment Booking.

-   **Required ServiceNow plugins**
    -   **Walk-Up for CSM \(com.snc.walkup\_for\_csm\)**

        **Note:** Conversational Appointment Booking can be used without the Walk-Up for CSM plugin. However, custom control and Virtual Agent topic blocks shown in [Configure Conversational Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/conv-appt-booking-config.md) cannot be used without this plugin.

        The following items are installed with this plugin:

        -   Now Assist model for Conversational Appointment Booking.

            **Note:** A Now Assist for CSM license must be active on your instance for using the Now Assist model for Conversational Appointment Booking model.

        -   Virtual Agent topics: Walk-up Appointment Scheduling - LLM, Reschedule a Walk-up appointment, and Cancel a Walk-up appointment.
    -   **Appointment Booking \(com.snc.appointment\_booking\)**

        Enables the appointment booking feature for Walk-up Experience.

    -   **Glide Virtual Agent \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\)**

        Activates the Virtual Agent platform. Virtual Agent requires additional licensing. See [Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent-landing-page.md) for more information.

    -   **Studio \(com.glide.dev-studio\)**

        Used for adding and updating application files.
