# Domain separation and the CSM Walk-up Experience application

This section is an overview of domain separation as it pertains to the CSM Walk-up Experience application and how it relates to Service Portal pages, interaction queues, and configurations. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic



-   Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
-   The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider \(SP\) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).

## Overview

Domain separation in the CSM Walk-up Experience application is supported at the **Basic** level. However, the application depends on the Service Portal, which is not supported for domain separation. Domain separation pertains to the CSM Walk-up Experience application in the following ways:

-   Walk-up location queues support domain separation to define which end users can access each location queue.
-   The Interaction table supports standard domain separation for data security. Interaction tickets are opened for a specific domain.
-   Walk-up location queues and interactions support domain separation. Therefore, fulfillers also work within a domain-separated environment when addressing interaction tickets associated with a location queue.
-   Management and administration configurations reside in the walk-up location queue records. Therefore, those configurations are available to the respective domain managers and admins.
-   While the Service Portal pages are not domain separated, the CSM Walk-up Experience application's portal pages retrieve data within the user’s specific domain. Therefore, those pages can be reused across different service portals designed and configured for separate domains. The admins must build each portal themselves.
-   The **Domain** field is available on the wu\_location\_queue table. Setting domain here ensures users only see queues that are part of their domains during online check-in.
-   For Advanced Work Assignment routing to operate, each wu\_location\_queue must include a work item routing condition. This condition explicitly adds a reference to the domain the queue is part of.

    **Note:** The appointment booking feature is not domain separated. Since Appointment \[itil\_appointment\] table data is not domain separated, list views could reveal data across domains.


## How domain separation works in the CSM Walk-up Experience application

For this application to be the most effective, walk-up administrators should configure walk-up locations accordingly. Configure the `wu_location_queue` record to meet a user need, which affects the requester experience. Each domain configured to the location queue record has its own set of rules. The same applies to other tables within the Walk-up application as well.

**Note:** Elements of the Service Portal platform such as settings, portals, and widgets cannot be domain separated. However, the data within the widgets displays based on how the domain is configured. The recommended approach is to set up separate portals for each MSP customer.

Elements of the Service Portal that are used as part of the walk-up experience are as follows:

-   Portal \(Walk-up\)
-   Pages \(``walkup_online_checkin, walkup_queue_on_site, walkup_home, walkup_survey, walkup_check_in``\)
-   Theme \(Walk-up theme\)
-   Widgets \(Online check-in experience, walk-up queue on site, walk-up check-in, walk-up exit survey, walk-up home, walk-up schedule\)

To learn more, see [Domain separation and Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/domain-separation-service-portal.md).

For data separation, the CSM Walk-up Experience application uses the walk-up user \(Requester/Walkup login user\) domain to determine in which domain the requester data should be placed.

-   Requesters can check in only in locations for which they have visibility.
-   Requesters are able to select the Reasons that belong only to their own domain.
-   Interaction records are created in the Requester’s domain.

For the Fulfiller side, the application uses the domain of the walk-up user \(walk-up technician/ manager/ admin\) to determine which records are visible.

-   By domain separation rules, Fulfillers can work only on interactions that are visible to them.
-   Fulfillers are able to configure only walk-up location records that belong to their domain, are in the global domain, or have the parent-child hierarchy.
-   The same visibility rules apply for the Many to Many `[wu_m2m_location_queue_reason]`tables that control the mapping between a location and reason.
-   The walk-up context records also have domain separation support. This support ensures technicians to view detailed requester information only for the records that are visible by domain separation rules.

## Domain-separated tables

As part of the CSM Walk-up Experience, records in the following tables can be domain separated.

-   Walk-up location queues `[wu_location_queue]`
-   Walk-up reasons for visit `[wu_reason]`
-   Walk-up reasons `[wu_m2m_location_queue_reason]`
-   Walk-up contexts `[wu_context]`
-   Interactions `[interaction]`
