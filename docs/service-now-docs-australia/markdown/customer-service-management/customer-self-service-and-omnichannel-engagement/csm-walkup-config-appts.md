# Create a Walk-up Experience appointment booking configuration for a service

Create or modify appointment booking configurations for Walk-up Experience services. A service is defined as the actual physical location of a walk-up queue. The information stored in the Walk-up Experience application configuration applies to all services,or queue locations, within the application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apptmnt\_booking.appointment\_booking\_admin

## About this task

To use the appointment booking feature, administrators must create a configuration for each service, or queue location, that is available to walk-up customers. Service configurations are created within the **Walk-up Experience** application configuration, as part of the **Appointment Booking** application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment Booking Configuration**.

2.  Click **Walk-up Experience**.

3.  In the Appointment Booking Service Configuration related list, click **New** to create a new service configuration.

    Alternatively, you can click an existing service configuration to modify data.

4.  In the Appointment Booking Service Configuration form, fill in the following fields as needed.

<table id="table_vst_5nf_2r"><thead><tr><th>

Appointment booking evaluates the holiday schedule when determining the number of available appointments and excludes any day in the schedule that is set to **Exclude**.

Catalog Item

</td><td>

The service in the service catalog for which this appointment booking configuration is being created. Click the lookup icon and select a service from the Record Producers list.

**Note:** The catalog item must exist in the service catalog.

 If you are using appointment booking with work orders, create a work order template before you configure appointment booking.

</td></tr><tr><td>

-   If disabled, the user can submit the service request without selecting an appointment.
