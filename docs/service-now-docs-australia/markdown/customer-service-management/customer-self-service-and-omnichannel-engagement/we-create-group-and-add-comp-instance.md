# Create a group and add a component instance

Create a group to model third-party website structure such as page or sections. Use the default group or create new groups to manage the component instances on that page or section.

## Before you begin

You must create a module. For more information, see [Create a module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/create-we-module.md).

Role required: sn\_embeddable\_core.emb\_admin

## About this task

You can create multiple groups for the same module and include different component instances. When you create a module, a default group called **Group 1** is automatically added to the **Components** tab. Additionally, you can delete the group, rename the group title, and rearrange the group position by simply dragging and dropping them. If you delete the group, it will permanently remove the group and its component instances from the module, and it cannot be undone. However, existing component instances on your website will remain functional. To remove the components from your website, delete or comment out the embed code on your webpage.

Similar to groups, you can also clone, delete, and rename component instances and move them between different groups by simply dragging and dropping. Additionally, if you delete, it will permanently remove the component instance from this module, and it cannot be undone. However, existing instances on your website will remain functional. To remove the component from your website, delete or comment out the embed code on your webpage.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Web Embeddables** &gt; **Homepage**.

2.  On Your modules section, select module.

3.  On the module page, in the **Component** tab, select **Add group**.

    **Note:** A Group 2 is created and appears in the **Component** tab.

4.  Select Group 2 \( &gt;\) icon.

    **Note:** A pop-up window appears, displaying all the components for which you can create component instances.

5.  Select **Add component**.

6.  Select a component.

    A new component instance is created and appears in Group 2.

7.  Configure the component instance properties.
