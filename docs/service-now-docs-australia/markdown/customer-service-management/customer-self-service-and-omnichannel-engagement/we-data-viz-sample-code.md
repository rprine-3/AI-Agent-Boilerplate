# Sample code for the Data visualization component

Sample code is provided to define an action when an event is triggered. Update the sample code for your use case before embedding the component on your webpage.

## Sample code

```
{ 

'NOW_VIS_WRAPPER#PROPERTY_OVERRIDE' : (e) => { 

// Dispatched when the visualization overrides its property. For example when the user selects a different group by from the alternative group by selection 

var {properties} = e.detail.payload; 

console.log(properties); 

}, 

'NOW_VIS_WRAPPER#SELECTED' : (e) => { 

// Dispatched when the user selects/de-selects element on data visualizations, typically to filter other content on the page 

var {title, type, isSelected, params, data} = e.detail.payload; 

console.log(title, type, isSelected, params, data); 

}, 

'NOW_VIS_WRAPPER#CLICKED' : (e) => { 

// Dispatched when the visualization is clicked 

var {title, type, params, data} = e.detail.payload; 

console.log(title, type, params, data); 

}
```
