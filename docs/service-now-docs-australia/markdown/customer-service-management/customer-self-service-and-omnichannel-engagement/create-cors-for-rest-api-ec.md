# Configure a CORS rule for Engagement Messenger

Configure a cross-origin resource sharing \(CORS\) rule to enable cross-domain requests between Engagement Messenger and your website where you want to deploy the messenger.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

You must complete the following tasks:

-   [Configure Engagement Messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/create-engagement-messenger-module.md).
-   [Create an identity provider \(IdP\) for Engagement Messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/create-identity-providers-for-engagement-messenger.md).

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **REST** &gt; **CORS Rules**.
