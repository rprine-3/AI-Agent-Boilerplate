# View the number of portal bot-based sessions

Ensure customers are not incorrectly billed by viewing the number of bot-based sessions. CSM portal usage sessions are billable to customers but sometimes customers are unnecessarily charged for sessions generated due to bots, crawlers, and DDOS attacks.

## Before you begin

Role required: usage\_admin

## About this task

For all new portals you create, bot sessions are captured in the Service Portal Bot Sessions \[ua\_sp\_bot\_session\] table and all session types are captured in the Service Portal Usage \[ua\_sp\_usage\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **View/Run**.

2.  Enter `customer portal usage` in the **Search** field.

3.  Select the **Customer Portal Usage** report from the drop-down list.

    The report shows the session count for all sessions and a separate count of sessions generated due to bots, crawlers, and DDoS attacks.
