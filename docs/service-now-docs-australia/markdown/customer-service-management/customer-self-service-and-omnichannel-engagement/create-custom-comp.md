# Create a custom component

Create a custom component to present information, capture user input, or offer interactive functionality on a third party website. You can also clone the existing component and customize it.

## Before you begin

-   Beginning with the Zurich release, Component UI Builder is enabled by default in your instance.
-   Existing customers on release versions before Zurich release, you must enable Component UI Builder in your instance by activating UI Builder plugin \(sn\_ui\_builder\) to create a custom component.
-   Make sure you’re referring UI Builder version 27.2 or above for component creation.
-   Ensure the \[sn\_cb\_experiences.uib.enable.cb\] system property is set to true.
