# Set up Engagement Messenger

Understand the stages involved in setting up Engagement Messenger before you add it to your customer service web portal.

After you install the Engagement Messenger application in your instance, you’re ready to configure it. You can also watch the [academy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uViv-3bcg3k&list=PLkGSnjw5y2U79gjQuQW-2GBqzEccwFkWH&index=20) to understand the overall functionality of Engagement Messenger.

The configuration process involves the following tasks:

1.  [Install the Engagement Messenger application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/install-engagement-center-app.md) from the ServiceNow® Store.
2.  Create Engagement Messenger module.

    -   Configure the theme and styling of how Engagement Messenger appears to your customers
    -   Configure how Engagement Messenger behaves when your customer uses it
    -   Configure how Engagement Messenger works for your customers
    For more information, see [Configure Engagement Messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/create-engagement-messenger-module.md).

3.  Create identity providers to enable an authenticated user experience. See [Create an identity provider \(IdP\) for Engagement Messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/create-identity-providers-for-engagement-messenger.md).

    If you want to enable only a guest user experience for your customer service portal, you can ignore this step and move on to step 4.

4.  Create cross-origin resource sharing \(CORS\) rules for the REST API. See [Configure a CORS rule for Engagement Messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/create-cors-for-rest-api-ec.md).
5.  Add HTTP response headers for your Engagement Messenger. See [Create HTTP response headers for Engagement Messenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/create-http-response-headers-for-ec.md).
6.  Configure the system properties to enable virtual agent chat, multi-provider SSO, and to set a user session time-out value.
