# Walk-up Experience appointment booking

With the CSM Walk-up Experience appointment booking feature, walk-up users can view available appointment windows. The users can also select and book an appointment for a walk-up location using the online **Walk-up Check-in** feature.

Create time windows for walk-up queue locations enabling requesters to book service appointments.

The Appointment Booking plugin \(com.snc.appointment\_booking\) must be activated to use the application. Appointment booking adds the Appointment Booking menu to the application navigator and the following modules:

-   **Appointment Booking Configuration**: Use this module to create an appointment booking. Configure an application and then configure each service within that application.
-   **Appointment Bookings**: Use this module to view a list of appointments that have been booked for services. This list includes the work orders associated with each appointment.

Appointment booking requires configuration at both the application level, in this case, Walk-up Experience, and at the walk-up queue service level, represented by the actual location of the walk-up queue.

The Walk-up Experience application configuration contains settings that apply to all the service locations within the application that support appointment booking.

A service configuration is required for each of the walk-up queue locations within the application that offer scheduled appointments. A service configuration includes settings that apply only to that specific walk-up queue service location.

**Note:** Both the application configuration and the service configuration must be active to book appointments.

For detailed information about the **Appointment Booking** application, see [Managing appointments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/managing-appointments.md).
