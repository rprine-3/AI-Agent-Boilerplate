Configure the business and consumer portal to provide information and support for your customers.

## Before you begin

Role required: sp\_admin

## About this task

The Business and Consumer Portals are self-service web portals based on the ServiceNow Service Portal application.

The Business Portal supports your business-to-business \(B2B\) customers and the Consumer Portal supports your business-to-consumer \(B2C\) customers.

Use the portals to provide information and support for your customers. The portals provide ready-to-use features that require minimal setup. These include:

-   Header and footer with links for different customer activities.
-   The home page provides a summary of essential items to the logged-in user.
-   Hierarchical menu to systematically navigate to different portal pages.
-   Unified browse experience for knowledge and catalog through taxonomy topics.
-   List pages to browse, search, and filter through records of cases, products, orders, and others.
-   Record view pages to view key information, related actions, related lists, and quick links of a record.

You can add additional self-service capabilities such as order management by installing the respective plugin .

**Note:**

-   The Business Portal Store app is automatically installed when you install the Customer Service Portal store app \(from version 24.0.0 and above\).
-   The Consumer Portal Store app is automatically installed when you install the Consumer Portal store app \(from version 24.0.0 and above\).
