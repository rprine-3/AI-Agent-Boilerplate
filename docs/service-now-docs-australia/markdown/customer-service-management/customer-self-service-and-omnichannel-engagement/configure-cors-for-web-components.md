# Configure CORS \(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\) rules before embedding ServiceNow components

Configure a CORS rule to enable cross-domain requests between ServiceNow components and the website that you want to embed the web components.

## Before you begin

You must have the following setup in to configure CORS rules for components:

-   You must activate the ServiceNow components. For more information, see [Activate Web Embeddables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/act-web-embeddables.md).
-   At least one ServiceNow component configured on your instance.

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can use the existing CORS rules to enable secure communication between ServiceNow components and the external website. You can also set up a CORS rule so that ServiceNow components are able to make cross-origin requests to retrieve dynamic translations. For more information on creating and defining CORS rules, see [Define a CORS rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/t_DefineACORSRule.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Web Embeddables** &gt; **Configure** &gt; **CORS rules**.

2.  In the **Domain name** field, enter the domain name that you want to embed the component.

3.  Select **Check status**.

    Displays all the CORS rules that must be configured. It shows both configured and unconfigured URLs.

4.  Select **Configure CORS rules**.

    Initiates CORS rules for all the unconfigured URLs.

    **Note:** The confirmation message `CORS rules configured successfully` appears.


## Result

The domain name that you’ve entered is configured with CORS rules and can be used to embed the component.
