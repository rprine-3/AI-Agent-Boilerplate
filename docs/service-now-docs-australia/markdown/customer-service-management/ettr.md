# Estimated time to resolve a case

Machine learning in Customer Service Management helps with case resolution by predicting the estimated time to resolve a case.

**Note:** Support for creating new regression solutions was deprecated in the Washington DC release. You can train and edit any existing solutions, but you can't initiate new ones. The following information is provided for legacy context. For more information see [Create and train a regression solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-regression-solution.md).

Machine learning predicts the estimated time to resolve a case \(ETTR\) based on attributes of a case such as its short description, category, priority, and assignment group. For more information about configuring the machine learning regression definition for ETTR, see [Configure the default estimated resolution time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ettr_configure.md).

## Activation

This feature is available with activation of the Predictive Intelligence for Customer Service Management plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_ml\). For more information, see [Install Predictive Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-predictive-intelligence.md).

Agents must activate the **Time to resolve** ribbon component, which displays the ETTR, to view it in the CSM Agent Workspace or in the CSM Configurable Workspace. For more information, see [Display the time to resolve ribbon component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ettr-activate.md) and [CRM Workspace form ribbon and components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-agent-workspace-ribbon.md).
