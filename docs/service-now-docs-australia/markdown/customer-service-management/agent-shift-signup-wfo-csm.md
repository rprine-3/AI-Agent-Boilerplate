# Enable your teams to sign up for work shifts

Empower your teams to sign up for work shifts based on their availability and preference.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_shift\_planning.admin

## About this task

When a schedule plan is enabled for sign-up, you can receive notifications. You can also receive notifications when the schedule plan that's open for sign up is due on the current day or when it's due soon.

**Important:** The maximum number of agents who receive notifications is controlled by the `glide.ui_notification.max_recipients` system property. Notifications are sent only up to the configured limit.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for CSM** &gt; **Manager Workspace**

2.  Select the Schedule icon \(\[Omitted image "schedule-icon.png"\] Alt text: Schedule icon\).

3.  Add a schedule plan.

    1.  Select the **Team Calendar** tab.

    2.  In the Contextual side panel, click the Show Schedules icon \[Omitted image "show-schedules-icon.png"\] Alt text: Show Schedules icon. to display the schedules.

        **Tip:** Select the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "show-filter-icon.png"\] Alt text: Filter schedule\) and then select the desired sign-up state and sign-up dates to narrow down the schedule plans enabled for sign-up.

        2.  In the **Agents must sign-up by** field, enter the date by which they must sign up for shifts within that schedule.
        **Tip:** If your agents have signed up for their preferred shifts, the **Assigned To** field is auto-populated with those agents.

    6.  Select **Save schedule**.

4.  Add a work shift to the schedule plan.

    1.  Select the schedule plan you've created.

    3.  In the **Shift** field, select the work shift that you want to add to the schedule plan.

        **Note:** If the schedule plan has been enabled for agents to sign up for shifts, the following fields are automatically enabled:

        -   **Request agent sign-up**
        -   **Enable auto-assignment of agents**
        If you want to assign agents manually, you can disable these check boxes at any time.

    4.  If the shifts are enabled for sign-up, you can select **Send for signup**.

        All shifts that have been enabled for sign-up are sent to the agents to sign up for their shifts. You can select **Close sign-up** to close agent sign-up for a shift before the sign-up due date and manually assign the agents.

        -   The **Enabled for sign-up** highlighted label changes to **Closed for sign-up**.
        -   The system will automatically close the sign ups after the sign-up due date.
