**Create a work shift**

</td><td>

1.  Create a work shift.
    1.  Click **Work shift**.
    2.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the shift.
    3.  Select the time window for the shift.
        1.  In the **Time Zone** field, select the time zone of the users that you want to allocate to the shift.

**Note:** To add a shift for agents working in their local time zones, select the **Use agent time zone** option. The system uses the time zone that is specified in the agent's user record.

        2.  In the **Start Time** field, enter the time of day when you want to start the shift.
        3.  In the **End Time** field, enter the time of day when you want to end the shift.
    4.  Select the days of the week for which you want to add this shift.
    5.  Click **Save**.
2.  Add schedule breaks to the shift.

    1.  Select the shift that you created.
    2.  Click **Add break**.
    3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the break.
    4.  Set a duration for the break.
        1.  In the **Duration** field, enter the length of time for the break.
        2.  In the **Earliest Start Time** field, enter the earliest time to start the break.
        3.  In the **Latest End Time** field, enter the latest time to end the break.

For example, you can set the earliest start time as 11:00, the latest end time as 15:00, and the duration of the break as one hour. If you add four agents to that work shift, the Scheduling application automatically staggers the break duration for each agent. Stagger breaks to ensure that your four agents can cover the entire shift span.

        4.  Click **Save**.
You can view the number of agents for each hour or day on the shift span window.
