# Review a publication

Users with the publications approver role that have been added as approvers to the publication workflow can review a publication.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_publications.approver or sn\_customerservice\_manager

## About this task

After reviewing, an approver can either accept or reject a publication. If an approver does not review a publication before the **Publish Date**, the publication cannot be approved. The **Approve** button is not displayed and the approver sees a message that the publish date and time has passed. The approver can only reject the publication, which returns it to the **Author** stage.

The **Approvers** related list displays a list of approval tasks and includes most recent comment from each approver.

**Note:** Delegate approval is not available in the Targeted Communications application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **My Approvals**.

2.  Select a publication for review from the Approvals list that has a state of **Requested**.

3.  Review the publication summary at the bottom of the approval form.

4.  Add review comments to the **Comments** field.

5.  Click one of the following options.
