# Configure case management

Configure the Customer Service Management features and components that agents and managers use to create and resolve cases.

## Before you begin

Role required: csm\_guided\_setup\_user or admin

## About this task

The customer service case is the primary entity of the customer service application. An agent creates a case to identify a customer's question or issue and to track the activities related to resolving the issue. An agent also uses a case to track all of the communication to and from the customer, including the communication channels being used.

Case activities include any action that is taken to resolve an issue. This can include phone calls or emails, knowledge base research, conversations with subject matter experts, and dispatch requests to field service agents, as well as other activities.

From the Case form, an agent can associate and store the related information, such as the customer's name, phone number, and company; account information; product and asset information; service contract and entitlement details, and any associated service level agreements \(SLAs\).

**Note:** These steps may also apply to case type configuration.

To configure case management, use the Customer Service guided setup. The guided setup takes you through the entire setup and configuration process.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Guided Setup**.

2.  On the Getting Started page of the guided setup, select **Get Started**.

3.  In the Case Management category, view the list of tasks to configure the feature.
