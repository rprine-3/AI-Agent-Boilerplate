# Create facets for activity contexts

Create facets to group the data and enable customer service agents to filter and display the data they want to see in the activity feed.

Learn more about configuring facets from the following video tutorial.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin
-   Ensure that the application scope is set to Customer Central.

## About this task

An activity context is the person or user who is interacting with the customer service agent. There are two predefined activity contexts: consumer and contact. Facets group the data, which enables customer service agents to filter and display the data they want to see in the activity feed. Each facet represents an activity group.

Facets are displayed in the Customer History view in Agent Workspace. Dynamic facets display record details associated with the facet.

Static facets display a subcategorization of the facets without any record details. \[Omitted image "static-facet.png"\] Alt text: Customer History tab with the Interactions facet highlighted.
