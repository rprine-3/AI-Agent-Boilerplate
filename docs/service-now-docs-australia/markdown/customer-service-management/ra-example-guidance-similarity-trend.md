# Example: Link the similar major case to the current case

Learn how process analysts or business owners configure a recommended action of type guidance to propose a major case that can be linked to the current case. This guidance uses a resource generator of type similarity with trend to recommend the similar case that has a common trend.

## Problem scenario

Isabella owns a thriving E-commerce business that specializes in selling handmade artisanal products. As the business grows, Isabella recognizes the increasing importance of providing exceptional customer service to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty. Isabella understands that addressing customer issues effectively and promptly is crucial for the success of the business.

Daniel, a process analyst on the Isabella's team identifies the most common and critical issues that their customers report and create major cases for them. So that whenever a customer creates a case, it can be linked to the similar major case. This process helps them understand the pattern, identify the root cause, take corrective actions, and apply similar solutions.

Daniel identifies the following major issues:

-   Missing items in the order
-   Wrong items received
-   Damaged or defective products
-   Refund requests
-   Billing discrepancies or errors
-   Difficulty applying discount codes
-   Difficulty reaching customer support

Now, Daniel configures a guidance that recommends a similar major case to the agent who is working on a new case created by a customer. The guidance provides an action to the agent to link the recommended major case to the current case.

## Configuring a recommended action for linking the similar major case to the current case

Help Daniel configure a recommended action of type guidance that uses Similarity with Trend resource generator to link the major case to the current case.
