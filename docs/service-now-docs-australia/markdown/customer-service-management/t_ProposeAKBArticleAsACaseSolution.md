# Resolve cases with knowledge and community content

Enable agents to resolve a case more quickly by searching for information from the knowledge base and community and, if helpful, associating it to the case.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent

## About this task

The Case form displays contextual search results based on text entered in the **Short Description** field. These search results provide targeted knowledge articles, pinned articles, and community content to customer service agents.

Customer service agents can search for information that is related to a case when opening a case or in a case that is already open. If the search results in any related content, the agent can preview the content. If the information is relevant, the agent can mark it as helpful. Knowledge articles can be also attached to the case.

By default, search results include knowledge articles, pinned articles, and solved community questions and blogs. Depending on the configuration, search results can also include other types of information, such as open and resolved cases and problems. With the Predictive Intelligence for Customer Service Management plugin \(com.snc.csm\_ml\), you can also view similar cases and similar knowledge articles.

Customer service case managers can use the Demand Insights for Cases dashboard to identify which cases have no or insufficient knowledge coverage. For more information, see [Demand Insights for Cases dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/demand-insights-cases-dashboard.md).
