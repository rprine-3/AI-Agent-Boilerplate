# Share knowledge articles in messaging-type interactions

Agents can share helpful knowledge base \(KB\) articles with customers during messaging-type interactions. Using the **Add link in message** option, agents can insert article links directly into the conversation to provide timely, contextual assistance.

## Before you begin

Required plugins: To enable the **Add link in message** functionality, install the following plugins:

-   Conversational SMS Service Channel \(sn\_awa\_sms\_int\)
-   Agent Messaging Component \(sn\_agent\_messaging\)
-   Agent-Initiated Messaging Interface \(sn\_agent\_initiated\)
-   SMS Adapter Plugin \(for example, sn\_sms\_aws\_adapter, or any other supported SMS adapter\)

    **Note:** The system supports multiple SMS adapters. Verify that your selected adapter is compatible with the Conversational SMS framework.


If the required plugins aren’t installed, the **Add link in message** action isn’t available. Instead, the system displays other guidance actions such as:

-   Copy link \(default primary action\)
-   Read article in full view
-   Mark article as helpful
-   Flag article

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Select **Add link in message** in the interaction record.

    The Compose Message modal opens with a preview to the article and a pre-filled message.

2.  Customize the message as needed.

3.  Review how the **To** field is populated.

    The system auto-populates the To field using the following order:

    -   If the **Contact** field is populated, the phone number from that contact is used.
    -   If the **Contact** field is empty, the system uses the phone number from the Opened For field.
    -   If both fields are empty, agents can manually enter a valid phone number.
    **Note:**

    The To field is visible only in new interactions. In existing interactions, it’s hidden, and the message box shows only the KB article link and the interaction details appear in the modal.

4.  If an agent manually changes the phone number in the To field:

    -   The system treats it as a new interaction.
    -   The previous message is logged as sent to the original number.
    -   The new message is tracked separately to maintain clarity on what was shared and with whom.
5.  When the Add link in message action is used during a messaging-type interaction:

    -   If an interaction is already in progress, the KB article link is added directly to the existing message.
    -   If no interaction is active, the system creates a new interaction to deliver the KB article.
6.  Select **Send** to send the message to the customer.

7.  After the message is sent:

    -   A confirmation appears in the Notifications panel.
    -   Select **View interaction** from the notification to open the related interaction record.
    -   The message also appears in the Active SMS side panel.
