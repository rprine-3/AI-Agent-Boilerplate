# Modeless dialogs

Modeless dialogs are windows that overlay the main window content in CRM Workspace. Customer service agents can use modeless dialogs to create and post comments and work notes to the activity stream and to compose and send emails.

A modeless dialog is a window that appears in a workspace as an overlay on top of the main window content. This overlay enables agents to interact with the window content and the overlay content at the same time. Agents can use modeless dialogs to do the following:

-   Create comments and work notes to post to the activity stream.
-   Create and send emails and reply to or forward emails.

After opening a modeless dialog, agents can move it around the screen and put it where they need it. This feature enables agents to reference information from the main window while drafting text in the overlay window.

## Thin compose modeless dialogs

The thin compose modeless dialog feature incorporates modeless dialogs into the activity stream. It enables agents to initiate a comment, work note, or email from the activity stream in a modeless dialog. Thin compose modeless dialogs:

-   Auto expand to accommodate the text.
-   Can be manually resized.
-   Can be minimized after they are opened.
-   Have the rich text editor enabled even when the **glide.ui.journal.use\_html** system property is set to false.

Thin compose modeless dialogs are available on the following record pages:

-   [Front-line case page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page.md)
-   [CSM default record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-default-record-page.md)
-   [CSM Interaction record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-interaction-record-page.md)
-   [CSM centered chat interaction record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-centered-chat-interaction-page.md)
-   [CSM voice interaction record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md)
-   [Email interaction record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-email-interaction-record-page.md)

**Note:** The thin compose modeless dialog feature has the Rich Text Editor enabled, which can add HTML tags along with the text to the **Additional comments** and **Work notes** fields on the case record. To remove these tags, see [Updating the glide.ui.journal.use\_html property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page-modeless-dialogs.md).

</table>The following guidelines apply to Compose windows for emails:

-   An agent can create multiple email drafts.
-   An agent can have one Compose window open at a time.
-   The Compose Email window can be resized.

## Collapsing and expanding the email header

The email header includes the following fields:

-   **To**
-   **Cc**
-   **Bcc**
-   **Subject**

You can expand and collapse the email header as needed by selecting the expand header \(\[Omitted image "csm-email-modeless-dialog-header-expand.png"\] Alt text: Compose email expand header icon\) and collapse header \(\[Omitted image "csm-email-modeless-dialog-header-collapse.png"\] Alt text: Compose email collapse header icon\) icons.

When the email header is expanded, you can edit the information in these fields. When the email header is collapsed:

-   The subject is displayed in a second line.
-   The fields are not editable.

When you create a new email or forward an email, the header is expanded by default and displays the **To** and **Subject** fields. If you expand the **Cc** and **Bcc** fields, the collapse header icon is displayed.

When you reply to an email, the header is collapsed by default. Expanding the header shows all the fields that contain information.

-   Email tab: Displays "Email \(Draft\)" text next to the tab name.
-   Work notes tab: Displays a dot indicator next to the tab name.
-   Comments tab: If the Comments tab is configured on a page, it also displays a dot indicator next to the tab name when a draft exists.

</table>## Using form templates to create comments and work notes

<table id="table_s2l_pmb_s2c"><thead><tr><th>

Content to add

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Comment

</td><td>

If a template includes content to add to the **Additional comments** field on the case record, the system does the following:-   Displays a modeless dialog for composing a comment.
-   Adds the content to the **Comments** field in the modeless dialog.

Selecting **Post Comments** adds the content to the **Additional comments** field on the case record and to the activity stream.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Selecting **Post Work Notes** adds the content to the **Work notes** field on the case record and to the activity stream.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Selecting **Post Work Notes** adds the content to the **Work notes** field on the case record and to the activity stream.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>If text already exists in the **Additional comments** or **Work notes** fields, applying a template opens a modeless dialog and adds the template content. Selecting **Undo** removes the template content from the modeless dialog and replaces it with the existing text from the fields on the Case record.

## Viewing attachments in modeless dialogs

Agents can view attachments in modeless dialogs rather than a full-screen view. This feature enables agents to view attachments while referencing the underlying case or interaction pages.

The **Open attachment preview in modeless window** UI Builder property controls the attachment display. This property is available at the workspace level and is set to true by default. When enabled, agents can do the following:

-   Select an attachment to open the file in a modeless dialog.

    When an attachment is already open in a modeless dialog and a second attachment is opened, the second attachment opens in the same modeless dialog.

-   Navigate through multiple attachments using a carousal.
-   Download and delete attachments.

**Note:** Agents can view attachments in modeless dialogs when the attachments are available in the contextual side panel or in the activity stream. Viewing attachments from other locations such as the email composer or forms continues to use the full-page preview.

## Updating the glide.ui.journal.use\_html property

The Rich Text Editor \(RTE\) is enabled for modeless dialogs and the thin compose modeless dialog feature. It is not enabled for the instance unless the **glide.ui.journal.use\_html** system property is set to true.

When you enter text in a comment or work note modeless dialog, the system adds that same text to the **Additional comments** and **Work notes** fields on the case record. HTML tags can appear along with the text in these fields.

To remove the HTML tags, enable the **glide.ui.journal.use\_html** system property:

1.  In the navigation filter, enter **sys\_properties.list** to display a list of the properties stored in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table.
2.  Search for the **glide.ui.journal.use\_html** property in the **Name** column.
3.  Set the **Value** field to true and select **Update**.
4.  Return to CRM Workspace and refresh the page.

Setting this property to true enables the Rich Text Editor for the **Additional comments** and **Work notes** fields on the case record and removes the HTML tags.
