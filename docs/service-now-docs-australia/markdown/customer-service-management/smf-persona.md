# Service Model Foundation personas

Understand the key personas involved in managing and using Service Model Foundation and their responsibilities in supporting business organizations \(formerly business locations\) and service operations.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Understanding Service Model Foundation personas

Service Model Foundation supports collaboration between multiple personas, each playing a distinct role in managing, delivering, and consuming services. Understanding these roles helps administrators assign the right access, responsibilities, and tools within the framework.

Service Model Foundation \(SMF\) supports access based on predefined personas that reflect the type of work users perform within a service organization. Because SMF is industry-agnostic, these personas aren’t tied to specific job titles and can be tailored to match your organization’s needs.

A single user can represent different personas across multiple business organizations. For example, a user might act as a Location Manager at one branch and a Contributor at another. SMF models this flexibility through:

-   Roles – Defined at the user level.
-   Responsibilities – Defined according to business organization.

The combination of user roles and responsibilities determines what a user can do within each service organization.
