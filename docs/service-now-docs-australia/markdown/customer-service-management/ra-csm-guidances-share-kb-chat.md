# Share KB in chat interactions guidance

The Share KB in chat interactions guidance recommends relevant knowledge articles to customer service agents and enables them to share the articles in chat conversations on chat interaction records.

The Share KB in chat interactions guidance recommends relevant knowledge articles to agents who are working on chat interactions. The guidance surfaces relevant knowledge articles based on the text in the interaction short description. Agents can view the recommended articles and share a selected article in the chat conversation.

The Share KB in chat interactions guidance enables automatic search results for knowledge articles by using the text in the interaction **Short description** field. The first article listed is the most relevant result. Agents can also manually search for articles.

**Note:** If there’s no text in the **Short description** field, no search results are displayed.

This guidance includes the following actions for sharing:

-   **Send in chat**: Agents can share the article with customers.
-   **Send in private chat**: Agents can only share the article with internal users such as other agents or managers. Customers can’t access locked articles. Private chat messages use a yellow background.

The relevancy score displays on the Share KB in chat interactions guidance in the Search tab of the Recommended Actions contextual side panel. It indicates how well a search result matches the agent’s query.
