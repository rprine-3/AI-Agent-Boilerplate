# Add task dependencies between template items

Add dependencies between template items in a task plan template to control the sequence in which tasks are available to agents after the template is applied.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_task\_plan.viewer, sn\_task\_plan.navigation\_menu, or sn\_task\_plan.admin

Plugin IDs: com.sn\_task\_plan\_templates, com.snc.task\_dependency, and com.snc.customerservice.demo.

Verify that the following conditions are met:

-   The task plan template is in Draft state. You can add or edit dependencies only while the template is in **Draft** state.
-   The template contains at least two template items to link as a predecessor and a successor.

## About this task

Task dependencies define the order in which agents act on tasks generated from a task plan template. All tasks are created at the same time when the template is applied. Dependencies determine when a successor task is available based on the status of a predecessor task and any configured time constraints.

Dependencies control the order in which agents can act on those tasks after generation. You can set how strictly a dependency is enforced and add an optional time offset between tasks.

You can define the following dependency types, which determine when a successor task is set to active:

|Dependency type|When the successor task becomes active|
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
|Finish to start|The successor task is active after the predecessor task is completed.|
|Start together|The same scheduled time as the predecessor task.|
|Start after start|The predecessor task starts.|

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Task Plan Template Workspace**.

2.  Open a task plan template you want to edit and confirm that the status field shows as **Draft**.

3.  Select the **Dependencies** tab to view the dependency map.

4.  Select **New Dependency** and complete the required fields:

<table id="table_omh_2hk_fjc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Predecessor

</td><td>

Select item that agents act on first.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Successor

</td><td>

Select item that follows the predecessor.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Dependency type

</td><td>

Select type: Finish to Start, Start Together, or Start after Start.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment criteria

</td><td>

Select assignment criteria. Options are:-   None
-   Same agent
-   Same day, same agent


</td></tr><tr><td>

Minimum lag time

</td><td>

Enter the minimum time before the successor task is available, using the days, hours, minutes, and seconds fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Maximum lag time

</td><td>

Enter the maximum time allowed before the successor task is available, using the days, hours, minutes, and seconds fields.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select **Save**.

    A confirmation message appears when the dependency is saved.

    **Note:** If the dependency condition is not met, a warning appears on the successor task when opened. Agents can dismiss the warning and continue.


## Edit or delete a dependency

Edit the fields of an existing dependency or remove it from the dependency map in a task plan template.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_task\_plan.writer

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Task Plan Template Workspace**.

2.  Open the template in **Draft** state and select the **Dependencies** tab.

    Select the dependency to edit or delete.

3.  Perform one of the following actions:

    -   To edit: update the fields and select **Save**.
    -   To delete: select **Delete** and confirm.
    A success message confirms the action. The dependency map updates to reflect the change.
