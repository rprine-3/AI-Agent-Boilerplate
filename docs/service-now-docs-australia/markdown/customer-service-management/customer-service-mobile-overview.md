# CSM application overview

Customer service agents and managers can use the applet launcher and applets in the Customer Service mobile application to view notifications and manage customer service cases.

## Applet launchers

Applet launchers serve as landing pages or home pages. When you log in to your instance, you see an applet launcher and the applets configured to display on that launcher. The system administrator configures the applet launcher and applets for the Customer Service Management mobile application.

## Navigation bar

The navigation bar appears at the bottom of the mobile application screen. This bar includes the following tabs that you can use to access different applets and application launch pages:

-   **Cases**: displays the main case page. Use this applet launcher to access case management functionality.
-   **Notifications**: view a list of the notifications that have been pushed to the agent. Tap a notification in the list to see the details, then tap the details open the case.
-   **Settings**: manage settings for the mobile application.

## Applets and cards

Select an applet from the applet launcher screen. Each applet contains one or more screens used to display records that correspond to the applet function. The Active Cases applet, for example, displays a list of all active case records.

The cases in the list are displayed as cards, with the case status displayed at the top of the card. To use the cards:

-   Swipe a card left or right to see the available actions, then tap the desired action.
-   Tap a card to see the record details such as activity, related list, and escalations if any.
-   In the detail view:
    -   Tap the top menu to see additional actions, then tap the desired action.
    -   Select the back button to return to the list.

Applets provide a filter option if there is more than one case in the list. When you tap the applet, you see a list of filters that you can use to narrow down the list of cases.
