# Account codes and account paths

An account code is a unique identifier for an account, while an account path establishes the account hierarchy.

## Account codes

An account code is a unique key that identifies an account in a ServiceNow instance. This code is stored in the **Account Code** field on the Account form.

An account code must be unique. Attempting to insert a new record with previously existing account code in the Account \[customer\_account\] table, the value for the code results in the following error:

`java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Duplicate entry for key account_path`

## Account paths

An account path establishes the hierarchy among different accounts. This path is stored in the **Account Path** on the Account form.

An account path is a combination of the account codes for each account in the hierarchy. For example, let's use the following accounts to demonstrate account paths.\[Omitted image "csm-config-workspace-account-hierarchy-example.png"\] Alt text: Account hierarchy example with three levels of parent and child companies

</table>## Importing account records

If you create your account records by importing the data from some source system through a transform map, make sure that you execute the business rules. The Account Path is added, updated, and deleted based on the insertion, updating, and deletion of records in the Account \[customer\_account\] table through the business rules. If the business rules aren’t executed, it can result in empty account paths, which can then result in data access issues.

**Note:** If you don’t execute the business rules during import, run the script in the **Update account path** business rule for the newly imported records to set the account paths correctly.
