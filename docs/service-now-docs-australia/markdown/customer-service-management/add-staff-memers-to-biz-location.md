# Add staff members to a business organization in the Business Organization Support Portal

Add users as staff members to a business organization \(formerly business location\) to support accounts, contacts, consumers, and households.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_customerservice\_manager, sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager, sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager\_contributor, and sn\_bus\_loc.location\_relationship\_manager

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## About this task

Add internal and external members to a business organization. You can add both internal users with the snc\_internal role and external users with the snc\_external role as staff members to an external organization \(formerly external business location\).

-   Administrators and customer service managers can add staff members to any business organization.
-   Location managers can add staff members to the business locations that they have access to.

**Note:** As a user with the sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager role, you can create both internal and external staff members. However, as a user with the sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager\_contributor role, you can only create external staff members.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Home** &gt; **Busines Location Support** &gt; **Services**.

2.  Select **Register Member at External Organization** to open the Register Member at External Organization record.

    You can use the record to register new location staff or move existing staff between locations managed by the Location manager, and assign responsibilities to staff accordingly.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

 **Note:** Assigning responsibility is applicable to both existing and new staff members.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Select **Submit**.

    Additionally, the external organization record is created in the **Organization** field \(formerly service organization field\) of the External organization staff \(formerly service organization external staff\) \[sn\_csm\_service\_organization\_external\_staff\] table.

    A new external staff member record is created for the selected external organization. The admin must assign responsibilities to the staff members. However, if you have selected **None** as a member type, then you must not create a responsibility record.


## Result

Once a staff member is added to a business organization, the following details can be accessed from the **Business Location Details** tab:

-   Cases Requested
-   Members
-   Available Services
-   Accounts
-   Consumers
