# Schedule Management in CSM Configurable Workspace

Schedule Management schedule management is a standalone capability within Workforce Optimization for Customer Service that allows supervisors and managers to create, view, and manage team schedules independently of other WFO modules.

Roles: sn\_shift\_planning.admin, sn\_shift\_planning.manager.

Schedule management schedule management provides supervisors and managers with tools to manage agent schedules, shifts, time off requests, and schedule adherence from the CSM workspace. You can activate and use Schedule Management schedule management without enabling Forecasting, Intraday Management, Coaching, or other WFO modules.

The modular design supports organizations in CSM, FSM, and Retail, that require shift and roster management capabilities without the full WFO suite.

Schedule Management schedule management provides the following capabilities:

-   Create and manage agent schedules within assigned groups.
-   View team calendars with shifts, on-call rotations, time off, meetings, and trainings.
-   Review and approve shift swap requests between agents.
-   Manage time off requests and reflect approved leave in the team calendar.
-   Monitor schedule adherence and conformance using built-in visualizations.
-   Access scheduling functionality directly from the CRM Workspace or CSM Agent Workspace.

## Schedule management module

The Schedule Management workspace is accessible from the navigation menu in the CRM Workspace. Select **Schedule** to open the workspace. The Team Calendar tab opens by default.

The workspace contains the following tabs:

</table>## Team Calendar toolbar

Use the toolbar on the right side of the **Team Calendar** screen to filter and navigate calendar data. You can filter by **Assignment Group**, **Agent**, or **Event Type**. Filters update the calendar view dynamically. Use the date navigation controls to switch between weeks and days. Select **Reset** to return the calendar to the default view.

## Roles and access

Schedule Management schedule management uses a role hierarchy based on the platform-standard Agent Group Management model. Manager visibility and permissions are determined by agent-to-group relationships, not WFO-specific configurations. This aligns scheduling access with the standard platform identity model and supports consistent access management across CSM, FSM, and Retail.

The following roles are available:

|Role|Persona|Capabilities|
|----|-------|------------|
|sn\_shift\_planning.admin|Manager|Full access to scheduling configuration, event categories, and location schedules.|
|sn\_shift\_planning.manager|Agent|Approve or reject shift schedules and registrations, manage shifts and shift agents, manage agent availability and time attendance.|
|sn\_shift\_planning.agent|User|View own schedule and submit shift swap and time-off requests.|
|sn\_shift\_planning.user|User|Base read access only.|

**Note:** If you have the sn\_csm\_wfo\_workspa.admin or sn\_csm\_wfo\_workspa.manager role, you can automatically inherit the corresponding sn\_shift\_planning role.
