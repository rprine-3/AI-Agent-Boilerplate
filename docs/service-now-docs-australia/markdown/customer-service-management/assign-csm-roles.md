# Assign roles to CSM users

Roles control access to features, capabilities, and data in the Customer Service Management application.

Before you can assign roles to your users, make sure that these users have already been configured.

-   [Configure consumers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-csm-consumers.md)

## About this task

You can assign roles to individual users or groups. Apply roles to groups and the members of those groups inherit those roles.

The Customer Service Management application provides two types of roles: internal roles for agents and managers and external roles for customers, customer partners, and consumers.

**Note:** Assigning a consumer role without a linked consumer record prevents the user from performing consumer activities. You can create the consumer record by navigating to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Customer** &gt; **Consumers** before assigning the role.
