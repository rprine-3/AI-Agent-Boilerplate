# Common attributes of service organizations

By using common attributes to establish a unified reference architecture and data model, you can extend the Customer Service Management data model to support your service organizations.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

You can get use cases from industries like Financial Services Operations, Healthcare and Life Sciences, and Public Sector Digital Services, to capture common attributes for your architecture and data model. For example, a service organization may want to capture attributes for bank branches, hospitals, and agencies. By capturing these common attributes across industries, you can create a unified reference architecture and data model that avoids implementing the same attribute across different industries.

The following table lists the common attributes that have been identified across industries for the Organization Core \[sn\_customer\_service\_organization\] table.

|Field Name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|Email|Primary email address for the service organization.|
|Identification number|ID that is used to identify the service organization.|
|Type|Type of primary service organization by industry. For example, branches, agencies, providers, stores, and so on.|
|Subtype|Organization types within the industry. For example, by using the **Type** and **Subtype** fields, you can select the multiple types to be used for your service organizations.|
