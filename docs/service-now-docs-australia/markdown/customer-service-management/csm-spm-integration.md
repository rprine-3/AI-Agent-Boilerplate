# Integrating with Service Portfolio Management

Integrate Customer Service Management with the Service Portfolio Management \(SPM\) application. This integration gives customer service managers, customer service agents, and service owners visibility into sold products and their associated service offerings.

Using the integration between Customer Service Management and Service Portfolio Management has the following benefits:

-   Increase customer service agent productivity: Empower customer service agents to quickly view the service offerings and associated definitions for sold products.

-   Increase service owner productivity: Empower service owners to quickly identify customers subscribed to services.


The Customer Service Management integration with Service Portfolio Management can be used in the following ways.

1.  Customer service managers can associate service offerings to product models. For more details, see [Associate services with product models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/associate-service-offering-product.md)
2.  Customer service managers can associate service offerings to sold products. For more details, see [Associate service offerings with sold products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/asssociate-service-offering-sold-prod.md)
3.  Service owners can view service offerings and which customers have subscribed to them.
4.  Customer service agents can view which service offerings are associated to the sold products affected by an issue. They can also see the service commitments and availability.
