# Opportunity Management for business location

Integrate Service Model Foundation with Opportunity Management for Business Locations to support channel sales.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Overview of the integration

Use the Opportunity Management for Business Locations plugin \(com.snc.business\_organization\_opptym\) to perform the following actions.

-   Create opportunities for business locations
-   Modify and manage opportunities for the business locations
-   Track the end-to-end life cycle of opportunities
-   Enable external channel partners to track opportunities.

To create an opportunity for business location, see [Create an opportunity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/create-new-opportunity.md).

## Data model

The Opportunity Related Channel Partner \[sn\_bus\_org\_opptym\_related\_business\_organization\] table is a list of service organizations. You can add a related party record to the table to provide access to another party that is different from the service organization associated with the customer opportunity. All related parties listed as **Authorized organizations** and associated with a particular customer opportunity have access to the opportunity, the order line items, and all other related entities. Channel partners such as referral partners, influencer partners, and more can be added as related parties to an opportunity.
