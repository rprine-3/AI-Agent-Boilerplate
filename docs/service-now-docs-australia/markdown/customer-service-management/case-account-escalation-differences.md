# Case and account escalation differences

An overview of the differences between case escalations and account escalations.

-   **Case escalations**: A customer service agent typically manages a case escalation and performs most of the problem resolution work, which is recorded in the case record. For case escalations, the escalation record is used primarily for status reporting purposes. The escalation SLA is also associated with the case record rather than the escalation record because that is where the agent provides regular updates.
-   **Account escalations**: An account escalation manager typically manages an account escalation because it is associated with multiple underlying cases. An account manager works with multiple case owners to resolve the customer escalation and uses the escalation record to consolidate the status of the associated cases and provide regular updates. Therefore, the SLA is associated with the escalation record.

Escalation assignment

Includes a separate assignment. An account escalation can have multiple associated cases that are assigned to different agents so the escalation record includes an **Assigned to** field. An account escalation is typically assigned to an escalation manager because account escalations are typically more serious than case escalations.
