# Chat with Virtual Agent from the Business Organization Support Portal

Provide the information needed about a case and its resolution by completing a pre-survey on the Business Organization Support Portal \(formerly Business Location Service Portal\). This pre-chat survey lets the customer service agent or Virtual Agent know your location and key case details, so you don’t have to repeat them.

## Before you begin

Role required: Service Organization Contributor \(sn\_customerservice.service\_organization\_contributor\) or Location Manager \(sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager\_core\)

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the Business Organization Support Portal \(formerly Business Location Service Portal\), select the Chat icon \(\[Omitted image "chat-icon.png"\] Alt text: chat symbol\) to start a conversation.

    **Note:** The agent chat configuration \(sp\_agent\_chat\_config\) must be active for the Business Organization Support Portal.

2.  From the list of locations in the pre-chat survey, select the business organization that you're directly associated with and select **Submit**.

    A virtual agent or a customer service agent responds to your chat request.

3.  When you're finished with the chat, select **End Conversation**.


## What to do next

If the agent creates a case or links the discussion to an existing case, you can view these cases from the Business Organization Support Portal by selecting **Cases**.
