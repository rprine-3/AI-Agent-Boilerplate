# Migrate to CRM Workspace

Follow the instructions in this topic to migrate from CSM Agent Workspace to CRM Workspace.

If you are currently using CSM Agent Workspace and want to migrate to CRM Workspace, you can continue using most of your existing configurations. Some features, however, need to be configured specifically for CRM Workspace. You can migrate some of the configurations using lists and forms and others using the [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder-overview.md) tool.

</table>Also, be aware that some configuration changes made for one workspace can also affect the other. For example, changes to the CSM Agent Workspace configuration may impact CRM Workspace. The same applies to changes to the CRM Workspace configuration, which may impact CSM Agent Workspace.

**Note:** For customers who are **not** currently using CSM Agent Workspace and want to implement CSM Configurable Workspace, use the CRM Workspace guided setup by navigating to **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Guided Setup** &gt; **CSM Configurable Workspace**. Clicking **Configure** in this category takes you to the Configurable Workspace guided setup. The information and instructions in the different guided setup categories can help you set up a new implementation of CRM Workspace.
