# Using the Recommended Actions application

Through the Recommended Actions application, use the recommended actions of type guidance and guided decision tree in your workspace to resolve cases quickly. Use the field recommendation to get recommendations on the field values. Use the AI search option to search the relevant resources from various sources.

## Recommended actions

Recommended actions appear as cards in the contextual side panel of your workspace. Depending on the open record type, these cards contain information to help find the fastest resolution path, minimizing time spent researching and gathering information from different sources.

You can take three types of actions:

-   **Guidance**: An action that can be performed or helpful information to share.
-   **Decision tree**: A guided flow to follow that walks you through a series of questions that help you determine the appropriate action.
-   **Field recommendations**: Recommended values to use for the fields in the record. Recommended field values are auto-filled or shown as messages underneath the fields for the new records. The recommended field values are shown as messages only underneath the fields for the existing records.

Recommended action cards display the following information:

-   Hint that briefly describes the recommendation.
-   Preview that shows a short summary of the recommended action, which can include an image and links to helpful articles.
-   Options to accept or dismiss the action.

When multiple cards are displayed, they’re arranged according to the Order value set when they were created.

## Primary and secondary actions

The recommendation that you select determines what is displayed next in the contextual side panel or subtab and how the record is updated. Some actions involve a single selection that is performed immediately such as **Acknowledge**, **Attach and add link in comment**. Other actions might have secondary actions that you can enable after selecting the primary action in the card. The following table explains a few primary and secondary actions.

</table>## Field recommendations

Field recommendations are messages that display either under fields on a form or auto-fill a recommended value within the field. For example, a field recommendation can recommend an assignment group based on the text in a case's short description.

You can read the description of the recommendation and use the recommended value in the fields.

## AI search

AI search enables you to search for the relevant resources to resolve cases or customer issues. Depending on the AI search configuration, the AI search tab displays search results, genius result answers, or both. AI search results appear in the form of guidances that you can act on. Genius result answers are the most relevant answers or the top results for the search query along with the action that you can take directly from the card.
