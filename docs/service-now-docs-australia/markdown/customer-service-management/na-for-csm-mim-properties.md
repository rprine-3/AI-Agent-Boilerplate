# ServiceNow Otto for CSM Major Issue Management Properties

The ServiceNow Otto for CSM Major Issue Management application is configured through the `NowAssistMajorIssueExtPoint` extension point and the trigger conditions on the **Major case agentic workflow** flow. This reference describes every configurable property, the valid values, the default, and the impact.

## Flow trigger properties

Configure these properties in Flow Designer on the **Major case agentic workflow** flow trigger.

|Property|Description|Default|Impact|
|--------|-----------|-------|------|
|Trigger conditions|The case-record conditions that cause the flow to run. Add filters such as category, account, product, or any other case field to control which cases the AI detection evaluates.|Priority is 1 or 2; Parent is empty|More restrictive conditions reduce AI skill executions, which lowers cost and processing load.|

## Major case search configuration

These properties come from `NowAssistMajorIssueExtPoint.getConfigForMajorCase()`. They control the search for similar existing major cases.

|Property|Description|Values|Default|Impact|
|--------|-----------|------|-------|------|
|`maxSearchResults`|Maximum number of similar major cases returned by the AI search.|Integer 1–50|10|Higher values increase AI search cost and latency. Lower values may miss relevant matches.|
|`similarityThreshold`|Minimum similarity score a major case must meet to be included in results.|0.0–1.0|0.75|Higher values return fewer, more precise matches. Lower values cast a wider net with more noise.|
|`searchProfile`|AI search profile used when searching for similar open major cases. Determines which indexed fields and ranking logic apply.|String \(profile name\)|`sn_csm_mim_gen_ai_mim_major_cases_profile`|You can edit this profile or replace it with a custom profile. The profile must return major cases.|
|`matchFieldList`|Case fields whose values are appended as additional exact-match filter conditions on the AI search.|Array of field names \(for example, `["account", "product"]`\). Empty field values are skipped.|`[]`|Restricts the search to cases that exact-match on the listed fields. For example, with `["account"]`, only cases from the same account are considered.|

## Non-major case search configuration

These properties come from `NowAssistMajorIssueExtPoint.getConfigForNonMajorCase()`. These properties control the search for similar non-major cases.

|Property|Description|Values|Default|Impact|
|--------|-----------|------|-------|------|
|`maxSearchResults`|Maximum number of similar non-major cases returned by the AI search.|Integer 1–50|10|Higher values increase AI search cost and latency. Lower values may undercount similar cases and suppress major case escalation.|
|`similarityThreshold`|Minimum similarity score a non-major case must meet to be included in results.|0.0–1.0|0.70|Higher values enforce stricter matching before escalation is considered. Lower values may trigger escalation proposals more liberally.|
|`searchProfile`|AI search profile used when searching for similar open non-major cases.|String \(profile name\)|`sn_csm_mim_gen_ai_mim_non_major_cases_profile`|Determines which indexed fields and ranking logic apply during the non-major search.|
|`matchFieldList`|Case fields whose values are appended as additional exact-match filter conditions on the AI search.|Array of field names. Empty field values are skipped.|`[]`|Restricts the search to cases that exact-match on the listed fields.|
|`minSimilarCasesForMajor`|Minimum number of similar non-major cases the AI must return before the new case is auto-proposed as a major case. Below this threshold the flow exits with no updates.|Integer 1–N|5|Lower values make major case escalation easier to trigger. Higher values require stronger evidence before a new major case is proposed.|

## Extension point method reference

The `NowAssistMajorIssueExtPoint` extension point exposes three methods that you can override.

|Method|OOB default|Purpose|
|------|-----------|-------|
|`isValid(glideRecord)`|Returns `true` for all cases|Pre-flight eligibility check called before skill invocation. Override to exclude specific case types, domains, or any other condition.|
|`getConfigForMajorCase(glideRecord)`|limit: 10, threshold: 0.75|Returns the search configuration used when scanning for existing major cases.|
|`getConfigForNonMajorCase(glideRecord)`|limit: 10, threshold: 0.70|Returns the search configuration used when scanning for similar non-major cases.|
