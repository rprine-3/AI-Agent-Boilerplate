# CSM Landing Page - Premium

The CSM Landing Page - Premium provides users with lists of assigned cases and case tasks as well as agent, group, and organization metrics.

Customer service agents and managers can use the CSM Landing Page - Premium to quickly scan and prioritize work, access records, and track performance. Administrators can customize landing pages in [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/using-ui-builder.md) to meet their unique business needs.

The CSM Landing Page - Premium includes components that display case information, plus visualizations that further break down the component data. For example, the **High priority cases** component includes visualizations for P1 and escalated cases, plus cases that need attention. It also includes additional indicators and visualizations in the **Performance** and **Organization's Performance** sections. Each of the visualizations is connected to a data source.

The CSM Landing Page - Premium is available with the following plugins:

-   CRM Workspace \(sn\_csm\_wrkspc\)
-   Performance Analytics - Content Pack - Customer Service Management - Advanced \(com.snc.pa.customer\_service\_advanced\)

**Note:** Upgrade customers who haven’t customized the existing CRM Workspace landing page are automatically upgraded to the landing page available with the Australia release. Upgrade customers who have customized the existing CRM Workspace landing page must manually accept the Australia landing page.

</table>## Create a landing page for CSM Configurable Workspace

Use UI Builder to create landing pages for your agents. For more information, see [Create a CSM Configurable Workspace landing page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-config-ws-landing-page.md).

## Create multiple landing pages

You can create multiple landing pages. However, only a single landing page is displayed for a user. The landing page that is displayed for you depends on the following settings:

-   The setting of the **Active** field. This field must be set to true for a landing page to be displayed.
-   The **Order** of the landing page. Pages with a lower-order value take precedence over pages with a higher-order value.
-   If permissions are defined, you can see a landing page if you have the required role or are a member of the required assignment group. Multiple roles and assignment group conditions are treated as OR conditions.
