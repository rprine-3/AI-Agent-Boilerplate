# Consumer Service Portal changes

Activating the Customer Household Data Model plugin lets you view households and their members on the Consumer Service Portal, and also view or create cases for household members.

## Viewing multiple households on the portal

Consumers can belong to multiple households and can have one primary household. When the Customer Household Data Model plugin is activated, consumers who are logged in to the Consumer Service Portal can see the following information on their user profile page:

-   The consumer's primary household in the **Primary Household** field.
-   The households that the consumer belongs to in the Households list.

## Viewing household members on the portal

For consumers who are the head of household, the Support menu includes the **Household Members** menu item, which lists all current members of the household.

Selecting this menu item displays a page that lists the members of the households where the logged-in consumer is the head of the household.

## Creating cases for other members of a household or other consumers

A consumer can create cases for another consumer in the following instances:

-   A consumer who is the head of a household can create cases for other members of the household.
-   A consumer who is an authorized representative for another consumer can create cases on behalf of that consumer.

When creating a case, the head of household or authorized representative can select the household member in the **Consumer** field on the record producer.

-   If the logged-in consumer belongs to only one household, the household is automatically added to the case when it’s submitted.
-   If the logged-in consumer belongs to more than one household, the correct household can be selected in the **Household** field on the record producer.
-   If the household is selected first, the consumers listed in the **Consumer** field are restricted to the current members of the household.

The default selections for the **Household** and **Consumer** fields on the record producer include the primary household and the logged-in consumer.

## Viewing and updating cases on the portal

The logged-in consumer can see the following cases on the portal:

-   All Cases: Cases that belong to their household or that belong to consumers with which they’re an authorized representative.
-   My Cases: Cases created by the logged-in consumer.

The head of household or authorized representative can perform the following actions for the cases that belong to their household:

-   Add comments and attachments.
-   Accept or reject a solution.
-   Close a case.

## Consumer case information

When the Customer Household Data Model plugin is activated, the Ticket Fields details tab includes the **Consumer** field.
