# Case task type selector

The case task type selector is a component that provides customer service agents with a way to create the right types of tasks while working on cases.

Using the case task type selector, agents can select services and create case tasks specifically for those services. The selections that an agent can make within the case task type selector depends on where they create a case task from.

When an agent creates a case task from a case task list, they can select a service in the case task type selector.

</td></tr><tr><td>

When an agent creates a case task from a case record, the case task type selector shows related services based on the case type.

</table>Some declarative actions available with the Customer Service Case Types plugin are disabled by default. For more information, see [Configure case type declarative actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-case-type-declarative-action.md).

## Configuring service definitions for cases and case tasks

The system administrator creates the [service definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-service-definitions.md) for cases and case tasks, along with their relationships. The service definition manager and service definition admin can also create these service definitions and relationships.

For case task service definitions, the system administrator can include logic and default field values that the system uses when creating the case tasks. For more information, see [Configuring service definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-service-definitions-configure.md).
