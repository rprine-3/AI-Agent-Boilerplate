# Case and account escalation

Use the escalation feature to highlight specific cases or accounts and raise awareness of important customer issues.

Escalating a case or an account provides the following benefits:

-   Increases attention about a customer issue.
-   Facilitates communication about that issue.
-   Provides a way to track progress toward a resolution.

Users with the escalation requester role can [escalate a case or an account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/escalate-csm-case.md) by selecting the **Escalate Case** related link on the case or account form.

## Case and account escalation differences

While the escalation process is similar for cases and accounts, there are some important differences to note.

-   Case escalations: A customer service agent typically manages a case escalation and works directly with the escalated case to resolve the issue.
-   Account escalations: An escalation manager typically manages an account escalation, which can include multiple associated cases, and records details in the escalation record.

For more information, see [Case and account escalation differences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/case-account-escalation-differences.md).
