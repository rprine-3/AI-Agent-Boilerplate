# Configure Advanced Work Assignment for routing email interactions

Configure Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) to route email interactions automatically to your agents, based on their availability, capacity, and optionally, skills.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Service channel **Email** is configured during the installation of the Email Interaction for CSM application. If you want to create service channels for email, follow the procedure.

You can use the  [Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/awa-overview.md) feature to automatically assign work items to users based on their availability and capacity.

**Note:** You can also configure external routing with third-party providers. For more information, see [Enable external routing for queues](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/enable-awa-external-routing.md).

AWA assigns work items using assignment groups, so it's important that your users and groups are set up correctly.

-   Determine the assignment group to use in the AWA service channel configuration and add users to this group.
-   Confirm that the users have at least one of the roles: sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent or sn\_customerservice\_agent.

Setting up a service channel involves multiple steps, which are detailed in the procedure. Once the service channel setup is complete, you can use AWA to assign newly created email interactions that either unassigned or satisfy the conditions specified in the service channel.

## Procedure

    1.  Navigate to  **All** &gt; **Advanced Work Assignment ** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Service Channels** &gt; **New**
