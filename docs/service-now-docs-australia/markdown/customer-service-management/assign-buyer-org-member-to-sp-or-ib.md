# Assign a buyer organization member to sold products or install base items

Assign a business organization member to a sold product or install base item so that the member can raise cases for the asset on the Business Organization Support Portal \(formerly Business Location Service Portal \(BLSP\)\) or in workspaces.

## Before you begin

The member must already exist as a business organization member at the location.

Role required: sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager\_core or admin

## About this task

You can assign a buyer organization member from the following locations:

-   Install base item or sold product record
-   BLSP portal: Business Organization details page on the Products or Install Base tab
-   Workspace: Install base or sold product view

All locations opens the same Assign Buyer Organization Member dialog and produce the same outcome.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Business Organizations** &gt; **Internal Organizations**.

2.  Select an internal or external organization record.

3.  Select the desired record from the install base or sold product related lists tab where you want to assign a member.

4.  Select **Assign Member** form the install base record.

5.  Select the **Buyer Organization Member** from the Assign Buyer Organization Member dialog box.

    The lookup is filtered to members of the same business organization; members of other organizations are not selectable.

6.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The Buyer Organization Member field on the record is populated.

**Note:**

For install base items, if you assigned the member to a parent install base item, the Buyer Organization Member field on every child install base item is also populated.
