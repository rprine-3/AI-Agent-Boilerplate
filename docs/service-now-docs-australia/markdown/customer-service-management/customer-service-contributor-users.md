# Contributor users

With contributor user roles, you can engage both internal and external users to assist in resolving customer issues and requests.

The contributor users feature provides unified customer support for internal and external customers. With this feature, you can serve internal and external customers through shared service teams and service organizations:

-   Enable service organizations to serve one another and external customers.
-   Enable employees to request support for themselves and for external customers.
-   ​Enable middle office agents to work on specific tasks that are required to resolve cases.

## Overview of contributor user roles

The contributor users feature includes several roles that you can assign to users to control access to cases, case tasks, and case-related information. These roles can be assigned to users based on different business needs. In some cases, these roles also provide access to the parent cases and associated customer information.

The contributor users feature also includes viewer roles that enable employees to view cases, cases tasks, or core customer data. These roles include:

-   Case Viewer
-   Case Task Viewer
-   Customer Data Viewer
