# Approve, change, or registration request from Business Portal

Users with the snc\_external role can view and approve requests and change requests from the business portal.

## Before you begin

## About this task

A request or change request may require approval from another employee within the same organization.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the business portal header,

2.  Select **Notification** &gt; **View all notifications**.

3.  Select a record in the Approvals section of the Notifications page.

    The system displays a read-only view of the record approval form. For requests that include one or more items, these items appear in a collapsible list at the bottom of the Request form.

4.  Click a requested item at the bottom of the Request form to view the details in a pop-up window.

5.  Select **Approve**.

    The system makes the following updates:

    -   The record status is set to **Approved**.
    -   The record status is displayed after the record number in the Related Records widget on the Case form.
    -   The record status is added to the Case form.
        -   If the record is approved by the customer administrator or if the customer self-approves the request, the change in status is added to the **Additional comments** field.
        -   For other approvers, the change in status is added to the **Work notes** field.
    -   The approval record is updated in the Approval table.
