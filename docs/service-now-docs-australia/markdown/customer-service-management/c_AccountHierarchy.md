# Account hierarchy

Use the account hierarchy feature to create and view a parent-child relationship between accounts.

An account hierarchy The account hierarchy uses a tree structure to show the parent, child, and sibling accounts. This structure represents the legal entity structure of the accounts and their relationships.

Agents can do the following from the account hierarchy:

-   Expand and collapse the tree structure.
-   Switch between the parent view and the full view.
-   Select an account to open the related Account form.
