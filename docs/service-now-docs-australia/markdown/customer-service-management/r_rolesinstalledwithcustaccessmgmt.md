# Roles installed with customer access management

Customer access management uses different functional and granular roles to establish relationships between users and entities. The granular and functional roles help provide user access to information and maintain data security.

## Functional and granular roles overview

Functional and granular roles help provide authorized related parties access to the case, and provide additional contacts or additional consumers access to the sold product.

Granular roles provide access to cases, sold product, and related entities. One or more granular roles can be bundled together as a functional role to perform a meaningful action. Linking multiple granular roles to a functional role enables you to build your own access rules by applying the functional and granular roles for various Customer Service Management \(CSM\) entities.

A granular model helps to protect data by granting the required level of access to the relevant CSM entities. With this functionality, each role is associated with a set of privileges or responsibilities that determine your access to certain information. You can set granular policies that authorize individuals to do their jobs efficiently and effectively, which helps to improve the customer experience.

## Roles and descriptions

Functional roles are a set of granular roles that are required to perform a function that requires access on multiple entities. The following table lists the functional roles for customer access management.
