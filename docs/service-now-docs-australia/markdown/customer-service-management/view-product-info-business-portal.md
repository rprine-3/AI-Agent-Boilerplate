# View product information from Business Portal

View a list of products to track the products or services sold to your account and manage your services using service catalogs.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.customer, sn\_customerservice.customer\_admin, sn\_customerservice.partner, or sn\_customerservice.partner\_admin

## About this task

You can view a list of products or services that have been sold to your account. You can also view any cases created on the product and all active contracts and entitlements for the product.

An entitlement is active if:

-   Its end date isn’t in the past or it has no end date.
-   The contract it’s linked to is also active.

A contract is active if:

-   Its state is set to active
-   It’s linked to a product with an active entitlement.

You can modify the **Active Entitlements** widget to define your own filters for active entitlements.

If product catalog items have been set up in your instance, you can use the **Service Catalogs** widget to view context-sensitive service catalogs based on the services you’re subscribed to. Extend your services using service catalogs and request additional items on the services that you have subscribed to.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the business portal.

2.  Select **My hub** &gt; **Manage sold products** in the header menu.

    The system displays a list of products or services sold to your account.

    You can only view sold products and all extensions of sold products that are not product inventories.
