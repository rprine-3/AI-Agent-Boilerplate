## Procedure

2.  In the Fix External User Role Assignment category, select **Get Started** and then select **External users with intentional internal role assignments**.

3.  Run the scheduled job to tag users that have intentional user role assignments.

    Users are tagged with the **Ext-user-contained-role** tag.

4.  Review the list of tagged users.

5.  Manually fix the role assignments for the desired users.
