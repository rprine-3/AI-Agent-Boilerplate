# Install Customer Project Management

You can install the Customer Project Management application \(com.snc.csm\_ppm\) if you have the admin role.The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

This plugin requires the Customer Service plugin \(com.sn\_customerservice\) and the PPM Standard plugin \(com.snc.financial\_planning\_pmo\).

The Customer Project Management application adds the **Customer Service** &gt; **Projects** module to the application navigator. Users with the customer project manager role can access this module.

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Review the [Customer Project Management application listing](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/ca994c6287723300f734a7da0acb0b41/2.0.0) in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
