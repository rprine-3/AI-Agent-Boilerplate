## Resume a single sold product

Create an order to resume a sold product and its hierarchy on the CRM Workspace. By resuming a sold product, you can restart a product or service.

### About this task

After an order is created and marked **Complete**, the order to sold product flow is triggered after fulfillment. This flow enables you to resume a sold product.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_admin or sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  In the list view, select **Customer** &gt; **Accounts**.

3.  Open the account that the sold product belongs to.

4.  In the Sold Products related list, select the sold product that you want to resume.

    **Note:** You can do a **Resume** action on the root sold product only if it is in the **Active** state. The sold product must not have a specification that is associated with it. The **Resume** option isn't visible if you select a child sold product.

5.  Select **Resume**.

    The **Resume** action is enabled on sold products that are in **Inactive** or **Suspended** states only.

6.  In the Resume sold product window, in the **Start date and time** field, enter when you want to resume the sold product.

7.  Select **Resume**.


### Result

An order for resuming the sold product is created.

## Resume multiple sold products

Create an order to resume multiple sold products and their hierarchy on the CRM Workspace.

### About this task

After an order is created and marked **Complete**, the order to sold product flow is triggered after fulfillment. This flow creates sold products on the sold product table \(sn\_install\_base\_sold\_product\).

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_admin or sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace.**.

2.  In the list view, select **Customer** &gt; **Accounts**.

3.  Open the account that the sold product belongs to.

    **Note:** You can do a **Resume** action only on the root sold product with a product offering and if it is in the **Inactive** or **Suspended** state. The **Resume** option is disabled if you select a child-sold product.

5.  Select **Resume**.

6.  In the Resume sold products window, in the **Start date and time** field, enter when you want to resume the sold products.

7.  Add a reason for a resumption in the **Reason for resumption** field.
