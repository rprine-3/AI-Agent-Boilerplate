# Create a resource generator in Recommended Actions

Create resource generators that you can use to provide resources for recommendations from Recommended Actions.

## Before you begin

The Task Intelligence Admin Console \(com.sn\_ti\_admin\) plugin must be installed for selecting the Task Intelligence Classification resource generator type.

Role required: sn\_nb\_action.next\_best\_action\_author, sn\_nb\_action.resource\_generator\_author, admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Recommended Actions** &gt; **Resource Generators**.

2.  Select **New** from the Resource Generators list.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the resource generator.

4.  In the **Context** field, select a context.

5.  In the **Generator type** field, select a generator type.

    Different types of generators are available that you can use. Some of the generator types require an additional selection in the **Generator** field.

    For example, if you choose flow as the generator type, you must also select the specific flow to use. Selecting the lookup icon opens a pop-up window that you can use to select the required flow.

    For more information, see [Resource generator types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-resource-generators.md).

6.  If applicable, in the **Generator** field, select a generator.

7.  Save the record.

8.  On the Generator input form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Resource generator inputs form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-resource-generator-form.md).

    The fields that appear in this form section are determined by the selections in the **Generator type** and **Generator** fields.

9.  Select **Update**.
