</table>## Configure sentiment analysis fields

The sentiment analysis feature uses the following fields to display sentiment prediction information on Cases list and Case form:

-   Original sentiment
-   Current sentiment
-   Sentiment over time

Add the sentiment fields to Case list views and to the Case form for CRM Workspace, CSM Agent Workspace, and Core UI.

-   In CRM Workspace, these fields appear as secondary values in the configurable form header. You can configure secondary values to display either below the primary value at the top of the form or in the Record Information tab in the contextual side panel. \(For more information, see [Display the form ribbon and form header secondary values in the Contextual side panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-display-header-in-sidebar.md).\)
-   In CSM Agent Workspace, these fields appear in the Case form header.
-   In Core UI, these fields appear on the Case form.
