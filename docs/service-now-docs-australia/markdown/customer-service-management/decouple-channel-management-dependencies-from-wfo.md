# Decouple Channel Management dependencies from WFO

Decouple Channel Management from core Workforce Optimization \(WFO\) modules to support modular deployment, enabling independent updates or scaling of Channel Management without impacting other workforce engagement.

## Overview of decoupling channel management

Channel Management is a crucial tool that allows users to monitor ongoing work and track agents' performance. Decoupling Channel Management from the core Workforce Optimization \(WFO\) modules supports modular deployment, enabling independent updates or scaling of Channel Management without impacting other workforce engagement.

**Note:** Channel Management when installed as a standalone module along with the agent workspace, the other modules are disabled.

Key Benefits:

-   Independent Deployment: Channel Management can now be deployed independently, allowing for greater flexibility and control.
-   Reduced Inter-Module Dependencies: The decoupling reduces dependencies between modules, enhancing system stability.
-   Enhanced Scalability and Maintainability: The new architecture improves scalability and maintainability, making it easier to manage and expand.
-   Streamlined Future Upgrades: Future upgrades for individual modules can be streamlined, ensuring smoother and more efficient updates.
