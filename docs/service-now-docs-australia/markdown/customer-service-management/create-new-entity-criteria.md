# Create entity criteria

Create an entity criteria record to define customer-based conditions, either for selected accounts \(B2B\) or consumers \(B2C\). These criteria can be applied to filter which customers are eligible for specific services.

## Before you begin

Role required:sn\_csm\_case\_types.service\_definition\_manager, sn\_csm\_case\_types.service\_definition\_admin, or admin

## About this task

You can select entity criteria records when you configure customer criteria for a service definition. The system uses this configuration to determine which customers are eligible for that particular service.

**Note:** Entity criteria records are available for all CSM applications.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service request operations** &gt; **Entity criteria**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_e2n_dcf_bgc"><thead><tr><th>

The type of customer for which the condition applies. There are two types of customers:-   Select **Account** for B2B customers.
-   Select **Consumer** for B2C customers.


</td></tr><tr><td>

The table on which the conditions in the condition builder apply. For example, Customer Account \[customer\_account\]. The selected table determines the visibility of the **Customer field** and the available elements in that field.
