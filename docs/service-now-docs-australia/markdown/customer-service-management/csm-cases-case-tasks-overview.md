# Cases and case tasks

Customer service cases store information about customers, their questions and issues, and related information. Case tasks are created and assigned to users to complete the work necessary to resolve cases.

## Cases

A case record is the main type of record used by the Customer Service Management application. Case records include detailed information about customers, their reported questions or issues, and the work performed to answer questions and resolve issues. The system stores case records in the Case \[sn\_customerservice\_case\] table.

Customer service agents create cases to identify questions or issues, gather information, and track the activities related to resolution. Agents also use cases to communicate with customers and other users.

## Case tasks

Case tasks are created for additional work that must be completed as part of resolving a customer service case. These tasks are frequently assigned to users such as middle or back-office agents. Case tasks are stored in the Case Task \[sn\_customerservice\_task\] table.

Case tasks can be manually created from cases or automatically from case playbooks. When a case task is created, the system uses information from the case to automatically fill in some of the fields on the case task record. This includes the case number in the **Parent case** field. It also includes customer information in the **Account**, **Contact**, or **Consumer** fields, if this information is present in the case record.

**Note:** Case tasks can also be created from other records. If a task is created from a non-case record, such as an incident, problem, change, or request, the **Parent** field is updated with the number of the parent record. The **Account**, **Contact**, or **Consumer** fields aren’t updated.

If the value in the **Parent case** or **Parent** fields is updated, the customer information in the **Account**, **Contact**, or **Consumer** fields is also updated.

Depending on a user's assigned roles, case tasks appear in a number of different Case Task list in the application navigator in CSM Configurable Workspace, including:

-   My Case Task
-   My Open
-   Unassigned for my groups
-   All
-   My Contributing Tasks
-   My Accessible Tasks

For more information about case tasks and case task records, see the following topics:

## Cases, case tasks and related parties

The Customer Service Management application enables you to support multiple contacts and consumers on cases and sold products and provide these contacts with varying levels of case access. These additional contacts and consumers are called related parties. Related parties are added to the Related Parties related list on the case record.

Customer service agents can also add related parties to case tasks. Customers that can be added to a case task are limited to the following:

-   Customers that are related parties on the parent case.
-   Customers that the agent has access to.

Users with the admin role can remove related parties from cases. When an admin attempts to remove a related party from a case, the system checks to see if that related party is associated with any open case tasks.

-   If no, the related party is removed from the case.
-   If yes, the related party isn’t removed from the case and the system displays a message that lists the associated case tasks.

## Case task integration with Service Definitions

The [service definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-service-definitions.md) feature enables you to create connections between products, services, and case types.

-   Agents can use configured service definitions to quickly create cases of the right type based on the selected product or service.
-   Customers can use configured service definitions to quickly discover and request the services they need.

</table>## Case tasks and external user roles

End users and requesters can access case tasks from the Customer and Consumer Service Portals by selecting **My Lists** &gt; **My Case Tasks**.

End users and requesters can view and update case tasks and the fields that they have access to \(case tasks that have the **Visible to customer** field enabled\). You get read access to the **Parent case**, **Account**, **Contact** and **Consumer** fields.

-   sn\_customerservice.customer

-   customer\_case\_manager
-   sn\_customerservice.partner
-   sn\_customerservice.consumer

The users can see the following fields on the Case Task lists and forms: **Account**, **Contact** and **Consumer**. If an end user is viewing a case task from a list of case tasks, the Case Task form also displays the **Parent case** field.

## Scheduled job for case tasks

Case task enhancements in the Australia release add several fields to the case task record. After upgrading to the Australia release, you can run a scheduled job that populates these fields for active case tasks.

**Note:** It is recommended that you run the scheduled job during planned downtime.

If the parent case is an active record in the Case table \(sn\_customerservice\_case\) or a table that extends the Case table, the **Update case task fields** scheduled job does the following:

-   Copies the parent case number to the **Parent case** field.
-   Copies the account and contact or consumer information to the **Account** and **Contact** or **Consumer** fields, if this information is present in the case record.

To run this scheduled job:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.
2.  Select **Update case task fields** in the **Name** field.
3.  Select **Execute Now**.
