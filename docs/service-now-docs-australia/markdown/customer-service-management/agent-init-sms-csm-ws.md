# Initiate SMS conversations from CSM Agent Workspace

Compose an SMS message from CSM Agent Workspace to interact with a customer contact or a consumer regarding customer service cases.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_workspace\_user

Ensure that an administrator has configured the Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio application. For more information, see [Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/sms-twilio-store-app.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Agent Workspace Home**.

2.  On the Agent Workspace Home page, navigate to **Agent Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Interactions** &gt; **My Interactions**.

3.  In the My Interactions list, modify an existing interaction or create another interaction.

    -   To modify an existing interaction, select the interaction number in **Number** column of the My Interactions list.
    -   To create another interaction, click **New** in the My Interactions list.
4.  On the Details tab of the workspace form, fill in the details for a new interaction or modify the details.

    For more information about the form, see [CSM workspace form features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-workspace-agent-actions.md).

    **Note:** The user profile associated with an interaction is configured by an administrator by using the AgentInitiatedConversationUtil extension point. By default, the AgentInitiatedMessagingUtilExtPointImpl script include that implements the AgentInitiatedConversationUtil extension point is available for the Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio application. For more information, see [Associate user profiles on messaging interactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/associate-user-profiles-messaging-interactions.md).

5.  Click **Compose SMS**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_phb_h3p_znb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

From

</td><td>

Provider phone number of the SMS channel.-   If there is only one provider phone number, the From list is automatically set to the provider phone number.
-   If there are multiple providers configured for the SMS channel, you can select a phone number in the From list.


</td></tr><tr><td>

To

</td><td>

Phone number of the consumer or customer contact. The phone number is in the E.164 format and automatically set to the phone number of the consumer or customer contact associated with the interaction record.

 By default, the user profiles for consumers and customer contacts and the format of their phone numbers are validated for the SMS channel.

 If you select **Other** from the To list, you can manually enter a phone number of the consumer or customer contact. Any manually entered phone number is automatically converted to the E.164 format. For more information, see [Phone number fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_UsePhoneNumberFields.md).
