# Create a CSM Configurable Workspace landing page

Create landing pages for different agents and teams by creating a page variant and adding or modifying containers and components.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_admin, ui\_builder\_admin, admin

## About this task

A landing page is the page that an agent sees when they open their workspace. One landing page for CSM Configurable Workspace is included with the Customer Service plugin \(com.sn\_customerservice\). This page, the **CSM Landing Page**, gives agents an overview of their new, assigned and high priority cases, plus the cases assigned to their groups.

You can create a variant of this page in [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder-overview.md), a WYSIWYG web user interface builder, and modify it as needed.

**Note:** It is important to create a variant of the CSM Landing Page to prevent issues with upgrades.

For example, you can use UI Builder to perform these tasks:

[Change the page layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/change-layout.md)

</td><td>

The layout governs the slots that are available on a page, how the slots are positioned, and what CSS rules apply to them. For more information about layouts and layout systems, see [Work with layouts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/work-layouts.md).

[Add components to the page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/add-components.md)

</td><td>

Components are the base elements of your page. Components range from core elements like buttons and labels to more complex experience components like lists and forms. For more information, see [Work with components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/work-components.md).**Note:** You can also find information about UI Builder components on the ServiceNow developer site. For more information, see the component documentation on www.devportaldocs.service-now.com/.

[Connect data resources to the components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/connect-data.md)

</td><td>

Connect data resources to dynamically expose data from tables, records, or other elements on your page. For more information, see [Work with data resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/data-resources.md).

</table>## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  In the **My experiences** section, click **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

3.  In the Page drop-down menu, select **Landing Page**.

4.  In the Variants list, select **CSM Landing Page**.

5.  Create a landing page variant.

    1.  Click the additional actions menu next to the **CSM Landing Page** variant and select **Duplicate**.

    2.  In the Create a variant pop-up window, add a **Variant name**.

    3.  Click **Create**.

    4.  If desired, specify the audience and display conditions for the page variant.

        The audience determines who can see the page. An audience is a collection of user roles. For more information, see [Understanding your audiences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/add-audiences.md).

        The **Order** field determines which page is displayed. The page with the lowest order number is displayed first.

    5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Add or modify containers and components for the landing page variant.

    See the UI Builder documentation for details about adding or modifying containers and components.

    -   [Add components to a page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/add-components.md): Beginning with step 4, use this task to add a component to a container and to configure the component properties and event handlers. This task also contains information about adding additional containers.
    -   [Add styling to a component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/add-styling-to-component.md): Beginning with step 3, set CSS styles for a component to change its default appearance.
    -   [Add a modal to a component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/modals-uib.md): Beginning with step 5, add a window that appears when a user clicks a component. For example, if you add a button component that deletes a record, you can add a modal that asks the user to confirm the record deletion.
7.  Click **Save** to save the page variant.
