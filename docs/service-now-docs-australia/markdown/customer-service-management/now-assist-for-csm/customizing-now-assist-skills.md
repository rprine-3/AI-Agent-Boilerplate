# Customizing a ServiceNow Otto for CSM skill

Learn how to access, activate, and customize a ServiceNow Otto for CSM skill using the AI Admin Hub console and AI Skill Kit.

Role required: admin

ServiceNow Otto for CSM provides base system skills that can be tailored to meet specific business requirements. Customization ensures that skills align with your organization's workflows, data sources, and user roles. There are two main ways to customize:

-   Using AI Admin Hub console: Modify base system skills, input configurations, and display settings.
-   Using AI Skill Kit: Build and publish custom skills for advanced use cases by customizing inputs and prompts, and then publish it. You can also use the AI Skill Kit to clone base system skills, as long as they are the latest versions created after the release of the AI Skill Kit.
