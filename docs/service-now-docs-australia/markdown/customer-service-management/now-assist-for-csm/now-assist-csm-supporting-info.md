## Role masking for ServiceNow Otto for CSM agentic workflows, AI agents, and skills

Role masking is used to restrict user access to agentic workflows, standalone AI agents, and skills. This ensures that users only receive the permissions necessary for their tasks, enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**How Role Masking Works**

Imagine a user assigned roles A, B, and C, where each role grants access to a specific set of data. Normally, only if using Access Control Lists \(ACLs\), the user could access any data or functions available to roles A, B, and C. With role masking applied, the user can only access data tied to the active role, limiting exposure to unnecessary information.

**Role Masking Considerations for ServiceNow Otto for CSM Skills**

When a CSM skill runs, its features are initially controlled by ACL permissions, ensuring users only access authorized data and functions. If the skill uses a large language model \(LLM\) to perform its task, role masking adds an extra layer of control. Role masking filters the LLM-generated output according to the user's active role.

Consider a user with roles A, B, and C, each granting different privileges. If the ACLs defined in the Case Summarization are roles A, B, and C and the masking role defined is role A, If the user activates the Case Summarization skill, and selects Summarize, the process occurs in two steps:

1.  **Data Retrieval**

    ACL permissions for role A are applied to fetch relevant case data. This ensures the user only sees data they are authorized to view.

2.  **Data Summarization**

    After data retrieval, an LLM summarizes the case. Role masking is then applied to the output, tailoring the summary to the access privileges defined for role A.


By applying both ACL permissions and role masking, the system ensures a secure and granular access control mechanism for CSM skills. This protects sensitive information while providing users with the insights needed to perform their tasks effectively.
