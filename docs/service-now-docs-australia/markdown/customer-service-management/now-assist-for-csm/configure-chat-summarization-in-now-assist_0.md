# Configure chat summarization

Configure Chat Summarization to generate condensed summaries of conversations between agents or with a Virtual Agent, highlighting key points for quick reference.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Configure the chat summarization skill

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

Chat summarizations are generated when:

-   The conversation ends.
-   The agent uses the summarize quick action in Agent Chat.
-   The user selects chat summarization or enters summarize chat in the Ask AI field on the ServiceNow Otto panel.
-   A live agent transfers an interaction to a different live agent.

    When an interaction is transferred from a Virtual Agent to a live agent and is at least six lines long, the chat summarization displays in a summary card. The summarization also populates the interaction's summarization and short description fields.


## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin &gt; AI Admin Hub &gt; AI Skills**.

2.  Select the **Customer** workflow, and **CSM** as the product.

3.  Activate Skill for the **Chat Summarization** skill.

    Each skill has a guided setup with multiple steps. A check symbol next to each step indicates whether its setup is complete, partially complete, or incomplete. After configuring a step, select **Save and continue** to move forward, or **Back** to return to a previous step.

4.  Select **Define Triggers** and switch the toggles to choose how and when the summarization is configured.

    |Trigger|Description|
    |-------|-----------|
    |Virtual Agent to Live Agent handoff|Chat summary that is generated when the chat handoff is done from Virtual Agent to a live agent.|
    |Live Agent to Live Agent handoff|Chat summary that is generated when the chat handoff is done from a live agent to a live agent.|
    |Quick action|Chat summary that is generated when the live agent performs the `/summarize` quick action.|
    |Chat wrap-up|Chat summary that is generated when the live agent ends the chat. The **Chat Summary** field is updated for the interaction.|
    |Short description|**Short description** field that is updated for the interaction when the live agent ends the chat.|
    |Task creation|**Short description** and **Description** fields that are auto-populated on the task record when a task is created from an interaction.|

    You can also toggle the bulleted list property to display the chat summary as an unordered list.

5.  Select **Choose Input** and review the portal and channel selections that determines where data is pulled from.

    **Note:** You cannot modify or deselect the default product portal data source. Additionally, portals that are already in use by other products cannot be selected.
