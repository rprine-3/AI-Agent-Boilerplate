# Configure email recommendation

Configure email reply recommendation to help agents generate and refine efficient email responses based on conversation context.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Configure email recommendation skill

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Email reply recommendations are generated from the information that you enter in the following fields:

-   Short description
-   Description
-   All journal fields
-   Emails

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin &gt; AI Admin Hub &gt; AI Skills**.

2.  Select the **Customer** workflow, and **CSM** as the product.

3.  Activate Skill for the **Email Recommendation** skill.

    Each skill has a guided setup with multiple steps. A check symbol next to each step indicates whether its setup is complete, partially complete, or incomplete. After configuring a step, select **Save and continue** to move forward, or **Back** to return to a previous step.

4.  Select **Choose Input** and review the tables and fields to create prompts that determines where data is pulled from.

    **Note:** You cannot modify the input data source.

</table>5.  Select **Define Availability** to customize how and when the skill capability is active and accessible.

    -   Select **Skill is always available** so no restrictions are placed on when a skill is available.
    -   Select **Customize skill availability** to define conditions and use the condition builder to configure fields and values.
6.  Select **Define access** to determine who can access this skill.

    By selecting specific roles, you're controlling who can use it. The roles you choose will also be available in the next step **Select display**.

    Default and Custom Roles:

    -   If no changes are made, the default role sn\_customerservice\_agent or sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent  will automatically appear in **Define Access** and **Select Display**.
    -   If custom roles were added before the upgrade, they’ll be updated automatically by a script.
    -   If new roles are created after the upgrade, you must manually add them in both the **Define Access** and **Select Display**.

        **Note:** In the **Select Display** step, you can only choose roles that were added in the **Define Access** step. If you add a role in **Define Access**, you still must manually select it in **Select Display** to make it active.

7.  Toggle **Display** to determine if email recommendation appears in In-product desktop, displaying AI skills on forms and workspaces.

8.  After selecting **Review and Activate** to examine changes, select **Done** to close the Email Reply generation settings.

9.  Select **Activate** to turn on the skill for agents and complete configuration.
