# Configure Propose Solution actions

Add generative AI-specific functionality to the Case form by configuring the Propose Solution UI action and declarative action that are included with the ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Customer Service Management application includes a Propose Solution UI action that agents can use to propose a solution for a customer service case.

The ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application includes the following actions that provide generative AI-specific functionality. Agents can use these actions to propose solutions that include AI-generated resolution notes:

-   Propose Solution declarative action: Generates resolution notes in CRM Workspace.
-   Propose Solution UI action: Generates resolution notes in Core UI.

**Note:** These actions are inactive by default.

To use the generative AI functionality, you must deactivate the Propose Solution UI action for Customer Service Management and then activate the Propose Solution UI action and declarative action for ServiceNow Otto for CSM. After being activated, these actions are available to customer service agents for assigned cases that are in the Open state.
