# Summarize a Sidebar discussion by using ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\)

Generate a summary of the Sidebar discussions between agents, requesters, and subject matter experts by using the chat summarization skill in the ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent, sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent

## About this task

You can do these actions by using Sidebar discussion summarization:

-   Summarize the Sidebar discussion at any point during the discussion using the `/Summarize` quick action.
-   Share the Sidebar discussion to the work notes.
-   Provide feedback for the summary.

**Note:** The Sidebar discussion summarization skill is on the chat skill card in the Customer group.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** and open a customer service case that supports Sidebar discussion and summarization.

2.  Choose an existing discussion, or start a new discussion.

    Start a new discussion by doing these actions:

    1.  Select **Discuss**.

    2.  In the Start a Sidebar discussion modal, add participants.

    3.  Select **Start Discussion**.

3.  Generate a summary of the Sidebar discussion during the conversation.

    Use the Summarize quick action by entering `/Summarize` in the Active sidebar discussion window, or select the quick action icon \[Omitted image "now-assist-sidebar-lightning-bolt-icon.png"\] Alt text: Quick action icon..

4.  After summarizing the Sidebar discussion, you can add it to the case work notes, and provide feedback about it.
