# Configure activity response generation

Set up the activity response generation skill in the AI Admin Hub console to enable automated responses in comments and work notes.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use the AI Admin Hub for configuring the activity response generation skill by selecting inputs, defining access, and activating the skill.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **AI Skills**.

    Access the skills configuration page.

    Verify you have admin role.

2.  Select the **Customer** workflow and choose **CSM**

    This determines the product context for the skill.

    Workflow and product must match your configuration requirements.

3.  Activate skill for the activity response generation skill.

    Each skill has a guided setup with multiple steps.

    A check symbol next to each step indicates whether its setup is complete, partially complete, or incomplete. After configuring a step, select **Save and continue** to move forward, or **Back** to return to a previous step.

4.  Select **General details** and review name, description and details of the skill.

    Additional information regarding details of the skill are displayed, but can't be edited.

5.  Select **Choose Input** and review the input tables and fields to create prompts that determine where data is pulled from.

    **Note:** You can't modify the input data source.

    |Input|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Input table|Case \[sn\_customerservice\_case\]|
    |Input fields|Description, Short Description, Additional comments, Work notes, State, Priority.|

6.  Select **Define access** to determine who can access this skill.

    By selecting specific roles, you're controlling who can use it. The roles you choose will also be available in the next step **Select display**.

    Default and Custom Roles:

    -   If no changes are made, the default roles sn\_customerservice\_agent and sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent automatically appear in **Define Access** and **Select Display**.
    -   If custom roles were added before the upgrade, they're updated automatically by a script.
    -   If new roles are created after the upgrade, you can manually add them in both the **Define Access** and **Select Display**.

        **Note:** In the **Select Display** step, you can only choose roles that were added in the **Define Access** step. If you add a role in **Define Access**, you still must manually select it in **Select Display** to make it active.

7.  Toggle **Select display** to determine if activity response generation skill appears in In-product desktop, displaying the AI skills on forms and workspaces.

    Additionally, verify the sn\_customerservice\_agent and sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent role\(s\) you configured in the previous step.

8.  Select **Review and Activate** to review the settings.

9.  Select **Activate** to turn on the skill for agents and complete the configuration.

    Skill is activated for agents and a success modal shows up with the option to **Return to CSM** and to **ServiceNow Otto context menu**.

10. Select **Go to ServiceNow Otto context menu** to launch the guided steps for [configuring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/now-assist-for-csm/customize-now-assist-context-menu-for-skills.md) the ServiceNow Otto context menu for the skill.

    You can also access this configuration from ServiceNow Otto Experience.
