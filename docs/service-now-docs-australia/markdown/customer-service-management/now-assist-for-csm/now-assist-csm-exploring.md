## ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) overview

The following generative AI capabilities are available for an agent:

-   An interaction chat summary provides context about the chat conversation between your agents and customers at different points of the handoff. For example, when a Virtual Agent chat history is handed off to a live agent, or when one live agent hands off a chat to another live agent.
-   A case summary enables an agent to gather the case context on long-running or complex cases. Because these cases can contain a lot of information, including the conversations with the customer or other agents, an agent can generate a summary to gain understanding faster.
-   Case resolution notes assist an agent to wrap up cases faster and provide context to other agents who might encounter similar issues.
-   A call summary assists an agent with obtaining the key details discussed during conversations between live agents and customers. It provides a high-level overview in a clear format.
-   Knowledge generation can help an agent to streamline content creation. An agent can automatically generate knowledge articles by using the relevant data from the case record after proposing a resolution or closing the case. By not having to generate knowledge articles manually, this feature can save your agents valuable time and effort.
-   Sidebar summary captures discussions between agents, requesters, and experts, and can be posted to case notes for further troubleshooting.
-   Chat recommendation generates reply suggestions for agents using the ServiceNow Otto context menu.
-   Email response generates reply suggestions for agents from existing or new emails using the ServiceNow Otto context menu.
-   Sentiment analysis helps reduce escalated cases by providing agents with the most current sentiment on a case, based on customer interactions and the latest trends. It also offers insights into why the sentiment is what it is today.
-   Suggested steps generation resolves cases and boosts agent productivity by automatically outlining the next best actions for unfamiliar cases in the Recommended Actions tab.
-   Sentiment analysis on an account uses filters and sorting dashboards to track sentiment, providing valuable insights and reducing escalated cases.
-   Conversational subflows and actions in the ServiceNow Otto panel use natural language to trigger subflows or actions, improving agent productivity and task completion efficiency.

-   The Portal case form guides requesters through a self-service flow using Genius Results, helping them find solutions and reducing the number of cases created.
-   Automated quality assurance dashboard displays detailed agent performance metrics and quality assurance scoring data, accessible from the CRM Workspace.
-   Special handling notes summarization skill condenses lengthy or multiple special handling notes into a brief, actionable summary. Agents view the summary in the Case Insights section to understand customer-specific handling requirements before engaging.
-   Customer summarization skill generates a concise, consolidated summary of a customer for the agent to understand the details before engaging.

## ServiceNow Otto panel in CRM Workspace

An agent can use the panel in CRM Workspace. This conversational interface enables an agent to request a chat summary or case summary and generate the case resolution notes. For more information about the panel, see [ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-overview.md).

## ServiceNow Otto in AI Search

The ServiceNow Otto in AI Search application uses Now LLM Service to extract actionable Q&amp;A Genius Result answers from the knowledge articles that are found in Service Portal, Virtual Agent, Employee Center, and global searches. By using this application, an agent can improve the customer's experience by retrieving the relevant content from the knowledge base and generating concise answers. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/now-assist-ais.md).

## ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent

ServiceNow Otto in the Virtual Agent guided setup can reduce the time and effort needed to deploy AI generated capabilities within Virtual Agent. Your administrators can configure features and skills and sources of information such as knowledge bases and catalogs. For more information, see [Configure AI in Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/configure-now-assist-va.md).

With the AI generated Multi-Turn Catalog Requests skill, your customers can engage with Virtual Agent in a conversational manner to request catalog items. A customer can request an item and then refine their search by providing additional information. For more information, see [Multi-turn catalog ordering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/using-now-assist-in-va.md#section_pl4_zjw_jzb).

## Sensitive data handling

Personally identifiable information and other sensitive data can be masked so that it does not appear in generative AI prompts. Placeholder text is sent with the prompt instead, and that placeholder text is replaced with the original text after the response has been received. This two-way masking ensures that your users see the correct values, but the Now LLM Service is not exposed to any sensitive information. For more information, see Multi-turn catalog ordering.
