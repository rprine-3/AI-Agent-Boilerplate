# Using agentic AI in ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\)

The Customer Service Management \(CSM\) AI Agent Collection provides a set of prebuilt, fully configured AI agents and agentic workflows designed to address common Customer Service Management scenarios.

These model examples combine autonomous and supervised flows to perform multi-step actions using advanced reasoning, triggered by customer cases, conversations, or detected intents. Built on the ServiceNow AI Platform, the agents leverage capabilities such as Knowledge Graph, Flow Designer, scripting, Topics, Catalog Items, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation \(RAG\). They also use record operations, web search, and generative inputs. Powered by AI Agent Fabric and Workflow Data Fabric, the collection operates seamlessly across systems without dependency on data location. Guardian enforces guardrails for security and compliance. By offering ready-to-use building blocks, it helps guide and automate complex processes, reduce agent friction, and free human agents to focus on higher-value work. This accelerates resolution times and enhances customer experience.

</table>## Supported Large Language Models

**Note:**

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).

## Security implementation considerations

Enable security implementation to execute AI agents and agentic workflows through Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) and user identities. For more information, see [Implement access control in AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-security-implementation.md)

## Considerations for running the autonomous AI Agents

**Important:** By default, all agentic workflows and AI agent records are read only.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first [duplicate the agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn’t necessary.

## Standalone AI agents

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).
