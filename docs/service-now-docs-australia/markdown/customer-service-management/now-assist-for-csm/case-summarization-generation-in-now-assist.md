# Configure Case Summarization

Configure case summarization to generate and display case summaries for agents and control who can access them in production.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Case summarization relies on a base input table and its associated field inputs with descriptions to provide the context for a generated summary. Choose your base table, and view the associated base input fields within the provided input templates. Record state determines which input template is used when generating a summary.

Provided input templates:

-   Case new
-   Case work in progress
-   Case resolved

Any modifications to the names or labels of the fields within these templates can result in issues with notes generation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin &gt; AI Admin Hub &gt; AI Skills**.

2.  Select the **Customer** workflow, and **CSM** as the product.

3.  Activate skill for the **Case summarization** skill.

    Each skill has a guided setup with multiple steps. A check symbol next to each step indicates whether its setup is complete, partially complete, or incomplete. After configuring a step, select **Save and continue** to move forward, or **Back** to return to a previous step.

4.  Select **General details** and edit name and description of the skill.

    Additional information regarding details of the skill are displayed, but can’t be edited.

5.  Select **Choose Input** and review the tables and fields to define the prompts that determine where data is pulled from.

    You can modify the rule conditions to determine when the input template is used. Additional data sources can be added via related tables as well.

    Default and Custom Roles:

    -   If no changes are made, the default roles sn\_customerservice\_agent and sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent automatically appear in **Define access** and **Select display**.
    -   If custom roles were added before the upgrade, they’re updated automatically by a script.
    -   If new roles are created after the upgrade, you can manually add them in both the **Define access** and **Select display**.

        **Note:** In the **Select display** step, you can only choose roles that were added in the **Define access** step. If you add a role in **Define access**, you still must manually select it in **Select display** to make it active.
