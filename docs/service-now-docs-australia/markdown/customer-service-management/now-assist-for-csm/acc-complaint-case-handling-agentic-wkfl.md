# Configure AI Agents for CSM - Complaint Case workflow

Configure the AI Agents for CSM - Complaint Case workflow by defining key requirements and security controls. The workflow is then tested and made available through various channels.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage.**.

2.  Select **AI Agents for CSM - Complaint Case**.

3.  Define the key requirements.

    For more information on defining key requirements, refer to [General guidelines for writing prompts for agentic AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/gg-creating-aia.md).

    1.  Write a clear description and list of steps.

    2.  Add AI agents that can perform these steps or ask ServiceNow Otto to suggest AI agents.

    3.  From the list, select any LLM providers that this agentic workflow does not support.

    4.  Select **Save and continue**.

4.  Define the security controls for this workflow.

    1.  Define user access.

        These include the following:

        -   Any authenticated user: Any logged-in user can access this AI agent.
        -   Users with specific roles: select specific roles that can access this AI agent.
        -   Public: anyone can access this AI agent, even if they are not logged in.
    2.  Define data access: Select the user identity type this agentic workflow will run as.

        These include the following:

        -   Dynamic user: This can be the sys\_user of a trigger, agentic workflow, or user that passes its roles to this AI agent.
        -   AI user: This is a type of sys\_user only for agentic workflows and AI agents, with pre-defined roles.
    3.  Select **Save and continue**.

5.  Add triggers.

    Add triggers if you want an agentic workflow or AI agent to launch according to pre-defined rules. Triggers spare your users the effort of reaching out for help.

    If you do not add triggers, the workflow executes only in response to users' requests for help.

6.  Select channels and status.

    Select the channels where you want this agentic workflow to be available for users.

    -   Engage via the ServiceNow Otto panel: When users send a message to ServiceNow Otto, they can discover and use this workflow.

    -   Engage via UI actions on specific records: When users select a UI action displayed on certain records, this workflow is activated.
7.  Select **Save and test**.
