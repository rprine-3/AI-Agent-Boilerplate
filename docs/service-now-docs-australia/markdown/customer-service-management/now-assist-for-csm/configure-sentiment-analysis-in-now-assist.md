# Configure sentiment analysis case

Configure Sentiment Analysis to evaluate case sentiment, trends, and reasoning from case inputs, helping agents resolve cases more efficiently.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Sentiment analysis is generated from the information that you enter in the following fields:

-   Description
-   Short Description
-   State
-   Priority
-   Additional Comments

Any modifications to the names or labels of these fields can result in issues with sentiment analysis.

Sentiment is calculated using several factors:

-   Latest requester comment
-   Previous comments for context
-   Sentiment history \(trend\)
-   Issue complexity and priority
-   SLA breach status
-   Feedback in comments
-   Frequency of updates and response time
-   Language tone

The Sentiment Reasoning field in the record provides details on which factors were considered for reasoning. This includes:

-   Exact tone in the given inputs.
-   Feedback in recent comment.
-   Task priority.
-   SLA consideration.

        **Note:** In the **Select Display** step, you can only choose roles that were added in the **Define Access** step. If you add a role in **Define Access**, you still must manually select it in **Select Display** to make it active.
