# Configure resolution notes generation

Configure the Resolution Notes skill to create concise summaries of case resolutions, helping agents quickly understand resolution details and support future similar interactions.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Configure resolution notes generation

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Case resolution notes are generated from the information that you enter in the following fields:

-   Short Description
-   Description
-   Work Notes
-   Additional Comments

Any modifications to the names or labels of these fields can result in issues with notes generation.

**Note:** Revert to the default field name and field label for the affected fields. To remove incompatible fields from summarization, confirm a copy of the skill has been created, as not all fields are removable/configurable.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Admin &gt; AI Admin Hub &gt; AI Skills**.

2.  Select the **Customer** workflow, and **CSM** as the product.

3.  Activate Skill for the **Resolution Notes Generation** skill.

    Each skill has a guided setup with multiple steps. A check symbol next to each step indicates whether its setup is complete, partially complete, or incomplete. After configuring a step, select **Save and continue** to move forward, or **Back** to return to a previous step.

4.  Select **Choose Input** and review the tables and fields to create prompts that determines where data is pulled from.

    **Note:** You can't modify the input data source.

</table>5.  Select **Define Triggers** and switch the toggle to require user input before resolution notes are created.

6.  Select **Define Availability** to customize how and when the skill capability is active and accessible.

    -   Select **Skill is always available** so no restrictions are placed on when a skill is available.
    -   Select **Customize skill availability** to define conditions and use the condition builder to configure fields and values.
7.  Select **Define access** to determine who can access this skill.

    By selecting specific roles, you're controlling who can use it. The roles you choose will also be available in the next step **Select display**.

    Default and Custom Roles:

    -   If no changes are made, the default roles sn\_customerservice\_agent and sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent will automatically appear in **Define Access** and **Select Display**.
    -   If custom roles were added before the upgrade, they'll be updated automatically by a script.
    -   If new roles are created after the upgrade, you must manually add them in both the **Define Access** and **Select Display**.

        **Note:** In the **Select Display** step, you can only choose roles that were added in the **Define Access** step. If you add a role in **Define Access**, you still must manually select it in **Select Display** to make it active.

8.  Select **Display** to determine where the resolution notes appear.

    -   Select In-product desktop to display AI skills on forms and workspaces.
    -   Select ServiceNow Otto panel to display AI skills in the panel.
9.  After selecting **Review and Activate** to examine changes, select **Done** to close the Resolution Notes Generation settings.

10. Select **Activate** to turn on the skill for agents and complete the configuration.

    Skill is activated for agents and a success modal shows up with the option to **Return to CSM** and to **Go to ServiceNow Otto content menu**.

11. Select **Go to ServiceNow Otto context menu** to [configure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/now-assist-for-csm/customize-now-assist-context-menu-for-skills.md) the activity response generation skill's context menu in AI Experience.
