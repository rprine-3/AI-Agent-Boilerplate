# Using Teams in Workforce Optimization for Customer Service

Use Teams to track and analyze performance trends for your teams from a single location. You can monitor the trends for each agent within your team and compare your agents or team members with one another.

With Teams, you can do the following:

-   Identify skill gaps so that you can recommend which skills are needed to coach your agents.
-   Organize your teams into assignment groups. You can add a set of key performance indicators \(KPIs\) to help you measure team performance consistently across the groups. For example, the Customer Service Desk unit contains multiple teams, such as Hardware and Network Support. You can create a KPI group for the Customer Service Desk unit and then add Hardware and Network Support as assignment groups to this KPI group. Next, you add a set of KPIs to the KPI group. With this data, you can measure the performance trends across the Hardware and Network Support teams.
-   Compare KPIs between multiple teams belonging to the same KPI group.
-   View the KPIs between the selected date range.
-   Drill down into a Team level KPI to view the split of KPIs across all individual team members.
-   View the KPI trend to analyze the future forecasts for each of the KPIs, if the date range has the latest values.
-   Targets can be set on the KPIs through the team performance page at the global or individual level. When such targets are set, the trendline reflects the targets.
-   Drill down to the individual agent level to view a 360 degree view of the current work, historical KPIs, presence history, channel capacity utilization, skills, and upcoming time-offs.
