# Configure catalog items for a service definition

After creating a service definition, you can associate one or more catalog items with the definition.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_csm\_case\_types.service\_definition\_manager, sn\_csm\_case\_types.service\_definition\_admin, or admin

## About this task

A catalog item is a product or service that is available within a service catalog. A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that enables users to create task-based records.

From the Customer and Consumer Portals, end users can select available services from the [Services portal widget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-service-definitions.md). Selecting a service displays the record producer associated with the service definition. Submitting the record producer creates a case of the correct case type.

A variable set for service definitions is available with the Customer Service Case Types plugin \(com.snc.csm\_case\_types\). This variable set populates the service definition based on the product and/or service selected on the record producer.

## Procedure
