    2.  Review the facts table, conditions, and frequency of the indicator sources compared to the data structure on your own instance.

        **Important:** Pay particular attention to time stamp fields such as Resolved or Created that are referenced in the **Conditions** field. You may need to use different time stamp fields.

    3.  If necessary, open an indicator source and make corrections.

        Changing the indicator source can also affect the additional conditions on the individual indicators.

8.  Open the Breakdown Sources tab.
