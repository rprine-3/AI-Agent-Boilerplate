# Integrating WhatsApp with Customer Service Management using the WhatsApp Cloud API

Use WhatsApp messaging with Customer Service Management to enable direct communication with customers through WhatsApp using the WhatsApp Cloud API.

This WhatsApp direct integration connects to Meta’s WhatsApp business platform and enables agents to provide real‑time customer support with rich media, interactive controls, and full CSM workflow integration.

The WhatsApp channel supports both automated conversations through Virtual Agent and live agent interactions through Agent Workspace, providing a complete customer service experience.

## WhatsApp messaging capabilities

WhatsApp messaging capabilities in Customer Service Management enable rich, interactive customer conversations beyond basic text messaging. Agents can exchange media files, send structured interactive controls, request customer inputs, and deliver formatted messages that improve clarity and reduce friction.

## Rich and interactive messaging features

WhatsApp supports the following messaging features and rich interactive controls:

Opt-in and consent

The integration captures and records customer opt-in and opt-out messages to track communication consent.

Audio messages

When a customer sends an audio message through WhatsApp, the system renders it as an inline audio player in the conversation thread instead of a downloadable link. The audio player supports play, pause, seek, and volume controls, and displays the total duration and current playback position. You can enable audio rendering using the **supports\_audio\_rich\_control** custom adapter system property.
