## About this task

The Customer Service Case Types plugin includes declarative actions that enable agents to create cases and case tasks using the [case type selector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-case-type-select-modals.md) and [case task type selector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-case-task-type-select-modal.md). These declarative actions are disabled by default.
