# Create Manager Workspace Landing Page

Create a landing page based on your business requirement.

## Before you begin

Create reports and key performance indicators that are required to set up the landing page.

Role required: sn\_mgr\_workspace.admin

## About this task

The landing page displays a set of reports that are the initial view of your workspace. You can enhance the Workforce Optimization experience by customizing the landing page to monitor metrics and trends that matter most to you. Use the User Interface \(UI\) Builder to add data visualization components to display widgets and reports that you want to track and monitor.

Using UI Builder, you can:

-   Clone the existing CSM landing page.

    **Note:** The application scope can be set to CSM Workspace, CSM Manager Workspace or Workforce Optimization. The **Clone Page** action is not available in the Global scope.

-   Add or edit containers in the page.
-   Add or edit visualizations for each container.
-   Edit the layout of a page or container.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Landing Pages**.

2.  Select the **CSM Landing Page**.

3.  Select **Clone Page**.

    **Note:** The **Clone Page** action is available when the application scope is CSM workspace.

4.  Fill out the form.

    The settings in the **Layout** and **Available Child Slots** fields determine how the content renders on the page.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|The name of your landing page.|
    |Component|The component defaults to sn-page and is read-only.|
    |Order|The order for the landing page. If you have multiple landing pages, the order determines the landing page precedence. Pages with a lower-order value take precedence over pages with a higher-order value.|

    4.  Select **Submit** to save your permissions.

If there are some element permissions set, then a user needs just one role or group assignment to see the element.
