2.  In the Foundation Data category, click **Get Started** and then click **Import Product Models**.

3.  Upload data from an external data source into an import set.

4.  Create a transform map.

5.  Execute the transform map to transfer the data.

6.  Verify that the data records are imported into the target table.
