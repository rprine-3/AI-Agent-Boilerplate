# Create an external organization

Create an external organization \(formerly external business location\) to enable users and consumers to create accounts, contacts, consumers, and households.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Both internal and external users can be added as managers for external business locations.

The manager of an external organization can access all the cases for an account, household, or consumer in the location hierarchy, including cases for child business locations. The manager can also:

-   Create staff members for internal and external organization .
-   Assign roles and responsibilities to the staff members.
-   Assign staff members to the location.
-   View and manage cases created in the location hierarchy.
-   Submit a case on behalf of the location.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Business Organizations\)** &gt; **External Organizations**.

2.  In the External Organizations list, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [External Organization form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ext-business-location-form.md).

4.  Select **Submit**.

    The location is added to the External Organizations list.

    After creating an external organization, add staff members to it. You can then create relationships between staff members and accounts, households, and consumers, and track the list of customers serviced by a business organization.
