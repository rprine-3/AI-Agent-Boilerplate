# Roles installed with Employee as a Consumer

Use different roles to establish the relationships between your users and entities. By using the Employee as a Consumer functionality within the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application, your organization can support both requesters and supporters.

## Overview of Employee as a Consumer

The Unified Consumer \(sn\_customerservice.unified\_consumer\) role enables a user to have both the snc\_internal and snc\_external roles, which means that roles have greater control over consumer behavior, whether it's internal or external.

Earlier, the Consumer \(sn\_customerservice.consumer\) role automatically included the snc\_external role, which created a limitation. This limitation helped to prevent an organization from assigning the snc\_internal role to a user and restricted the simultaneous use of both the snc\_internal and snc\_external roles. To address these limitations, a new role, independent of the snc\_external role, was introduced to complement the sn\_customerservice.consumer role. This additional role can be associated with both the snc\_internal and snc\_external roles, which means that your organization now has increased flexibility in managing a user's behavior.

## Employee as a Consumer existing and new roles

The following diagram shows the existing roles and the new roles that enable the Employee as a Consumer functionality.

\[Omitted image "unified-consumer.png"\] Alt text: Existing and new roles that enable the Employee as a Consumer functionality. For a detailed explanation of these roles, refer to the Roles and description table.

**Note:**

With the Employee as a Consumer functionality, the Requester \(sn\_customerservice.requester\) and the Unified Consumer \(sn\_customerservice.unified\_consumer\) roles were introduced. Both these roles are independent of the snc\_internal and snc\_external roles​.

In addition to the roles listed below, users functioning as consumers must have a linked record in the Consumers \[csm\_consumer\] table. Without this record, consumer functionality is not available even with the appropriate role assigned.
