# Add related parties to an install base item

Add related parties to an install base item in the Customer Service Management application so that you can enable another party to have access to an install base.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin and sn\_customerservice\_manager

## About this task

An install base-related party is a list of contacts, consumers, contributors, service organization members, accounts, or service organizations. You add a related party to enable access to another party that isn't the owner of the install base. Related parties associated with an install base can access it and its related entities, including installed products, sold products, and associated cases.

**Note:** You can enable additional contacts by using the **Restrict Contact Access** field. For details, see [Restrict contact access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/manage-account-access-cam.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Products** &gt; **Install Base Items**.

2.  Open an install base item from the list.

3.  Select **Install Base Related Parties**, and select **New**.

4.  From the **Type** drop-down, select the type of related party that you want to add to the install base item.

    Based on the selection that you chose, you can assign one of the combinations in the following table:

    |Type|Functional Role|Entity|
    |----|---------------|------|
    |Authorized Account|Install Base Authorized Contact \(sn\_install\_base.install\_base\_authorized\_contact\)|Account|
    |Authorized Contact|Install Base Authorized Contact \(sn\_install\_base.install\_base\_authorized\_contact\)|Contact|
    |Authorized Consumer|Install Base Authorized Consumer \(sn\_install\_base.install\_base\_authorized\_consumer\)|Consumer|
    |Authorized Contributor|Install Base Authorized Contributor \(sn\_install\_base.install\_base\_authorized\_contributor\)|User|
    |Authorized Member|Install Base Authorized Member \(sn\_install\_base.install\_base\_authorized\_member\)|Service Organization|
    |Authorized Service Organization|Install Base Authorized Member \(sn\_install\_base.install\_base\_authorized\_member\)|Service Organization|
    |Listed Account| |Not applicable|
    |Listed Contact| |Not applicable|
    |Listed Consumer| |Not applicable|
    |Listed Contributor| |Not applicable|
    |Listed Member| |Not applicable|
    |Listed Service Organization| |Not applicable|

    **Note:** The **Responsibility** field on the Install Base-Related Parties form is automatically populated based on the type of related party that is selected. For information on the type of related parties, see [Create related party configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/adding-related-party-config-to-case.md).

5.  To use the **Order** field to specify the sequence in which records are displayed, organized according to business preferences.

6.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The contact is assigned as a related party to the Install base item. The contact gets access to all the corresponding items, such as the child install base items and the cases on the install base item form.
