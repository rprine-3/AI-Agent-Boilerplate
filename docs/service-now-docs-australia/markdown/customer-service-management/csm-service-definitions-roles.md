The admin and agent roles can do the following:

-   See the **Service** field on the Case Task form.
-   Select a service in the **Service** field and save the Case Task form.
-   Create a case task and see the **Service** field on the Case Task form.

In the Core UI, users with the admin role or one of the agent roles listed above can do the following:

-   See the **Service** column on Task list.
-   See the **Service** field on the Task form.

From the Customer and Consumer Service Portals, users with the admin role or an end user role can see the **Service** field on case tasks that the user has access to. See the following table for the end user roles that can see this field.
