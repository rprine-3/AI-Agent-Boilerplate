# Add Guided Decisions to Recommended Actions

Add decision trees created using the Guided Decisions Experience application to Recommended Actions, so customer service agents can work through it to resolve cases more efficiently.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have Recommended Actions application \(sn\_nb\_action\) installed.

Role required: sn\_nb\_action.next\_best\_action\_author, admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Recommended Actions** &gt; **Contexts**.

2.  [Create a context for a table.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-contexts-create.md)

    A context enables agents to see recommended actions for a record in that table.

3.  [Create a rule for the context.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-rules-create.md)

    A rule is a set of conditions that applies to a context and determines when a recommended action appears for records in the context table.

4.  [Create a recommendation of type decision tree.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-recommendations-create.md)

    A recommendation is a way to suggest an action to an agent.
