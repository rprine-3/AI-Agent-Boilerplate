# CRM Workspace form headers

Form headers in CRM Workspace provide agents with a brief description of the case.

Form headers typically include the case short description. They can also include the action bar, record tags, and the [record presence component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page.md).

For more information, see [Set up a form header in CRM Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-config-ws-form-header.md)

**Note:** One form header configuration, **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace Header Config**, is included with CRM Workspace.

## Record Information tab

The record information tab in the contextual side panel displays record details including the account and contact or consumer, the case state, and the case priority.

The Record Information tab in the contextual side panel can include the following cards depending on the record page configuration:

-   Overview: Displays relevant information about the case including the account and contact, the case priority, and the state.
-   Active SLA: Displays active SLAs for the case, including time remaining, the SLA state, and any breaches.

The cards that appear in the Record Information tab can be configured in the ribbon configuration. For more information, see [Set up a ribbon configuration in CSM Configurable Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-config-ws-ribbon.md).

## Form header components

For CRM Workspace, the form header is made up of individual components that can be configured with [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/using-ui-builder.md).

Individual components provide customers with flexible and granular configuration options. Customers can control the placement, size and spacing of these components, giving them the ability to show additional information that agents may need.

The Data Value Block component is used to display secondary values in the form header and the Contextual side panel. .
