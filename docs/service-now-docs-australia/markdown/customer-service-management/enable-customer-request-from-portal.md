# Enable external customers to create requests

Enable your external customers to create and track requests from the Customer and Consumer Service Portals.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Each submitted request generates a case, with the request record associated to that case. Customer service agents can also create requests on behalf of contacts and consumers.

**Note:** This feature requires activation of the Customer Service with Request Management plugin \(com.sn\_cs\_sm\_request\).

## Procedure

-   Configure the Case form to display the **Initiated as request** field.

    When a request is created from the portal, the system creates a case for the request and sets this field to true.

    **Note:** The **Initiated as request** field is read-only for all users.
