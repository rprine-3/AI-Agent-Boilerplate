# Add questions or instructions to a decision input

Create decision inputs for each decision node. Decision inputs appear in the form of questions in a workspace for service agents to answer.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_gd\_core.decision\_tree\_author

Create a decision path first. A decision node is automatically created with the same name as the decision path.

Decision nodes can have one or multiple questions with different answer types.

You can edit or extend existing decision trees in the Core UI but you can no longer create them. Use Decision Tree Builder to create new decision trees.
