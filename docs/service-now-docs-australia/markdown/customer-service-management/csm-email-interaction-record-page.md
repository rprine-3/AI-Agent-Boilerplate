If you are using any additional plugins, you need to add the actions from those plugins to the Email Interaction record page action bar. For more information, see the configuration steps in this topic: [Configure the Front-line case page action bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-front-line-case-page-action-bar.md).

## Thin compose modeless dialogs

The thin composer is located at the bottom of the activity stream with the Email tab as the first tab. Agents can pop out the composer into a separate window called a modeless dialog.

Drafts are created when agents add or modify content in the composer. Minimized modeless dialogs appear in the [workspace dock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-config-ws-bottom-utility-bar.md).

For more information about modeless dialogs, see [Thin compose modeless dialogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page-modeless-dialogs.md).

Recommended Actions

</td><td>

The Recommended Actions tab is now available as the first tab in the contextual side panel and is enabled for Pro customers. It includes a set of base system recommendations, such as similar incidents and similar open incidents.

The Recommended Actions tab includes [AI search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-ai-search.md) functionality and suggested actions. Agents can use AI search to find relevant resources or resolutions for customer issues.The search feature displays an initial set of search results based on the text in the interaction short description. This initial set of results includes knowledge articles. Agents can also enter different search keywords and repeat the search.

From the list of search results, agents can select a source to see search results of that type.

Depending on the source type, agents can do the following:

-   Open an article in full view in a sub tab.
-   Flag an article.
-   Mark an article as helpful.
-   Order a catalog item.
-   Attach and add a link in email.

The workspace switches to the relevant tab. The inserted link displays the knowledge article title and article number as a hyperlink, in the format `Article Title: KB0012345`.


For more information, see [Use AI search in Recommended Actions to resolve cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/nba-use-ai-search.md).

**Note:** Using Recommended Actions in the contextual side panel requires the [Recommended Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/nba.md) application \(sn\_cs\_nb\_action\) which is included with the CSM Configurable Workspace application.

</table>## Email interaction tab notifications

Unread email counters display on email interaction tabs to help agents track new email activity across multiple interactions. When new emails arrive for an email interaction that's open in an inactive tab, an unread counter appears on the tab. The counter increments as additional emails arrive and clears when you select the tab.

For example, you have multiple email interactions open. A customer replies to an interaction in an inactive tab. The tab displays an unread counter \(for example, "2"\), so you can identify which interactions have new activity without losing context. For configuration requirements, see [View unread email counters on interaction tabs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/view-unread-email-counters-on-interaction-tabs.md).
