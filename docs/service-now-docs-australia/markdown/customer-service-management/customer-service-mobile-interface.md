## Activate the Customer Service Mobile plugin

The Customer Service Management mobile application runs on the ServiceNow® mobile platform.

To use the Customer Service Management mobile application, activate the Customer Service Mobile plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_mobile\). This plugin activates the following plugins:

-   Mobile Agent Native Client plugin \(com.glide.sg.agent\_native\_client\)

Once the Customer Service Management mobile application is activated and configured, agents can download the ServiceNow Agent mobile app on their mobile devices and access ServiceNow instances.

**Note:** You can activate the Customer Service Mobile plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_mobile\) from the Customer Service Management guided setup.
