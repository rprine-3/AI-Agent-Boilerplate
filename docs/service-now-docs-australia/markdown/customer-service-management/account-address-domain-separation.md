# Domain separation for the Account Address table

Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can then control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

All account address table records are present in the domain of the associated account.

**Note:** Any location record is originally created in the global domain. However, when the location record is associated with an account, the location record is automatically added to the account's domain. Associating the same location to multiple accounts doesn’t change the domain of the location.
