# Add the Timeline component as a standalone component

Add the Timeline component as a standalone component to a record page by using the Task activity timeline reset and controller.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Timeline component displays activities for task-based records such as cases or incidents in a timeline view. It uses the resolution shaper configuration to automatically fetch and organize your data.

To add the Timeline component to a record page as a standalone component, the admin can select the Task activity timeline controller and preset and complete the component configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Open a page variant in UI Builder.

2.  On the page variant, select the + icon to add a component.

    For example, add a component above the lookup card in the left column.

3.  Select the Timeline component from the Add content pop-up window and then select **Add**.

4.  Select the Task activity timeline preset from the Select a preset pop-up window and then select **Apply**.

    This also adds the Task activity timeline controller 1 to the page.

5.  Select **Use preset**.

6.  Select **Task activity timeline controller preset** and then select **Apply**.

    This auto populates the necessary properties such as the table and sys ID.

7.  In the Configure tab, select a role in the **Fulfiller Role** field.

8.  Close the controller dialog box and select **Save** to save the changes to the page variant.
