# Disconnect product inventory records

Perform the **Disconnect** operation on single or multiple product inventory records that result in the creation of orders or quotes on the CRM Workspace so that you can permanently disconnect a product and its services.

## Before you begin

Role required: Order admin \(sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_admin\) or Order agent \(sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent\)

## About this task

After performing the **Disconnect** action, a disconnect order is created and the fulfillment process for the order begins. This fulfillment flow marks the order as **Complete** and updates the product inventory records.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  In the list view, select **Customer** &gt; **Accounts**.

3.  Open the account that the product inventory belongs to.

4.  Navigate to the **Product Inventories** related list and select one or more root product inventory records.

    **Note:** You can do the **Disconnect** action only on one root sold product whose state is **Active** or **Suspended**, and the option is enabled only if the root product inventory with **Active** or **Suspended** states are selected and is disabled for any other state.

5.  Select **Disconnect**.

6.  In the Disconnect window, enter when you want the disconnection to start in the **Start date and time** field.

7.  Add a reason for a disconnection in the **Reason for disconnection** field.

8.  Select **Disconnect**.


## Result

An order to disconnect the product inventory record is created.
