Starting with the Yokohama release, CRM Workspace has a dependency on the [Customer Central plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-central.md). The Customer Central application is installed automatically with CRM Workspace.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Select the Page collections tab.

3.  Select a page collection.

    -   CSM default record post-Details
    -   CSM Interaction record post-Details
4.  Select **Settings** for one of the following page variants to open the settings panel.

    -   Customer Activity default
    -   Customer Information default
5.  In the Availability section, disable the **Active** check box.

6.  Select **Save**.
