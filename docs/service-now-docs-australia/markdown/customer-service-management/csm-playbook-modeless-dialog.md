# Playbook modeless dialogs

Use modeless dialogs, windows that overlay the main window content, to create and post comments and work notes to the activity stream and to compose and send emails.

A modeless dialog is a window that appears in a workspace as an overlay on top of the main window content. This overlay enables users to interact with the window content and the overlay content at the same time. Agents can use modeless dialogs to do the following while working in a playbook:

-   Create comments and work notes to post to the activity stream.
-   Create and send emails and reply to or forward emails.

After opening a modeless dialog, agents can move it around the screen and put it where they need it. This feature enables agents to reference information from the main window while drafting text in the overlay window.

The playbook page templates include the following modeless dialogs:

-   Compose Activity - for creating and posting comments and work notes
-   Compose Email - for creating and sending emails

You can access the modeless dialogs by selecting the **Compose** button in the action bar and then selecting one of the following actions:

-   Compose Comments
-   Compose Email
-   Compose Work notes \(Private\)

## Create comments and work notes

Agents can use the Compose Activity modeless dialog to create comments and work notes and post them to the activity stream. See the following table for more information about creating these activities.
