# Set up a ribbon configuration in CRM Workspace

Create a ribbon setting and add that setting to a ribbon configuration for CRM Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_admin, ui\_builder\_admin, admin

## About this task

Use the steps in this task to set up a ribbon configuration for CRM Workspace.

-   Create a ribbon setting, such as creating another version of the Customer 360 ribbon component.
-   Add the ribbon setting to a ribbon configuration.
-   Set the width and the order of the ribbon setting within the ribbon configuration.

**Note:** You can also use ribbon settings from CSM Agent Workspace in CRM Workspace if you add the setting to the ribbon configuration.

One ribbon configuration **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace Ribbon Config**, is included with CRM Workspace. This configuration includes the Customer 360, Timeline, and Active SLA ribbon components. You can use this configuration in the base system without completing any additional configuration steps.

## Procedure

1.  Create a ribbon setting.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Configuration Settings** &gt; **UX Ribbon Setting**.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  Fill in the fields on the Ribbon Setting form.

<table id="table_os4_3hp_s3b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

A label that describes this ribbon setting. It often includes the table associated with this ribbon.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ribbon component

</td><td>

The component to add to the ribbon setting, including Customer360, Timeline, Active SLA, or a custom ribbon component. **Note:** You can only add one component at a time. To make a second component appear in the ribbon, repeat this procedure to create another ribbon setting and add a different component.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

The table associated with this ribbon setting. Anytime an agent selects a record from this table, the ribbon setting appears with this component.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Width

</td><td>

The number of columns that the component occupies in the ribbon. The width of the page is 12 columns. When using multiple components, the total combined width of all the components must equal 12 or less.**Note:** For CRM Workspace, set the width of the ribbon component on the Ribbon Configuration Setting form \(see step 3\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

The scope of this ribbon. Global means the ribbon works with all applications.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

The location of this component in the ribbon. Ordering the components goes from left to right. For example, if you associate three components with a table, the component with the lowest order appears on the left and the component with the highest order appears on the right.**Note:** For CRM Workspace, set the order of the ribbon component on the Ribbon Configuration Setting form \(see step 3\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Toggle to turn this component on or off in the ribbon for this table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Inherit

</td><td>

If set to true, the ribbon configuration can be inherited by child tables. For this to be effective, a child table shouldn’t have any configured ribbon settings. The **Inherit** field is false by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Experience restricted

</td><td>

If set to true, the ribbon component is restricted to Configurable Workspaces.

 If set to false, the ribbon component is global and appears in CSM Agent Workspace \(legacy\).

 This field is set to true by default.

</td></tr></tbody>
