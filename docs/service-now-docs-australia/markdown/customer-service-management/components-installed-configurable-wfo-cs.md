</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_shift\_planning.conformance\_lower\_threshold

</td></tr><tr><td>

Clock-out event generation \(For scenarios where clock-out event does not get triggered\)

</td><td>

Generates clock-out events every 4 hours if agents haven't clocked-out. **Note:** Consider an agent's work shift timings are from 8 AM to 5 PM and **sn\_shift\_planning.auto\_clockout\_threshold** property value is set to 60 minutes. The agent clocks-in and fails to clock out, the scheduled job waits until 6 PM\(5 PM+60 minutes\) and if there’s no clock out until 6 PM, the system generates a clock-out event with agent's shift end time.

</table>**Setting the due date for time-off and shift-swap request approvals**: Administrators can configure the due date logic for the Time Off Request and Shift Swap Request approval flows. The approval due date is set as the number of days before the request start date. The default is set to two days which means if the approval is not approved two days before the request start date, it will be auto-rejected.
