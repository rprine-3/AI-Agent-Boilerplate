# Example: Troubleshoot a failed credit card transaction

Learn how process analysts or business owners configure a recommended action that uses a decision tree to troubleshoot a failed credit card transaction.

## Problem scenario

Paul was trying to purchase a smart watch using his StellarVest bank credit card. But the transaction failed at the time of payment. Paul created a case in the StellarVest bank customer support portal seeking assistance.

In this scenario, the agent assigned to the Paul’s case is recommended to use a decision tree to troubleshoot the failed credit card transaction. The decision tree collects user, credit card, and transaction details. If money was debited, transaction tracking is initiated. However, if no money was debited, the agent provides a failure code, which determines what guidance is provided. Examples of potential guidances include: reassigning the case, creating a work order, or assigning the case to an IT technician.
