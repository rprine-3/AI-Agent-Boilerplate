# Lookup component

Use the lookup component on interaction record pages in CSM Configurable Workspace to look up, link, and verify a contact or consumer on an interaction record.

\[Omitted image "lookup-and-verify-component.png"\] Alt text: Lookup and verify contact card includes the contact name plus selectable fields for account name, email address, and phone numbers

The lookup component is available on the following interaction record pages:

-   [CSM centered chat interaction record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-centered-chat-interaction-page.md)
-   [CSM voice interaction record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md)
-   Email interaction record page

**Note:** For some of these interaction record pages, the Lookup component replaces the Lookup &amp; Verify component that was formerly available in the contextual side panel.

For more information about the component usage and configuration, see [Lookup](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/next-experience/zurich/now-components/record%20lookup/overview) in the [Next Experience Components documentation](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/next-experience/components?&query=&order_by=nameAsc&limit=120&offset=0&categories[]=uib_component&categories[]=uib_macroponent-component&categories[]=uib_facades).

## Using the lookup component

Customer service agents can use the lookup component to search for and select a customer, either a contact or consumer, and link that customer to the interaction record.

Linking a customer displays the customer information in a contact or consumer card on the interaction record. After linking a customer to the record, agents can verify the customer.
