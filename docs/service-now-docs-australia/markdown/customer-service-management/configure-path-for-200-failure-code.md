# Configure paths for different failure code conditions

Configure a path for each failure code condition to provide appropriate guidance to agents.

Role required: admin, sn\_gd\_core.decision\_tree\_author

## About this task

When the failure code received by the customer is 200, the path that leads to the Reassign case guidance is taken.

For more information about how to configure a path, see [Determine the next node displayed in a decision tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-path-in-gdb.md).

## Procedure

1.  In Decision Tree Builder, select the Add path icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-add-path.png"\] Alt text: Add path icon\) on the Ask for failure codes question node.

    A new path and a new node are added to the canvas.

2.  Select the new path.

3.  In the **Path name** field, enter `200`.

4.  In the **Path priority** field, enter `100`.

5.  Select the appropriate fields to set the condition "Enter the failure code \| is \| true".

6.  Select **Save and close**.


## What to do next

Configure paths for other failure codes:

-   300 failure code - This path leads to the Create work order guidance.
-   500 failure code - This path leads to the Assign IT technician guidance.
