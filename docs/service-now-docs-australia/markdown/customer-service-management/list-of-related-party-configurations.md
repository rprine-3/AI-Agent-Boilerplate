**Note:**

-   Whenever a related party record is created, the **Responsibility** field gets auto-populated from the default responsibility associated with the selected party type​. Similarly, the **Order** field gets auto-populated from the default order associated with the selected party type​.
-   Listed role types don’t have any responsibility. Since the correct role and responsibility determine access, related parties aren’t granted access if the **Responsibility** field is left empty.​
