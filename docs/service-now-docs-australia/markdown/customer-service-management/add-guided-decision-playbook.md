# Add Guided Decisions to playbooks

Add decision trees created using the Guided Decisions Experience application to a playbook, so customer service agents can work through it to resolve cases more efficiently.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, pd\_content\_author

## About this task

A playbook is set of steps that defines a process. A decision tree can be added as one of the steps within a playbook.

Playbooks are displayed in cases on Agent Workspace based on trigger definitions defined for each playbook in the Process Automation Designer. For more details, see [Process Automation Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md). Based on the context of the case the customer service agent is working on, the playbook and any associated decision trees are displayed.

For more details on playbooks for Customer Service Management, see [Playbooks in Customer Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/setting-up-csm-playbooks.md).
