# Omnichannel

Omnichannel routes customer conversations from every channel into one workspace. Agents can see the full interaction history and resolve issues without switching context.

## Omnichannel overview

Omnichannel brings together customer communications from email, chat, voice, messaging apps, web and portal, virtual agents, and in-person interactions. It keeps all conversations and context unified in one system as customers switch channels. Agents manage every interaction from a unified workspace to provide consistent service across every channel.

-   **Chat**

    Chat is available in self-service portals, third-party portals, and mobile apps through Virtual Agent and Engagement Messenger, and conversations carry across every channel.

-   **Email**

    Track, route, and resolve all emails in ServiceNow. Two workflows are available: Email as Interaction creates an interaction record for agent review before optionally converting to a case. Email to Case automatically creates and populates a case record, with all replies threaded within it. Full conversation history is preserved in both workflows.

-   **Messaging**

    Omnichannel messaging supports SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, LINE, and Apple Messages for Business, so customers can message at their own pace through Virtual Agent or live agents across all channels.

-   **Voice**

    The Voice framework integrates with certified CCaaS platforms to deliver call features. ServiceNow serves as the unified agent workspace for organizations that need voice-only or embedded Computer Telephony Integration \(CTI\).


## Omnichannel workflow

The following omnichannel workflow example shows how Alex, a customer service manager at a growing retail company, improves support across chat, email, messaging apps, and voice. Customers can start in one channel and continue in another without repeating themselves. A virtual agent collects order and issue details and attempts self-service resolution. When escalation is needed, the conversation moves to a live agent with full context, who creates and resolves the case while keeping the complete interaction history linked. From the unified workspace, Alex’s team can view every channel in one place, reduce resolution times, and provide consistent, informed service at each touchpoint.
