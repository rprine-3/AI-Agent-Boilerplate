# Create a responsibility definition

A responsibility, or responsibility definition, specifies the role or function a user has within an entity, determining access through relationships. When creating a relationship, users are assigned specific responsibilities that grant access to the entity and its related entities.

## Before you begin

Role required: One of the following roles:

-   sn\_crm\_customer\_access\_management\_admin
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_admin
-   admin

## About this task

If you’re using the Service Model Foundation feature, you can also create the responsibility definitions to use in customer and consumer relationships. For more information about configuring Service Model Foundation, see [Configure Service Model Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-industry-data-model.md).

The Responsibility Definition \[sn\_customerservice\_responsibility\_def\] table supports domain separation. For more information on domain separation, see [Domain separation and Customer Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/domain-separation-customer-service.md).

**Note:** Starting with the Vancouver release, the Responsibility Definition \[sn\_customerservice\_responsibility\_def\] table is reparented to the Application file \[sys\_metadata\] table.
