# Create customer contacts

A contact is a user who is an employee of an account. Use the Customer Service Management application to create contact records.

## Before you begin

Role required: One of the following roles:

-   sn\_crm\_account\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_account\_relationship\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_admin
-   sn\_customerservice\_manager
-   admin

## About this task

An account can have multiple contacts but a contact can be associated with only one account. A contact can have one or more associated assets and service contracts. A contact can also have a user ID and can log in to the customer portal.

**Note:** A contact is a user in the system. If you create a contact, that person is also added to the User table \(sys\_user\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Customer** &gt; **Contacts**.

2.  Select **New** and fill in the fields on the Contact form.

3.  Enter the contact information, such as the name, email address, and phone number.

4.  Enter the name of the contact's company in the **Account** field.

5.  Select the **Timezone**.

6.  Select a **Language**.

7.  Select a **Notification** setting.

8.  Select **Submit**.

    After a registration request is approved, the customer contact receives an email with a user ID and temporary password. When logging in for the first time, the contact is asked to change the password.
