# Create an invoice case

Create an invoice case for a customer invoice or for selected invoice lines.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_csm\_invoice.agent, sn\_csm\_invoice.manager, admin

## Procedure

1.  In CRM Workspace, select **New** from the Invoice Cases list view.

2.  Add information to the Invoice Case form, such as **Account** and **Contact** and **Short description**.

3.  Select an invoice number in the **Invoice** field.

    This field is displayed if the **Request source** field is set to Specific invoice lines, single invoice.

4.  Select **Save**.

    Saving the Invoice Case form to creates the invoice case record in the Draft state.

5.  View the invoice case record details and make any necessary changes.

    You can perform the following tasks while the order case is in Draft state:

    -   Add invoices or invoice lines to the invoice case.
    -   Delete invoices or invoice lines from the invoice case.
    -   Create new invoice case lines.
    -   Edit the details of invoice case lines.
    -   Assign invoice case lines to yourself.
6.  Select **Submit**.

    Submitting the invoice case record moves the invoice case and the invoice case lines currently in the Draft state to the New state and enables you to begin working to resolve the invoice case.
