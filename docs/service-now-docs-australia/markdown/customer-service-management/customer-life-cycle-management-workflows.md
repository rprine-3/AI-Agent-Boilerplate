# Customer Life Cycle Management Workflows

Manage the life cycle of your sold products by activating the Customer Life Cycle Management Workflows \(com.snc.customer\_lifecycle\_mgmt\_workflows\) application.

## Overview of workflows

The Customer Life Cycle Management Workflows \(com.snc.customer\_lifecycle\_mgmt\_workflows\) application enables you to update the existing configurations, and to modify, suspend, resume, or disconnect the sold products and their complete hierarchy. The workflows are built and composed by using the lead-to-cash transactional operations like Effect, Create Instance, Delta, and Commit Instance. To learn more about the transactional operations of the Lead to Cash Core \(com.snc.l2c\_core\) plugin, see [Lead to Cash Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/lead-to-cash.md).

## Plugins for the Customer Life Cycle Management Workflows

The following table lists the required plugins for the Life Cycle Management Workflows plugin.

</table>## Life Cycle workflows and configurations

Perform the **Modify**, **Suspend**, **Resume**, and **Disconnect** declarative actions on the complete hierarchy of the sold products. These actions will transform and maintain their state and characteristics. You can perform these actions on the sold product entities to update the existing products or services. The declarative actions are available on the sold product related list on the account detail page on Configurable Workspace.

**Note:** The declarative actions with the sold product to order flow are available only if the Order Management \(com.sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm\) plugin is installed.

The Sold Product related list on the Accounts page displays all the sold products regardless of the product offer having a product specification. You can also select a sold product with a product specification associated with the product offering and perform any of the MACD flows. Be sure to upgrade to Xanadu to perform the modify, suspend, resume, and disconnect actions on product offerings that have a specification associated with it.

**Note:** If Product Inventory records are selected, the **Modify**, **Suspend**, **Resume**, and **Disconnect** actions are deactivated.

Workflows

Multiple sub-flows are based on the modify, suspend, resume, and disconnect actions that help to update the sold products and their configurations. The flows are based on a set of entity configurations that are shipped when you activate the Customer Life Cycle Management Workflow plugin.

The following table lists the flows for the declarative actions.

<table id="table_swj_wyc_d1c"><thead><tr><th>

Flow

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Sold product to Suspend order

</td><td>

This flow is responsible for creating a suspend order when the **Suspend** action is triggered on a sold product.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sold product to Resume order

</td><td>

This flow is responsible for creating a resume order when the **Resume** action is triggered on a sold product.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sold product to Disconnect order

</td><td>

This flow is responsible for creating a disconnect order when the **Disconnect** action is triggered on a sold product.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Add order to sold product

</td><td>

This flow is responsible for creating a sold product order when order is moved to completed.**Note:** The sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.enable\_prod\_invt\_for\_order\_management property is set to **False** by default with the Order Management \(com.sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm\) plugin. However, if the Order Management for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology \(com.sn\_om\_tmt\) plugin is installed, the property value is set to **True**.

If the property value is false, a record is created in the sold product \(sn\_install\_base\_sold\_product\) table. If the property value is true, a record is created in the Product inventory \(sn\_prd\_invt\_product\_inventory\) table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Change order to sold product

</td><td>

After an order is marked completed, this flow triggers and thus entire product hierarchy shows the updated configuration made by the customer, along with the associated pricing adjustments that were processed through the Sold Product to order flow. For more information on pricing management, see [Components installed with Pricing Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/components-installed-with-pricing-management.md).

 **Note:** The **\[sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.enable\_prod\_invt\_for\_order\_management \]**property is set to **False** by default with the Order Management \(com.sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm\) plugin. However, if the Order Management for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology \(com.sn\_om\_tmt\) plugin is installed, the property value is set to **True**.

If the property value is false, a record is created or updated in the sold product \(sn\_install\_base\_sold\_product\) table. If the property value is true, a record is created or updated in the Product inventory \(sn\_prd\_invt\_product\_inventory\) table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Suspend order to sold product

</td><td>

This flow is responsible for suspending a sold product on completion of an order.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Resume order to sold product

</td><td>

This flow is responsible for resuming a sold product on completion of an order.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Disconnect order to sold product

</td><td>

This flow is responsible for disconnecting a sold product on completion of an order.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:** If the 'sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.enable\_prod\_invt\_for\_order\_management' property is set to true, the last five flows in the displayed table are disabled.

**Note:** The back and forth flow of the data \(from a sold product to an order, an order to a sold product\) happens with the help of a set of entity configurations.

Configurations

Configurations are a set of end-to-end flows that enable the data to flow from one entity to the other. The sub-flows that are triggered with each declarative action are based on the configurations that are listed in the following table.

|Configuration|Configuration ID|Source Entity|Target Entity|
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
|Sold product to Order|sn\_l2c-cust\_flows\_sp\_to\_order|Sold product|Order|
|Order to Sold Product|sn\_l2c\_cust\_flows\_order\_to\_sp|Order|Sold product|

To learn more about the configurations, see [Entity configuration and mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/entity-configuration-and-mapping.md).
