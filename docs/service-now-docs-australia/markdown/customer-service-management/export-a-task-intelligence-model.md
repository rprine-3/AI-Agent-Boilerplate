# Export a model

Export a Task Intelligence model to another instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: ti\_admin or tia\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Task Intelligence for Customer Service** &gt; **Setup**, depending on which application and context you want to export for.

2.  In the **Models** list, select the more options menu of the model you want to export.

3.  Select **Export model**.

    A new tab opens with authentication steps.

4.  Select **Allow**.

    Your browser screen goes blank. To check that the download was successful, look at the bottom left of your browser and also check your download location to see if you have the exported model on your computer. Repeat this process for any other Task Intelligence models that you want to move to the target instance.


## Result

The browser downloads the XML file to your system.

## What to do next

You can use the XML file to transfer the model to another instance using update sets. To learn more, see [System update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets.md).
