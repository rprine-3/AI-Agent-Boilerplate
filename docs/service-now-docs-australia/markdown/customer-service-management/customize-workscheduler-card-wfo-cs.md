# Customize a Work Scheduler card using the Next Experience UI Builder

Customize the Work Scheduler card components, such as adding an extra field, or changing the color or order of a field, to display them in the Work scheduler queue.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, workspace\_admin, or ui\_builder\_admin​

## About this task

You can duplicate an existing work item variant such as an Incident, Problem, Change Request and customize it based on your needs.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  In the **My experiences** list, select **Manager Workspace**.

3.  Select the Pages icon.

4.  In the **Page** menu, select **Work scheduler**.

5.  In the left pane, go to the **Content** section and navigate to **Body \(Flex\)** &gt; **Work queue \(Flex\)** &gt; **Sidebar**.

6.  In the right pane, select the icon \(\[Omitted image "edit-card-icon.png"\] Alt text: Edit card icon\) in the **Work item cards default** sub-page.

7.  In the left pane, select **Body \(Flex\)** &gt; **Viewport1**.

8.  In the right pane, select the icon \(\[Omitted image "edit-card-icon.png"\] Alt text: Edit card icon\) next to a card, for example, **Incident default**, that you want to configure.
