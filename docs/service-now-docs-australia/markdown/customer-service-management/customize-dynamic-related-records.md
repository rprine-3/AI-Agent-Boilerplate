## About this task

The definitions for the related records aren't active by default. You must activate these definitions if you want them to appear in the related records.

Any change made to the customer service case dynamic related record context will also be applicable to all extensions of the customer service case. For creating custom context, see [Configure related record contexts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-related-record-contexts.md).

You must define an EVAM view configuration for the tables in addition to setting up Dynamic Related Records. For more information, see [Define an EVAM view configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/define-csm-evam-view-config.md).
