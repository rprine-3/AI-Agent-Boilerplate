# Remote tables and definition

Once you have the spoke custom actions working, you need to create a remote table that describes the schema for the data to be retrieved from the Salesforce Opportunity table.

Create a remote table with the following information:

-   Label: Salesforce Opportunity
-   Name: u\_st\_salesforce\_opportunity
-   Application: Global
-   Remote table: true

Create the script definition for the remote table \(u\_st\_salesforce\_opportunity\), which does the following:

-   Uses the spoke custom actions to pull data from the Opportunity table in the Salesforce instance.
-   Maps the response from Salesforce into the remote table columns.
