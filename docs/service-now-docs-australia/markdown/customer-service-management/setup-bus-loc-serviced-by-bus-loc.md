# Setting up inter-organization support

Provide your agents at a business organization \(formerly business location\) with the visibility into other business organizations that they support using the inter-organization support capability. This way, you can enable location support agents to resolve cases raised by other business organization.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Overview of inter-organization support

The Service Model Foundation enables business organizations to request help from others and fulfill such requests. Besides supporting customers, business organizations can also support other service organizations.

Currently, there’s no easy way for agents who are assigned to a specific business organization to access the details they need about other business organizations they support, such as contact information, install base items, or existing cases.

With the inter-organization support capabilities, you can enable your business organization agents to access additional details about the other business organizations they serve, facilitating quicker and more efficient support for the requesting service organization.

**Note:** You can activate this capability by enabling the business location \(com.snc.business\_location\) plugin.

## Use case

Streamlined support for national retail chains: In the retail segment, store and central support teams assist with day-to-day store operations at the market, country, or segment level. The retailers aim to structure these teams to support only the stores or franchises within their countries. For effective customer support, store agents need full access to the stores, but currently, regional support agents lack full access to the service organizations, limiting their effectiveness.

For example, a retail chain operates with more than 150 stores nationwide. Each store has its own dedicated support team for daily operations, while regional support teams provide additional assistance. However, the regional location support agents currently lack full access to the service organizations, resulting in delays and inefficiencies in addressing store issues.

With the inter-organization capability, ABC retail can:

-   Set up inter-organization support for their stores by associating each store with its regional service organization.
-   Enable regional location support agents to view context about the stores they support, including contact information, install base, and existing cases.

This way, the regional support agents can quickly access necessary information and other details, coordinate efficiently with store agents, and resolve issues more effectively. This improves overall store performance and customer satisfaction.

## Key benefits

Inter-organization support offers the following benefits:

-   Improve agent experience: Provide agents at a business organization with visibility into the other business organizations that they support.
-   Reduce resolution time: Minimize back-and-forth communication by providing key context alongside cases for service organizations.
-   Increase operational efficiency: Define support structures for service organizations through hierarchy or relationship-based criteria.
