# Install base work plans

You can create an install base work plan on the Customer Service Management application to get the details that are related to an install base item. Work plans help you to create, maintain, and view the basic details of an install base item. You can also plan for the regular and timely maintenance of the install base item.

## Overview

A work plan provides the information that you need about the regular maintenance that you must do for an install base item. You can create a work plan for a product model. All the install base items that are associated to that product model inherit the same work plan.

You assign your customer and consumer service agents with the sn\_fsm\_planned\_wm.planned\_work\_read role so that they can have read access to all the planned work management tables.

You can also create a work plan in the CRM Workspace. To create a work plan in the workspace, see [Create a work plan in Customer Service Management \(CSM\) Configurable Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-work-plans-in-workspace.md).

## Related lists for work plans

You can perform or view the maintenance operations, like device inspection and performance, for an install base item through the related lists section of the Install Base form. The following table lists the descriptions about the related lists for the work plans.
