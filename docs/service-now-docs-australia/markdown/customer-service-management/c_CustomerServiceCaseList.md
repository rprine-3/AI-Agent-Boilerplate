# Customer Service Cases list

The Cases list displays a list of customer service cases for the current user.

Users with the sn\_customerservice\_agent or sn\_customerservice\_manager roles can view the Cases list in the Customer Service Management application. The default view of the Cases list includes the following columns:

-   **Number**
-   **Short description**
-   **Contact**
-   **Account**
-   **Channel**
-   **State**
-   **Priority**
-   **Assigned to**
-   **Updated**
-   **Case Report** \(add a column to access this table if needed\)

External customers can view a list of cases from the customer portal. For external users with the sn\_customerservice.customer or sn\_customerservice.customer\_admin roles, the Cases list displays a subset of case information, including:

-   **Number**
-   **Short description**
-   **Product**
-   **Priority**
-   **State**
-   **Updated**

For external users with the sn\_customerservice.partner or sn\_customerservice.partner\_admin roles, the **Account** column is also displayed.

## Cases displayed in the Case list by user role

The cases included in the Case list are determined by user role.
