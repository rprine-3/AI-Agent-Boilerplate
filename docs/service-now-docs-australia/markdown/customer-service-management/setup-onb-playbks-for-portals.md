# Set up predefined Playbooks for Portals

Set up predefined Playbooks for Portals to provide end users with the playbook experience on your service portal.

## Overview of Playbooks

Playbooks guide users through complex processes and enable them to save their progress and resume their work when convenient. They can also get the information that they need for each stage of the flow and its associated activities with the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) playbooks on service portals.

You can activate Playbooks for Portals if you have the admin role. The base system is delivered in an inactive state. You must activate it in the Playbooks \(PAD\) for the user to see it.

Plugins required:

-   Playbooks for Customer Service Management: sn\_csm\_playbook
-   Playbook Experience: sn\_playbook\_exp
-   Case Playbook for Onboarding: sn\_onboarding \(required if you need the predefined playbook experience\)
-   Case Playbook for Product Support: sn\_product \(required if you want to use the product case playbook and record generator\)

Plugins are available from the ServiceNow® Store. For more information, see [Playbook plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/setting-up-csm-playbooks.md).
