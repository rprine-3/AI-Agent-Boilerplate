# Create additional consumer addresses

Consumers can have multiple addresses, including one primary address.

## Before you begin

Role required: One of the following roles:

-   sn\_crm\_consumer\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_consumer\_relationship\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_admin
-   sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent
-   sn\_customerservice\_manager
-   admin

## About this task

The primary address is stored in the Primary Address tab of the consumer form within the **Addresses** related list. When you fill in the fields in the Primary Address tab and select **Submit**, this information is added to the **Addresses** related list as the primary address, with the **Primary** field set to true. Any changes made to the **Primary Address** fields are also updated in the related list. A consumer can have only one primary address.

Other addresses, such as billing or shipping addresses, can be created and stored in the **Addresses** related list. For these other addresses, the **Primary** field is set to **false**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Customer** &gt; **Consumers**.

2.  Select the number of the desired consumer.

3.  In the **Addresses** related list, select **New**.

4.  Fill in the fields on the Location form.

5.  To denote this address as the primary address for the consumer, enable the **Primary** check box.

    A consumer can have multiple addresses but only one primary address.

6.  Select **Submit**.
