# Import queues

Import queues from your contact center provider to ensure that customer interactions are routed to the appropriate agents based on their skills and availability.

Role required: admin \(sn\_ct\_ctr\_it\_core\)

Follow these steps in the workflow to import queues from your selected contact center:

-   **Step 1: Select queues**

    Identify the queues that you want to import from your selected contact center provider.

-   **Step 2: Assign channels**

    Select queues, assign service channels to them, and import them into ServiceNow.

-   **Step 3: View summary**

    Review the newly imported queues and the ones that existed before in your ServiceNow instance.


**Note:** The **Start Over** button resets your current changes and takes you back to the **Select queues** step.

## Select queues

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Contact Center Integration Center** &gt; **Contact Center Admin Console**.
2.  Select a contact center provider to import queues from the dropdown menu for the **Select a provider** field.

    **Note:** The contact center dropdown menu appears only when multiple providers are configured. If you have just one provider, it's automatically selected and can't be changed.

3.  Select the **Import Queues** tab from the navigation pane.

5.  Once you’ve fetched a set of queues, select the queues you plan to import by selecting the check box next to each queue.

    **Note:** You can also select all queues by selecting the check box at the top of the list.

6.  Select each queue that you want to import and click **Continue**.
7.  Proceed to the next step of assigning service channels for your selected queues.

4.  Repeat steps \(1\) through \(3\) and confirm that all queues have at least one service channel assigned to them.
5.  Select **Import** to begin the import process.

    **Note:** Each pairing of a new queue and service channel creates a unique queue record in ServiceNow.
