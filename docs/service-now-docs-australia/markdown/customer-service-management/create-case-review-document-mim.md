# Create a post case review for a major case

Create a post case review document for a resolved major case that captures the configured case information.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_manager, sn\_majorissue\_mgt.major\_issue\_manager, or admin

## About this task

You can create a post case review document for a resolved major case if the **sn\_customerservice.parent\_child\_case\_sync** is set to true.

**Note:** Setting this property to true disables the **Create Post Case Review** UI action for child cases.

## Procedure

1.  Open a major case in the **Resolved** state.

2.  Complete steps 2 through 7 in the [Create a post case review](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-case-review-document.md) topic.

3.  Select one of the following options.

</td><td>

The system performs the following actions:1.  Syncs the child case PCR record with the parent case PCR record. \(If the child case PCR record is not present, the system creates a new child case PCR record.\) The following fields are synced:
    -   Assigned To
    -   Case Digest Configuration
    -   Short Description
    -   Root Cause Analysis
    -   Solution Provided
    -   Summary
    -   Symptoms
    -   Preventive Measures Taken
    -   Commitment Date
    -   Assignment Group
    -   State
    -   Approval Users
2.  Generates a PDF document for all of the child case PCR records with customer-specific information.
3.  Adds a link to the PCR document to the **Additional Comments** field on the child case form.
