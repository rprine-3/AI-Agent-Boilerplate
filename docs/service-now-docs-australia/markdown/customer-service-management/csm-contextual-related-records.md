# Dynamic related records

Display related records in the Contextual side panel in CRM Workspace that dynamically change based on the context of the current record or playbook activity.

The dynamic related records feature provides customer service agents with easy access to the information they need when they need it. Agents can view related records in the Contextual side panel without navigating away from the current tab and searching for information in other related lists. This feature also enables users to display related records without requiring any type of reference or parent-child relationship.

Different types of agents can use dynamic related records to see different information. For example:

-   A front-line agent creating a new case can see similar, recently opened cases.
-   A middle-office agent reviewing a complaint case can see active contracts for the customer.
-   A back-office agent can view emails for a selected playbook activity.

To view related records, click the Related Records tab in the Contextual side panel in CRM Workspace. Records appear in the Related Records list as read-only cards.

## Configuring dynamic related records

System administrators can configure the dynamic related records feature and define the following information:

-   Context records that specify the type of record for which related records are displayed, such as a case record or a playbook activity. A context can also specify any conditions for the record type that must be met in order for related records to be displayed.
-   Definitions for each specific type of related record to display, such as SLAs or contracts.
-   Relationships between context records and their associated definition records.

System administrators can also configure the related record card format. For more information, see [Configuring dynamic related records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/dynamic-related-records-configure.md).

## Using dynamic related records

Agents can search the Related Records list by entering text in the search field or filter the list to display records of a specific type, such as SLAs or active customer contracts. Agents can expand a card to show more a more detailed view or open the list in a sub-tab. If agents have create permission, they can also create new related records of the selected type.

For more information about these agent actions, see [Using the Related Records tab in the contextual side panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/using-dynamic-related-records.md).
