# Create a post case review

Create a post case review document for a resolved case that captures the configured case information.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent, sn\_customerservice\_manager, or admin

## About this task

You can create post case review documents for customer service product cases that are in the **Resolved** state. Creating a review document is a multi-step process that involves:

-   Creating a post case review record from a case.
-   Previewing the generated review document and making any corrections.
-   Requesting approval, if necessary.
-   Publishing the review document so that it is available to customers, internal stake holders, or both.

You can create one post case review document per case. If this document has already been created, the **Create Post Case Review** menu option is not available. You can view and edit the post case review document from the Related Records form section.

If a case is closed while the post case review is in progress, you can still update the **Additional comments** field on the Case form with the Post Case Review document link. When the case is closed, the system displays a message about the case closure on the Post Case Review form.

## Procedure

1.  Open a customer service case in the **Resolved** state.

2.  To create a post case review record, do one of the following:

    -   Agent Workspace: Click the More UI Actions icon \(\[Omitted image "agent-workspace-more-ui-actions-icon.jpg"\] Alt text: More UI Actions icon.\) and select **Create Post Case Review**.
    -   Platform interface: Click the form context menu icon and select **Create Post Case Review**.
3.  In the Post Case Review form, enter any necessary information in the following fields.

    You can edit the content in the Post Case Review record if the state is **New** or **In Progress**. Clicking **Preview** creates a preview of the document with the latest record information.

    3.  Click **Request Approval**.

    You can request approval for a post case review document before sharing it with customers or internal stake holders. When approval is requested, the status of the post case review moves to **Awaiting Approval** and the record is locked for edits.

    An email is sent to the approvers with a link to the post case review document. The approvers can either approve the document or suggest changes by adding them to the **Work notes** field on the Post Case Review record. The agent receives a notification when an approver approves the case review document or suggests changes.

    -   If the approver suggests changes, the agent can see the changes in the **Work notes** field.
    -   If the approver approves the document, the status of the post case review record changes to **Approved**.

8.  Click **Publish to Case** to update the case with the Post Case Review document.

    The document is included as a link in the **Additional comments** field on the Case form. If the document is available to customers, the link is visible from the Customer and Consumer Service Portals.
