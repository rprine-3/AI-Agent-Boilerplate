# Configuring service definitions

Create service definitions for the types of services required to support your products. Associate different features such as case types, playbooks, and record producers with service definitions so that customers can request the services they need and agents can create cases of the right type to support those services.

System administrators can use the service definitions feature to define the services that are offered to customers and connect those services to products, case types, playbooks, and catalog items.
