# Actionable case flows

Actionable case flows contain predefined user actions that automatically create and resolve blocking tasks for customer service cases.

The Case Action Status plugin provides several actionable case flows that create and resolve blocking tasks for different case-related actions. These flows are enabled by default. If you don't want to create blocking tasks for a specific action, disable the associated flow.

To view these flows, navigate to **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Actionable Case Flows**.

## Flow Designer actions

Case flows use the following predefined Flow Designer actions:

-   Add Blocking Task
-   Inactivate Blocking Task
-   Set Needs Attention Flag

## Flows for problem records associated with a case

If a problem is associated with a case with the **Need task resolution** blocking reason, a case flow is provided to resolve the blocking task when a fix is communicated or the problem record is closed or cancelled.

If a problem is associated with a case with the **Need PRB workaround** blocking reason, a case flow is provided to resolve the blocking task when a workaround is provided or the problem record is closed or cancelled.
