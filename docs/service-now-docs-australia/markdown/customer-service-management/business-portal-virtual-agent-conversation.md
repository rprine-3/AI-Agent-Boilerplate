# Get help using virtual agent conversations from Business Portal

Predefined Customer Service Virtual Agent chatbot conversations help customers complete common self-service tasks, such as getting help with a product or checking the status of a case.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.customer, sn\_customerservice.consumer

If you’re anonymous \(not logged in to the application\), get help by entering keywords for an issue and choose to get transferred to a live agent.

Install the plugin Customer Service Virtual Agent Conversations \(ID: com.sn\_csm.virtualagent\) to view the chatbot topics.

A user with a proxy\_contact role can also check the case status for a customer.

## About this task

The information exchanged during the conversation flow \(user inputs and bot responses\) enables the chatbot to fulfill a user request or assist a user in completing a task. If the user has a question or an issue with an existing product or order, the virtual agent searches the keyword and displays relevant knowledge articles. If no relevant articles are found, it creates a case. Predefined NLU chatbot topics assess user intent and provide the best response based on the conversation context.

ServiceNow NLU enables discovery of the chatbot topics based on either the keywords entered in the chat or the user-intent and matches an entity with the user input. It also makes the entity available to the topic if there’s a match.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the business portal.

2.  Select **Chat**.

    You can select **Show Me Everything** to display all available topics or enter keywords to narrow down the results to relevant topics.

3.  If you’re a logged-in user, enter keywords to get help on a case, an issue, or an order.

    -   If NLU is enabled, it guides you through the right topic based on the utterance.
    -   If NLU isn’t enabled, it displays topics based on the match for the entered keywords. You can make a selection from all available topics displayed.
    **Note:** Contact your administrator to determine whether the topics are NLU-enabled.

4.  Use
