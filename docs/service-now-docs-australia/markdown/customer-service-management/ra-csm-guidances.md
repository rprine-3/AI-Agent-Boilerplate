# Guidances in Recommended Actions

A guidance is an action that an agent can take or information that an agent can share as they work to resolve tasks, such as customer service cases.

Guidances appear as cards in the contextual side panel in a workspace. Agents can access these guidance cards by selecting the Recommended Actions icon in the contextual side panel. Agents can then perform the actions by selecting a button on a card.

Guidances include actions such as sharing a knowledge article, creating a case task or a work order, or copying the resolution notes from a similar case. For a detailed list of guidances, see the following table.

</table>## Attaching and sharing knowledge articles

Agents can use two different guidances to view and attach knowledge articles to task records and chat interaction records and share articles with customers.

</table>## Configuring Recommended Actions guidances

Recommended Actions is a component that you can add to a record page in [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder-overview.md). You can find information about configuring the Recommended Actions component, including the properties and events, in the [Next Experience Components](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/rome/components) documentation.

The Recommended Actions component includes two views: a preview view \(card view\) and a detail view \(full article view\). How these views are displayed is determined by the Recommended Actions configuration. For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Create a guidance in Recommended Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidances-create.md)
-   [Configure a guidance preview experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidance-configure-preview.md)
-   [Customize a guidance preview experience in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customize-ra-preview-experience.md)
-   [Customize a guidance detail view in U Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customize-ra-detail-experience.md)

The Recommended Actions component includes **Recommended Action Specific Configuration** property. Users with the administrator role can use this property to configure the following settings:

-   Select which type of experience to uptake on a record page: modal or modeless dialog.
-   Select which of the guidance actions to show or hide.
-   Order the guidance actions to determine the primary action \(displayed as a button on the guidance card\) and secondary actions \(displayed on the overflow menu\).

The **Recommended Action Specific Configuration** property is available in the Configure tab of the Recommended Actions component and includes expandable sections for each guidance.

## Access to internal field values for predicted records

When accessing data for a predicted record within the Recommended Actions framework, the system provides the internal field values, in addition to display values, through standard guidance inputs. The system does so without requiring data brokers or custom scripts. By enabling direct access to internal values, the framework can support more complex logic, reduce performance bottlenecks, and verify consistent UI behavior across languages.

For catalog items:

-   When the catalog item type field is used in a catalog item prediction, the system returns the internal value \(for example, the catalog item or order guide\) along with the sys\_id.
-   When the catalog item type field is accessed in a translated environment, the system relies on the internal field value instead of the display value to verify the language settings do not affect condition fulfillment.

For custom guidances based on the incident state:

-   When custom guidance logic is applied to a predicted incident with a specified state, the system accesses the internal value of the incident’s state field directly.
-   When the state field is required for custom actions like linking an incident as a parent or copying resolution notes, the internal value should be accessible without causing UI performance issues or delays.
