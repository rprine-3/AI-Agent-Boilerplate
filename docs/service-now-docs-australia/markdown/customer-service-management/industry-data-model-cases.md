# Service Model Foundation cases

Location agents and location consumer agents at a business organization \(formerly business location\) can create cases for accounts, contacts, consumers, and households.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

Staff members with the location agent or location consumer agent role can do the following:

-   View information for the customers at their location.
-   Create cases for the accounts, contacts, households, and consumers.
-   Update cases created at their location.
-   Create consumers.

## Case location

A case belongs to a business organization \(formerly business location\). When a case is created by a location agent or manager, the **Service Organization** field on the Case form is automatically updated with the business organization to which the agent or manager belongs. If the case is reassigned, this field is updated to that of the new agent or manager.

If the location agent or manager belongs to multiple locations, the **Service Organization** field can be kept empty. When you fill in this field, select carefully as the service organization controls a location agent's access to cases.

**Note:** A case can belong to only one business organization.

The **Service Organization** can be set manually for a new case or changed for an existing case. Changing the **Service Organization** doesn’t change the assigned agent.

## Case access

Case access is controlled by the business organization in the **Service Organization** field on the Case form. The following users can access cases:

-   Staff members at the business organization with the location agent or location consumer agent role.
-   Managers at the business organization with the location manager role.

Cases for a business organization are added to the Cases related list on the internal or external organization \(formerly internal or external business location\) form.

-   When a case is created, the service organization on the case is the service organization of the user who creates the case.
-   When a case is assigned to an agent, the service organization on the case is updated to the service organization of the assigned agent.

**Note:** Only external staff with the location agent can act as fulfillers. For more information, see [External Organization as a fulfiller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ebl-as-a-fulfiller.md).
