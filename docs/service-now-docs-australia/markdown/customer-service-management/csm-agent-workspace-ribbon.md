# CRM Workspace form ribbon and components

The form ribbon provides includes components that display relevant information about a case and provide agents with a quick overview of the case details. These components can include a contact or consumer summary, a timeline, and SLA details.

In addition to viewing case information, agents can use links in the ribbon components to place phone calls or create email messages. Agents can also show or hide the ribbon as needed by clicking a button at the top of the ribbon.

## Customer Service Management ribbon components

For Customer Service Management, you can configure the ribbon for the Case form to include one or more of the available ribbon components:

-   Customer 360
-   Timeline
-   Active SLAs
-   Time to resolve component

## Customer 360 ribbon component

The Customer 360 component displays customer information such as the contact or consumer name, email address, and phone numbers.

The timeline uses icons to display events and colors to show ranges of time, such as when the case is with the agent or the customer. Agents can point to event icons in the timeline to display tooltips with additional information.

**Note:** The timeline component uses the resolution shaper configuration for the selected entity table, for example, the Case table.

</table>## Active SLA component

The Active SLA component displays active SLAs for the case, including time remaining, the SLA state, and any breaches. If a case has multiple SLAs, the SLA with the most imminent deadline is shown first. Pointing to the SLA component displays left and right navigation arrows that agents can use to view the other SLAs.

\[Omitted image "SLARibbonComponent.jpg"\] Alt text: SLA ribbon displaying the time remaining for the SLA. For the color code description, refer to the text that follows.

Color coding within the component indicates the time remaining for the SLA:

-   Green: 0–50%
-   Yellow: 50–75%
-   Orange: 75–99%
-   Red: 100% or breached

## Time to resolve component

The time to resolve component displays the estimated time required for an agent to resolve the case.

**Note:** The time to resolve component requires the Predictive Intelligence for Customer Service Management plugin \(com.snc.csm\_ml\). For more information, see [Estimated time to resolve a case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ettr.md).

\[Omitted image "time-to-resolve.jpg"\] Alt text: Ribbon component displaying the estimated time required by an agent to resolve a case.

In this image, the estimated time that the agent will need to resolve the opened case is 0 to 2 days. Hence, the upper bound value is displayed. The estimated time is calculated from the time the case was created. If the range for example, is between 2 to 4 days, both the lower and upper bound values are displayed.

The **Time to resolve** component also displays the prediction for SLA breach if the case is attached to an SLA.

Following are a list of SLA messages displayed and the action required when they appear.

|SLA messages|Task|
|------------|----|
|No resolution SLA exists for this case|Set the value in the **Target** field to **Resolution** in the **SLA Definition** form.|
|Repair resolution SLA to add breach time|Click **Repair** on the Task SLA form.|
|Highly likely to breach resolution SLA|None|
|Highly unlikely to breach resolution SLA|None|
|Likely to breach resolution SLA|None|
|Unlikely to breach resolution SLA|None|

## Configuring ribbon components

For CRM Workspace, you can create a ribbon setting and add that setting to a ribbon configuration. For more information, see [Set up a ribbon configuration in CRM Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-config-ws-ribbon.md).

**Note:** One ribbon configuration, **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace Ribbon Config**, is included with CRM Workspace.

You can also display the form ribbon in the form ribbon in the Contextual side panel. For more information, see [Display the form ribbon and form header secondary values in the Contextual side panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-csm-display-header-in-sidebar.md).
