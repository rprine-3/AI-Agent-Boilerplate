# Setting up products and available services at a business organization

By setting up the relationships between organizations and users in the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application, your organization can associate the products and services with the service organization \(SO\)\). The SO staff can address the customer queries about the products and services at a business organization \(formerly business location\) and even raise a case on the behalf of their customers.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).
