# Create a guidance in the Core UI

Create a guidance in the Core UI so that you can link the guidance to the guidance node of a decision tree. For example, your agent may attach a knowledge article or propose a solution to a customer to help resolve an issue.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_gd\_guidance.guidance\_manager

## About this task

The preview information appears on the Recommended Actions card in the contextual side panel. The preview experience is applicable only for Recommended Actions, where agents can see previews of recommendations before launching them.

Playbooks don’t have a preview experience because decision trees are embedded and considered launched already in playbooks.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Guided Decisions** &gt; **Guidances**.

2.  Create a guidance.

    1.  Select **New** in the Guidances list.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_pkc_2xq_52c"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Action available to multiple users

</td><td>

Makes the guidance available to multiple agents working on the case.When this option isn’t selected, only one agent can work on any guidance. When the first agent works on the guidance and the state is In-progress, Completed, or Error, the other agents can't see this guidance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow users to re-run the guidance

</td><td>

Enables agents to go back to the previous node, edit the previous nodes, or re-execute the guidance in the runtime experience of a decision tree.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Hide completed guidance

</td><td>

Hides the guidance recommended for a case resolution.In other words, the completed guidance in the View my response section of a Decision Tree is not displayed for the agent.

**Note:** This field is visible only when the Guided Decision Experience plugin is installed. You may need to configure the form to add this field.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    3.  Select **Submit**.

3.  Open the guidance that you want to update.

4.  Create one or more inputs for the guidance.

    Inputs are the variables or information that the system needs to perform the guidance. You can use inputs in multiple places such as the guidance preview experience and the guidance actions.

    1.  In the Guidance Input tab, select **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_gzc_lc3_q2c"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    3.  Select **Submit**.

5.  Create one or more outputs for the guidance.

    Outputs are the desired result of the guidance action. For example, if a guidance action creates a case task, the output of that action can return a reference to the case task that was created.

    1.  In the Guidance Output tab, select **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

            You can drill down to find the specific input you want.\[Omitted image "ra-csm-guidance-preview-title.png"\] Alt text: Guidance input details for a predicted knowledge base article that references a user table with fields showing the published date, rating, article retiring date, roles, and short description.

7.  Select **Submit**.
