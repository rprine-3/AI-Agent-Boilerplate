# CSM voice interaction record page

The CSM voice interaction record page provides a component that customers can use for integration with Contact Center as a Service \(CCaaS\) providers and an interface that agents can use to handle customer phone calls.

\[Omitted image "voice-interaction-record-page.png"\] Alt text: CSM voice interaction record page with the Interaction Controls Component and Customer History component displayed in the side panel.

The CSM voice interaction record page enables CCaaS providers to display native voice integrations in CRM Workspace. Using CCaaS call controls integrated in the page, agents can do the following:

-   Accept calls directly from the agent inbox.
-   Manage call transfers and conferences.
-   Place calls on hold and on mute.

For more information about the integration with CCaaS providers, see [Interaction Controls Component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/contact-center-integration-with-icc.md) and [OpenFrame configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md).

## Page structure

The CSM voice interaction record page is made up of two different pages:

-   CSM voice interaction record page
-   Interaction control page

The pages appear together and are visible to agents for phone interactions when the [OpenFrame configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md) is enabled.

The Interaction control page appears in the left panel and includes the following components:

-   [Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md): Enables CCaaS providers to display native voice integrations.
-   [Customer History component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md): Displays customer, consumer, or account history information, depending on the customer information provided on the interaction record.
-   [Live call transcript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md): Displays the text of the call transcript when a conversation record is present for the interaction.

    **Note:** A live call transcript requires additional configuration.


The CSM voice interaction record page includes the following components:

-   Interaction form
-   [Action bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md)
-   [Contextual side panel component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md)

## Plugin

The CSM voice interaction record page template and page variant are included with the CSM Configurable Workspace application \(com.snc.uib.csm\_agent\_workspace\).

The CSM voice interaction record page template and page variant are available to users when the Interaction Controls Component plugin \(com.app\_interaction\_control\) is installed.

The Interaction Controls Component plugin has the following dependencies:

-   com.app\_openframe\_store
-   com.sn\_component\_workspace\_openframe

## CSM voice interaction record template

The CSM voice interaction record template enables customers to create voice interaction record page variants and customize them as needed. This template includes customizable views for different CCaaS providers as well as real-time updates and notifications.

Record pages and page variants created with this template enable agents to manage phone calls with customers and external users and to display information that helps agents to resolve issues. Use this template to customize and extend CSM functionality around phone interaction management. Additionally, you can configure a CCaaS provider to integrate features such as call transcript.

## CSM voice interaction record page variant

The CSM voice interaction record page variant is included with the CSM Configurable Workspace plugin and has a dependency on the Interaction Controls Component plugin. This page variant is available for users with the interaction controls enabled. For more information, see [OpenFrame configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md).

</table>## Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\)

The Interaction Controls Component appears at the top of the left panel of the CSM voice interaction record page. This component enables CCaaS providers to display native voice integrations. Agents can then use the component to manage customer calls directly from their inbox.

The CSM voice interaction record page with the ICC component is displayed when the following conditions are met:

-   The interaction is of type phone.
-   The **Enable interaction controls** field on the OpenFrame Configuration record is enabled.
-   The agent belongs to the **User Group** selected on the OpenFrame Configuration record.
    -   If a user group is selected on the configuration record, only agents belonging to that group can see the CSM voice interaction record page.
    -   If no group is selected, all agents can see the CSM voice interaction record page.

This feature uses the Interaction table, which includes a reference to the Callback \[sys\_cs\_callback\] table. The Callback table, in turn, references the Callback Context table.

For more information about the integration with CCaaS providers, see the following topics:

-   [Interaction Controls Component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/contact-center-integration-with-icc.md)
-   [OpenFrame configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-native-voice-record-page.md)

## Callback actions component

The Callback actions component appears at the top of the left panel on the CSM voice interaction record page when it’s associated with a callback task. Agents can use this component to manage customer callback requests directly from the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace.

**Note:** Prerequisite for CCaaS callbacks: Verify that agents are configured through their contact center integration to receive callbacks and access the ServiceNow Workspace. Agent profiles are synced automatically when agents log in through the contact center connector in OpenFrame. For example, an agent must be able to log in to both the contact center and ServiceNow workspace. The agent presence state must match between both systems, as callbacks only route to available agents. In some cases, the state "available" might be labeled differently in the contact center, such as "on queue." Presence mismatches can prevent agents from receiving callbacks.

The callback actions component contains:

-   Callback number drop-down: Contains a list of all the contact numbers of the customer.
-   Timer: Displays the time remaining before auto-dialing the number selected in the drop-down or automatically closing the task.
-   Call number button: Enables you to call the number in the drop-down.
-   Retry call: Enables you to redial the customer number when the customer doesn’t answer the call.
-   Close the callback button: Enables you to wrap up callback interactions.
-   Enables you to transfer an ASAP or Scheduled callback to another queue or agent before the call to the customer begins. For more information, see [Manage a CCaaS callback request in the Configurable Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ccaas-address-callback-requests.md).

\[Omitted image "Tranfer\_callback\_button.png"\] Alt text: The CCaaS callback actions component displays a callback number drop-down, timer, and Transfer callback, call number, and close callback buttons.

\[Omitted image "Transfer\_callback\_sub\_component.png"\] Alt text: The CCaaS callback sub-component displays queues and agents list.

\[Omitted image "Cancel\_callback\_transfer.png"\] Alt text: Cancel callback transfer buttons to cancel the callback transfer

## Callback context card

The CSM voice interaction record page includes the Callback context card at the center of the page.

The callback context card is displayed when an interaction record has a linked callback task.

\[Omitted image "callback-context-card-new.png"\] Alt text: The callback card displays the customer-related information, including the reason for the call, the callback type source channel, and more.

The callback context card includes the following information:

-   Name
-   Reason for the call
-   Callback type: Scheduled or ASAP
-   Scheduled start time
-   Source channel \(visible only in case of CCaaS callback\)
-   Queue \(visible only in case of CCaaS callback\)
-   IVR Path \(visible only in case of CCaaS callback\)
-   Callback Task
-   Callback context

    **Note:** This field is visible in both the native and CCaaS callback environments when relevant information exists.

-   Agent scheduled callback

    **Note:** This field is visible in both the native and CCaaS callback environments when relevant information exists.


**Note:** The Callback Task field is turned off by default.

In UI Builder, the callback context card is configured to use the [Lookup component](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/next-experience/components?&query=&order_by=nameAsc&limit=120&offset=0&categories[]=uib_component&categories[]=uib_macroponent-component&categories[]=uib_facades), which can be used to look up a record on any table in card format. It also uses a data resource that returns the callback task for the specific interaction.

For more information about the callback feature, see the following topics:

## Customer History component

The Customer History component appears below the Interaction Controls Component in the left panel. This component is included with the [Customer Central](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-central.md) plugin, which is activated as part of the CRM Workspace application.

The Customer History component includes the **Customer** tab. This tab displays customer, consumer, or account history information, depending on the customer information provided on the interaction record. This tab also includes a search field, filter, and date range selector that agents can use to find specific information in the history.
