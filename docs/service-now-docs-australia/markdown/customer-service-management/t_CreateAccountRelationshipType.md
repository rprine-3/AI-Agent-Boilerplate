# Create an account relationship type

Create an account relationship type by defining the types of source and target accounts and providing a name for the relationship between these accounts.

## Before you begin

Role required: One of the following roles:

-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_admin
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_account\_relationship\_data\_manager,
-   admin

## About this task

Use the following steps to create an account relationship type.

You can edit an existing account relationship type by changing the types of source and target accounts and the name of the relationship that exists between these accounts. If that account relationship type is being used by any account relationship records, the **Relationship** and **Reverse relationship** fields in those records are automatically updated.

You can also delete an existing account relationship type.

-   If there are no account relationship records that use the account relationship type, then it’s deleted.
-   If there are active account relationship records that use the account relationship type, an attempt to delete that relationship type results in a warning message. Deleting an account relationship type also deletes the relationship records based on that type.

Account relationship types can be set to inactive at any time.

## Procedure
