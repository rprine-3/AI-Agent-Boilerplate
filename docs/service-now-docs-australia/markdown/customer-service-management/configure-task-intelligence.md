# Configure Task Intelligence for Customer Service

Install the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application and configure the different features: record categorization, language detection, Sentiment Analysis, and Document Intelligence for Customer Service.

## Install and configure Task Intelligence features

Complete the following tasks to install Task Intelligence for Customer Service and configure the features.

|Task|Description|
|----|-----------|
|[Install the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/install-task-intelligence-cs-app.md)|You can install the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application \(com.snc.csm\_ml\_task\) if you have the admin role.|
|[Configure record categorization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/case-categorization-configure.md)|Activate the required plugins and import training data. Then you can create and train a model to predict field values.|
|[Configure Sentiment Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/case-sentiment-analysis-configure.md)|Activate the required plugins, enable the sentiment analysis property, and assign roles. Then you can train a model to predict case sentiment.|
|[Configure language detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/case-language-detection-configure.md)|Activate the required plugins and the ServiceNow translator to use the language detection feature. Then you can set up a model to detect the case language.|
|[Configure Document Intelligence for Customer Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-doc-intel-configuring-.md)|Enable Document Intelligence for Customer Service and create use cases to extract data.|

## Set up and deploy Task Intelligence models

Once you have completed the configuration tasks, you can use the Task Intelligence Admin Console to set up and deploy models for record categorization, sentiment analysis, and language detection. You can also use the Task Intelligence Admin Console to access the Document Intelligence Admin interface, which you can use to create document processing use cases.
