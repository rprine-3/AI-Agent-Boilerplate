# Customer data

Customer data for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) consists of information about people who aren’t part of your organization, including accounts, contacts, consumers, and households.

## Different entities within Customer Data

-   **Accounts**

    An account is a customer or a partner who sells to and supports other customers. Accounts can be customer accounts, partner accounts, or both, and their information is stored in the Account \[customer\_account\] table.

    **Note:** Starting with the Australia release, the following fields are added to the Customer Account \(customer\_account\) table to improve business identification and record management:

    -   DUNS Number - Store the Data Universal Numbering System \(DUNS\) identifier for your business accounts to support data enrichment and third-party integrations.
    -   Active - Indicates whether an account record is currently active for filtering and workflow purposes.
    There are two types of accounts: customer accounts and partner accounts.

    -   A partner is a supported external customer that sells to and supports other customers. A partner can report and manage cases on behalf of customers. A partner can also be a customer.
    -   An account can be a customer account, a partner account, or both. The **Customer** and **Partner** fields on the Account form denote the account type.
-   **Contacts**

    A contact is an employee of an account and can be associated with only one account. Contacts can have multiple assets and service contracts and can log in to the Customer Service Portal.

    Contact information is stored in the Contact \[customer\_contact\] table.

-   **Consumers**

    In the business-to-consumer \(B2C\) model, consumers are customers, and their information is stored in the Consumer \[csm\_consumer\] table.

-   **Households**

    A household is a group of consumers who live at the same address and share products and services. A household can have a designated head of household and multiple current members. The head of household has access to all cases and information for the other household members.

    Household information is stored in the Household \[csm\_household\] table.


## Granular administrative roles for Customer Data Foundation \(CDF\)

Implemented new administrative roles that provide fine-grained access control across Customer Data Foundation \(CDF\). These roles can be assigned to administrators and other personas based on job functions and security requirements. It includes the following enhancements:

-   Added 25 new admin roles with specific read, write, create, and delete permissions.
-   Updated "Before you begin" sections across all Customer Data Foundation configuration topics with role prerequisites.
-   Enhanced security compliance through role-based access segregation.
