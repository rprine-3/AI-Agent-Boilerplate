</table>Other notable limitations:

-   The Launch Interactive Analysis option in the Case list form context menu isn’t functional.
-   Related cases can’t be accessed from the related search results on the Case.

However, with an external organization as a fulfiller, the external location agents can:

-   Access Service Model Foundation data, such as internal organization, external organization, organization members \(formerly service organization members\), and responsibilities, on the platform.
-   Access customer foundation data, including accounts, contacts, sold products, and install base items on the platform.
-   Access the case form on the platform.
-   Self-assign and start working on a case.
-   View related search results.
-   Add comments or work notes.
-   View the activity stream, work notes, and case timelines.
-   Add resolution notes, propose a solution, and close the case.
-   Create and update case tasks.
-   View service definitions.
