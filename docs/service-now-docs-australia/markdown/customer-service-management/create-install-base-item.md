# Create an install base item

Create an install base item in the Customer Service Management application that represents the instance of the product that has been configured for a customer. The install base item enables you to track all the purchases that were made by a customer.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the Customer Service Install Base Management plugin \(com.snc.install\_base\) is installed.

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_manager or admin

## About this task

An install base item is any configuration item \(CI\) that has been made accessible to customers. For SaaS \(Software as a Service\) products, an install base item refers to an application service configuration item. Each install base item references the configuration item record for the customer. If issues arise with a configuration item, customer service agents can trace which install base items the case is affecting.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Products** &gt; **Install Base Items**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
