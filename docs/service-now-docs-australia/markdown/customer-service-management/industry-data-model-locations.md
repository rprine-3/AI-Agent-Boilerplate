# Service Model Foundation business organizations

Use the business organization \(formerly business location\) entity to create an organizational structure that includes internal and external organizations \(formerly internal and external business locations\) such as stores, branches, franchises, and dealerships.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

A business organization is an extension of a service organization. The business organization entity enables you to model the internal and external organizational structure involved in supporting customers. It also enables you to give agents the correct level of visibility into customer data.

With the business organization entity you can:

-   Create internal and external organizations \(formerly internal and external business locations\) using a hierarchy, with parent and child locations.
-   Associate users within a business organization, which makes them staff members of that location.
-   Provide staff members at a business organization with access to the customer cases and information for that location.
-   Create teams of staff members to support accounts, consumers, and households.
-   Provide the staff members on those teams with access that enables them to manage cases for their accounts, consumers, and households.

## Creating a business organization

Maintain an organizational structure by creating internal and external organizations . To create a business organization \(formerly business location\), see [Create a business organization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-business-location.md).

## Accessing business organizations

Managers have access to their business organization and to the business locations that are designated as child locations in the hierarchy.

When a user is added to the **Manager** field, the sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager role is automatically added to that user. You can also add a user as the manager for multiple business organizations.

Staff members with the location agent role or location consumer agent role can perform the following actions:

-   Create cases for customers in their business locations.
-   Access cases where the location in the **Service Organization** field on the Case form matches their business locations.
