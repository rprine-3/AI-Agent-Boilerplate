# Configure product data

Configure product data including product models, sold products, install base items and installed products.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

-   **Product models:** A product is a type of good or service that your company sells and supports. Product models identify different types of products, such as service, hardware, software, or consumables.

    **Note:** Product models require the Model Management plugin \(com.snc.model\).

-   **Sold products:** The products and components that have been sold to an account or a consumer.
-   **Install base items:** Items that represent the instances that have been installed or provisioned for a customer.
-   **Installed products:** Provide information on the sold products and how they are deployed or installed. Use installed products to create an association between sold products and install base items.
