# View product information from the Customer Service Portal

View a list of products to track the products or services sold to your account and manage your services using service catalogs.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.customer, sn\_customerservice.customer\_admin, sn\_customerservice.partner, or sn\_customerservice.partner\_admin

## About this task

You can view a list of products or services that have been sold to your account. You can also view any cases created on the product and all active contracts and entitlements for the product.

**Note:** When the Customer Data Models for B2B2C plugin installed, contacts are able to access the list of sold products belonging to account consumers.

An entitlement is active if:

-   Its end date is not in the past or it has no end date.
-   The contract it is linked to is also active.

A contract is active if:

-   Its state is set to active
-   It is linked to a product with an active entitlement.

You can modify the **Active Entitlements** widget to define your own filters for active entitlements.

If product catalog items have been set up in your instance, you can use the **Service Catalogs** widget to view context-sensitive service catalogs based on the services you are subscribed to. Extend your services using service catalogs and request additional items on the services you have subscribed to.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Customer Service homepage.

2.  Click **Support** &gt; **Products** in the header menu.

    The system displays a list of products or services sold to your account.

3.  Click a product to view the details and any cases created on the product in the last 30 days.

4.  View all active contracts and entitlements for the sold product.

5.  You can also create a case directly from the product details.

6.  View all catalog items associated to sold products and request additional services, as required.
