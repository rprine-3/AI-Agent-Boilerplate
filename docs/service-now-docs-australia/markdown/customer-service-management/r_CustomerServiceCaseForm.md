# Case form

The Case form displays detailed information about a customer issue or problem.

A customer service agent creates a case to identify a customer's question or issue and to track the activities related to resolving the issue. An agent also uses a case to track communication to and from the customer, including the communication channels being used.

Case activities include any action that is taken to resolve an issue. This can include phone calls or emails, knowledge base research, conversations with subject matter experts, and dispatch requests to field service agents, as well as other activities.

From the Case form, an agent can associate and store the related information, such as the customer's name, phone number, and company; account information; product and asset information; service contract and entitlement details, and any associated service level agreements \(SLAs\).

There are several key features to a case.

-   Communication between an agent and the customer or an agent and other employees within the organization. Details of all internal and external communication are recorded on the Case form.
-   Any additional tasks that result from a case, such as a work order. Tasks are tracked from a related list on the Case form. These tasks may be internal to the organization or they may involve the customer.
-   Information from the case that can be included in the knowledge base and used to help resolve other cases.

There are two different Case form views: a detailed view that is available to agents and agent managers in the Customer Service Management application and a simplified view that is available to external customers from the Customer and Consumer Service Portals.

## Agent view

The agent view of the Case form includes the following components:

-   A timeline that provides a visual display of case activities.
-   Referenced entities for the case including account and contact information, product and asset information, service contract and service entitlement details, and any pertinent SLAs. Except for SLAs, this information exists in the system and can be associated with the case by the agent or agent manager.
-   All communication about the case, both external and internal. This information is stored in the **Additional comments** field \(external communication\), the **Work notes** field \(internal communication\), the **Resolution notes** field. The **Resolution notes** field stores details about the case resolution, and the **Activity** field, which stores all communication in a chronological list.

Agents and managers can view a Case form by navigating to **Customer Support** &gt; **Cases** and selecting one of the following menu options:

-   **My Cases**
-   **All**
-   **Open**
-   **Unassigned**

From the Case list, select a case number to display the Case form.
