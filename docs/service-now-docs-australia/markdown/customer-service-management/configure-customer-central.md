# Configure Customer Central

Provide customer service agents with all the information about a customer in one central place by configuring the Customer Information and Customer History views for Customer Central.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, or the app-specific sn\_customer\_central\_admin role.

**Note:** Admins can assign either the full admin role for broad access or the app-specific sn\_customer\_central\_admin role to limit access to only the Customer Central application \(`sn_customercentral`\).

## About this task

Customer Central provides customer service agents with all the information about the customer in one central place. It enables them to quickly zoom in on the customer issue and provide efficient and empathetic service to their customers.

Customer Central consists of two views, Customer Information and Customer History. In CRM Workspace, Customer Central is displayed on the interaction, account, contact, or consumer records.

For more information, see [Customer Central](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-central.md).

2.  On the Getting Started page of the guided setup, select **Get Started**.
