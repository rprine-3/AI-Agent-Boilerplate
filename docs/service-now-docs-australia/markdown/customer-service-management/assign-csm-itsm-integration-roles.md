# Assigning CSM/ITSM integration roles

To enable the Service Management integration features, assign the CSM/ITSM integration roles that are included with the Incident Management application.

The Service Management integration plugins do not add any roles to the customer service agent role \(sn\_customerservice\_agent\). To enable the Service Management integration features, you must assign the CSM/ITSM integration roles included with the Incident Management application.

-   Assign roles to agents using guided setup. For more information, see [Integrate with IT Service Management using Guided Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-csm-sm-integration.md).
-   Assign roles to agents using the ServiceNow AI Platform user administration feature. For more information, see [Assign a role to a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignARoleToAUser.md).

## CSM/ITSM integration roles

Several types of roles are available with CSM integration with ITSM.

### CSM/ITSM integration roles for agents
