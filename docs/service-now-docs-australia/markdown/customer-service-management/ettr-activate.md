# Display the time to resolve ribbon component

Activate the **ETTR Experience Card** so that you can display the time to resolve ribbon component in your CSM workspaces.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** Support for creating new regression solutions was deprecated in the Washington DC release. You can train and edit any existing solutions, but you can't initiate new ones. The following information is provided for legacy context. For more information see [Create and train a regression solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-regression-solution.md).

The Time to resolve ribbon component is available by default and can be displayed in both CSM Agent Workspace and CSM Configurable Workspace. You must activate the component in CSM Agent Workspace before you activate it in CSM Configurable Workspace.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Forms** &gt; **Workspace Ribbon Settings**.

2.  Select any record that has the table value **Case \[sn\_customerservice\_case\]**.

3.  Increase or decrease the values in the width column to make the total combined width of all the components to 12 or less.

    **Note:** If the total is already exceeding 12, decrease the values for the other components before modifying the value of **ETTR Experience Card**.

4.  Select **ETTR Experience Card**.

5.  Select **Active**.

6.  In the **Ribbon Component Attributes** form section, modify components such as the **Card title** and **Info message** as required.

    **Note:**

    -   You can see that the Solution name is pre-filled with the default name.
    -   The same procedure applies to activate the **ETTR Experience Card** in the CSM Configurable Workspace. You must activate the **ETTR Experience Card** in the CSM Agent Workspace before activating it in the CSM Configurable Workspace. Navigate to **User Experience Framework** &gt; **Ribbon Configuration Settings** and activate. The **Ribbon Component Attributes** section is not available for modifying.
