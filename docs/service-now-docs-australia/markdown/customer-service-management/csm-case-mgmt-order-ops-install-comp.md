</table>## Service definitions and service definition categories

The Order Operations Case Management application provides the following order case service definitions. These service definitions belong to the Orders service definition category, which stores services for order-related issues. When creating a case, agents can select the desired service definition in the [case type selector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-case-type-select-modals.md).

**Note:** The system administrator needs to activate these service definitions. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Service Definitions** and filter the list to show service definitions from the Order Case \[sn\_order\_case\] table.

For more information about service definitions and categories, see the following topics:

-   [Service definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-service-definitions.md)

## Order case workflows

The Order Operations Case Management application includes subflows that provide the mapping between a customer order and an order case. These subflows are used when an agent creates an order case from a customer order.

These subflows create the data mapping between two different entities: 1\) the customer order and 2\) the order case. For example, when mapping a customer order to order case line items, the entities share some fields such as **Account**, **Contact**, and **Contract**. The data mapping copies these field values from the customer order to the order case line items on the order case.

-   If an order case is created by selecting **Create case** from a customer order:
    -   The **Scope of request** is set to **Multiple orders**.
    -   The mapping copies the data from the selected order headers to create order case line items.
-   If an order case is created by selecting **Create case** from the Order Line Items list on a customer order.
    -   The **Scope of request** is set to **Specific line items, Single order**.
    -   The mapping copies the data from selected order lines to create case line items as well as copies the order line characteristics to case line item characteristics.

Subflows:

-   **Primitives - Order to order case for multiple request**
    -   Inputs: Order IDs, Order Case ID
    -   Action: Create Case Line Item - Multiple Request

        Creates an order case line item on the order case based on the customer order.

-   **Primitives - Order to order case for single request**
    -   Inputs: Order ID, Order Case ID, Selected IDs
    -   Action: Create Case Line Item - Single Request

        Creates order case line items based on the selected order line items from the customer order.


To view these subflows, navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio** and select **Subflows** on the Workflow Studio homepage.
