# Add staff members to an external organization

Add users as staff members to an external organization \(formerly external business location\) to support accounts, contacts, consumers, and households.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_customerservice\_manager, sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager, sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager\_contributor, and sn\_bus\_loc.location\_relationship\_manager

## About this task

You can add both internal users with the snc\_internal role and external users with the snc\_external role as staff members to an external organization.

-   Administrators and customer service managers can add staff members to any business organization \(formerly business location\).
-   Location managers can add staff members to the business organizations that they have access to.

**Note:** Adding new external staff members to the external organizations must be done using the external organization staff \(formerly service organization external staff\) module.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Business Organizations** &gt; **External Organizations**.

2.  Select the desired external organizations \(formerly external business locations\) record.

3.  Select the **Register Member** related link to open the Register Member at External Organization \(formerly Register Member at External Business Location\) record.

    You can use the record to register new location staff or move existing staff between locations managed by the Location manager, and assign responsibilities to staff accordingly.
