# Case Playbook for Product Support

Use the Case Playbook for Product Support to guide agents through the steps that are needed to resolve product issues.

A product support case captures the information about the customer, the product, and the reported issue. The product support playbook provides the activities and tasks that agents can perform to research and resolve the issue. Agents can also create and assign tasks as needed and use the playbook to communicate with the customer.

The Case Playbook for Product Support is available for both CRM Workspace and CSM Agent Workspace. In the CSM Workspaces, the playbook appears in the **Playbook** tab on the case record.

**Note:** If you have the admin role, you can configure a playbook to use the compact mode in CRM Workspace. Use the compact mode to move the playbook from a tab in the Workspace to a tab in the contextual side panel.

## Using the Playbook Actions menu

The Playbook Actions menu in the playbook header includes the actions that agents can perform at the playbook level. The agents can select the Playbook Actions icon \(\[Omitted image "playbook-ellipses.png"\] Alt text: Playbook actions menu icon.\) to access this menu.

-   **Info Received**: Returns the case to the previous state and restarts the SLAs and any timers on the case.

The activity-level actions can also appear in the Playbook Actions menu. These actions vary depending on the type of activity and in which stage it appears. For example, actions are available to accept cases, create related cases, create case tasks, and propose solutions.
