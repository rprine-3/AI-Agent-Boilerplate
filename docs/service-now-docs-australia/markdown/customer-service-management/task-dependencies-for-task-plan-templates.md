# Task dependencies for task plan templates

Task dependencies control the execution order of tasks, cases, and case tasks in a task plan template, reducing ambiguity and supporting predictable sequencing.

Task dependencies provide controlled sequencing within the generated records from the template items in the Task Plan Template Dependency table. By defining predecessor and successor relationships, tasks can start at the correct time and reduce ambiguity for agents. Administrators and users with edit permissions can add or update dependencies when the template is in the **Draft** state. Users with read-only access can view dependency information after the template is shared.

All dependency records are stored in the Task Plan Template Dependency table. Each record includes the predecessor, successor, dependency type, minimum and maximum lag times, use max lag time, and assignment criteria.

The user interface provides list views, form views, and a related list on the template record to support dependency management. UI policies dynamically show or hide fields based on user selections. For example, selecting **Use maximum lag time** displays the **Maximum lag time** field, allowing users to specify the maximum lag duration.

The **Assignment criteria** field contains a list with options such as **Same agent** and **Same day, same agent**. Built-in validations prevent circular, self-referencing, or duplicate dependencies. Role-based access controls determine who can view, create, update, or delete dependency records, depending on the user's role and the template state.

The **Apply Template** button is available only after a task plan template is published. When selected, it generates task records in the corresponding tables and populates the defined dependencies between template items in the Task Dependency table. Task plan template users and administrators can add, edit, or remove dependencies using the provided UI controls only when the template is in **Draft** state. When a dependency is removed, the system displays a custom confirmation message indicating that only the dependent tasks are affected.

Task dependencies support clear and predictable task sequencing and multiple dependency types through minimum and maximum lag times.
