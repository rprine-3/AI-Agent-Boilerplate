# Create customer projects

Create customer projects at internal or external organizations \(formerly internal or external business locations\) to manage location openings, renovations, closings, or other location-specific initiatives.

## Before you begin

To access customer projects and to enable required roles, make sure that you enable the Customer Project Management \(com.snc.csm\_ppm\) plugin.

Role required: admin, it\_project\_manager, sn\_service\_org.project\_manager

## About this task

A customer project can be initiated by applying templates, or by importing and exporting projects. Furthermore, cases can be created to address issues either at the project or project task level.

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).
