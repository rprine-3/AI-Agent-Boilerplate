# Add an entitlement to a case

Add one or more entitlements to a customer service case record in CRM Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esm\_agent, sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent

## About this task

Agents can view the available entitlements on a customer service case and associate one or more entitlements to the case. Available entitlements are associated with the account, consumer, or contract selected on the case record.

Starting with the Zurich release, the **sn\_customerservice.advanced\_entitlements** system property determines if agents can associate one entitlement to a case or multiple entitlements.

-   If set to true, the Case Entitlements related list is visible on the Case form and the **Entitlement** field is hidden. Agents can use this list to associate multiple entitlements to the case.
-   If set to false, the **Entitlement** field is visible on the Case form and the Case Entitlements related list is hidden. Agents can use this field to associate one entitlement to the case.
