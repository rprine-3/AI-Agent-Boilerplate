</table>Granular admin users can be granted delegated developer privileges and other required roles to manage and configure metadata in scoped applications instead of assigning high-privileged admin roles. By granting granular admin users with the Manage Update Set permission, you can allow them to create and manage records within a specific application scope and track those changes in the appropriate update set. The metadata\_scope\_viewer role allows these granular admins to view the Application field on metadata records within scoped applications.. For more information on the delegated development, see [Delegated Development](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-landing.md).
