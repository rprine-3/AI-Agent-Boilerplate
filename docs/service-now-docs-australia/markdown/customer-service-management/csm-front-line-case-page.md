# Front-line case page

The Front-line case page provides a simplified case view that enables front-line agents to quickly gather context, categorize cases, and provide prompt responses to customers.

The Front-line case page focuses on the essential functionality that front-line or tier 1 agents need:

-   Look up and verify customer information
-   Scan the activity stream
-   View related information
-   Search for knowledge articles

The Front-line case page is included with the CRM Workspace application.

## Contact and consumer lookup components

The contact and consumer lookup components enable users to do the following:

-   Look up a contact or consumer by name, phone number, or email address. As you type characters in the search box, matching information appears in record cards below the search box.
-   Select a contact or consumer after searching by selecting the desired record card. The selected record card replaces the lookup component.

User roles determine which lookup component appears on the Front-line case page.

-   Front-line case agents can see the Contact lookup component.
-   Consumer agents with the Front-line case agent role can see the Consumer lookup component.
-   Some users, such as managers, can have both B2B \(account and contact\) and B2C \(consumer\) roles. When a user has both roles, they can see both the Contact and Consumer lookup components.

When using the Contact lookup component to look up and select a contact, the system hides the Consumer lookup component. When using the Consumer lookup component to look up and select a consumer, the system hides the Contact lookup component.

When using the Contact component, the system displays the contacts for the selected account. If the agent selects a different contact, the system updates the account.

After selecting a contact or consumer, users can perform the following actions from the contact or consumer record card:

-   Remove a linked contact or consumer from a case record by selecting the more actions icon and then selecting **Unlink**.
-   Edit and save a linked contact or consumer record by selecting the pencil icon, editing the information for the contact, and selecting **Save**.
-   Select a reference field on a lookup card to open the referenced record in a subtab.
-   Select an email address on a lookup card to open to open the email composer in a subtab.
-   Select a phone number on a lookup card to make a phone call.
-   Collapse the card to display more record content. When collapsed, users can see a link to the contact or consumer name.

The Contact and Consumer lookup components include advanced search capabilities that enable agents to perform a type-ahead search across multiple tables and fields. This includes the following types of matching:

-   Exact match: phone number and record number
-   Starts with match: name and email address

## Case summarization component

The case summarization component provides agents with a summary of a customer service case, including the issue and the actions taken. Agents can generate summaries to understand case context and post summaries to the case work notes.

The case summarization component appears above the activity stream on the Front-line case page variant. Upon first opening a case, the component is collapsed and in the default state.

Using this component, agents can:

-   Select **Summarize** to create a summary of the case details.
-   Select **Share to work notes** to copy the summary text to the activity stream.
    -   Review the summary text in the Share to work notes pop-up window and modify the text as needed.
    -   Select **Save to work notes** on the pop-up window to add the text to the activity stream.
-   Select the refresh icon in the component footer to refresh the text and get the latest summary.

**Note:** If the case does not contain enough text to summarize, the system displays the following message: "This case doesn't have the minimum number of words required for summarization yet."

To use the case summarization component with the Front-line case page, activate the Now Assist for Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application and configure the case summarization skill in the Now Assist Admin console. For more information, see:

-   If a list has more than five items, it includes a **Show more** option.

## Customer History component

The Customer History component displays customer, consumer, or account history information, depending on the field selections on the interaction record. This component displays the information previously displayed in the Customer Activity tab. For more information, see [Customer History component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-central.md) in the Customer Central documentation.

## Record presence feature

The Front-line case page includes the record presence feature. This feature allows agents to see other users who are viewing the same record and enables easy collaboration.

The user presence component displays an icon in the form header that shows the user who is currently viewing the record. For three or more users, the component displays two icons plus a number that represents additional users.

-   Hover over an icon to see more information about a user.
-   Select the number icon to see more information about the additional users.

For more information about this feature, see [User presence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_UserPresence.md).

## Requesting information from customers

The Front-line case page includes a **Request Info** UI action that agents can use to request information from customers. This action provides agents with the option to send a comment to the customer when requesting information.

**Note:** The **Request Info** UI action is available to users with the sn\_cwf\_wrkspc.frontline\_agent role and for cases in the Open state.

The **Request Info** UI action on the Front-line case page behaves differently than the same action on the CSM default record page. On the Front-line case page, this action moves a case to the Awaiting Info state but does not require the agent to add a comment.

To request information:

1.  Select **Manage Case** in the action bar.
2.  Select **Request Info**.

The system sets the case **State** field to Awaiting Info and displays the following message to the agent: **Send a comment to request info if you haven’t already. The case is awaiting info.**

-   If the agent has not sent a comment, they can compose and post a comment in the activity stream.
-   If the agent has already composed a comment and then selects **Request Info**, the system saves the record and automatically posts the comment to the activity stream.

## Attaching and sharing knowledge articles

Agents can share articles with customers by using the **Attach and share article** knowledge guidance. This guidance recommends relevant knowledge articles to customer service agents and enables them to share the selected articles with customers in comments, work notes, or emails.

From the Recommendations tab in the contextual side panel, agents can use [modeless dialogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-front-line-case-page-modeless-dialogs.md) to do the following:

-   Attach and add a link to a comment.
-   Attach and add a link to an email.
-   Add a link to a work note.

Selecting these actions displays the comment, work note, or email modeless dialog. The inserted link displays the knowledge article title and article number as a hyperlink, in the format `Article Title: KB0012345`. Once the guidance is executed, it is marked as Complete. After an action is completed, an entry is posted in the case record activity stream.

To display the knowledge article links that are added to the modeless dialogs with the **Attach and share article** guidance, the system administrator needs to manually enable the rich text editor:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.
2.  Search for the **glide.ui.journal.use\_html** system property.
3.  Set the **Value** to true.

When the **glide.ui.journal.use\_html** is set to true, the Rich Text Editor is enabled by default for comments and work notes in the Activity Stream. A **Rich Text Editor** toggle appears in the upper-right corner of the message box, allowing users to switch between rich text and plain text as needed.

The editor provides options such as bold, italics, lists, hyperlinks, and text alignment to help create structured, readable content. This setting does not affect email composition, which is managed  separately via **sys\_email\_client\_confguration**. The rich text editor and formatting options are available by default in email messages, but the toggle does not appear.

For more information about the knowledge guidance, see [Attach and share article guidance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-guidances-attach-share-article.md).
