# Create a work order

Create a work order to manage your regular maintenance and service requirements for an install base item. You can do this task by using the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent and sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent

## About this task

A work order is a request for off-site work. You can create a work order for a new or an existing work plan so that you can assign work order tasks to field service agents. Users with the sn\_customerservice\_agent and sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent roles can create the work orders and provide the information that is needed for the fulfillment of the work order tasks. If the scope of an existing work order changes during the planned maintenance stage, you can create a work order for an existing work order.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Products** &gt; **Install base item**.

2.  Select an install base item record.

3.  From the related list, select **Work Orders** and then select **New**.

4.  On the Work Order form, enter the short description.

    **Note:** The **Install base item** field is automatically filled in because the work order is created directly through the install base form.

5.  Select **Submit**.

    A work order for the install base item is created and appears in the Work Order related list on the install base form.

    All work orders that are associated with a child install base item also appear in the work orders section of the parent install base form.
