# Order case intake page

Customer service agents use the Order case intake page to capture the initial information when creating a new order case.

The agent initiates an order case in one of the following ways:

-   Selecting **Create case** from a customer order.
-   Selecting **Create case** from the Order Line Items list on a customer order.
-   Selecting **Create case** from an interaction record.
-   Selecting **New** from the Order Cases list view.

The system displays the Order case intake page after the agent selects an order-related service from the case type selector modal. The agent can enter the following order case details:

-   **Account**: the account for the order.
-   **Scope of request**: the agent can create a case for order lines from a single order or for multiple complete orders.
-   **Order number**: the order number associated with the order case. This field is mandatory for cases created from the Order Line Items list on a customer order.
-   **Short description**: a brief description of the order case.

Depending on where the agent creates the order case from, some of these fields are auto filled. For example, the **Scope of request** displays the following:

-   **Specific line items, Single order**: If the agent selects **Create case** from the Order Line Items list on a customer order.
-   **Multiple orders**: If the agent selects **Create case** from a customer order.

After saving the intake record, the agent can see the [Order case record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-order-ops-order-case-record-page.md) with the case line items created either from customer orders or customer order lines.
