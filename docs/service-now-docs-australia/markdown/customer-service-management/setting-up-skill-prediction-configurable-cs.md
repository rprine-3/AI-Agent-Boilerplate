# Setting up skill prediction in Workforce Optimization for Customer Service

Collect skill data based on skills agents have used for case resolution. Use supervised learning to recommend these skills for agents to resolve similar open case. You can also find patterns in how skills are used for case resolution and use unsupervised learning to recommend skills for agents.

## Before you begin

Set up skills. For more information, see [Skills Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/skills-management.md).

Predictive Intelligence must be set up and configured on your instance to train the models. For more information, see [Predictive Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/predictive-intelligence.md).

Activate the Skill Recommendation application plugin \(com.snc.sre\) to use predictive intelligence for recommending skills.

Role required: sn\_sre.admin

## Procedure

1.  Configure the [properties for the Skill Recommendation application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md).

2.  Run the solution definition models such as **Recommend similar skills for cases** or **Recommend skills from similar cases** to train the supervised and unsupervised solutions.

    For more information on training a solution, refer to [Create and train a similarity solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-similarity-solution.md).

3.  Run the **Start skill prediction** scheduled job everyday to start predicting skills for cases or agents.

    This scheduled job is inactive by default. When you activate it, the job runs daily at 1:00 AM on all cases resolved the previous day. The job then adds the skills to the User Predicted Skill \[sn\_sre\_user\_predicted\_skill\] table and Task Predicted Skill \[sn\_sre\_task\_predicted\_skill\] table.

    **Note:** Recommended skills will start appearing once the number of records in \[sn\_sre\_task\_predicted\_skill\] table exceeds the value defined in the \[sn\_sre.user\_predicted\_skill\_threshold\] [Components installed withWorkforce Optimization for Customer Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md).

## Use extension points for skill prediction

Use scripted extension points to customize skill prediction for tasks.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

You can create multiple implementations for each extension point and provide an order number for each implementation. The implementation that has the lowest order number is executed.

Note that the Skill Recommendation extension point is included with the Skill Recommendation \(com.snc.sre\) plugin.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Client Extension Points**.

2.  From the Extension Points list, select **Skill Recommendation** \(sn\_sre.SkillPredictionAPI\).

3.  Either create a new skill recommendation implementation or modify an existing one.

    -   To create a new skill recommendation implementation, click **Create Implementation**.
    -   To modify an existing implementation, from the Implementations related list, select a class.
4.  Modify the script as required.

5.  Click **Update**.
