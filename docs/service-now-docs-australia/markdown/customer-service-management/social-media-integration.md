# Social media communication channel

Use the social media communication channel to associate social profiles and social media conversations with cases.

## Overview

Agents can select **Social** as the communication channel on the Case form. Selecting the Social channel adds the Social Profile field, which lets agents associate a specific social media profile with the case. Social media conversations related to a case are captured in the Social Logs related list.

Customer service managers can create social profiles for accounts, contacts, and consumers from the **Social Profiles** related list on each entity form. A social profile records a user's profile information for a specific social media channel. Managers can create multiple profiles per entity. Agents have read-only access to these profiles.

## Supported forms

The social media communication channel adds the following functionality to CSM forms:

-   **Case:** The Channel field includes the Social option. Selecting it adds the **Social Profile** field and the **Social Logs** related list.
-   **Account, Contact, and Consumer:** Each form includes the **Social Profiles** related list for creating and managing profiles.

## Plugin

The Customer Service Social Integration plugin \(com.sn\_cs\_social\) is activated as part of the Customer Service Management plugin.
