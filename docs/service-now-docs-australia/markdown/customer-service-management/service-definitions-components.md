</table>## Extension points installed with case types

Extension points enable you to extend the functionality of an application and integrate customizations without altering the application code. Extension points are stored in the Extension Point \[sys\_extension\_point\] table.

The CSMServiceDefinitionIntegrations extension point returns a list of products that is available to agents in the **Product** field on Product Service Select version of the [case type selector screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-case-type-select-modals.md). Out of box, this list is based on customer context and displays the sold products and install base items owned by the customer.

To access this extension point, navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points** and select **CSMServiceDefinitionIntegrations**.

To modify this extension point:

1.  Select the **Create implementation** related link on the extension point record.
2.  Modify the **Script** field and add an API to return product information.
3.  Select **Update**.

    The system adds the implementation to the Implementations related list on the extension point record.

    **Note:** The implementation with the lowest **Order** number is used to return the list of products.
