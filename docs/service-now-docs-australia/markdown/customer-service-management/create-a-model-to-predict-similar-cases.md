# Create a model to predict similar cases

Test and edit the pre-trained similar cases model for predicting similarity in customer service cases and create a model for custom cases.

-   **Pre-requisites**

    Role required: ml\_admin, ti\_admin

-   **About this task**

    Base system models: Task Intelligence for Customer Service includes three base system models for predicting similar records for cases:

    -   Major Case identifier
    -   Similar Open Cases
    -   Similar Resolved Cases
    To get recommendations for a major case identifier that includes propose major cases and similar major cases, install the [Major Issue Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/major-issue-management-application.md) application and activate the feature as needed to get recommendations. When you install the Task Intelligence for CSM plugin in your production instance, the plugin automatically installs and trains the similar open cases, similar resolved cases, and major case identifier models using your data. These models are then auto-deployed. The similar open case and similar resolved case models show predictions on recommended actions on case form. However, recommendations aren’t enabled for the major case identifier model in the base system.


## Steps to activate Major Case identifier recommendation

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Recommended Actions** &gt; **Recommendations**.
2.  Select **Propose major issue** under the Application scope **Task Intelligence for Customer Service**.
3.  Check the **Active** check box.

4.  Select **Update**.

    Repeat the steps for **Similar major cases**.


**Note:**

Propose major issue and similar major cases are inactive in the base system.

## Enable Suggested Actions on the front line case page record

-   **Before you begin**

    Role required: workspace\_admin, ui\_builder\_admin, ti\_admin, next\_best\_action\_author

    Recommended Actions component should be added to the specific record page. \(Front line or CSM default record page\)

-   **About this task**

    To enable **Suggested Actions** tab, the admin should activate the **Recommended actions** feature on two specific pages: **Front line case page** and **CSM default record page**. Once activated, agents can view the recommendations on these pages.

    **Note:** For CSM default record page, first wire Recommended actions on this CSM default record page first, and then enable the **Suggested Actions** tab in UIB via the component property.


To enable **Suggested Actions** feature in the Recommended Actions component, follow the following steps:

1.  Navigate to **All**&gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt;**Experiences**.
2.  Select the UX application **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.
3.  Select **Open in UI Builder**.
4.  Navigate to **Record** under **Pages and variants**.
5.  Select **Front-line Case page**.

    **Note:** Verify that you're in the accurate scope to be able to edit.

6.  Select **Recommended Actions 1** under the Tabs.
7.  In the Configure tab, turn off the toggle for **Hide recommended actions**.
8.  Select **Save**.

By following these steps, you successfully activate the Recommended Actions feature, enabling agents to view suggestions under Recommendations in the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace. When you open a case, you find the recommendations section with two tabs: **Search** and **Suggested Actions**. The recommendations are displayed under **Suggested Actions**.

## Enable Recommended actions in the CSM default record page

1.  Navigate to **All**.
2.  In the search box, enter sys\_ux\_screen\_condition.list and press enter.
3.  Select the filter icon, enter **\[Screen\] \[contains\] \[Recommeded Actions default\]** and **\[Application\] \[is\] \[Recommeded Actions\]**, and select **Run**.
4.  Select the **true** link under **Active**.
5.  On the **UX Screen Condition** page in the Script, replace the return value with **true**.
6.  Select **Update**.

Result: On opening a case, the recommendations section with two tabs: Search and Suggested Actions is displayed. The recommendations are displayed under Suggested Actions.
