# Address a callback request from a customer

As a customer service agent, call a customer back either immediately or at the date and time requested by the customer.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent

## About this task

Depending on the type of request, you can call the customer on the phone or over Zoom.

If the callback is requested from the Customer Service or Customer Service Portal, you can look into the customer's issue by going through the chat, related cases, knowledge base searches, and history to become familiar with the context before making the call.

## Procedure

1.  Open your workspace.

2.  When an interaction request comes in, accept it from your inbox.

    The interaction card shows the following information:

    -   The type of callback and interaction number
    -   The name of the customer
    -   The type of issue
3.  Call the customer back on the requested channel.

    |Type of call|Action|
    |------------|------|
    |**Voice**|Select the **Click-to-call** button next to the phone number to make a voice call.|
    |**Video**|Use the meeting URL to make a video call over Zoom.|

    If the customer doesn't accept the call:

    -   Retry the callback later by clicking **Re-attempt Callback**.

        The number of retry attempts is updated.

    -   If necessary, assign the callback task to another agent by selecting **Requeue Callback** from the **More actions** menu.
4.  End the call.

    -   The state of interaction changes to **Close complete**.
    -   If you have the notify\_view role, you can see the video meeting participants in the **Video participants** tab.
    -   The meeting recording and transcript are attached to the interaction. The inserted transcripts are not sentiment analyzed.
5.  If the issue is resolved, close the callback task by selecting **Close Callback**.
