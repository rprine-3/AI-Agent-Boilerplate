The **Email** and **Phone** links are clickable. When you select these links, the information is copied to the clipboard.

**Note:** If your administrator hasn't enabled Computer Telephony Integration \(CTI\), your contact numbers are copied to the clipboard instead of calling the numbers directly​.
