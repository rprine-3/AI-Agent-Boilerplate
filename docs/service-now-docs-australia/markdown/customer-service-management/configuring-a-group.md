# Configuring a group

Set up the group by adding members and assigning them the necessary roles. The group members inherit the roles of the group, so you don’t have to assign roles to each member separately. This setup enables members within a group to perform specific field service tasks, filtered by location, skills, product models, and so on.

## Add members to a group

Add a member to a group so that the member inherits all the roles assigned to the group.

### Before you begin

Role required: user\_admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Groups**.

2.  Select the group from the list that you want to add members to. 

3.  In the Group Members related list, select **Edit**. 

4.  Select and add one or more names to the Group Members List.

5.  Select **Save**.


### What to do next

Assign the required roles to the members of the group. For more information, see [Assign required roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configuring-a-group.md).

## Assign required roles

You can assign one or more roles to a group to grant required access to the group members.

### Before you begin

Role required: user\_admin

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Groups**.

2.  Select the group from the list that you want to add roles to. 

3.  In the Roles related list, select **Edit**. 

4.  Select and add the required roles to the Roles List.

5.  Select **Save**.


### Result

The roles are successfully added to the assignment group. You can now start associating these groups to a business organization \(formerly business location\).
