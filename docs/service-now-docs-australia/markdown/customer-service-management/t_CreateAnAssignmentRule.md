# Create an assignment rule for case routing

Create a rule that assigns those cases that meet the matching rule criteria to a customer service agent.

    You can also create an assignment rule by navigating to **Routing and Assignment** &gt; **Assignment Rule** and selecting **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields on the Assignment Rule form.

If you select a custom table that extends the task table, you must clear the instance cache by navigating to `https://<instance_name>.service-now.com/cache.do` in order for the assignment rule to work.

**Warning:** Clearing the system cache can affect overall performance, and degrade system response times. Don’t run cache flushes during business hours, and don’t trigger cache flushes automatically.

The conditions in which the assignment rule will apply.Use the buttons in this field to build one or more conditions on the selected table. A condition is made up of a selected field, an operator, and a value. Add conditions using the **AND** and **OR** buttons. Delete conditions by selecting the **X** to the right of a condition.
