## About this task

By default, the Auto-Responder feature is configured to send contextual search results based on Predictive Intelligence. Knowledge articles that have significant text similarity with the short description of a case are sent as Auto-Responder recommendations.

You can configure the Auto-Responder feature to send knowledge article recommendations that match a text search of the case short description when the recommendations sent through the Predictive Intelligence feature aren't sufficient or the feature is disabled.

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Search for the **sn\_adv\_emailscript.textsearch.enable** property.

3.  In the **Value** field, enter `true`.

4.  Click **Update**.
