# Manage customer service case types

Manage the settings and the configuration for a case type from the Case Type form.

After using the Customer Service Management Guided Setup to create and [configure a case type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-csm-case-types.md), you can view and manage the settings and configuration for the case type from the [Case Type form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-service-case-type-form.md). To access a Case Type form, navigate to **Customer Service** &gt; **Case Types** &gt; **Manage Case Types** and select a case type from the list.

## Select a category and subtype for a case type

The system administrator can assign an optional category and a subtype to a case type. When creating a case, agents can filter the available case types by category and subtype in the [case type selector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-case-type-select-modals.md). If an agent selects a category, the list of case types displayed is filtered by that category. If an agent selects a subtype, the list is further filtered by that subtype.

The Customer Service Case Types plugin includes several categories that the system administrator can select for a case type. These categories include:

-   Onboarding
-   Complaint
-   Orders
-   General

The **Subtype** field displays fields from the Case Type table that are of the following type:

-   Choice list
-   Reference

To select a category and a subtype for a case type:

1.  Navigate to **Customer Service** &gt; **Case Types** &gt; **Manage Case Types** and select a case type.
2.  Select a category in the **Category** field.
3.  Select a field in the **Subtype** field.
4.  Select **Update**.

## Case types and major cases

The system administrator can enable the **Propose Major Case** UI action for different case types. If this UI action is available, an agent can propose a major case from the selected case type record. If the major case candidate is accepted, a major case is created and the case type record is added as a child case on the major case.

The major case is created on the base Case table. Updates to the major case are synchronized to the child case types. Multiple case type records can be added to the same major case.
