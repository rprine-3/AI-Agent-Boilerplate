# Outsourced Service Provider dashboard

The Outsourced Service Provider dashboard enables monitoring of breached service-level agreements \(SLAs\), average resolution time, and case transfer percentages, among other metrics. You can utilize the insights to identify the areas of concern and to plan your case management strategy.

**Important:** Starting with the Xanadu release, the Outsourced Service Provider dashboard has a new, modernized look and feel.

To access the new Outsourced Service Provider dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **Outsourced Customer Service** &gt; **Analytics**, and select the outsourced service provider \(OSP\) name. Existing customers upgrading from earlier releases to the Xanadu release can also access the new Outsourced Service Provider dashboard.

However, existing customers on release versions prior to the Xanadu release can still view the old Outsourced Service Provider dashboard by navigating to **All** &gt; **Outsourced Customer Service** &gt; **Overview**.
