# Create or update a household

Create or update a household.

## Before you begin

Role required: One of the following roles:

-   sn\_crm\_consumer\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_household\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_household\_relationship\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_consumer\_relationship\_data\_manager

## About this task

A household is made up of a group of consumers who live at a common address and share products and services. A household can have a designated head of household and multiple current members. The head of household has access to all the cases and information for the other household members.

A user with the administrator role can create a household. This user can also delete a household. When a household is deleted, the system removes its references and associations—including members, sold products, cases, and work orders—but doesn’t delete the associated entities.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Customers** &gt; **Households**.

2.  Select **New** on the Households list.

3.  Fill in the fields on the [Household](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/data-model-household-form.md) form.

4.  Select **Submit**.

    The household is added to the Households list.
