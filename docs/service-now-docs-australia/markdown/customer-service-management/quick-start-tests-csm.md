# Quick start tests for Customer Service Management

Quick start tests are part of the Automated Test Framework \(ATF\). Use these tests to validate that the Customer Service Management application still works after you make any configuration change, such as applying an upgrade or developing an application.

A quick start test is a test or test suite installed with the demo data of an application. You can use quick start tests as templates to build your own tests and test suites that ensure successful execution with your instance-specific data.

For more information about using quick start tests, see the following topics:

-   [Test your apps with the ATF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework.md)
