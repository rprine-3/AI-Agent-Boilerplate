# Configure a resource generator for providing a similar major case to the current case

Configure a resource generator of type similarity with trend that provides a similar major case to the current case.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure Predictive Intelligence is active and set up on your instance. See [Install Predictive Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-predictive-intelligence.md).
-   Ensure you have a Predictive Intelligence subscription.
-   Train the Major issue detector similarity solution with the existing customer cases. For more information, see [Create and train a similarity solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-similarity-solution.md).
-   Create a trend definition with the name Major issue trends to define how many records that have something in common constitute a trend, for example, six or more records with common field values.
