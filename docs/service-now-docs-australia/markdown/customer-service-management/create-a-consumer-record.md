# Create a consumer record

Consumer service agents and managers can create consumer records from the Customer Service Management application.

## Before you begin

Role required: One of the following roles:

-   sn\_crm\_consumer\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_consumer\_relationship\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_data\_manager
-   sn\_crm\_foundation\_admin
-   sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent
-   sn\_customerservice\_manager
-   admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Customer** &gt; **Consumers**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields on the Consumer form as necessary.

4.  Fill in the fields on the Primary Address tab.

    A consumer can have multiple addresses but only one primary address. The primary address is stored in the Primary Address tab on the Consumer form and in the **Addresses** related list.

5.  If desired, fill in any of the fields on the Preferences tab.

6.  Select **Submit**.

    The record is added to the Consumers table \(csm\_consumer\). The primary address is added to the **Addresses** related list and the **Primary** field is set to **true**.
