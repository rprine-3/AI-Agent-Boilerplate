# Create relationships

Use relationships to provide internal and external users with additional access to customer data.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Important:** Some table and field labels have been changed across recent releases. For a mapping of former labels to current labels, see [Service Model Foundation renamed Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/renamed-entities.md).

## About this task

With the Service Model Foundation feature, you can create relationships between the following users:

-   Between an internal user and an account, household, or consumer.
-   Between two consumers.

Relationships are based on responsibility definitions. These definitions describe a role or a function that supports a customer. When you create a relationship, you select the users involved in the relationship and the responsibility that one user performs on behalf of another.

The Service Model Foundation plugins provide:

-   Relationships that you can create between users.
-   Responsibility definitions that you can assign to a user in a relationship.
