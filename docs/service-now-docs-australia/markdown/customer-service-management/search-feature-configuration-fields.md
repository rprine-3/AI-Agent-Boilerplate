In addition to configuring these fields for Engagement Messenger, you must configure AI Search in your ServiceNow instance and then enable Typeahead Search and AI Search Assist widgets so that the unauthenticated users can use the AI search feature from Engagement Messenger.

For more information on enabling Typeahead Search and AI Search Assist widgets for Engagement Messenger, see [Enabling AI search in the Customer and Consumer Service Portals for unauthenticated users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-self-service-and-omnichannel-engagement/configure_search_csp_guestuser.md).

For more information of AI Search configuration, see [Configuring AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configuring-ais.md).

For more information on the availability of AI Search in your instance, see the [AI Search Availability \[KB0867751\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867751) article.

**Note:**

-   In the Firefox browser, AI Search results aren’t displayed on the Engagement Messenger home page.
-   If AI Search isn’t enabled:
    -   The search feature won’t be available for users if the messenger module is created on or after version 5.6.
    -   Zing search is used for messenger modules created before version 5.6.
