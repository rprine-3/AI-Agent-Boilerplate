# Use AI search in Recommended Actions to resolve cases

As an agent, use AI search in Recommended Actions to help address customer issues and resolve cases quickly.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_nb\_action.next\_best\_action\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Open the customer service record.

3.  Select the Recommended Actions icon \(\[Omitted image "nba-icon.png"\] Alt text: Recommended Actions icon.\) in the Contextual Side Panel.

4.  Select the **Search** tab.

5.  In the **Search bar** field, enter your search query.

6.  Select the Search icon \(\[Omitted image "search\_icon.png"\] Alt text: Search icon\) or press Enter.

    The AI search results or genius results or both are displayed as cards.

    The relevancy score displays on the search result recommendation cards in the Search tab for following guidances provided with the base system. The relevancy score indicates how well a search result matches the agent’s query.

    -   Default guidance for search results
    -   Attach and share article
    -   Share KB in chat interactions
    -   Case resolution guidance
    -   All no-code guidances \(Link incident to current case, Link problem to current case, and Link change request to current case\).
    **Note:** The relevancy score displays only when the **Show relevancy score for results** check box is enabled in the Context form. For more information, see [Create a context in Recommended Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ra-csm-contexts-create.md).

7.  Select the **Filters** button, select a search source to filter the results and then select **Apply**.

    The number of search sources selected appear on the Filter button once you apply the filters. The following table shows the actions that you can perform on the search results in the Filters section in the Search tab.
