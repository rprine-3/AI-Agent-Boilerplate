# Using Coaching in Workforce Optimization for Customer Service

By using Coaching in Workforce Optimization for Customer Service, you can assess your team's abilities to efficiently resolve cases by reviewing their work at critical moments of customer service.

With Coaching, you can do the following:

-   Recommend training for your agents to address skill gaps.
-   Use the coaching opportunities that are available by [default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/components-installed-configurable-wfo-cs.md) to coach your agents. You can also create a coaching opportunity using the Coaching application specific to your agent needs.
-   Use assessments and surveys to apply consistent, measurable scores across teams.
-   Use Predictive Intelligence to recommend skills for your agents and provide training to address those skill gaps.

## Assess the quality of completed tasks

Assess the ability of your agents to resolve cases or the quality of their completed tasks.

### Before you begin

You can create an assessment from an interaction or any task type.

When you manually create an assessment, you can add a survey to it. Coaching assessments also get created and assigned to the coach based on the trigger conditions that are defined in coaching opportunities.

Role required: sn\_coaching.coach

Watch this short video to get an overview on coaching, assessments, and trainings.

### About this task

If the [Configuring Coaching](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/cf-configuring-coaching.md) includes a survey, you can opt to take the survey and the assessment. When you use a survey to [Coaching your trainee](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/cf-coaching-your-trainee.md), the score for the survey is automatically calculated when you complete the survey. The assessment rating is then updated based on that score.

The Coaching Overview screen displays the average quality of the tasks that were completed in the past 30 days for your assignment groups.

-   The donut chart displays the number of assessments in various states of completion. You can point to one of the states and select to open all assessments in that state.

## Manage skills using Workforce Optimization for Customer Service

Add or update skills for an agent. You can approve predicted skills if the skill is necessary for the agent to complete assigned tasks. You can also reject a skill if it doesn't apply to the agent.

### Before you begin

Role required: skill\_manager

### About this task

The Predictive Intelligence application for skills displays the recommended skills on each agent's profile. The application uses sample cases that the agent has worked on to recommend skills for an agent.

You can view skills for all users grouped by assignment group and the overall skill coverage for each group.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Manager Workspace**.

2.  Click the Coaching \(\[Omitted image "coaching-new.png"\] Alt text: Coaching icon.\) icon.

3.  Click the **Skills** tab.

    You can also filter the skill matrix based on users, groups, skill type, skill level, or skill category. Reset the filter if you want to view the skills for all users.

4.  Add a skill or skill level.
