# Using Customer Service Management with Safe Workplace applications

Screen consumers and contacts for compliance with health and safety policies to determine whether they are permitted to enter a location.

To ensure that consumers and contacts can enter a location safely after emergencies and pandemics, consumers or contacts fill out a Health Verification form and health screeners or customer or consumer service agents perform a health screening.

**Note:** Typically, you receive an email or a mobile notification with a link to the health verification form. Alternatively, you can search for the health verification form on the Consumer or Customer Service Portal.
