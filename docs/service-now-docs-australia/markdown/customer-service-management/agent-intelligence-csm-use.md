# Use Predictive Intelligence for case management

Agents can use Predictive Intelligence to predict values for configured fields when creating a customer service case.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent, sn\_customerservice\_manager, or admin

## About this task

When you create a case, the Predictive Intelligence feature predicts values for the configured fields based on the short description.

**Note:** If you update the case, the values for these fields are not predicted again.

## Procedure

1.  Create a case.

2.  Enter information in the **Short description** field and then tab to the next field.

    Based on this information, the system predicts the values for the **Priority**, **Assignment group**, and **Category** fields.

    **Note:** If the system can't predict values based on the short description, these fields remain empty.

3.  Change the values in the predicted fields if needed or enter values for fields where Predictive Intelligence has skipped the prediction.

    The system doesn't overwrite user-entered values for the predicted fields.
