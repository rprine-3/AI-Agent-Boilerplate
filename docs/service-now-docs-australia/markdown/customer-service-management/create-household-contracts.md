# Create service contracts for a household

Create service contracts for a household so that all household members are covered under the same terms and conditions.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_manager, admin

## About this task

Administrators and customer service managers can create contracts for a household. These contracts apply to the current members of that household.

When a case is created for a household or a consumer, the **Contract** field on the Case form lists the available contracts:

-   If the **Household** and **Consumer** fields are filled in, the **Contract** field lists the contracts for both the consumer and household.
-   If only the **Household** field is filled in, the **Contract** field lists the contracts for the household.
-   If only the **Consumer** field is filled in, **contracts** field lists the contracts for the consumer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Contracts** &gt; **Service Contracts**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select a household in the **Household** field.

    When you select a household, the head of household is automatically added to the **Consumer** field.

    **Note:** You must configure the form layout and add the **Household** field.

4.  If desired, select a different household member in the **Consumer** field.

5.  Fill in the remaining fields on the Contract form.

    For more information, see [Create service contracts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/create-csm-service-contracts.md).

6.  Select **Submit**.

    The contract is added to the Contracts related list on the Household form.
