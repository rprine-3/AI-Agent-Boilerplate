# Configure force refresh for recommendations

Configure the **Trigger Recommendation Refresh** data broker to refresh and update the recommendations based on the results from UI events for precise recommendations. Similarly, use the `ForceRefreshRecommendations` method for configuring an explicit refresh mechanism.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_nb\_action.next\_best\_action\_author, or admin

## About this task

Prior to the Zurich family release, the recommendations often remain outdated due to refresh triggers being tied only to updates on primary context records. Starting with the Zurich family release, you can configure explicit and event-driven refreshes for various context updates beyond just the primary context table to improve recommendations relevance.

-   Explicit refresh mechanism: Enables you to trigger recommendation refreshes manually, independent of internal context changes, addressing scenarios where event-driven updates are insufficient.

    Call the `ForceRefreshRecommendations` method. The `ForceRefreshRecommendations` method is shipped with the base system as part of the **NextBestActionServiceImpl** script include.

    `ForceRefreshRecommendations` method:

    ```
    sn_nb_action.NextBestActionService().forceRefreshRecommendations(input.ruleContextSysIds, input.currentRecordSysId, input.refreshAllUsers);
    ```

-   Event-driven refresh: Implements automatic recommendations updates triggered by predefined system events such as attribute changes on related tables or user interactions like button clicks or tab navigation.

    Configure the **Trigger Recommendation Refresh** data broker of a UI component in the UI builder. This data broker is shipped with the base system and is available for all the UI components of the record pages. Perform the following steps to configure this data broker.


## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI builder**.

2.  In the UI builder, open the **Workspace** experience which you want update.

3.  Open the record page containing the UI component for which you want to configure the data broker.

4.  In the content tree, select a UI component.

    A panel opens on the right with Configure, Style and Events tabs.

5.  In the Events tab, select **Execute Data Resource - Trigger Recommendation Refresh 1**.

6.  On the Configure modal, set the following properties.

<table id="table_z4v_sh3_yfc"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>
