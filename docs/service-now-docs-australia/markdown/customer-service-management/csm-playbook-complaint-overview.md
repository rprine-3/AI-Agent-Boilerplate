# Case Playbook for Complaints

Use the Case Playbook for Complaints to guide agents through the steps that are needed to resolve customer complaints.

A complaint case captures the information about the customer, the product, and the details about the complaint. The complaint playbook provides the activities and tasks that agents can perform to research and resolve the complaint. Agents can also create and assign tasks as needed and use the playbook to communicate with the customer.

The Case Playbook for Complaints can be used with cases that are created using the complaint case type. This playbook is available for both CRM Workspace and CSM Agent Workspace. In the CSM Workspaces, the playbook appears in the **Playbook** tab on the case record.

**Note:** If you have the admin role, you can configure a playbook to use the compact mode in CRM Workspace. Use the compact mode to move the playbook from a tab in the Workspace to a tab in the contextual side panel.

</table>## Using the playbook stage and activity pickers to navigate stages and activities

The playbook stage picker enables agents to see the entire complaint workflow. Agents can navigate the playbook stages and activities by doing the following tasks:

-   Expand and collapse stages to show or hide activities.
-   Use the filter in the stage picker to filter activities by the assigned user or the activity state.
-   Select an activity to display the details in the activity viewer.

## Using the Playbook Actions menu

The Playbook Actions menu in the playbook header includes the actions that agents can perform at the playbook and activity levels. The agents can select the Playbook Actions icon \(\[Omitted image "playbook-ellipses.png"\] Alt text: Playbook actions menu icon.\) to access this menu.

The Playbook Actions menu includes the following playbook-level actions:

-   **Collapse All Stages**: Collapses all the stages in the playbook.
-   **Request Info**: Displays a pop-up window that the agent can use to communicate with the customer and to request information about a case or case task.

-   **Info Received**: Returns the case or case task to the previous state and restarts the SLAs and any timers.

**Note:** The **Request Info** and **Info Received** actions can also be configured to appear on case task activity cards.
