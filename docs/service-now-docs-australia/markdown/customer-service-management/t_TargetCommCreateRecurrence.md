# Create a recurring publication

Review publications to either accept or reject them. You must have the publication’s approval role to review the publication. If the publication is not reviewed before the Publish Date, the publication is rejected.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_publications.author or sn\_publications.admin

## About this task

You can specify the recurrence interval and the recurrence start and end date. The number of copies that are created are based on these settings and appear in the **Publications** related list on the original publication form. Each copy has a different publish date, which is based on the interval. Each copy gets reset to the **Author** state and each one goes through its own workflow.

    -   Navigate to **Targeted Communications** &gt; **Active Publications**, open the desired publication, and click the **Setup Recurrence** related link.
