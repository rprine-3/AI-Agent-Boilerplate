# Get help using virtual agent conversations

Predefined Customer Service Virtual Agent chatbot conversations help your customers complete common self-service tasks, such as getting help with a product or checking the status of a case. Use predefined NLU with your virtual agent chatbot topics to enable the chatbot to assess user intent and provide the best response based on the conversation's context.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.customer, sn\_customerservice.consumer

If you’re an anonymous user not logged in to the application, you can get help by entering keywords for an issue and choose to get transferred to a live agent.

A user with a proxy\_contact role can also check the case status for a customer.

## About this task

The information exchanged during the conversation flow \(user inputs and bot responses\) enables the chatbot to fulfill a user request or assist a user in completing a task. If you have a question or an issue with an existing product or order, the virtual agent searches the keyword and displays relevant knowledge articles that can help resolve the issue. If there are no relevant articles, it creates a case.

ServiceNow NLU enables discovery of the chatbot topics based on either the keywords entered in the chat or the user-intent and matches an entity with the user input. If there’s a match, it also makes the entity available to the topic.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Customer Service Management portal.

2.  Select **Chat**.

    You can select **Show Me Everything** to display all available topics or enter keywords to narrow down the results to relevant topics.

3.  If you’re a logged-in user, enter keywords to get help on a case, an issue, or an order.

    -   If an NLU is enabled, it guides you through the right topic based on the utterance.
    -   If an NLU isn’t enabled, it displays topics based on the match for the entered keywords. You can make a selection from all available topics displayed.
    **Note:** Contact your administrator to determine whether the topics are NLU-enabled.

4.  Use
