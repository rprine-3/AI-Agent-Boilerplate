# Configuring billing accounts

Billing Account Core provides a foundational data model for managing billing accounts across organizations and users. It enables businesses to define, organize, and maintain billing relationships, supporting accurate billing, payments, and scalable financial operations.

## Billing account overview

A billing account is a centralized record that manages payment and invoicing for services. Use billing accounts to organize billing schedules, payment terms, addresses, currency settings, and links to customers—including individuals, organizations, or sub-accounts.

Unlike a customer account, which represents the organizational relationship, a billing account is a financial entity specifically for managing billing and payments. A single customer can have multiple billing accounts for different billing arrangements, while multiple customers can share a consolidated billing account.

Billing accounts support both B2B and B2C scenarios and provide flexibility for complex billing structures through parent-child hierarchies.

## Key capabilities

-   Billing schedule: Define billing frequency \(monthly, quarterly, annual\) and billing cycles.
-   Payment terms: Configure payment terms \(net 30, net 60\) and accepted payment methods.
-   Bill-to address and currency: Specify invoice delivery address and billing currency.
-   Customer associations: Link billing accounts to customers, contacts, and households.
-   Hierarchy support: Create parent-child structures for consolidated billing, sub-accounts, or delegated payment responsibilities. The billing account hierarchy visualization shows these relationships as a tree on the billing account form so that you can review the structure and move between related billing accounts without leaving the record.

    You can view and navigate these relationships from the billing account form. The hierarchy appears following the Description field on the Default and Case views. It shows the parent billing account, the child billing accounts, and identifies the billing account you're currently viewing. From the hierarchy, you can:

    -   Expand or collapse nodes to show or hide child billing accounts.
    -   Select a billing account in the tree to open that record.

## When to use billing account

Use billing accounts when your organization needs to:

-   Separate billing from customer relationship management
-   Support multiple billing arrangements for a single customer
-   Consolidate charges from multiple business units, geographies, or product lines
-   Manage payment responsibility separately from service consumption
-   Track billing-related cases and interactions distinct from general customer cases
