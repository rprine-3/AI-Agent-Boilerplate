1.  Select the Edit Module icon on the Overview module.
2.  Select the Link Type tab on the Overview Module record.
3.  Replace the link in the **Arguments** field with the following text:

    `now/platform-analytics-workspace/dashboards/params/edit/false/tab-sys-id/cfd42b49713354023ee53ca6498cb5d7/sys-id/06e36279f3d8b8349c285a79155206f8`

4.  Select **Update**.

The Service Manager dashboard displays four case-related reports, which are created using the Reports application. You can drill down into these reports for more information about the related cases.
