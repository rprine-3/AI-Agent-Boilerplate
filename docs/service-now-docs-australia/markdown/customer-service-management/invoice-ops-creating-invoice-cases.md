# Creating an invoice case

Agents can create invoice cases from the Invoice Cases list view in CRM Workspace or the Core UI.

Agents can create invoice cases by selecting **New** from the Invoice Cases list view. From the Invoice case record, agents can:

-   Add invoices or invoice lines to the invoice case.
-   Delete invoices or invoice lines from the invoice case.
-   Create new invoice case lines.
-   Edit the details of invoice case lines.
-   Assign invoice case lines to themselves.
-   Create tasks for invoice case lines.

Selecting **Save** on the Invoice case record moves the invoice case and the invoice case lines currently in the Draft state to the New state. Once in the New state, agents can begin working to resolve the invoice case. This can include creating tasks for invoice case lines, assigning them to other agents or team members, and monitoring case progress.

## Request source

An agent can create the following types of invoice cases:

-   Cases that reference one or more invoice lines from a single customer invoice.
-   Cases that reference multiple customer invoices.

The Invoice case record includes the **Request source** field. An agent can select the following values in this field:

-   **Specific invoice lines, single invoice**: The invoice case is for a single customer invoice. The agent can select the invoice in the **Invoice** field.
-   **Invoice header details, multiple invoices**: The invoice case is for multiple customer invoices.

## Add invoices and invoice lines to an invoice case

Invoice cases can include a list of invoice case lines. These case lines represent either customer invoices or invoice lines from a single customer invoice.

Once an invoice case has been created, agents can add invoices or invoice lines to the case by selecting **New** from the Invoice Case Lines related list. Selecting this action displays a new Invoice Case Line record.

The agent can select an invoice line or invoice for the Invoice Case Line record and then select **Save** to add it to the invoice case as an invoice case line.
