# Components installed with Task Intelligence for Customer Service

Several types of components are installed with the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application, including tables, roles, properties, flows, and scheduled jobs.

## Tables

The Task Intelligence for Customer Service application uses the following tables.

<table id="table_ykp_1d5_xrb"><thead><tr><th>

Table

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

ML Solution \[ml\_solution\]

</td><td>

The ML Solution table stores trained machine learning solutions.

 Activating the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application \(com.snc.csm\_ml\_task\) creates a record in this table for the pre-trained sentiment analysis machine learning solution: **ml\_x\_snc\_global\_global\_sentiment**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ML Sentiment \[ml\_sentiment\]

</td><td>

This table stores machine learning sentiment information and includes the following fields:-   **Original sentiment**: The sentiment that is predicted when the case is created.
-   **Current sentiment**: The sentiment that is predicted when the case is updated.
-   **Sentiment over time**: Displays the sentiment trend prediction as an agent works to resolve the case. To be able to calculate a value for this field, there needs to be a minimum of two sentiment predictions.

The system uses the following formula used to determine the sentiment trend:

**\(currentSentiment - originalSentiment\) &gt; 0 ?'improving' :'declining';**


</td></tr><tr><td>

Predictor Result\[ml\_predictor\_results\]

</td><td>

This table stores prediction results and feedback for record categorization, sentiment analysis, and language detection. This includes skipped and failed predictions that result from prediction requests.

 For case categorization:

-   The **Default confidence** and **Predicted confidence** fields store confidence values returned by the categorization machine learning models.
-   For cases created from email, the **Source ID** field includes a reference to the sys\_email record and the **Predicted Table** field includes a reference to the sys\_email table.

 For sentiment analysis:

-   The default value in the **Predicted correctly** field for each sentiment prediction is set to true.
-   The **Final input value** and **Final output value** fields remain empty because sentiment analysis predictions do not collect feedback from agents.

 For language detection:

-   The Predictor Result table stores the prediction results from the Language Detection Service spoke.
-   The **Detected Language** field stores the language returned by the Language Detection Services spoke.

 The Predictor Result table includes the **Skipped** field, which is a true\|false field.

-   **True**: The prediction was skipped.
-   **False**: The prediction was not skipped.

For more details about skipped predictions, see [Logic for Skipped field values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/case-categorization-components.md) below.

 **Note:** The Predictor Result list includes a filter on the **Capability** field, which displays results where the capability is Classification. Remove this filter to display all of the prediction results.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Case\[sn\_customerservice\_case\]

</td><td>

The Case table stores customer service case records. This table is the recipient for case categorization predictions.The **Language** field has been added to the Case table. This field is a reference to the Language \[sys\_language\] table. This field is populated with the prediction made by the language detection spoke and stores the language that was used to create the email or case.

 The Case table is added with the Customer Service \(com.sn\_customerservice\) plugin.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task \[task\]

</td><td>

The Task table is one of the core tables provided with the ServiceNow base system. The sentiment analysis feature adds the **Sentiment** column to the Task table. This column is a reference to the Task ML Sentiment \[task\_ml\_sentiment\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task ML Sentiment \[task\_ml\_sentiment\]

</td><td>

This table stores sentiment predictions. The reference to the prediction record is stored in the **Sentiment** field in the Task table. This table is an extension of the ML Sentiment \[ml\_sentiment\] table.

The **Task** column in the Task Sentiment table is a reference to the Task \[task\] table and is used for domain separation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Task Skills\[task\_m2m\_skill\]

</td><td>

The Task Skills table stores skills for the Customer Service Management application.

 The language detection feature links language skills to new customer service cases by saving the detected language in the Task Skills table.

 The Task Skills table lists customer service cases and the language skill detected and assigned to each case.

</td></tr></tbody>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Machine learning models

The sentiment analysis feature uses the **ml\_x\_snc\_global\_global\_sentiment** machine learning model. This model is provided with the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application.

## Scheduled job for categorization solution training

The system administrator can run the **Categorization solution training** scheduled job on demand.

**Note:** It is recommended that you import a training data set to the Case table \[sn\_customerservice\_case\] to support the initial training of the Categorization machine learning model. The training data set should be tailored to the Case fields that you want to predict and include additional case records that have the correct labels \(i.e., the expected field values\) for the specific fields being predicted. By creating this data set, you leverage your own data to train the algorithm to predict on the fields you select.

The system administrator can set the following parameters before running the scheduled job.

<table id="table_pl2_q2p_trb"><thead><tr><th>

Parameter

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

trainNewSolution

</td><td>

Set to true to train a new solution. Set to false to retrain a solution and add the name of the solution in the **existingSolutionName** parameter.

</td></tr><tr><td>

inputFields

</td><td>

The fields that are used to train the model. For example:`["short_description","description"];`

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

The fields to be predicted. For example:`["priority","category"];`

</td></tr><tr><td>

encodedQuery

</td><td>

The query that is applied to the data used for training.

</td></tr><tr><td>

existingSolutionName

</td><td>

The name of an existing solution. Add a name to this parameter if retraining a solution.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>To determine when a solution is ready to be used for categorization predictions, the system administrator can check the status of the scheduled job. Once the state is Solution Complete, the solution can be used for predictions.

## Scheduled job for publishing previously deployed models

The system administrator can run the **Deploying Task Intelligence for Customer Service Management** after upgrading the Task Intelligence for Customer service plugin.

This scheduled job verifies if there are previously deployed models for record categorization, sentiment analysis, language detection, and Document Intelligence and publishes these models.
