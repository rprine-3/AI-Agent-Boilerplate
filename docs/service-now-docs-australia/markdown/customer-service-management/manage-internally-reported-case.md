# Manage a proactive case created from an alert

Work on a proactive case and resolve the proactive case as you would other customer service cases.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_customerservice\_agent
-   evt\_mgmt\_admin and evt\_mgmt\_operator have read-only access to a case created from an alert and can add work notes, as required.

## About this task

**Note:** This task only applies if you are using Event Management integration on CSM Agent Workspace or the ServiceNow AI Platform interface.

Review proactive cases created from alerts using Agent Workspace. Identify customers, their corresponding install base items affected by the issue causing the alert as well as the service health for each affected install base item. Depending on the number of customers affected, you can propose a proactive case as a major case.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agent Workspace** &gt; **Agent Workspace Home** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Cases**.

    Alternatively, accept a proactive case from your Agent Workspace inbox.

2.  Click the case you want to work on.

3.  You can perform the following actions from the Case form.

<table id="table_izm_tqr_whb"><thead><tr><th>

Click **Refresh Install Base Health**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Resolve and close proactive cases in the same way as other customer service management cases.

    **Note:** If an alert is closed, a case is not automatically closed.
