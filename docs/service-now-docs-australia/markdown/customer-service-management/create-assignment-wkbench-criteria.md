# Create assignment workbench matching criteria

Create one or more matching criteria that can be used in an assignment workbench configuration.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The assignment workbench uses configurable matching criteria, such as skills and availability, to evaluate agents in a selected group and provide an overall ranking. The Matching Criteria \[matching\_dimension\] table stores the individual criterion that can be added to a matching rule to create an assignment workbench configuration.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a **Name** and a **Description** for the criterion.

<table id="choicetable_at3_1ch_cw"><tbody><tr><td id="d232663e115">

**Simple Match**

Creates a one-to-one match. For example, match the time zone of an agent with the time zone of a task location.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d232663e124">
