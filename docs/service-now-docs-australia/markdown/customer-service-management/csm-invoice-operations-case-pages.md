# Invoice case pages

The Case Management for Invoice Operations application includes record pages that display invoice cases and invoice case lines in CRM Workspace.

The Case Management for Invoice Operations application enables agents to create invoice cases that reference customer invoices and invoice lines. Using invoice cases, agents can manage and track customer requests and the actions taken to fulfill these requests.

Invoice cases contain invoice case lines, which represent either invoice lines from a single invoice or multiple invoices. The Case Management for Invoice Operations application includes the following record pages to display this information in CRM Workspace.

## Invoice case record page

The Invoice case record page displays information about invoice cases and the associated list of invoice case lines.

Customer service agents use this page to do the following:

-   Add invoices or invoice lines to the invoice case.
-   Delete invoices or invoice lines from the invoice case.
-   Create new invoice case lines.
-   Edit the details of invoice case lines.
-   Assign invoice case lines to themselves.

The Case Management for Invoice Operations application uses the [CSM default record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-default-record-page.md) to display Invoice case records in CRM Workspace.

## Invoice case line record page

The Invoice case line record page displays information about an invoice case line associated with an invoice case.

The Invoice case line record shows the details of an invoice case line, including customer and product information, the invoiced quantity, invoice discounts, and the billing and shipping locations. From this page, agents can select **Create case line task** to create tasks for invoice case lines.
