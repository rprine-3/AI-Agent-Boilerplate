# CRM Workspace overview

CRM Workspace is a ServiceNow workspace specifically designed for customer service agents. This workspace is designed to improve user efficiency and facilitate resolutions and can be configured using UI Builder.

The [configurable workspace UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/learn-about-agent-workspace.md) provides a suite of tools in a single focused work area. It displays the lists and forms that agents are used to working in within the Core UI. It also includes features that enable agents to be more efficient, manage multiple cases, and quickly orient themselves to the current task.

## CRM Workspace and UI Builder

ServiceNow configurable workspaces use content pages to display list, table, and record information. These pages contain layouts and components that provide building blocks for creating user interfaces.

Some [record pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-config-workspace-record-pages.md) are provided with the CRM Workspace application, such as the [CSM default record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-default-record-page.md) and the [CSM Interaction record page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-interaction-record-page.md).

You can customize these content pages and create content pages for workspaces using [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder-overview.md), a web user interface builder. With UI Builder, you can:

-   Create pages and page variants, tailoring workspace pages for multiple user roles.
-   Configure page layouts, containers, and components, drawing from the library of reusable Next Experience components.
-   Customize components for page layouts, content, data visualization, messaging, and navigation.

## Viewing information in CRM Workspace

Agents can view information in different ways in CRM Workspace including landing pages and dashboards, list pages, and record pages.

|Information|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|[Landing pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-workspace-landing-pages.md)|Landing pages provide agents with a starting point to get into their work. These pages can include filtered lists such as assigned cases and case tasks, key performance indicators \(KPIs\), and other metrics. Agents can quickly scan the information presented on a landing page and prioritize cases and case tasks, access records, and track their performance.|
|[Dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-ws-landing-page-dashboard.md)|Dashboards provide an overview of information such as filtered lists, reports, and performance analytics. Dashboards are flexible and easily customizable so agents can display the information they need.|
|[List pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/lists-configurable-workspace.md)|A list displays records from a database table. CRM Workspace uses list pages to display list information such as cases and case tasks. These pages are designed to help agents navigate, filter, and manage records.|
|[Record pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-config-workspace-record-pages.md)|A record displays the information from one record in a database table. CRM Workspace uses record pages to provide the base structure for how that information is displayed. Record pages include elements such as layouts, containers, and components to display record information.|
