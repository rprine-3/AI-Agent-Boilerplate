# Computer Telephony Integration Workflows

Computer Telephony Integration \(CTI\) enables customer service agents to place and receive phone calls in ServiceNow applications.

The following sample workflows show how CTI can be integrated with Interaction Management System \(IMS\) and OpenFrame \(OF\) to support outgoing and incoming telephone calls.

## CTI integration for outgoing call

The following workflow describes the logical sequence of actions when an outgoing call is triggered using the OpenFrame window.

## CTI integration for incoming call

The following workflow describes the logical sequence of actions when an incoming call is received using the OpenFrame window.

## CTI integration for transferring call

The following workflow describes the logical sequence of actions when an incoming call is transferred to an agent.

## CTI call interactions operations

CTI integration with IMS and OF uses the `OpenframeInteractionUtility` script. You can use the`createOrUpdateInteractionForOpenframe` method from the utility script to create an interaction. For more information about creating interaction using APIs, see Interaction Management API.
