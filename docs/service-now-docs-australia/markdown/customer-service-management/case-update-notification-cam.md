# Case update notifications

Contacts, consumers, and contributor users assigned the Authorized Representative responsibility on a case receive all email notifications sent to the case’s primary contact.

Contacts added as additional contacts to the sold product with the Authorized Representative responsibility receive all email notifications sent to the case’s primary contact.

Consumers added as an additional consumer to the sold product with the Authorized Representative responsibility receive all email notifications sent to the case's primary consumer.

Internal users added as related parties to a case with the Authorized Representative responsibility receive all email notifications sent to the case’s primary contact or consumer.

For case resolved emails, related parties with the Authorized Representative responsibility can accept or reject the proposed solution. The responses of emails from related parties are treated similarly to the primary contact or consumer on the case. For more information, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

## Enable case update notification

To receive notifications when a customer replies to a case, related parties added to cases must be assigned a Customer Access Management \(CAM\) role, such as the sn\_customerservice.case\_authorized\_contributor role. For more information, see [Roles installed with Customer Access Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/r_rolesinstalledwithcustaccessmgmt.md).
