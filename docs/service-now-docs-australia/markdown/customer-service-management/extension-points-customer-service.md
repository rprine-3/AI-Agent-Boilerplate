# Extension points in Customer Service Management

Use extension points to call custom scripts in the Customer Service Management application.

To access the available extension points, type **sys\_extension\_point.list** in the application navigator and press **Enter**. Click the desired extension point to view the record details.

You can create multiple implementations for each extension point and provide an order number for each implementation. The implementation that has the lowest order number is the implementation that is executed.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_customerservice.CSMService

</td><td>

Defines the default value logic for case objects. Available with the Customer Service \(com.sn\_customerservice\) plugin.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_customerservice.CSMCaseSync

</td><td>

Use this extension point to customize the logic for parent-child case synchronization. This extension point can be used in one of two ways: -   Define the conditions for parent case records that can be considered for synchronization to child cases. The default functionality is based on the **sn\_customerservice.parent\_child\_ case\_sync** system property. Customers can add additional conditions using this extension point.
-   Customize the logic for parent-child case synchronization based on the state of the child case. By default, if the child case is in the **Resolved**, **Closed**, or **Cancelled** state, there is no sync from the parent case.

 This extension point is used by the CSCaseSyncHelper script include and is available with the Customer Service \(com.sn\_customerservice\) plugin.

**Note:** In the base system, parent-child case synchronization is available only for the Case table \(sn\_customerservice\_case\). This feature must be configured for tables that extend the Case table.
