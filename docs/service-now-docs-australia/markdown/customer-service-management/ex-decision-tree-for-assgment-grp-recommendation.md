# Creating a decision table for recommending assignment groups

Create a decision table with name **Assignment group for a router issue** that provides an assignment group as a result for a given product and problem combination.

This decision table requires two inputs:

|Input|Type|
|-----|----|
|Product|String|
|Problem|String|

For the result, create the Assignment group column with Result type selected as Reference and Result table selected as Group \[sys\_user\_group\].

Configure the decision table conditions, results, and values as displayed in the following table. For more information, see [Decision Tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/decision-table.md).
