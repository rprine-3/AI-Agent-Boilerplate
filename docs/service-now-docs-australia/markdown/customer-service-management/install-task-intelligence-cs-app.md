# Install the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application

You can install the Task Intelligence for Customer Service application \(com.snc.csm\_ml\_task\) if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Review the [Task Intelligence for Customer Service](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/892158dc7deec910f877d4d6a46b1d5f) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   The minimum version of the workspace required to support Task Intelligence for Customer Service application is CSM and FSM Configurable Workspace Foundation \(sn\_cwf\_wrkspc\): 24.2.1.
-   To enhance ML functionality, we need to set up three Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) within the Customer Service application. These ACLs are essential for granting the platform\_ml\_read role the necessary read access to the sn\_customerservice\_case table and its associated fields. For more information, see [KB1705485](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_knowledge.do?sys_id=4d3e9b1f93d15610f2167de86cba1061&sysparm_record_target=kb_knowledge&sysparm_record_row=1&sysparm_record_rows=228&sysparm_record_list=short_descriptionSTARTSWITHACL%5EORDERBYDESCnumber)
