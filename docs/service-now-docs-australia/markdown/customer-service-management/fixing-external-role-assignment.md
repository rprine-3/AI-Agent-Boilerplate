# Fix external user role assignments

You may have external users \(contacts or consumers\) on your instance that have been assigned internal roles. If so, you can use the Customer Service Management guided setup to evaluate and correct these role assignments as needed.

Because external users with internal roles can result in access issues, it’s recommended that external users only be assigned external roles.

Use the tasks in the Fix External User Role Assignment category guided setup category to evaluate the contacts and consumers with the following role assignments:

-   The snc\_internal role only.
-   The snc\_internal role and one or more external roles.
-   The snc\_internal role and one or more additional internal roles.
-   The snc\_internal role and one or more additional internal and external roles.

Review the list of users in each group and tag those users with incorrect role assignments. Then run the scheduled job to fix the role assignments.

**Note:** You can also review and update external user roles using a query-based list. For more information, see [KB0829930](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0829930).
