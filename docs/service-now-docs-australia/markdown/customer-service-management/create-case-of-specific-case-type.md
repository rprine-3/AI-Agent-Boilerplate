# Create a customer service case of a specific type

Customer service agents can create different types of cases by making selections from the case type selector.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent

## About this task

The types of cases that agents can create depend on the configuration of the [customer service case types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/customer-service-case-types.md) and [service definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-service-definitions.md) features. For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Configure customer service case types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-csm-case-types.md)
-   [Manage customer service case types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/manage-csm-case-types.md)
-   [Configuring service definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-service-definitions-configure.md)

In CRM Workspace, agents use the [Case type selector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-case-type-select-modals.md) to make selections and create cases.

**Note:** In the Core UI, use the Case interceptor to make selections and create a case.

## Procedure

1.  Create a case by selecting one of the following actions.

    The case type selector appears by default with the options the agent has for creating a case in the context of the record.

    **Note:** The `sn_csm_case_types.enable_service_selector` property which enables the case type selector is set to true for zBoot customers, and can be enabled for upgrade customers.
