# Configure Auto-Responder notifications

Configure the Auto-Responder feature for sharing relevant content in email notifications for deflecting cases.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Activate the Predictive Intelligence for Customer Service Management plugin \(com.snc.csm\_ml\). For more information, see [Activate a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md) and [Predictive Intelligence for CSM solution definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/predictive-intelligence-for-csm.md).

## About this task

When you install and activate the Predictive Intelligence for Customer Service Management plugin \(com.snc.csm\_ml\), the following related plugins are also activated:

-   Customer Service plugin \(com.sn\_customerservice\)
-   Predictive Intelligence for Contextual Search plugin \(com.snc.contextual\_search\_ml\)
-   Email Notification Script for Contextual Search Results plugin \(com.snc.adv\_cxs\_results\_email\_script\)

You can also configure the Auto-Responder feature for tasks other than customer service cases. For more information, see [Configure Auto-Responder for tasks other than cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/config-auto-responder-other-tasks.md).
