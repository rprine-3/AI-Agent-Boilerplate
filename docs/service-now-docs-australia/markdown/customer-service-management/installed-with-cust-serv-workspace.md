# Components installed with CSM workspaces

Several types of components are installed with CSM workspaces.

## Roles

The agent workspace user role \(agent\_workspace\_user\) is added to the Service Management agent \(sn\_esm\_agent\) role. The role is required to access Agent Workspace for CSM.

## Form views

Customer service agents see forms in the CSM Workspace form view \(workspace\_csm\), if they exist for certain record types. Otherwise, agents see forms in the Workspace form view.

## Tables

In CSM workspaces, a number of Customer Service Management tables are provided with the Workspace and CSM Workspace view layouts.

-   **Tables in Workspace view**

    The Workspace view is provided for the following tables:

    -   Case \(sn\_customerservice\_case\)
    -   Consumer \(csm\_consumer\)
    -   Account \(customer\_account\)
    -   Contact \(customer\_contact\)
    -   Account Relationship \(account\_relationship\)
    -   Asset \(alm\_asset\)
    -   Contract \(ast\_contract\)
    -   Product Model \(cmdb\_model\)
    -   Entitlement \(service\_entitlement\)
    -   Task \(sn\_customerservice\_task\)
    -   Appointments \(sn\_customerservice\_appointment\)
    -   Contact Relationship \(sn\_customerservice\_contact\_relationship\)
    -   Escalation \(sn\_customerservice\_escalation\)
    -   Order \(csm\_order\)
    -   Order Case \(csm\_order\_case\)
    -   Special Handling Notes \(sn\_shn\_notes\)
    -   Order Line Item \(csm\_order\_line\_item\)
    -   Asset Contact \(sn\_customerservice\_m2m\_asset\_contact\)
    -   Account Team Member \(sn\_customerservice\_team\_member\)
    -   Social Profiles table \(sn\_app\_cs\_social\_social\_profile\)
    -   Social Logs table \(sn\_app\_cs\_social\_social\_log\)
    -   Knowledge Applied to Tasks table \(m2m\_kb\_task\)
-   **Tables in CSM Workspace view**

    The CSM Workspace view \(workspace\_csm\) is provided for the following tables:

    -   Interaction \(interaction\)
    -   Location \(cmn\_location\)
    The CSM Workspace view for these tables is similar to the respective default platform interface view.
