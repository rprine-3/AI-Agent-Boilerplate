# Record time worked for a case or activity

Customer service agents can record time worked on a case or case task as well as time spent on other activities.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_agent

## About this task

Agents can record time worked from a case or case task. Time worked can be recorded regardless of the case or task state. Agents can also record time worked from the Time Sheets module by navigating to **Time Sheets** &gt; **Time Recording** &gt; **My Time Worked.**

When an agent creates a time worked record, a time card and time sheet are automatically created for the week based on the work date. The time card is created for the task and the category type. The total hours recorded on each time card are recorded on the current time sheet in the **Time Cards** related list.

## Procedure

1.  To record time worked from a Case form or Case Task form.
