# Auto-dismiss alerts in CSM Configurable Workspace

In CSM Configurable Workspace, alerts automatically dismiss after a set time to reduce alert fatigue and help agents stay focused. By default, Info, Low, and Moderate alerts dismiss after 5 seconds, while Critical and High alerts remain persistent until manually dismissed. Admins can customize the auto-dismiss behavior and timer duration for each alert level.

Admins can configure auto-dismiss alert behavior at the experience level either using UI Builder or UX Page Properties. This configuration provides control over timer duration and display options. Agents view alerts based on the configuration created by the admin.

Role required: admin

You can either configure this feature using UI Builder or UX Page Properties, depending on your preference.
