## Suspend a single sold product

Create an order to suspend a sold product and its hierarchy on the CRM Workspace. By suspending a sold product, you can reduce the number of canceled products or services and take the time to fix that product or service.

### About this task

After an order is created and marked **Complete**, the order to sold product flow is triggered after fulfillment. This flow enables you to suspend a sold product.

**Note:** You can also indefinitely suspend a sold product without creating a resume order.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_admin or sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  In the list view, select **Customer** &gt; **Accounts**.

3.  Open the account that the sold product belongs to.

4.  In the Sold Products related list, select the sold product that you want to suspend.

    **Note:** You can do a **Suspend** action on the root sold product only if it is in the **Active** state. The sold product must not have a specification that is associated with it. The **Suspend** option isn't visible if you select a child sold product.

5.  Select **Suspend**.

6.  In the Suspend sold product window, in the **Start date and time** field, enter the start date and time that you want to start the suspension.

    **Note:** If you fill in only the **Start date and time** field, a suspend order line item is created. A resume order line item is created within the same order header if the **End date and time** field is also filled in.

7.  Add a reason for a suspension in the **Reason for suspension** field.

    For example, a disturbance due to a renovation can be a reason for suspension.

8.  Select **Suspend**.


### Result

An order with the suspend action is created for the suspend order line items. If you specify an end date and time, a resume order line item is created as a part of the same order. When you update the suspend action line item to **Complete**, the sold product state automatically updates to **Suspended**. When you move the state of the resume action line item to **Completed**, the sold product state updates to the **Active** state. The **Resume** action is enabled only if you set the state of the sold product as **Inactive**.

## Suspend multiple sold products

Create an order to suspend multiple sold product and their hierarchy on the CRM Workspace. By suspending a sold product, you can reduce the number of canceled products or services and take the time to fix that product or service.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_admin or sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent

### About this task

After an order is created and marked **Complete**, the order to sold product flow is triggered after fulfillment. This flow creates sold products on the sold product table \(sn\_install\_base\_sold\_product\).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  In the list view, select **Customer** &gt; **Accounts**.

4.  In the Sold Products related list, select the sold products that you want to suspend.

    **Note:** You can do a **Suspend** action only on root sold products with a product offering and if it is in the **Active** state. The **Suspend** option is disabled if you select a child sold product.

5.  Select **Suspend**.

6.  In the Suspend sold products window, in the **Start date and time** field, enter the start date and time that you want to start the suspension.

    You can see the selected sold products in the accordian.

    **Note:** If you fill in only the **Start date and time** field, a suspend order line item is created. If you fill in the **End date and time** field, a resume order line item is also created within the same order header.

7.  Add a reason for a suspension in the **Reason for suspension** field.

    For example, a disturbance due to a renovation can be a reason for suspension.

8.  Select **Suspend**.


### Result

An order with the suspend action is created. Suspend order line items are created in an asynchronized process. If you specify an end date and time, a resume order line item is also created as a part of the same order.

When you update the suspend order line item to **Complete**, the sold product state automatically updates to **Suspended**.

When you update the state of the resume order line item to **Completed**, the sold product state updates to the **Active** state.
