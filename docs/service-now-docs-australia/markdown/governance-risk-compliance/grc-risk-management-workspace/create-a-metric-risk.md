# Create a metric

Create a metric to perform calculations on your data.

## Before you begin

Role required:

sn\_grc\_metric.manager, sn\_risk.user, and sn\_compliance.user.

## About this task

To create a metric, you need a metric definition and an entity. A metric definition defines the method for collecting the score for an entity. When a metric definition gets associated with an entity, it creates a metric.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Risk** &gt; **Risk Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Metrics** &gt; **Metrics**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table-create-metric"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the automated metric definition. For example, `Number of incidents`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Brief description of the automated metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to mark the automated metric definition as active.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Class

</td><td>

Class to which the metric definition belongs. The choices are as follows:-   **KPI**: Indicates how well the risk exposure is managed against objectives. Use this option to add entities and additional entities to the metric definition.
-   **KRI**: Indicates the amount of exposure to a given risk or set of risks. Use this option to add risks and risk statements to the metric definition. This option is available if the Advanced Risk plugin is activated.
-   **KCI**: Indicates the effectiveness of any controls that have been implemented to reduce or mitigate a given risk exposure. Use this option to add controls and control objectives to the metric definition. This option is available if the Policy and Compliance Management plugin is activated.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Method used to determine if the score is collected manually or in an automated manner. This field is automatically set to **Automated** but the value changes when you select the metric definition and gets updated to the type of the metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Key metric

</td><td>

Option to indicate if the metric is a key metric for your business.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Domain area

</td><td>

The workspace from where the metric definition is created. This field is automatically set. For example, if you create a metric definition from the Risk Workspace, then this field is set to **Risk**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enterprise Owner Type

</td><td>

Type of enterprise owner who is responsible for the automated metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **User**
-   **User group**


</td></tr><tr><td>

Metric Score Aggregation

</td><td>

Method used to summarize the score at the metric definition level. The choices are as follows:-   **Sum**: Sum of all active metrics.
-   **Average**: Average of all active metrics.
-   **Maximum**: Maximum value of all active metrics.
-   **Minimum**: Minimum value of all active metrics.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Value

</td><td>

Value obtained after the metrics are executed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enterprise owner

</td><td>

Enterprise owner of the automated metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Metric Properties

</td></tr><tr><td>

Direction

</td><td>

Direction of the automated metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **None**: If you don’t want any change in the metric direction, select this option.
-   **Minimize**: If the desired metric direction is downward or descending, select this option. For example, you want to minimize the fuel consumption.
-   **Maximize**: If the desired metric direction is upward or ascending, select this option. For example, you want to maximize the use of natural resources in your organization.
-   **Milestone**: When the metric direction isn’t applicable, but the metric is tracked against a milestone, select this option. For example, if your organization is going to launch a new renewable energy product in the market, the upcoming launch date is considered as a milestone.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Precision

</td><td>

Number of decimal places after the decimal point on a score.

 When an indicator has a Precision of 0, the indicator rounds the result to the nearest even, whole number. For example, if an indicator with Precision 0 calculates the values 7 + \(5 / 2\), the indicator rounds the result up to 10. However, if the formula calculates 2 + \(5 / 2\), the indicator rounds the result down to 4.

 When an indicator has a Precision greater than 0, the indicator rounds to the nearest decimal point for the given precision. For example, an indicator with Precision 1 rounds a result of 4.45 as 4.5.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unit

</td><td>

Unit for the automated metric definition. You can define the units in which the scores are shown. The most commonly used units are provided by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Nature

</td><td>

Nature of the automated metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **None**
-   **Leading**: If the metric is an indicator of future events, select this option. For example, consider the number of sales that a store makes on new solar batteries. This number is a leading indicator for the support requests that the store may receive in the future.
-   **Lagging**: If the metric is an indicator of past events, select this option. For example, consider the number of sales that a store has made in the previous year. This number is a lagging indicator for the support requests that the store has received in the past year.
-   **Current**: If the metric is an indicator of the current state of the events, select this option. For example, consider the number of sales that a store has made in the current year. This number is an indicator of the current support requests received by the store.


</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Method

</td></tr><tr><td>

Method Type

</td><td>

Type of automated metric. The choices are as follows:-   **Basic**
-   **Scripted**
 **Note:** If you select **Scripted**, you must save the form and select **Add script** to add your script. Only users with the sn\_grc.developer role can add scripts.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table that is queried for creating the automated metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Criteria

</td><td>

Condition for the record from which a score is obtained. Build a filter by adding conditions that contain a field, operator, and values and then click **Set**.**Note:** Select a value for the **Table** field before modifying this field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregate

</td><td>

Method to aggregate the automated metric definition score. When an option is selected in the **Aggregate** field, a new **Aggregation Field** is displayed next to the **Aggregate** field. The **Aggregation Field** displays the selected record. The choices for the **Aggregate** field are as follows:

 -   **Count**: Count of the number of records that are rendered by the table query that is set in the filter criteria.
-   **Sum**: Sum of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Average**: Average of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Maximum**: Maximum of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Minimum**: Minimum of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Count Distinct**: Number of groups in the result set that is grouped by the **Aggregation Field**.
 **Note:** The **Aggregation Field** is displayed for all the options except **Count**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reference field

</td><td>

Field based on which the metric data can be segregated. This field connects the entity to the selected scoring table and it calculates a score that is specific to an entity. **Note:** Ensure that the table that the reference field points to matches with the table of the records that the associated entities point to, through the **Applies to** field in the entity form.

 **Note:** It is the user's responsibility to validate the criteria mentioned in the note as the system doesn’t validate it. Select a table before modifying this field.
