# Risk Event Response Template form

Use the Risk Event Response Template form to define assignment rules. Rules automatically assign owners, approvers, issues, and Root Cause Analysis \(RCA\) tasks to risk events based on entity, event type, category, and impact thresholds.

See the following table for a description of the field values.

<table id="table_byk_bhv_jjb"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

Template number. This field is automatically set.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Entity

</td><td>

Entity that the template is created for.**Note:** When you select an entity in a Risk Event Response Template, the template applies to that entity and all its downstream entities unless a downstream entity has its own specific Risk Event Response Template. If a downstream entity does not have a separate template, the system applies the template from the nearest parent entity in the hierarchy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Category that the risk event applies to if there’s an occurrence. You can edit the category to apply one of the following options.-   **Personal**: For example, any physical harm caused to an employee.
-   **Legal**: For example, an employee conducts a business that is a conflict of interest.
-   **Information Security**: For example, a theft, burglary, or system crash.
-   **Human Resources**: For example, sensitive lawsuits by an employee against another employee.
-   **All**: Any risk event that is reported.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approval rule based on

</td><td>

Rule used while assigning the event. -   **Gross Loss**
-   **Net Loss**
-   **Expected Loss**

This field depends on the values in the **Event type** and **Sub type** fields. For example, -   If the event type is **Financial**, and the sub type is **Actual**, the approval rule is based on gross loss, net loss, or expected loss.
-   If the event type is **Financial**, and the Sub type is **Potential**, the approval rule is expected loss, by default.
-   If the Event type is **Non-Financial Impact**, the approval rule is Non-financial, by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Event type

</td><td>

Classification of the event based on the type of impact on the organization. This field determines whether the event has a financial or non‑financial consequence. The options are as follows:-   **Financial Impact**: Indicates that the event has an associated financial loss. Enter the amount. You can choose the currency.
-   **Non-Financial Impact**: Indicates that while the event doesn’t have any financial loss, it does have a non-financial impact on the organization. For example, non-financial impact can be negative market news or a decline in employee morale.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sub type

</td><td>

Classification of the event based on whether the impact has already occurred or may occur in the future. The options are as follows:-   **Actual**
-   **Potential**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Auto close event once approved

</td><td>

Option to select if the event must be closed after approval. Selecting this option results in closing of the event after the issue and root cause are closed. If a risk event has open issues or tasks, the risk event isn’t closed even after approval.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Currency conversion date

</td><td>

Currency conversion dates for the risk event entries. You can select specific dates for currency conversion rather than relying solely on the date of impact to calculate the net loss. The options are as follows:-   **Risk event entry date**

-   **First recovery entry date**
-   **Last recovery entry date**
-   **Custom date**
