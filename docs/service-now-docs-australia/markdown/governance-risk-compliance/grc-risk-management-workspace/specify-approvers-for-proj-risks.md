# Configure Project Portfolio Management and Advanced Risk integration

Use the Project Integration Configuration form to set up the risk assessment. You have to select the risk assessment methodology, the right assessors and approvers, and the formula to roll up the risk scores and show the scores at a project level.

## Before you begin

To use Advanced Risk Assessment for Project Management, do the following:

-   Activate the Project Portfolio Management plugin.
-   Activate the Advanced Risk plugin.
-   Enable the **Enable Advanced Risk PPM Integration** property under **Advanced Risk Assessment** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**. This property is automatically set to **No** by default. Only users with the it\_pps\_admin or sn\_ risk.admin roles can enable this property..

**Note:** Currently, in the Project Portfolio Management suite, advanced risk assessments are only supported for the Project Management application.

Role required: sn\_risk.admin

## About this task

As the risk administrator, you can select the following on the Project Integration Configurations form:

-   The risk assessment methodology \(RAM\).
-   The approvers and assessors for both enterprise risk assessment and project risk assessment.

Two predefined RAMs are provided for Enterprise Risk Assessment and Project Risk Assessment. You can modify the default methodology or create methodologies. If you select your own risk assessment methodology, then the entity class for that methodology must be Project. For assessing project risks and enterprise risks, you can add the approvers and assessors of your choice. The risk assessment methodology for project risk is automatically selected as the methodology that is associated to the Project Portfolio Management risk table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Advanced Risk Assessment** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Project Integration Configuration**.
