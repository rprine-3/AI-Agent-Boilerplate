# Performance Analytics dashboards for risk events and risk hierarchy

Use the Performance Analytics \(PA\) dashboards to view the comprehensive data for risk events and risk hierarchy. Use the Analytics Hub to view data for any time period.

By default, users with the sn\_risk.manager role can view data for six months. To view the data for different time periods, purchase and activate the Performance Analytics Premium plugin. Users with the sn\_risk.manager role can collate historical data for one year by running the ServiceNow® Governance, Risk, and Compliance \(GRC\) **Entity and risk statement historical data collection** job.

**Note:** Run the historical data collection job only once. Running this job more than once leads to inconsistent data collection and might result in a loss of previous data.
