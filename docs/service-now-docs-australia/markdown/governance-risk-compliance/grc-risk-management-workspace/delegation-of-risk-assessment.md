# Delegation of risk assessment

If a risk assessor is unavailable to perform a risk assessment, the assessor can appoint a delegate to perform the risk assessment for a specified time period. The ServiceNow AI Platform enables you to appoint your delegates.

Delegation is the assignment of authority to another person to perform specific activities. It is a process of entrusting work to another person. In the context of risk assessments, at times, it may happen that the assigned assessor for a risk assessment is unavailable to perform their risk assessments. In such a scenario, the assessor can assign another user as a delegate and the delegate can perform the risk assessment on behalf of the original assessor for a specified time period. A delegate can perform the risk assessment from the Risk Workspace and the Risk Portal. A delegate also receives a copy of all the system notifications that are sent to the original assessor. Once the delegate starts performing the assessment, the delegate's name is visible on the assessment instance.

As a risk assessor, to understand how you can assign a delegate, refer to [Configure a delegate for your tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_DelegateApprovalsTasks.md).

To delegate tasks to another user, configure your user profile form to display the Delegates related list. For details, refer to [Add the Delegates related list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/add-delegates-related-list.md).

It is important to note the following points when you assign a delegate.

-   The ability to assign a delegate is only available to perform an assessment. You cannot assign a delegate for approving a risk assessment.
-   After a delegate is assigned an assessment, the assessment shows the names of the original assessor as well as the delegate.
-   You can only assign an individual user as a delegate and not a group.
-   A delegate must have the sn\_risk\_advanced.ara\_assessor role to perform risk-based assessment.
-   A delegate must have the sn\_risk\_advanced.ara\_assessor to perform any object assessment.
-   All delegates are considered licensed users and are tracked for their GRC usage.
-   When the delegate logs in to perform the risk assessment on behalf of the assessor, the original assessor's name remains in the **Assessor** field. The new field **Assessor's delegates** displays the name of the delegate.
-   The delegate can reassign the task to another user.
-   The delegate can view the on-going assessments for the original assessor under **Tasks** in the Workspace.
-   The delegate can create issues.
-   The delegate can create risk response tasks and request approval.
-   All activity performed by the delegate is captured in the activity stream.
