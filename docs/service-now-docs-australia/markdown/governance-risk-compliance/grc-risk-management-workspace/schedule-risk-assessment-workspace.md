# Schedule risk assessments in the Risk Workspace

Schedule risk assessments automatically for multiple entities. The risk assessment scheduler helps the risk managers save time by automatically initiating the assessments based on the defined frequency.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk\_workspace.IT\_risk\_manager and sn\_risk\_workspace.operational\_risk\_manager

## About this task

In most organizations, the second line of risk managers is responsible for coordinating risk assessments. This group identifies the entities and associated risks that require assessment. They also determine the individuals responsible for assessing these risks. However, this continuous cycle of risk assessment demands that risk managers create individual risk assessment scopes and initiate assessments, leading to a significant loss of their time. To address this issue, the risk assessment scheduler can be used. By using the scheduler, you can schedule assessments and specify their frequency. The system initiates the assessments automatically based on the defined frequency. Additionally, you can designate the assessors and approvers for each assessment.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Risk** &gt; **Risk Workspace**.

2.  Select the list \[Omitted image "list-icon-risk-workspace.png"\] Alt text:.

3.  Navigate to **Risk assessment planning** &gt; **Scheduled assessments**.

4.  Select **New**.

    The Assessment Scheduler playbook opens the Scope definition stage, where you define the risk assessment methodology \(RAM\) and assessable entity.

**Note:** If you conduct an unplanned risk assessment before the next scheduled reassessment date, the subsequent assessment date is determined by the frequency established in the last assessment. For example, if your frequency is set as monthly and you conduct the initial assessment on January 1. Then, if you perform an unplanned assessment on January 15, the next assessment will still be based on the last assessment date.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Days to overdue

</td><td>

Number of days within which the assessment should be completed after it’s initiated. For example, if you define 10 in this field, the due date of the assessment will be set to 10 days after the date the assessment is initiated. The default value is 30.
