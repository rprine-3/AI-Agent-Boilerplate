Expected ALE

</td><td>

Annual Loss of Expectancy \(ALE\) refers to the product of the annual rate of occurrence \(ARO\) and the single loss expectancy \(SLE\). Expected ALE is the expected value of the ALE for the risk statement. Enter currency and amount for the expected ALE.**Note:** This value must be less than or equal to the **Maximum acceptable ALE**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sum of calculated ALE

</td><td>

This calculation is based on the sum of calculated ALE of all the underlying risks of the risk statement and its children risk statements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Maximum calculated ALE

</td><td>

This calculation is based on the maximum of calculated ALE of all the underlying risks of the risk statement and its children risk statements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Maximum acceptable ALE

</td><td>

Threshold value for the ALE for the risk statement.**Note:** This value must be greater than or equal to the**Expected ALE**. This value has an impact on the Tolerance status field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Average calculated ALE

</td><td>

This calculation is based on the average of calculated ALE of all the underlying risks of the risk statement and its children risk statements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Minimum calculated ALE

</td><td>

This calculation is based on the minimum of calculated ALE of all the underlying risks of the risk statement and its children risk statements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Calculated Score

</td><td>

The corresponding score for the calculated ALE:-   Low
-   Med
-   High
