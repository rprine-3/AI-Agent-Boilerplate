# Create a risk indicator

Create a risk indicator to identify the possibility of a future adverse impact on your organization. Indicators are an early warning system, and they enable you to take preventative action on the risks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk.manager or sn\_risk.admin

## About this task

Generally, indicators are automatically created using the normal process of indicator templates. You can also manually create new indicators. You can also create an indicator by using an indicator template. When you relate an indicator template to a risk statement, the risk indicators are automatically generated.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Risk** &gt; **Indicators** &gt; **Indicators**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

-   **Basic**: Basic indicators are automated indicators based on an indicator source. The indicator source specifies a table and a frequency at which the scores from this table are saved.
-   **Script**: Scripted indicators use a custom script to collect the data.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Target type

</td><td>

Type of the target value. The choices are as follows:-   **None**: Use this option if you do not want to set up any target or threshold for the indicator.
-   **Percentage**: Use this option to determine the indicator result by a percentage value.
-   **Count**: Use this option to determine the indicator result by a count value or total number.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Value mandatory

</td><td>
