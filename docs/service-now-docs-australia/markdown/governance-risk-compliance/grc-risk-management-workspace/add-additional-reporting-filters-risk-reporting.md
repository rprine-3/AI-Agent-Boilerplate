# Add additional reporting configuration filters for a Microsoft 365 configuration record in risk

Add additional reporting filters to specify at a granular level what data must be imported to the report from a table using the Management Reporting of Risk application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk\_advanced.ara\_admin

## About this task

When you specify that you want to import data from a particular table, you must also specify from which exact record of the table you need the data. For example, assume that you specify that you want to fetch data from the sn\_risk\_risk table. This table may have multiple records. Therefore, you must specify the exact record from which you want to fetch the data. You can specify as many filters as you require.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Management Reporting of Risk** &gt; **Microsoft 365 Reporting Integration** &gt; **Reporting Configurations**.

2.  Open the record for which you want to add the additional reporting configuration filters.

3.  On the Microsoft 365 reporting configuration filters related list, select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
