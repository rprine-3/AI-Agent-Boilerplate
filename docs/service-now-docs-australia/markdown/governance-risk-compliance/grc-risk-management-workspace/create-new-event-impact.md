2.  Click the Risk Event Entries related list.

3.  Click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

-   **General Ledger**: The book of accounts in which this event is entered.
-   **Booked Provision**: Refers to the amount that you set aside in your accounts to cover a future event. For example, if a firm sets aside an amount to cover a risk event that might occur in the future.

## What to do next

-   **Create or edit a new risk**

    Creating or editing a new risk for an event is useful for future prediction of risks. The information obtained from the risks is useful for scoring and reporting. For more information, see [Create a risk manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/t_CreateRisk.md).

-   **Link new control to risks**

    A control is used to prevent a risk from occurring. Linking the controls to risks lets users know which controls failed and why the risk event occurred. This information can be used for future predictions and reporting.

    **Note:** Only those risks and controls that are tagged to the impacted entity can be related to this risk event.

    For more information, see [Create a control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/t_CreateAControl.md).
