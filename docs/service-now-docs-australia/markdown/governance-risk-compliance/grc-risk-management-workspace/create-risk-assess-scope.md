# Create a risk assessment scope and initiate assessments

Create a risk assessment scope to define and identify risks for an entity. Identify assessors and approvers for assessments, and define the frequency of assessments.

    |Assessable Entity|Entities that are related to the entity classes that are selected in the **Applicable entity classes** field on the RAM.

    |Owner|Owner of the entity. This field is automatically set based on the entity owner.|

3.  Right-click and save the form.

    -   **No. of risks not assessed**

5.  Right-click to save the form.

    1.  In the Risks related list, click **Add** to add existing risks.

    2.  From the Choose Risks window, select the risks that you want to add.

    3.  Click **Add Risks**.

    4.  To select control objectives that do not have a control for the entity, click **Create from library**.

    5.  From the Choose Risk Statements window, select what risk statements to apply and click **Create From Library**.

    6.  Click **Initiate Assessments** either for all the risk records or for the selected risk records.

        Ensure that the selected records are in either the Draft or Closed state.

    7.  To add new risks, click **New**, fill in the details, and click **Submit**.

        The newly added risks appear in the Risks related list.

**Note:** When a risk assessment is canceled, the risk assessors are notified about the cancellation and the tasks are removed from their queue.
