# Update a metric definition

Update an existing metric definition to collect the new metrics. You can associate new goals, targets, and entities with the metric definition.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc.metric\_manager, sn\_risk.user and sn\_compliance.user

## About this task

You can use the same form for updating the automated metric definition, manual metric definition, and composite metric definition.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Risk** &gt; **Risk Workspace** &gt; **Metrics**.

2.  Select a metric definition from the list.

3.  On the form, update the fields as necessary.

It isn’t displayed for the calculated metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Child Metric Definition

</td><td>

Child metric definition associated with the parent metric definition. Displays the details such as name, frequency, and description of the child metric definition. To add a new child metric definition, click **Add**.**Note:** This related list is displayed only for the calculated metric definition. It isn’t displayed for the automated metric definition and the manual metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>
