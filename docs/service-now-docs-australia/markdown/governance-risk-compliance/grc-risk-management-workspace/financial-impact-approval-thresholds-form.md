Threshold amount

</td><td>

Option to specify the monetary value that triggers an approval requirement. When the financial impact of a risk event meets or exceeds this amount, the system evaluates the approval rules defined by this record. The amount is evaluated in the selected currency.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approver required

</td><td>

Option to specify whether approval is required when the threshold amount is met. When selected, the request can’t proceed until the required approval is granted. When cleared, approval isn’t enforced even if the threshold condition is met.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment type

</td><td>

Options to determine the risk event approver when the threshold amount is met. The selected assignment type controls whether approval is routed to a specific user, a group, or resolved dynamically from the associated entity. The options are follows:-   **User**: Option to assign approver directly to a specific user.
-   **Group**: Option to assign approver to a group.
-   **User field on entity**: Option to assign approver based on a predefined user field on the associated entity record.
-   **Entity stakeholder**: Option to assign approver to a stakeholder associated with the selected entity.

**Note:** This field appears only when **Approver required** is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approver

</td><td>

User assigned to approve the risk event if the threshold amount is met. This field appears only when **User** is selected from **Assignment type**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Group responsible to approve the risk event if the threshold amount is met. This field appears only when **Group** is selected from **Assignment type**.

</td></tr><tr><td>
