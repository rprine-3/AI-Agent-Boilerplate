# Create New Metric form

Use the Create New Metric form to create a metric.

Metric Properties

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name for the metric. For example, `Number of incidents- ACME Asia`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Brief description of the metric.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to mark the metric definition as active.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Key metric

</td><td>

Option to mark the metric definition as a key metric.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Metric definition

</td><td>

Metric definition associated with the metric.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Method used to determine if the score is collected manually or in an automated manner. This field value changes when you select the metric definition and gets updated to the type of the metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Entity

</td><td>

Entity associated with the metric.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enterprise Owner Type

</td><td>

Enterprise owner type who is responsible for the metric.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enterprise owner

</td><td>

Enterprise owner of the metric definition.

Metric Properties

</td></tr><tr><td>

Direction

</td><td>

Direction that you want to see the metric in. The choices are as follows:-   **None**: If you don’t want any change in the metric direction, select this option.
-   **Minimize**: If the desired metric direction is downward or descending, select this option. For example, minimize the number of risks assessments that remain open beyond their due date.
-   **Maximize**: If the desired metric direction is upward or ascending, select this option. For example, you want to maximize the number of critical controls.
-   **Milestone**: Option to select when the metric direction is not applicable, but the metric is tracked against a milestone. For example, if your organization has a goal to complete all the risk assessments for an entity by the end of the month, the upcoming date for the goal is considered as a milestone.

**Note:** Thresholds can be set for all directions excluding **Milestone**. For more information on creating thresholds, see [Create a threshold for a metric definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/t_create-threshold-for-metrics.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Precision

</td><td>

Number of decimal places after the decimal point on a score.

 When an indicator has a Precision of 0, the indicator rounds the result to the nearest even, whole number. For example, if an indicator with Precision 0 calculates the values 7 + \(5 / 2\), the indicator rounds the result up to 10. However, if the formula calculates 2 + \(5 / 2\), the indicator rounds the result down to 4.

 When an indicator has a Precision greater than 0, the indicator rounds to the nearest decimal point for the given precision. For example, an indicator with Precision 1 rounds a result of 4.45 as 4.5.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unit

</td><td>

Unit for the automated metric definition. You can define the units in which the scores are shown. The most commonly used units are provided by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Nature

</td><td>

Nature of the automated metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **None**
-   **Leading**: If the metric is an indicator of future events, select this option. For example, consider the number of sales that a store makes on new solar batteries. This number is a leading indicator for the support requests that the store may receive in the future.
-   **Lagging**: If the metric is an indicator of past events, select this option. For example, consider the number of sales that a store has made in the previous year. This number is a lagging indicator for the support requests that the store has received in the past year.
-   **Current**: If the metric is an indicator of the current state of the events, select this option. For example, consider the number of sales that a store has made in the current year. This number is an indicator of the current support requests received by the store.

Method

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table that is queried for creating the metric definition. This field is automatically set.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Method Type

</td><td>

Type of automated metric. The choices are as follows:-   **Basic**
-   **Scripted**

 **Note:** If you select **Scripted**, you must save the form and select **Add script** to add your script. Only users with the sn\_grc.developer role can add scripts.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table that is queried for creating the metric definition. This field is automatically set.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Criteria

</td><td>

Condition for the record from which a score is obtained. Build a filter by adding conditions that contain a field, operator, and values and then select **Set**.**Note:** Select a value for the **Table** field before modifying this field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregate

</td><td>

Method to aggregate the automated metric definition score. When an option is selected in the **Aggregate** field, a new **Aggregation Field** is displayed next to the **Aggregate** field. The **Aggregation Field** displays the selected record. The choices for the **Aggregate** field are as follows:

 -   **Count**: Count of the number of records that are rendered by the table query that is set in the filter criteria.
-   **Sum**: Sum of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Average**: Average of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Maximum**: Maximum of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Minimum**: Minimum of the values of the parameters based on the selected value in the **Aggregation Field**.
-   **Count Distinct**: Number of groups in the result set that is grouped by the **Aggregation Field**.

 **Note:** The **Aggregation Field** is displayed for all the options except **Count**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reference field

</td><td>

Field based on which the metric data can be segregated. This field connects the entity to the selected scoring table and it calculates a score that is specific to an entity. **Note:** Ensure that the table that the reference field points to matches with the table of the records that the associated entities point to, through the **Applies to** field in the entity form.

 **Note:** It’s the user's responsibility to validate the criteria mentioned in the note as the system doesn’t validate it. Select a table before modifying this field.
