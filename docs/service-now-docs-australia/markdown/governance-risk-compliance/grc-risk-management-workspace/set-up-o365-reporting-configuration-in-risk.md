# Set up Microsoft 365 reporting configuration in risk

Set up the Microsoft 365 reporting configuration records to specify the data points and reports that you want to import in to a Microsoft Word document for risk reporting purposes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk\_advanced.ara\_admin

## About this task

Data is imported into a Microsoft Word document for risk reporting purposes. You must specify which tables and reports from your ServiceNow instance must be used to import data into the Microsoft Word. You can also specify the columns from a table from which you want to import data. Only those reports that are either created by or shared with the Risk administrator are available for selection.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Management Reporting of Risk** &gt; **Microsoft 365 Reporting Integration** &gt; **Reporting Configurations**.

2.  From the Microsoft 365 reporting configurations list, select **New**.

3.  On the Microsoft 365 reporting configuration form, fill in the fields.

## What to do next
