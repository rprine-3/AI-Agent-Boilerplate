Metric data

</td><td>

Details of the metric data such as start date, end date, value, collector metric data, collection frequency, and type.

 Start date: The start date is the date the data collection begins.

 End date: The end date is the end of the period date that determines the interval for which the score is calculated. The end date depends on the frequency of the metric definition. The end date is used for tracking the scores. Every score is time-dependent and it has a reference to the interval end date.

 Collection frequency: The options in the collection frequency field are:

-   **Daily**: Score that gets created for each day.
-   **Weekly**: Score that gets created by the end of the week date \(Sunday\). Monday is the start of the week and Sunday is the end of the week.
-   **Monthly**: Score that gets created by the end of the month.
-   **Quarterly**: Score that gets created by the end of the quarter. For example, Q1 ends on March 31, Q2 ends on June 30, Q3 ends on September 30, and Q4 ends on December 31 in a year.
-   **Semi-annually**: Score that gets created by the end of the 6-month period. The end date for the semester is June 30 and December 31 in a year.
-   **Annually**: Score that gets created by the end of the year. The end date for the year is December 31.
