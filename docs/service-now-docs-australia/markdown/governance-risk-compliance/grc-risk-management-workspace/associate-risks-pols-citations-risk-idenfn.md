# Associate risks, citations, policies, and controls with a risk identification record

After the inherent assessment is completed, you can associate risks, citations, policies, and controls with the risk identification record. You can identify what methods to use to mitigate the risks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk.manager and sn\_compliance.manager

## About this task

Risks, citations, and policies can be associated manually or by using the recommendation engine. The recommendation engine provides automatic suggestions for risk, citations, and policies. The choice to enable the recommendation engine is made in the risk identification configuration record. The choice is available only for the business application table. For the recommendations to be enabled, the risks statements, citations, and policies must have information objects.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Advanced Risk Assessment** &gt; **Risk Identification** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the record for which you want to associate risks, citations, and policies.

    This is the record for which you performed the inherent assessments.

3.  Click **Associate Risks**.

    The Information Objects Mapping related list and the Risks related list appear. At this stage, you can either manually add risks or allow the recommendation engine to recommend risks.

    The controls are created based on the control objectives.

10. To move a control to the Attest state, select the control and click **Initiate Attestation**.

11. Click **Monitor** to move the record to Monitor state.
