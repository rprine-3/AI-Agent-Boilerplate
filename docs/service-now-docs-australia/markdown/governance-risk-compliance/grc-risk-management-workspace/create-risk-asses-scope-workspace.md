# Create a risk assessment scope in the Risk Workspace

Create a risk assessment scope to identify risks for an entity, define assessors and approvers, set assessment frequency, and initiate assessments using the Risk Management application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk\_workspace.IT\_risk\_manager, sn\_risk\_workspace.operational\_risk\_manager, or sn\_risk\_workspace.business\_op\_risk\_manager

## About this task

Creating a risk assessment scope ensures that assessments are effectively carried out, resulting in valuable insights for the risk management team and enabling informed decision-making. You can create a risk assessment scope with a guided experience using the playbook. Each stage within the playbook includes one or more activities that must be completed, providing a structured approach to the risk assessment scope. The playbook guides you through each stage, recommending necessary activities, and ensuring comprehensive coverage of the workflow. Stages can also include automated activities, such as auto-sending an email to the Assessor when you initiate an assessment.
