# Workflow of a risk using Advanced Risk

When you migrate to advanced risk assessment, you can view the various states of the risks take the necessary actions. This ability simplifies your view of the risk form.

When your risk administrator enables the **Migrate to Advanced Risk Assessments** property located under **Advanced Risk Assessment** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**, the life cycle of the classic or legacy risks undergo a change. You can also initiate a risk assessment directly from the risk form.

**Note:** Once you enable this property, you cannot disable it.

Prior to version 14.0, when the **Migrate to Advanced Risk Assessments** property was enabled, the risks were only classified as either active or inactive. Starting with version 14.0, as a risk owner, when you enable Advanced Risk, you can view the following states of your risks.

1.  Draft
2.  Assess
3.  Respond
4.  Monitor
5.  Retired
