# Create a risk event in the Risk Workspace

Create a risk event in the Risk Workspace. Risk events are potential or actual financial and non-financial losses, near misses, and gains that occur within an organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk.manager

## About this task

When you create a risk event, the risk event goes through the defined lifecycle of analysis, approval, and closure. Creating or recording risk events enables your organization to prevent similar events from occurring.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Risk** &gt; **Risk Workspace** &gt; **Risk events** &gt; **All events**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the following fields:

</td></tr><tr><td>

Financial gain

</td><td>

Option to show if the risk event resulted in a gain instead of a loss. This option is automatically selected if the risk event meets one of the following conditions:-   If **Potential** is selected from **Sub type** field and the **Expected loss** field or the **Potential loss** field has a negative value because of the gain.
-   If **Actual** is selected from **Sub type** field and the **Net loss** field has a negative value.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Used in modeling

</td><td>

Option to share the risk event records with external systems where advanced analysis is performed using simulation techniques such as the Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event.
