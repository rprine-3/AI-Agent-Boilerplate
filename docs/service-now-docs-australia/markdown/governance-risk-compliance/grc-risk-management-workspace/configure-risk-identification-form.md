# Set up risk identification integration

Before assessing an application, specify the target application where the risk identification must be initiated.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following applications:

-   Application Portfolio Management must be installed if you want the recommendation engine enabled and want to use the integration.
-   Application Portfolio Management integration with Risk Management \(com.snc.apm\_risk\_assessment\) must be installed. This application is required only if you want to use the integration.
-   Smart Assessment Engine and GRC Common Workspace Elements must be installed to use the smart assessment questionnaire during the risk identification. For more information, see [Configuring Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/smart-assessment-engine-cf-config.md).

Role required: sn\_risk.admin

## About this task

The Risk Identification Configuration form contains an entity type and a default identification record for the business application table. As a risk admin, you can either modify the default record or create your own configuration. The steps in this procedure are for creating a record. The Risk Identification Configuration form is used to do the following:

-   Gather information about the application by using a questionnaire.
-   Determine the criticality of the application.
-   Determine if an inherent assessment for the application is required.
-   Identify risks and map the relevant controls.
-   Choose to receive recommendations for risks and controls.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Advanced Risk Assessment** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Risk Identification Configuration**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
