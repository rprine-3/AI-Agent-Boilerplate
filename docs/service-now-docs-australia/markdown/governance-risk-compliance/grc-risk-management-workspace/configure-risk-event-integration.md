# Configure risk event integration

Configure risk event integration with other upstream ServiceNow applications. This integration enables all users in an organization to report and track the risk events.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk.admin and user\_admin

## About this task

When you configure the risk event integration with another upstream application, then users of that application can directly report risk events from the application. For example, if you configure risk event integration in the ServiceNow® IT Service Management \(ITSM\) application, all users of ITSM can report risk events from the ITSM application. By default, this configuration is provided for the IT Incidents application and the Security incidents application.

The two modes that enable the creation of a risk event are **Simple** and **Advanced**. The **Simple** mode enables you to define filter conditions on the application table so that users of the Incidents application can report a risk event. For example, you can define that a financial event with a high impact must be reported as a risk event. In contrast, the **Advanced** mode enables users with GRC developer role to write scripts.

Incident managers with the incident\_manager role are able to see the **Report Risk Event** option in an incident, whereas Security Managers with the sn\_si.manager role are able to see the **Report Risk Event** option in a security incident.
