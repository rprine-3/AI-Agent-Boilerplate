# Create an automated factor

Create automated factors to automatically fetch data from other data sources such as tables or database views.

## Before you begin

You must have the Governance, Risk, and Compliance Enterprise license.

Role required: sn\_risk.admin

## About this task

Automated factors help automate the risk assessment process. They do not to rely on manual inputs, and they thus reduce subjectivity. All the responses to automated factors are automatically calculated during the assessment.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Advanced Risk Assessment** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Automated Factors**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Response type

</td><td>

Options for users to respond to the factors. Choices are the following:-   **Number**: The factor response after automatic calculation will be a number.
-   **Currency**: The factor response after automatic calculation will be in currency.
-   **Percentage**: The factor response after automatic calculation will be a percentage.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment context

</td><td>

Context where the assessment must be performed. Choices are the following:-   **Risk**: Select this option to perform the assessment for an entity and for an associated risk.
-   **Object**: Select this option to perform an assessment on any ServiceNow record. For example, users can perform Exception Risk Assessment or Change Risk Assessment directly on an object.


</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Transform qualitative score

</td><td>
