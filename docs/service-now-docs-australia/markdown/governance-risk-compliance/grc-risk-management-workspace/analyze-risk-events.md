# Analyze a risk event

Analyze user-submitted risk events to determine if the risk event is valid and needs further processing.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk.manager

## About this task

When you analyse a risk event, you add more relevant details to the risk event that is submitted. During analysis, you can either reject the event if the risk event doesn't appear to be an actual risk event, or request more information if the information is insufficient.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Risk Events** &gt; **All Events** and open the risk event that you want to analyze.

    Alternatively, you can also navigate to **Risk Events** &gt; **New Events**.

2.  On the form, review the fields and edit them as necessary.

Additional Classification

</td></tr><tr><td>

Used in modeling

</td><td>

Option to share these risk event records with external systems where they want to perform advanced analysis using simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Full rapid recovery

</td><td>

Total loss recovered. Select if the total loss is recovered within a short duration and doesn't impact the organization. **Note:** Generally, a short duration refers to five working days, but this value can be configured according to your requirements.

</table>    The values in the Summary section, the values in the fields are calculated in the Event Impacts related list. For example, consider that a firm has a fire outbreak. This event can result in multiple direct and indirect impacts such as loss of information and business.

    If you enter the value of a direct impact as **$2000**, then the **Direct amount** field reflects the same value. If you enter two indirect amounts, each with a value of **$300** and **$500** respectively, then the **Indirect amount** field reflects a value of **$800**.

    If an external agency is hired to address the root cause of the fire outbreak, the cost incurred reflects an additional cost.

    If the firm was able to recover a part of the cost of the event in five working days, then the **Rapid recovery amount** field reflects the same amount.

    The **Gross loss** field reflects the total loss incurred by the event.

    The currency conversion rates impact the values displayed in the Summary related list. For example, if you enter a value of **300** Japanese Yen as the recovery amount, you see the amount in the concurrent USD value of **2756** in the Summary related list. This conversion occurs because the currency conversion rates are applied from the Exchange Rate table. For more information on how the values in the exchange rate table are calculated, see [Use your own currency-conversion rates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_UseYourOwnConversionTable.md).
