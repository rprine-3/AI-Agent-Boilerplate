    |Residual ARO|Probability that a risk will occur in any given year after all mitigation strategies are in place.|
    |Inherent ALE|Annualized loss expectancy `ALE = SLE x ARO` before any mitigation strategies are in place.|
    |Residual ALE|Annualized loss expectancy `ALE = SLE x ARO` after all mitigation strategies are in place.|
    |Inherent score|The score of the risk before any mitigation strategies are in place.|
    |Residual score|The score of the risk after all mitigation strategies are in place.|
    |Calculated ALE|Annualized loss expectancy based off all calculations.|
    |Calculated score|The corresponding score for the calculated ALE.|
