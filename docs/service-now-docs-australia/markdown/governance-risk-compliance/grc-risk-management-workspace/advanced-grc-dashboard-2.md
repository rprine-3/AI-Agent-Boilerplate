# Advanced Governance, Risk, and Compliance Application Risk dashboard

The GRC **Application Risk and Compliance Overview Dashboard** provides the latest view of risk and compliance aspects for the business applications that are used in an enterprise.

The Application Risk Dashboard is useful for the Chief Information Officer \(CIO\) and application owners. Both these users must have the sn\_compliance.reader, sn\_risk.reader, and sn\_audit.user roles to view the dashboard. Navigate to **Advanced GRC Dashboard** &gt; **Application Risk Dashboard**. The **Application Risk and Compliance Overview Dashboard** is displayed.

**Note:** To be able to view this dashboard, you must activate the GRC: Advanced Dashboards \(com.sn\_grc\_pa\_advanced\) plugin and the GRC: Policy and Compliance Management \(sn\_compliance\) plugin.

The Application Risk and Compliance Overview dashboard provides you a detailed report of the risk and compliance posture of all the business applications in an organization.

The dashboard highlights the following:

-   The compliance impact of applications in use.
-   The risk posture of applications.
-   The state of remediation and exceptions activity of the issues.
-   The audit activity around applications and status.

The dashboard provides answers to the following questions that are of interest to the CIO and the application owner:

1.  What are the key applications, and are they all operational and delivering the required services optimally?
2.  What are the policies and authority documents that the applications must be compliant to? Are the applications compliant to them?
3.  What are the risks faced by the applications? Are any of them high to raise a concern? Are there enough mitigations in place? Are there adequate controls in place and are they working effectively?
4.  For applications that need remediation, are the remediations being done on time according to the Service Level Agreements \(SLAs\)? Which are the applications that generate the maximum number of issues?
5.  Are exceptions being sought often on the applications and why? Are they within manageable limits?
6.  Are the applications due for audit any time? How have the applications performed on these audits?

The dashboard offers various representations such as bar graphs, donut charts, and trend charts. Application owners can use various filters on the dashboard to view reports related to the business applications they own such as, critical business applications, mandated controls related to specific business application, or high priority issues and so on.
