# Project Risk Overview dashboard

The project risk dashboard is useful for project managers and the enterprise risk managers. Using this dashboard, the project managers and enterprise risk managers can view the risk performance and the overall risk posture. This dashboard helps risk managers to reduce the overall risks in an organization.

**Important:** Starting with version 18.1.0 of the Advanced Risk and Risk Management applications, the Project Risk Overview dashboard is deprecated. If you're on a legacy release or already using the dashboard, you can continue to use it.

## Use cases

For examples of how different people in your organization would use this dashboard, see these use cases.

|User|Dashboard use|
|----|-------------|
|Enterprise risk manager|The enterprise risk manager can view the different enterprise risks and understand how many risks are critical, high, moderate, low, and very low. This dashboard provides an understanding of the overall enterprise risk posture.|
|Project manager|The project manager can select the project for which they want to view the risks. They can view the trend of the risks on a quarter-by-quarter basis, the number of risks assessed, the number of risks that affect the enterprise, and so on. The heatmap aggregates all the project risks that are assessed. It helps to keep a track of the bad risks and helps to manage them. This reduces the overall risk exposure for an organization.|
