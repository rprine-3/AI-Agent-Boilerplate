Basic details

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the automated metric definition. For example, `Number of incidents`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to mark the automated metric definition as active. When enabled, the metric definition becomes active and ready for use.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Brief description of the automated metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unit

</td><td>

Unit for the automated metric definition. You can define the units in which the data is shown.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregation method

</td><td>

The Aggregation method refers to the method used to calculate the metric data for all the entities. For example, when a metric applies to multiple entities, such as people, departments, or regions, you calculate each entity’s data and combine it into one score that shows overall performance. Your choice of aggregation method depends on your goal of metric collection. For example, if you’re interested in overall performance and want to account for differences in scale or size between entities, the sum or average may be more appropriate. If you’re interested in identifying the best-performing entity, the maximum may be more appropriate, while if you’re interested in identifying the worst-performing entity, the minimum may be more appropriate. The aggregation happens across time periods based on the frequency defined in the metric definition. If the frequency is monthly, the calculation takes place every month. The four choices for aggregation methods are as follows:-   **Sum**: The metric data for all entities are added to create a single score.
-   **Average**: The metric data for all entities are averaged to create a single score.
-   **Maximum**: The highest metric data among all entities is used as the single score.
-   **Minimum**: The lowest metric data among all entities is used as the single score.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Precision

</td><td>

Number of decimal places after the decimal point on a score.

 When an indicator has a Precision of 0, the indicator rounds the result to the nearest whole number. For example, if an indicator with Precision 0 calculates the values 7 + \(5 / 2\), the indicator rounds the result up to 10.

 When an indicator has a Precision greater than 0, the indicator rounds to the nearest decimal point for the given precision. For example, an indicator with Precision 1 rounds a result of 4.45 as 4.5.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Class

</td><td>

Class to which the metric definition belongs. The choices are as follows:-   **KPI**: Indicates how well the risk exposure is managed against objectives. Use this option to add entities and additional entities to the metric definition.
-   **KRI**: Indicates the amount of exposure to a given risk or set of risks. Use this option to add risks and risk statements to the metric definition. This option is available if the Advanced Risk plugin is activated.
-   **KCI**: Indicates the effectiveness of any controls that have been implemented to reduce or mitigate a given risk exposure. Use this option to add controls and control objectives to the metric definition. This option is available if the Policy and Compliance Management plugin is activated.

**Important:** This field appears only when the metric definition is created from the IRM suite of applications. It doesn’t appear for Operational Sustainability Management.

For more information on creating thresholds, see [Create a threshold for a metric definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/t_create-threshold-for-metrics.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Group

</td><td>

Area that the metric relates to. For example, the metric may be related to the stress indicators, failure indicators, and so on.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reporting classification

</td><td>

Tag used to categorize the metric.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enterprise owner

</td><td>

User who is the owner of the metric and is responsible for the metric. For example, for a metric such as revenue collection, the vice president or the general manager of the business unit could be the enterprise owner.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Nature

</td><td>

Nature of the manual metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **Leading**: A leading metric is predictive and helps anticipate future risk outcomes. For example, an organization may use a leading metric such as the percentage increase in control failures within critical processes. By monitoring early signs of control degradation, the organization can predict a potential rise in operational or compliance risk. Tracking this metric enables risk teams to identify emerging risk exposure and take preventive actions before the risk materializes or exceeds defined risk tolerance.
-   **Lagging**: A lagging metric measures the impact of past risk events or actions. For example, a lagging metric could be the number of risk events that resulted in financial loss or regulatory penalties during a reporting period. This metric provides visibility into the organization’s historical risk impact. By tracking this metric over time, risk teams can assess how effective past risk mitigation and control efforts have been and identify patterns that require corrective action. Lagging metrics help evaluate outcomes after risks have materialized and support improvements to future risk strategies.
-   **Current**: A current metric monitors active risk exposure across operations. For example, the number of active operational risks rated as high or very high helps organizations understand their present risk posture. Monitoring this metric enables risk owners to focus on high-exposure areas and initiate mitigation actions in real time.
