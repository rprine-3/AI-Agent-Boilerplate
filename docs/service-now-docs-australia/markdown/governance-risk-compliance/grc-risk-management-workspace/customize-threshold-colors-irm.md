# Customize threshold colors

Customize the available threshold colors by enabling inactive colors in the Color dictionary.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_risk.admin or sn\_risk.manager

## About this task

The Color dictionary includes multiple color options. By default, Amber, Red, and Green are active. Other colors are available but marked as inactive. Change the inactive status to make these colors available for threshold levels.

**Note:** The Color dictionary entry is in the GRC: Metrics application scope. If the current application scope is different, change the scope before editing.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Tables**.

2.  Search for and select **sn\_grc\_metric\_threshold**.

3.  In the Columns section, select **Color**.

4.  Review the colors in the Choices related list.

5.  For each color to make available, change the Inactive value from true to false.

6.  Save the form and refresh.


## Result

The color is available in the Color field when configuring thresholds.
