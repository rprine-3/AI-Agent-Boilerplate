</table>    -   When a control objective and risk statement are associated and the control entity matches the risk entity, the risk-control association is created.
    -   The risks and controls that are created after associating a control objective to the risk statement aren’t associated with the risk statement immediately. They get associated when the **GRC Profile Generation** scheduled job runs.
    -   If you manually delete a control from a risk, the control won’t be re-created by the scheduled job. You must manually create it again if necessary.
