**Update CSDM and other dependencies**

Scheduled job that gathers data from different applications including such as GRC: Advanced Risk, GRC: Risk Management, and GRC: Policy and Compliance Management, BCM, CMDB, and Vulnerability Response to calculate supporting data for various reports.

 The scheduled job runs once a day and removes all the data from the previous day before creating new supporting data for the reports. The job uses different conditions to retrieve the data from different sources and saves it to the Operational Resilience staging tables.

 Updates CSDM and other dependencies. It is configured to run weekly at midnight local time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies**

</td><td>

Calculates the red flags for the CSDM and its dependencies. It is configured to run daily at 3:00 AM local time to refresh the red flags.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:** Beginning with Operational Resilience release 22.x.x, the **Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies** and **Update CSDM and other dependencies** scheduled jobs are deactivated by default for new installations. For existing installations, these jobs retain their current state \(active or inactive\).
