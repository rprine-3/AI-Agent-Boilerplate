# Completing general administrative tasks

A user with the sn\_oper\_res.admin role can perform the setup tasks in the Operational Resilience application.

## Admin module in the classic Operational Resilience view

If you have the sn\_oper\_res.admin role, you can configure the Admin module and set up the administrative tasks in the Operational Resilience Workspace as shown in the following example:

\[Omitted image "admin-tasks.png"\] Alt text: Admin module in the classic view.

A user with the sn\_oper\_res.admin role can set up the following entities by using the Admin module:

-   Entity Types

    **Note:** Installing the Operational Resilience application inserts seed data to the Entity type \[sn\_grc\_profile\_type\] table. Both entity types and entity filters are installed as inactive. When you activate them, it could lead to generation of thousands of entity records.

-   Pillars
-   Scenarios
-   Event Groups
-   Events
-   Participant Roles
-   Important Choices
-   Importance and Impact Tolerance Rating Scale
-   Attestation Templates
-   Assessment Templates

**Note:** When you log in to the application as a user with the sn\_oper\_res.admin role, you can view the Admin module.

Operational Resilience administrators can create pillars and can also modify the reports on the dashboard.

**Note:** Though you can modify the entity types, their filters, and pillars as a user with the sn\_oper\_res.admin role, you must exercise proper caution while modifying them.

## Administrative setup tasks

As a user with the sn\_oper\_res.admin role, you can complete the following general setup tasks:

-   Create a scenario that represents a risk. For more information, see [Create a scenario and link it to an event](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/define-scenarios.md).
