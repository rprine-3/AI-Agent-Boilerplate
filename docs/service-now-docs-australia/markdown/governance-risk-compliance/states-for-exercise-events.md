# States for an exercise and crisis event

This section describes the states of progression for an exercise and crisis event.

## States for an exercise and crisis event

<table id="table_lmp_l5p_cyb"><thead><tr><th>

State

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

**Pending**

</td><td>

First state of the event.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Pending Approval**

</td><td>

State of the event when an approval is requested. When you select **Submit for Approval**, the event is set to the **Pending Approval** state. In this state, you can only update the **Work notes** field in the event form.

 If any approval rules are configured for the event, then the approvals are generated and sent to the approvers. If no approval records are associated with the event in the requested state, then you can either select **Reject** or **Approve**.

 You can view the approval details of an event in the **Approvals** tab with the name of the approver, level of approval, and state of the approval.

 You can view the approval history of the event in the **Approval History** tab such as the approval state, name of the approver, event number, and so on.

 **Note:** If you are a BCM program manager, you can see the **Approve** and **Reject** buttons.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Returned**

</td><td>

State of the event when an event is rejected. The state is set to **Returned**. It can be moved to the **Submit for Approval**, **Closed Complete**, or **Closed Incomplete** states. Since this action is related to an event only, you can update the description, results, and work notes in the form.

 When an event is in the **Returned** state, you can edit the state of the event asset.

 From the **Returned** state onwards, you can only add your comments and the attachments to the event task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Closed Incomplete**

</td><td>

State of the event when an event is incomplete.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Closed complete**

</td><td>

When all tasks are complete, the event moves from the **Work in progress** to the **Closed complete** state.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Approved**

</td><td>

Approved state of the event. When an event is approved, the state is set to the **Approved** state.
