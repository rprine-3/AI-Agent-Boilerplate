</table>## Roles created for BCM Professional and IRM Professional

-   The following roles are created for the BCM Professional users:

    **Note:** When the app-grc-bcm-lite applications are not installed, the users with these roles are counted as operators.

    -   sn\_oper\_res.bcm\_opres\_admin
    -   sn\_oper\_res.bcm\_opres\_manager
    -   sn\_oper\_res.bcm\_opres\_user
-   The following roles are created for the IRM Professional users:

    **Note:** When the app-grc-bcm-lite applications are not installed, the users with these roles are counted as operators.

    -   sn\_oper\_res.irm\_opres\_admin
    -   sn\_oper\_res.irm\_opres\_manager
    -   sn\_oper\_res.irm\_opres\_user​
-   When the following Lite applications are installed, the users with the sn\_oper\_res.bcm\_opres\_user, sn\_oper\_res.irm\_opres\_user, or sn\_oper\_res.user roles are counted as Lite operators.
    -   BCM Lite application: app-grc-bcm-lite \(Plugin id: com.snc.app\_grc\_bcm\_lite\)​
    -   IRM Lite application: app-grc-business-user-lite \(Plugin id: com.sn\_grc\_lite\)​
-   The sn\_oper\_res.admin, sn\_oper\_res.manager, and sn\_oper\_res.user roles are included in IRM.

**Note:** Starting with Operational Resilience, version 22.3.1, the sn\_grc.reader, sn\_grc.manager, and sn\_grc.admin roles require the IRM Professional plugins and are no longer granted through BCM Professional. If you previously accessed these roles through BCM Professional, you can use them only after the IRM Professional plugins are installed.

## Roles required for accessing the Workspaces

A user with one of the following roles can access the Operational Resilience Workspace and BCM Configurable Workspace:

-   sn\_oper\_res.bcm\_opres\_user​
-   sn\_oper\_res.bcm\_opres\_manager​
-   sn\_oper\_res.bcm\_opres\_admin

​A user with any following role can access the Operational Resilience Workspace:

-   sn\_oper\_res.irm\_opres\_user
-   sn\_oper\_res.irm\_opres\_manager
-   sn\_oper\_res.irm\_opres\_admin

A user with one of the following roles can access the Risk Workspace:

-   sn\_risk\_workspace.business\_op\_risk\_manager​
-   sn\_risk\_workspace.IT\_risk\_manager​
-   sn\_risk\_workspace.operational\_risk\_manager​

A user with one of the following roles can access the Compliance Workspace:

-   sn\_compliance\_ws.corporate\_compliance\_analyst​
-   sn\_compliance\_ws.corporate\_compliance\_manager​
-   sn\_compliance\_ws.it\_compliance\_manager​

## Roles used for reporting the incidents

The following roles are used for reporting incidents in the Digital resilience incident reporting module.

|Role|Description|
|----|-----------|
|sn\_dri\_inc\_rptg.digital\_resilience\_incident\_admin|Role for setting up administrative and Digital resilience incident activities.|
|sn\_dri\_inc\_rptg.digital\_resilience\_incident\_manager|Role for creating Operational Resilience and Digital resilience incident activities.|
|sn\_dri\_inc\_rptg.digital\_resilience\_incident\_user|Role for participating in Operational Resilience and Digital resilience incident activities.|

## Plugin dependencies for BCM Professional

For BCM Professional, the following mandatory applications are installed with Operational Resilience.

-   Business Continuity Planning \(com.snc.bcm.app\_bcm\_planning\)
-   Business Impact Analysis \(com.snc.bcm.app\_bcm\_bia\)
-   Crisis Management \(com.snc.bcm.app\_bcm\_exercise\)
-   Data Relationships Framework \(com.sn\_app\_grc\_relationship\_config\)
-   Optional: Vulnerability Response \(com.snc.vulnerability\)

**Note:** BCM Professional customers cannot install the IRM plugins. As a result, the sn\_grc.reader, sn\_grc.manager, and sn\_grc.admin roles are not available with BCM Professional. To obtain these roles, install the IRM Professional plugins as described in the "Plugin dependencies for IRM Professional" section. User can perform the same Operational Resilience operations previously available through sn\_grc.reader, sn\_grc.manager, and sn\_grc.admin roles via feature roles.

## Plugin dependencies for IRM Professional

For IRM Professional, the following applications are required and must be installed manually with Operational Resilience.

-   Advanced Risk Assessment \(com.sn\_risk\_advanced\)
-   Data Relationships Framework \(com.sn\_app\_grc\_relationship\_config\)
-   Policy and Compliance Management \(com.sn\_compliance\)
-   Risk Management \(com.sn\_risk\)
-   Optional: Vulnerability Response \(com.snc.vulnerability\)

**Note:** Installing the IRM Professional plugins also grants the sn\_grc.reader, sn\_grc.manager, and sn\_grc.admin roles.
