# Set up approval configuration

Set up approval configuration to enable multiple levels of approvals and select approvers for each level based on approval rules.

## Before you begin

You must install GRC: Approver Configurator \(sn\_grc\_appr\) application for approval configurations.

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin

**Note:** Granting this role to a user is equivalent to giving the user the admin role, because workflow script activities bypass access controls and grant access to all tables and database operations. Script activities do not bypass application scope settings.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assignment and Approval Configurations** &gt; **Approval Configurations**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_oyj_52z_hrb"><thead><tr><th>
