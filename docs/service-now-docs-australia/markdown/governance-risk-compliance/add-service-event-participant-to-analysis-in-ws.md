# Associate a scope and define the dependencies

Associate a scope by adding services and define the dependencies with the scenario analysis by adding services. You can then begin to analyze the impact of the scenarios and events in Operational Resilience Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **All scenario analysis** and open the scenario analysis that you’re working on.

2.  On the **Scope** tab, select **Add**.

    A list of all available services that are fetched from the Services \(OR\) entity type is displayed.

    1.  Select one or more services from the list and select **Add**.

        The selected service is successfully added as the scope of the analysis.

    2.  To add the scope related to a dependency, select **Add dependency related scope**, select the dependency, and select **Add** again.

        **Note:** In the Operational Resilience application, some of the services use specific dependencies. You can add the services that are related to a dependency. You must add one or more dependencies on the **Dependencies** tab, as explained in the previous step, before you can add one or more dependency related services to the analysis.

3.  To add a dependency to the scenario analysis, select **Add** in the **Dependencies** tab.

    1.  Select one or more dependencies from the list and select **Add**.

        The dependencies are displayed on the **Dependencies** tab.

    2.  To add the scope related to a dependency, select **Add scope related dependency**, select the dependency, and select **Add** again.

4.  Select **Save**.
