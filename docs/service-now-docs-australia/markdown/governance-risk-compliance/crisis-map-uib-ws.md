# Crisis map view

When you install the GRC: Crisis map application in your instance, you can view the Crisis map icon in the List view. You can integrate the Crisis map application with BCM and analyze real-time threat alerts from different locations in a map view. You can then take remedial actions and manage the crisis events from Business Continuity Workspace.

## Panels displayed in Crisis map

The Crisis map displays real‑time alerts from integrated threat feeds. Users can search locations, view assets at risk, and respond to alerts. Panels include:

-   Alerts panel for viewing and filtering alerts
-   Map view for exploring impacted locations

    **Note:**

    To enable the search functionality in Crisis map, you must set the **sn\_bcm\_map.use\_google\_places\_lib** system property. For more information on setting the property, see [Properties installed with BCM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/properties-bcm.md).

    To enable Crisis map functionality in the GRC: Crisis map application, you must set up Google maps. For more information, see [Set up Google Maps API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/set-up-google-maps-api.md).

-   Asset and task details for assessing risk and acting on alerts

A typical view of the Crisis map application is shown in the example.

## Tasks for BCM administrators
