# Configuring impact analysis dependency updates

The BCM administrators configure the Impact analysis dependency update configuration to schedule automatic BIA dependency updates based on CMDB data and relationships.

## Impact analysis dependency update configuration record

The BCM administrators access the Impact analysis dependency update configuration record by navigating to **General Administration** in the application UI. The record contains the configuration details such as the name, order, target records, sources, and notification preferences as shown in the example.

## Configure the sources for adding the dependencies

Configure the sources in the Impact Analysis dependency update configuration record to retrieve the latest BIA dependencies. As shown in the example, select the CMDB source to read dependencies from the Configuration Management Database. The BIA's **Applies to** field specifies the input asset. The system retrieves dependencies from the CMDB based on the asset defined in the BIA.

**Note:** You can fetch the latest dependencies of the BIAs from the CMDB relationships only.

## Auto-update the dependencies and set the notification preferences

The BCM administrators select the **Auto-update dependencies** option to schedule an auto-update of the dependencies in the BIAs.

The BCM administrators select the **Send notification** option to notify the BIA owners about the updated dependencies. The email notification contains the details of the dependency updates for the BIA records.

The snapshot records are displayed in the Pending updates record of the BIA from the list view. The delta snapshot record displays details of the BIA and updated dependency configuration such as Added, Updated, and Deleted assets for the BIA.

BIA owners then update the CMDB assets and dependencies manually by selecting the **Update dependencies** UI action displayed in the Dependency assessment of the BIA. The BIA owners or BIA approvers then review the dependency updates and save the changes to the BIA.
