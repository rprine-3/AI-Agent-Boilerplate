# Request an approval for the assessment

Request an approval for the Importance and impact tolerance assessment in Operational Resilience Workspace. With an approval, you can make sure that an accurate rating is assigned to your business services.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **List** &gt; **Importance and impact tolerance assessment** &gt; **All assessments** and then to the assessment that you’re working on.

    When an assessment is in the "Assessment Received" state, its owner can see the **Request approval** UI action on the form.

2.  To request an approval for the assessment, select **Request approval**.

    The state of the assessment is updated to **Pending Approval**. The approver of the assessment receives an email notification to approve the assessment. A message displays that the approval is pending for the assessment.

3.  Log into the instance and open the assessment as its owner and navigate to the **Approvals** tab.

4.  To approve, reject, or cancel the assessment, double-click the State column.

5.  To reject the assessment, update its state to **Rejected** and select **OK**.

6.  To cancel the assessment, update its state to **Cancelled** and select **OK**.

7.  To approve the assessment, update its state to **Approved** and select **OK**.

    The state of the assessment is updated to **Approved** in the State column of the **Approvals** tab and also in the **Overview** tab of the record. This completes the workflow of the Importance and impact tolerance assessment.


## What to do next

Having an approved Importance and impact tolerance assessment completes the workflow. To close an inactive assessment, see [Close the assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/approve-the-assessment-in-ws.md). Note that closed assessments are considered inactive.
