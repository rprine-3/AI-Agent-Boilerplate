# Configuring sources for adding event dependencies

The BCM administrators configure the sources in the Event dependency source configuration record. The impacted assets are added in the events and exercises based on the source data and relationships in the BIA, CMDB, and plans.

## Event dependency source configuration record

The Event dependency source configuration record contains the event dependency details such as the event record name, its target records, and sources as shown in the example.

\[Omitted image "event-dep-update-config-module.png"\] Alt text: Event dependency source configuration.

Dependencies are incorporated into events from all sources through the selection of the **Update dependencies** UI action by the user. When an event is created and linked to a plan, assets are automatically retrieved if the Event Dependency Configuration is active and includes the plan in Sources. You do not need to select the **Update dependencies** UI action.

Dependencies are fetched from these sources for the events:

-   BIA upstream dependency
-   BIA downstream dependencies
-   CMDB
-   Plan primary assets
-   Plan related assets

**Note:** In an event, the dependencies of all assets are added manually where the source is Manual.
