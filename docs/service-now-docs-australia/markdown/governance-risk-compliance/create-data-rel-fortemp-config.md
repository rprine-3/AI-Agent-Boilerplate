# Configure the data relationships

Configure the data relationships in the Template Configurations module, which helps you to navigate from a record in the template configuration to any table. When you create these paths, you can fetch necessary data from each of these records in the BCM report template.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_doc\_design.admin and sn\_bcm.admin

## About this task

When you create data relationships, you can specify how selected records are connected to the table \(for example, \[sn\_bcp\_plan\]\) in the template relationship registry. You can then establish a path to navigate to these respective records. You can create as many relationships as needed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Business Continuity** &gt; **General Administration** &gt; **Template Configurations**.

2.  In the Template Configurations module, open the template configuration that you created.

3.  In the Data relationships related list, select **New**.

    The Data relationship new record is displayed.

    \[Omitted image "data-rela-new-record.png"\] Alt text: Data relationship new record.

    You can add the source and target relationships.

    \[Omitted image "data-rel-record-source-rel-list.png"\] Alt text: Source relationships.\[Omitted image "data-rel-record-target-rel-list.png"\] Alt text: Target relationships.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
