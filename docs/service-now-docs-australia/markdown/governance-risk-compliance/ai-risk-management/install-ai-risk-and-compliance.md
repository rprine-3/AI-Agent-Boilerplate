# Install AI Risk and Compliance

You can install the AI Risk and Compliance application \(sn\_grc\_ai\_gov\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Review the AI Risk and Compliance application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to AI Risk and Compliance.

**Note:**

Some AI capabilities are available only when the required plugins are installed.

-   AI Risk and Asset Management capabilities in AI Control Tower with Now Assist require the AI Risk and Asset Management for Now Assist plugin \(sn\_aict\_irm\_aiam\), which depends on:
    -   AI Risk and Compliance Integration with Control Tower \(sn\_grc\_ai\_irm\_intg\)
    -   AI Asset Management \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt\)
-   AI Control Tower supports governance of both enterprise AI assets and ServiceNow AI assets, while AI Control Tower with Now Assist supports governance of ServiceNow AI assets only.
-   When AI Control Tower Core \(sn\_ai\_governance\) is used with AI Risk and Compliance in a new IRM deployment, the IRM Standard \(sn\_irm\_std\) plugin is required to make AI intake request forms available. These intake forms are used to submit requests through the Employee Portal for registering AI systems, AI models, and datasets for governance and risk evaluation.

    This requirement applies only to AI intake request forms and does not apply to AI cases, inquiries, or the Anonymous Reporting Center. For more information on applicable requests, see [Request an AI use case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/request-ai-system.md), [Request an AI model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/request-ai-model.md), and [Request a dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/request-dataset.md).


For information about AI Control Tower setup and plugin dependencies, see [Activation and installation of AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activation-and-installation-of-ai-control-tower.md).
