# Perform risk assessments on AI systems

Perform risk assessments on AI systems to evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential risks using the AI Risk and Compliance application.

## Before you begin

The Advanced Risk application must be installed to perform risk assessment on the AI systems.

Role required: sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_analyst or \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\]

## About this task

To confirm risk-based assessments on AI assets and risk roll-up function correctly, the **Migrate to Advanced Risk Assessments** property must be enabled. If the property is set to **No**, risk score roll-up does not occur. For more information, see [Set up Advanced Risk assessments properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/ai-risk-management/advanced-risk-assessments-properties-airc.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations:

    -   **All** &gt; **AI Risk and Compliance** &gt; **AI Risk and Compliance Workspace**.
    -   **All** &gt; **AI Control Tower \(Legacy\)**
2.  Select the list icon \[Omitted image "list-icon-airc-ws.png"\] Alt text:.

3.  From the Lists, open the AI systems for which you want to perform risk assessments.

4.  Navigate to **Assessments** &gt; **Risk assessments**.

5.  Open the risk assessment.

6.  To reassign the assessment, select **Reassign** and do the following:

    1.  Select the reason for reassignment.

    2.  Select the new assessor.

    3.  Enter additional details for the reassignment in the **Additional Comments** field.

    4.  Select **Reassign**.

7.  To initiate the assessment, select **Start assessment**.

8.  Respond to all the risk assessment questions or factors.

    Your responses are automatically saved, and the overall risk score is calculated.

9.  To change the computed risk score, do the following:

    1.  Select the **I would like to change the computed score** option.

    2.  From the **Override regulatory risk classification** field, select the appropriate value.

    3.  Enter comments that explain the reasons for the change in the computed score.

10. Select **Submit**.

    The assessment is sent for review and approval if it meets the criteria, or published directly if no approvals are required.
