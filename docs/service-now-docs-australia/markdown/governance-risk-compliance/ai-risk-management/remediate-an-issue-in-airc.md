# Remediate an issue in AI Risk and Compliance

After an issue has been created, reported, identified, triaged, and investigated, you can remediate it.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_admin, sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_manager, sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_business\_user, sn\_ai\_case\_mgmt.ai\_case\_analyst

## About this task

Remediating an issue marks an intention to fix the underlying issue causing the control failure or risk exposure. Accepting an issue marks an intention to create an exception for a known control failure or risk. Controls that are **Accepted** remain in a non-compliant state until the control is reassessed. In this way, the issue can be used to document observations during audits.

## Procedure

1.  Open the issue you want to remediate.

2.  Select the **Remediation Tasks** tab.

    **Note:** You have two options for creating a remediation task:

    -   Select **Suggested Remediation Tasks** and select **Copy** to use an existing task as a basis for creating this task. A copy of the selected remediation task is created with certain information from that task copied to the new task. You can manually complete the other fields.
    -   Selecting **New** and manually creating the task.
    **Important:** You can't assign a single remediation task or response to multiple issues at the same time. To remediate several related issues together, group them under a parent issue, then create the remediation task on the parent.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
