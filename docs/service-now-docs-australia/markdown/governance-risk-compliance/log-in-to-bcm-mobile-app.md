    If you aren’t already logged in to a ServiceNow AI Platform instance, the Instances screen is displayed.

</table>    3.  Tap **Save and Login**.

3.  On the ServiceNow login screen that is displayed, enter the User name and Password for the ServiceNow AI Platform instance that you want to add and tap **Login**.

    The BCM landing screen with the plans list is displayed. You have successfully logged in to the BCM mobile app.

4.  After you log in to an instance on your mobile device, it’s the default ServiceNow AI Platform instance on the device.

    If you want to view another ServiceNow AI Platform instance on your device, you must log out of the default instance. To log out:

    1.  At the bottom of the screen, tap **More**.

        The More screen is displayed.

    2.  Tap **Settings**.

    3.  On the screen that is displayed, tap **Logout**.

        The Instances screen is displayed with any ServiceNow AI Platform instances that you have added to the mobile device.

    4.  Tap another instance to log in to it, or, alternatively, follow the preceding steps to add another instance.

5.  Log in to the app using your credentials.

6.  Access the BCM mobile app interface.


If the instances screen for the BCM mobile app isn’t displayed after you tap the ServiceNow Agent app, verify that ServiceNow Agent is permitted as a trusted app. To permit access as a trusted app, navigate to the settings and general device management on your device and tap the option \(**Trust app**, and so on\) to permit access.

If an error message appears after you enter your credentials, verify that your username and password for the ServiceNow AI Platform instance are correct.

If you have problems viewing the landing screen, verify your network connection.

If you can’t view the Instances screen after you tap the ServiceNow Agent app, try uninstalling it from your device. Verify you have the most current version of the app from the Apple iOS App Store or the Google Play Store and try reinstalling it.
