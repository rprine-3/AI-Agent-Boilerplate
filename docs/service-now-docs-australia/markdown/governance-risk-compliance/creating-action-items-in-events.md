# Creating action items in events

Starting with BCM release 9.0.x, crisis managers can create action tasks for recovery members or teams anytime for open crisis events or exercises. Crisis managers can create these tasks on the fly without mapping them to event assets or recovery plans. These action tasks are also not included in the event recovery timeline.

## Action items in real-time

Action items can be used to assign tasks in real-time. For example, a crisis manager can assign an action item to verify that there are no injuries at a specific office location after an exercise. They can also request someone to review the business continuity plan before proceeding to the next steps.

You can also use action items to conduct assessments during a crisis event. For example, in the event of a fire, you can assign an action item to assess the situation, determining the severity, and identify affected employees and buildings. You can perform an assessment and assign an action item.

## Fields and states associated with Action items

The Action items tab contains these details related to the ad-hoc tasks:

-   Actual start date
-   Actual end date
-   Total time taken
-   Event \(Reference\)
-   Short description
-   Description
-   Due date
-   Task numbers
-   Type
-   Task
-   Assessment

The states associated with action items are listed in the table.

|State|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|**Open**|First state of the action item.|
|**Work in progress**|State of the action item when its work begins. When an action item moves to the **Work in progress** state, the system auto-captures its start time.|
|**Skipped**|Assigned state of the action item when it is not relevant. When an action item is skipped and considered not relevant, its time fields are removed, resulting in a total time of 0.|
|**Closed \(complete, incomplete\)**|Final state of the action item task. When an action item has been completed, the system auto-captures its end time.|

BCM managers or planners can update the action items and can re-open the ad-hoc tasks associated with them.

You can assign the action item tasks to the groups or team members by using these fields:

-   **Assignment group**
-   **Assigned to**
-   **Additional assignee list**

## Comparison between event tasks and action items

The action items are distinct from the event tasks in crises and events. The table outlines the differences between event tasks and action items.
