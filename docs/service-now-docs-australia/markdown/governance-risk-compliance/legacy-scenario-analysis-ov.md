# Legacy scenario analysis

By performing a scenario analysis, you can determine the risks that might impact your business. You can analyze the impact of the scenarios and events on your business services. You can also track the actions and improvements from the scenario analysis in Operational Resilience Workspace.

## Scenario analysis process

Scenarios represent the business-specific risks that are used to test how events can impact your organization. By performing a scenario analysis, you can analyze the impact of the scenarios and their associated events on your business services. Each service has a few dependencies associated with it. The **Compute Operational Resilience Compliance** scheduled job runs in the background and populates the dependencies for the services. As an owner of the scenario analysis, you can request a plan approval.

When a plan approver approves the plan approval, it triggers a response task for the scenario analysis. Participants of the analysis work on the response tasks and add their observations on the analysis.

As an owner of the scenario analysis, you can verify the status of the services and calculate the possible disruptions. After the response tasks have been completed, you can request an analysis approval for your scenario analysis. When an analysis approver approves the scenario analysis, you can close it and monitor its status in Operational Resilience Workspace.

**Note:** Starting with Operational Resilience, version 22.3.1, the advanced scenario analysis experience is displayed in the Operational Resilience Workspace by default. To enable the legacy scenario analysis entry points, see [Enable the legacy scenario analysis flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/activate-scenario-analysis-legacy-flow.md).

## Tasks to set up the legacy scenario analysis

If you've got the sn\_oper\_res.manager role, you can set up the legacy scenario analysis as follows:

1.  Create a scenario that helps you to determine the risks that are applicable to your business.
2.  Assign an owner, a plan approver, and an analysis approver to the scenario analysis in the scenario analysis form.
3.  Add the scope and dependencies that are applicable to your scenario.
4.  Associate one or more scenario events with the scenario analysis. Add the participants, services, dependencies, and issues that are specific to a scenario event. When a scenario event is associated with a participant, a response task is automatically generated on the **Responses** tab and it’s assigned to the participants.
5.  Send the scenario analysis to the plan approver of the scenario analysis and request for a plan approval.
6.  Collect the observations, gaps, and recommendations from the participants about the scenario analysis event. The participants of a scenario event are the users with at least the sn\_oper\_res.user roles from the associated business functions, such as Finance or HR departments.
7.  Compare the impact tolerance with the disruption duration to determine if any service was breached.
8.  Close the open response tasks and open scenario events that are associated with your scenario analysis.
9.  Send the scenario analysis to the analysis approver for a review and request an approval for the scenario analysis.
10. Close the scenario analysis and monitor its status in Operational Resilience Workspace.

</table>## Fetching the service entities from the Services \(OR\) entity type

The Operational Resilience application fetches the service entities from the Services \(OR\) entity type as shown in the following example.

\[Omitted image "entity-type-module-view-in-list-4.png"\] Alt text: Services OR entity type.

Users with the sn\_oper\_res.admin role can view the Entity Types module and its related lists in the Operational Resilience application UI as shown in the following example.

\[Omitted image "entities-under-services-or-entity-type-5.png"\] Alt text: Service entities under the Services OR entity type.

**Note:** You can only select the entities that belong to the Facilities, People, Suppliers, and Technology pillars. The Services and Processes pillars are filtered out from the list of the pillars for the entities.

## Dependencies for the services

Each service has a few dependencies associated with it. The **Compute Operational Resilience Compliance** scheduled job runs in the background and populates the dependencies for the services. The following example shows that the Addison, TX United States HVAC entity is listed as a dependency for supporting the Faster Retail Payments service.

\[Omitted image "dependencies.png"\] Alt text: Dependencies for the services.

You can only select the dependencies that belong to the Facilities, People, Suppliers, and Technology pillars. The Services and Processes pillars are filtered out from the list of the pillars for the dependencies.

## Response tasks

As a scenario analysis owner, when you create a scenario event and add a participant to it, a response task is automatically created for the participant. When a participant is assigned to a scenario event, a response task is created. An email notification is automatically sent to the participant.

On the **Responses** tab, the details of the response task such as the response task number, name of the assigned participant, and state of the response task are displayed.

The owner of the scenario event can add a service and a dependency to the response task. The assignee of the response task can complete the response task, add their notes about the scenario event, and update the impact duration of the scenario event.

\[Omitted image "sce-event-notes.png"\] Alt text: Notes about the scenario event.

## Known issue for upgrading from Release 15.x.x to Release 16.x.x

When upgrading from Release 15.x.x to 16.x.x, a response task is not created automatically if a scenario analysis is in the **Analyze** state and a participant is already added. This is a known issue.

As a workaround for this issue, the Operational Resilience manager must remove the participants from the scenario analysis and add them to the same scenario analysis. The Operational Resilience application then automatically creates a response task for the scenario analysis.

**Note:** You can also choose to proceed with the scenario analysis without a response task.

## Summary of the services, scenarios, disruptions, and events

You can view information on the services, scenarios, disruptions, and events in the Summary panel as shown in the following example.

\[Omitted image "summary-panel.png"\] Alt text: Summary panel of the scenario analysis form.

The Summary panel provides information about the business services, associated scenarios, disruptions, and events. For a description of the field values, see the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Number of services|Number of services that are associated with the scenario analysis.|
|Number of services under impact tolerance|Number of services that are associated with the scenario analysis and that are under the impact tolerance.|
