# BIA states and UI actions

When you create a business impact analysis \(BIA\), certain UI actions are associated with each state.

## States and associated UI actions in BIA

The states and their UI associated actions in a business impact analysis are described in the table.

<table id="table_amh_4kb_cv"><thead><tr><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

**Draft**

</td><td>

In the Business Impact Analysis record Lists view, select **New**.

 **Note:** You can also navigate to the Business Impact Analysis section of the Home page and select **Create BIA**.

</td><td>

When you select **New** in the Create New Impact analysis form or **Create BIA** in the Home page, a record is created in the **Draft** state by default.

 On the **Details** tab, you can add details of the business impact analysis \(BIA\). On the **Assessments** tab, you can respond to the Recovery point objective assessment, Recovery time objective assessment, and Dependency assessment.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**In review**

</td><td>

Select **Submit for review**.

</td><td>

When you select **Submit for review** in the Create New Impact analysis form, the state of the business impact analysis is updated to **In review**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Pending approval**

</td><td>

Select **Submit for approval**.

</td><td>

When you select **Submit for approval** in the Create New Impact analysis form, the state of the business impact analysis is updated to **Pending approval**.

 In the **Pending approval** state, the business impact analysis is not editable. You cannot add items to a Dependency assessment because the **Add** and **Add first level CMDB dependencies** actions are unavailable until the business impact analysis returns to an editable state.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Approved**

</td><td>

Select **Approve**.

</td><td>

When you select **Approve** in the Create New Impact analysis form, the state of the business impact analysis is updated to **Approved**. The **Overview** tab displays the progression of the states as shown in the example.

 \[Omitted image "bia-analysis-approved-overview-tab-states-progression.png"\] Alt text: BIA in the Approved state.

 When the business impact analysis is in the **Approved** state, it is in the read-only format. You can only view the Recovery point objective assessment, Recovery time objective assessment, and Dependency assessment in the **Approved** state.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Archived**

</td><td>

In the Create New Impact analysis form, select **Archive**.

</td><td>

When you select **Archive** in the Create New Impact analysis form, the state of the business impact analysis is updated to **Archived** as shown in the example.

 \[Omitted image "bia-archived.png"\] Alt text: Archived BIA.

 Starting with BCM release 9.0.x, you can revert an archived business impact analysis \(BIA\) to the **Draft** state by selecting the **Edit** button on the form.

 You can perform additional UI actions in the Create New Impact analysis form:

-   **Generate PDF**

Download the PDF of the business impact analysis for reference. The PDF attachment is available in the **Activity** panel on the **Details** tab.
