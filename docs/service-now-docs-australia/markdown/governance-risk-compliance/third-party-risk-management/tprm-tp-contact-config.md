# Set up third-party contacts

Set up your third-party contacts so that you can send assessments, address issues, and communicate any additional required information with these contacts using Third-party Risk Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager and admin for steps 4 and 5

## About this task

Third-party contacts are external users at the third-party organization. They use the Third-party portal to securely organize, prioritize, and perform tasks like responding to questionnaires for assessments, performing tasks, and communicating with your risk-assessment staff regarding issues. You grant access to the Third-party portal and specify the permissions for third-party contacts. The third-party risk \(TPR\) manager must contact a team member with the admin role to complete steps 4 and 5.

**Important:** The third-party contact role should be used only for external contacts. The role prohibits access to your ServiceNow AI Platform instance and grants access only to the Third-party portal.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Third Parties** &gt; **Third-party Contacts** to determine whether a third-party contact has already been assigned.

    The number of contacts is listed for each third party on the third-party contacts page.

2.  On the third-party contacts page, select a third party to view the list of associated contacts.

    -   To manage existing contacts:

        -   Select each contact to verify that the contact is associated with the appropriate third party, is active, and, if applicable, is specified as the primary contact.

            **Note:** The questionnaires, document requests, and issues that are currently assigned to the contact are listed in the associated tab.

        -   If you don't have the admin role, ask a user who does to verify that the vendor\_contact role appears for the user on the Roles related list. If the user with the admin role can't see the Roles related list, they have to go to step 4. If the user with the admin role can't see the vendor\_contact role listed for the user, they have to go to step 5.
        **Note:** For more information on managing third-party contacts, see [Manage the access for your third-party contacts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-manage-tp-contact.md).

    -   To add a contact, select **New** and continue with the following steps.
    **Note:** It’s normal for a contact to have the snc\_external role because the vendor\_contact role includes it.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
