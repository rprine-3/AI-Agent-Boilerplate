# Create a document version

Use the document management system to version documents in Third-Party Risk Management \(TPRM\).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor

## About this task

A document can have many versions. You can view these versions as a related list within the document record.

The term "document" refers to the container record that holds document information such as its name, description, type and other metadata. While the document record doesn’t contain the actual document file, it does contain versions in the record, which you can open, update, and track.

Use the attachment icon \[Omitted image "Form\_Attachment.png"\] Alt text: to add documents to a record.

Alternatively, you can provide the link to a document in the URL field. You then access the actual documents by selecting the versions in the related list.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text:\) and then navigate to **All Documents**.

2.  Select the document record that you want and then the **Versions** tab.

3.  Select **New** to add a version.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_cyz_r34_ycd"><thead><tr><th>

</table>5.  Select **Save** to save the document record.


## What to do next

After saving the document record, complete the following tasks to finalize the document setup:

-   Define who can view, edit, or manage the document using the sharing permissions field. For more information, see [Define document sharing permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-doc-share-permissions.md).
-   Link references by associating the document with relevant records such as assessments, engagements, issues, or tasks to enable roll-up and traceability. For more information, see [Link documents to a TPRM record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-link-document.md).
