# Configuring Third-party Risk Management

You can activate or upgrade TPRM, by downloading the applications from the ServiceNow Store and then configuring the settings to meet your needs.

## Configuration overview

By performing the tasks in the Setup tasks for TPRM checklist, you can upgrade or install the TPRM application. After you’ve completed the tasks, you can perform additional configuration as described in [Classic assessment configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-ongoing-config.md).

**Note:**

For any custom messages you create, it is your responsibility to generate the corresponding `sys_ui_message` records. This step is crucial if you want the custom messages to be extracted and translated.
