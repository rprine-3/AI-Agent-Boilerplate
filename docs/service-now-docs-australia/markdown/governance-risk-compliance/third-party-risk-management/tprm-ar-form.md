-   Approver from source: Users or groups from the source table.
-   Dynamic approvers: Approvers that are selected dynamically from any table.
-   Scripted approvers: Script to determine your approvers. In the following example, a new approval rule record is shown with Scripted approvers as the selected **Approver type**. A script is started where you can update the parent, users, and groups parameters.

**Note:**

For security reasons, a user with the admin role doesn’t have write access to the **Script** field on the Approval Rule form. Only the Approver Configurator developer has create and write access to the **Script** field on the Approval Rule form.

If you have the admin role, you can set up an approval rule only with the following types of approvers from the Approver type list:

-   Specific approvers
-   Approver from source
