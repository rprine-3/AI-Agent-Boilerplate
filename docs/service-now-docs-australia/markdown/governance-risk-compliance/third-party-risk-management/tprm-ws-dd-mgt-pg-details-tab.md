# Due diligence request process management

From the Details tab, you can view and adjust the due diligence request information for a third party. You can also log external-facing comments and private work notes, attach files, and track request updates in the activity stream.

The **Details** tab for a due diligence request displays information in the following sections:

## Third-party due diligence request

<table id="table_drw_dbj_fyb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

For each due diligence request, the system auto-assigns a unique ID number that starts with the text DDR.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

Current state in the due diligence process: IRQ, external due diligence, approval, contract risk, or closed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Request Type

</td><td>

-   **Onboard a new engagement.** Start the onboarding process for a new engagement with an existing third party.
-   **Reassess an existing engagement.** Reassess an existing engagement when the conditions change. For example, let's say that you hear adverse news or have changes in your third-party's supply lines. You might want to reassess the risk by conducting additional due diligence.
-   **Reassess an existing engagement for contract renewal.** Reassess the risk before your organization renews the contract with a current third party or engagement by conducting due diligence.
-   **Offboard an engagement with due diligence.** Determine if offboarding \(terminating the relationship\) with an engagement is the optimal course of action by conducting due diligence. For example, it might be too risky to switch third parties or engagements even if their current performance doesn’t meet expectations.
-   **Offboard an engagement with NO due diligence.** Request that an engagement be permanently terminated when an engagement ends or you want to switch to a different third party for other reasons. In this case, you typically don't need to conduct additional due diligence. The process does, however, include the normal Inherent Risk Questionnaire \(IRQ\) process to confirm that the services provided by the engagement will no longer continue.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Priority

</td><td>

Priority of the request.-   **1 - Critical**
-   **2- High**
-   **3 - Moderate**
-   **4 - Low**

 **Note:** After the due diligence request is submitted by the requester, the TPR manager or due diligence request owner can update this field to an existing engagement by selecting the magnifying glass icon \[Omitted image "magnifying-glass-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:. This helps avoid onboarding existing engagements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Skip contract risk process

</td><td>

Option to skip the contract risk process. When you select the check box, you bypass the `contract negotiation` state. The **Contract start date** and **Contract expiration date** fields are replaced with **Engagement start date** and **Engagement expiration date**. See [Contract Risk process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-workflow-in-workspace.md).

**Note:** After the Third-party risk \(TPR\) manager approves the request, it won’t be sent to the contract negotiators, and the request is closed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

Qualified group of individuals available to work on the request.

 For new requests, the **Assignment group** is set to **Due diligence request assigners**. The system sends an email notification to all users in the group that is specified in the **Assignment group**. The message states that the request was received and is in the **New** state. The message also includes a link to the details page for the request.

 On the due diligence request form:

 -   Any member of the group can select **Assign to me** or set the **Owner** field to any other member of the group.
-   A TPR manager or TPR assessor can clear the **Assignment group** field or change the value to select from different TPR assessors in the **Owner** selection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assigned to

</td><td>

The individual assigned to the due diligence request.

 The owner is responsible for confirming that the assessment is completed in a timely fashion by the third party, reviewing their responses, and creating and resolving issues. To drive the assessment to its completion, owners are notified when an assessment reaches a particular milestone. The owner must have the TPR manager or TPR assessor role.
