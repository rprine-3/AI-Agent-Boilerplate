# Create records in bulk

Create records in bulk from the Digital resilience third-party registers using Third-party Risk Management rather than creating one record at a time for single or multiple entities. You can save time and effort by working on multiple records at a time.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_admin

## About this task

Only DORA administrators can view the **Upload** option and perform this task.

**Note:** Annual expense data is used during report generation for conversion and aggregation. Confirm that currencies and annual expense fields are accurate to avoid conversion failures or skipped aggregation.

**Note:** When uploading Legal entity, Branch, Third party, or Third-party engagement records that include LEI codes, LEI codes are batch-validated against the GLEIF database before rows are processed. The **Save rows with LEI GLEIF errors during Excel upload** system property controls whether rows with GLEIF data failures are saved or blocked. Format and checksum failures always block rows regardless of this setting. For more information, see [Validate Legal Entity Identifier codes for DORA reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-valid-lei.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then navigate to **Digital resilience third-party registers**.

2.  Select **Excel download/upload requests** and then create an Excel upload request by selecting **New**.

    **Note:** Only DORA administrators can see the **Upload** option and perform this task.

3.  On the form, select **Upload** as the request type and fill in the remaining fields.

    For descriptions of all these fields, see [Create New Excel download/upload request form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-excel-upload-download-req.md).

    **Note:** You can only upload one type of record for each upload request. For example, if you made an upload request for Assessment records, you can only include Assessment record information in the template.

4.  Select **Save**.

    A template file is generated and available for download.

5.  Download the default template by selecting **Download template** and fill it out.

    You can view instructions for filling out the template by navigating to the **Instructions** tab of the template file. You can add your record creation information by navigating to the **Digital resilience information** tab and filling out the template.

6.  Attach the completed template file by selecting **Attach File** and selecting the file from your local hard drive.

7.  Select **Upload**.

8.  Navigate to the **Result** section of the upload request to view the records that were uploaded successfully and any errors.

    1.  Correct the errors in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

9.  Repeat the steps until all errors are resolved and all records are uploaded successfully.

    The records are uploaded in bulk from the Digital resilience third-party registers.
