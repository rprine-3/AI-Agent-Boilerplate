# Guidelines for importing spreadsheet data

Before you try to import the questionnaire data from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet into Third-party Risk Management tables, you must verify that its format meets particular guidelines.

## Property settings that affect spreadsheet data

You can specify the following property settings:

-   **Text delimiter in spreadsheets \[`sn_vdr_risk_asmt.excel_choice_delimiter`\]**

    Character string that separates response text in questions of type ‘Choice’ and ‘Multiple Selection’.

    Common delimiters: \\r, \\n, \\t, \\r\\n, and the comma character.

-   **Maximum spreadsheet file size \[`sn_vdr_risk_asmt.excel_file_max_size`\]**

    Maximum file size in MB that can be imported.
