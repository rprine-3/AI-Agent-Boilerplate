# Third-party risk management data model

Use the Third-party Risk Management \(TPRM\) data model to assess, monitor, and mitigate the risks for your risk management program.

## TPRM data model overview

The Third-party Risk Management application is one of the Governance, Risk, and Compliance products.

The following model is used to support TPRM's capabilities.

Use the scoring setup in TPRM configure how the scores from the external risk assessments are aggregated to the engagements and third parties. The criteria tables have the information that is related to the aggregation of the scores of multiple records \(MIN, MAX, AVG\) or from multiple tables \(weights for each table\). Use the scoring rules to group third parties or engagements and assign criteria. You can configure all the records in these tables without any customization.
