# Integrating scores from risk intelligence providers

Risk intelligence providers generate risk scores for a variety of third-party risk domains. Your organization can purchase services from providers that return data that is analogous to personal credit scores. The scores provide insight on how trustworthy and safe a particular third party can be.

## Working with data from risk intelligence providers

**Note:** You can request risk data for third parties but not for engagements.

-   After you register a risk intelligence provider, you specify which of the provider's scoring or rating services you’ll use. You also specify how their scores or ratings map to your TPRM ratings. For more information, see [Register a risk intelligence provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintelprvdr-register.md), [Set up a risk intelligence provider service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintelprvdr-set-up.md), and [Set up a request type for a provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintelprvdr-request-type.md).
-   You add a raw score from a provider to the provider service record for a third party. The system uses the mapping that you specified to normalize the value to the appropriate TPRM rating. For more information, see [Add a risk intelligence score to risk data for a third party](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintelprvdr-add-score.md).
-   A provider-based submission rule is a set of conditions and actions. In a rule, you can specify that an update to a rating from a risk intelligence provider is the condition that triggers the action that is specified in the rule. The action might be to create and send a third-party risk assessment, issue, task, or email. For more information, see [Automate actions upon risk intelligence updates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintelprvdr-submissrule.md).
