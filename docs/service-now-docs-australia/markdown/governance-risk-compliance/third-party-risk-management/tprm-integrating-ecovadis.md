# Integrating EcoVadis with Third-party Risk Management

Integrating EcoVadis into your third-party risk management program can enhance your ability to assess and mitigate risks associated with sustainability and corporate social responsibility \(CSR\). By leveraging EcoVadis' comprehensive sustainability ratings, you can gain detailed insights into the environmental, ethical, and social practices of your third parties.

## Configuring the Vendor Risk Management integration with the EcoVadis application

The following pre-requisite configurations are required to use the Vendor Risk Management integration with the EcoVadis application.

-   Activate the Vendor Risk Management integration with EcoVadis application \[com.sn\_app\_grc\_ecovadis\]. To see the instructions for downloading a GRC application from the ServiceNow® Store, see [Download a GRC application from the ServiceNow Store for the first time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/download-grc-first-time.md).

-   Create a connection and authenticate your credentials with EcoVadis for more information, see [Create an EcoVadis connection and configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-config-connection-ecovadis.md).
-   Request EcoVadis ratings using the EcoVadis website. After the request is accepted, scores will become available in TPRM. For more information on the EcoVadis website, see [https://support.ecovadis.com/hc/en-us](https://support.ecovadis.com/hc/en-us).

**Note:** You can customize the system properties for EcoVadis.

## EcoVadis integration actions

As part of the EcoVadis integration with TPRM, you can Fetch and view risk intelligence scores including theme scores and scorecards from EcoVadis.

For more information, see [Fetch and view EcoVadis scores](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-ecovadis-scores.md).
