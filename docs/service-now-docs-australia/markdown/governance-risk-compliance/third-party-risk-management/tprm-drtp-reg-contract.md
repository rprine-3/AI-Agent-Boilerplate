# Create a contract and enhance digital resilience data

Create a contract record in Digital resilience third-party registers using Third-party Risk Management where you add details of the contract such as vendor name, start and end dates, state, substate. You can then enhance its digital resilience information for compliance with DORA regulation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor

## About this task

The Digital resilience third-party registers include details about who within your organization is using externally outsourced ICT services, which functions and branches are using them, and who the third-party providers and their engagements are. The contracts link these two aspects together.

The contracts link both parties—those using the information and those providing it. Essentially, they bind legal entities, branches, and functions to third parties and third-party engagements.

You can navigate to the contracts from the Contracts menu item in Digital resilience third-party registers. Alternatively, you can navigate to the legal entities record, open the Legal entities tab, and navigate to the contracts.

**Note:** The annual expense may be converted during report generation if currency conversion is enabled. If aggregation is enabled and all criteria are met, contract expenses may also be combined into a provider‑level total.

After setting up contract and Specific Information records, you can generate a Register of Information reporting package. For more information, see [Generate a register of information package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-drtp-roi-packages.md).

LEI codes on records associated with this contract are validated against the GLEIF database during Register of Information reporting. For more information, see [Validate Legal Entity Identifier codes for DORA reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-valid-lei.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then navigate to **Digital resilience third-party registers**.

2.  Select **Contracts** and then create a contract by selecting **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For descriptions of all these fields, see [Create New Contract form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-create-new-contract-form.md).

4.  Select **Save**.

5.  To submit the contract for review, select **Submit for Review**.

6.  To add entities signing the contract to use the ICT services associated with the contract, navigate to the **Entities signing contract to use service** related list of the contract record and select **Add**.

7.  Select **Save**.

8.  To add entities using the ICT services associated with the contract, navigate to the **Entities making use of services** related list of the contract record and select **Add**.

9.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** When creating multiple entities using the ICT services, the combination of LEI and Nature of the entity must be unique. If the nature of the entity is a branch, the combination of the LEI of the entity, Nature of the entity, and the identification code of the branch must be unique.

10. To add entities signing the contract to provide ICT services associated with the contract, navigate to the **Entity providing services** related list of the contract record and select **Add**.

11. Select **Save**.

12. To add third parties signing the contract to provide ICT services associated with the contract, navigate to the **Third party signing contract to provide services** related list of the contract record and select **Add**.

13. Select **Save**.

14. To add third-party engagements signing the contract to provide ICT services associated with the contract, navigate to the **Third-party engagements signing contract** related list of the contract record and select **Add**.

15. Select **Save**.

16. To set up the digital resilience information for DORA regulation, navigate to the **Specific information** related list and create a contractual arrangement by selecting **New**.

17. On the form, fill in the fields.

18. Select **Save**.

    -   When you save a Specific Information record, Rank 1 ICT service supply chain records are generated automatically using the Type of ICT services value. If you update the Type of ICT services value, the supply chain records update automatically. If you remove a Type of ICT services value, the corresponding Rank 1 and higher supply chain records are deleted automatically. To create Rank 2 and higher supply chain records manually, see [Create a supply chain and enhance digital resilience data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-drtp-reg-supply-chain.md).
    -   If a Specific Information record with the same combination of contract reference, entity using service, service provider, country of provision, function identifier, Type of ICT services, storage location, and processing location already exists, the save is blocked. The error message includes a link to the conflicting record so you can compare the two records before saving.
    **Note:** If the **Storage of data** field is set to **No** on a contractual arrangement, the associated location field values are cleared automatically.

19. To add intra-group contractual arrangements, navigate to the **Intra-group contractual arrangements** tab of the contract and select **Add**.

    **Note:** If all Specific Information records are removed from a contract, making it no longer DORA relevant, any intra-group contractual arrangements linked to the contract are removed automatically. A confirmation message is displayed when this occurs.

20. Select **Save**.

21. To add ICT service supply chains associated with the contract, navigate to the **ICT service supply chains** tab of the contract and select **New** and fill in the fields.

22. Select **Save**.

23. To add Assessments of the ICT services associated with the contract, navigate to the **Assessments of the ICT services** tab of the contract and select **New** and fill in the fields.

24. Select **Save**.

    For descriptions of all these fields, see [Create New Contractual arrangement form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-create-new-cont-arrange-form.md).

    **Note:** The annual expense may be converted during report generation if currency conversion is enabled. If aggregation is enabled and all criteria are met, contract expenses may also be combined into a provider‑level total.

25. To edit the contract record, select it from the list and select **Save** after making your edits.

26. To export contract records, select **Export**.

27. To delete the contract record, select it from the list and select **Delete**.
