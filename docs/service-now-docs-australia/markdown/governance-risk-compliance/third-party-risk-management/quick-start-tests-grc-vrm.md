# Run the Quick Start tests for Third-party Risk Management

Verify that TPRM still works after you make configuration changes such as applying an upgrade or developing an application. Copy and customize the quick-start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

GRC: Vendor Manager Workspace and Third-party Risk Management quick start tests require activating the Vendor Manager Workspace and Third-party Risk Management plugin \(com.sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt\) and loading demo data.

**Important:**

The Vendor Management Workspace for ITSM \(sn\_itsm\_vendor\) is deprecated as of the Australia release. It is hidden and no longer available for activation for new customers.

The GRC: Vendor Management Workspace quick start tests listed below require this plugin and are not applicable if your instance does not have it activated. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
