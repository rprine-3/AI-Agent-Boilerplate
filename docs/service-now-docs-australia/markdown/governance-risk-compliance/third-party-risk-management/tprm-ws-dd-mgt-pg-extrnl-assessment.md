# Third-party \(external\) risk assessment management

## Working on a third-party risk assessment

For each external risk assessment, the system auto-assigns a unique ID number that starts with the text VRA. A risk assessment can represent the work on an engagement request for a third-party organization or an engagement request for a group within the parent organization. Select a VRA number to work on the risk assessment on the **External assessments** tab.

    A risk domain defines the type of risk to assess for a third party.

Some platform applications refer to risk domains as "risk areas."

-   **Issues tab on the External assessments page**

    In an iterative process, before the TPR manager closes an assessment, the TPR manager can generate non-compliance issues and tasks. The TPR manager communicates with the TP contacts and engagement contacts by using comments to close the issues and tasks. The TPR manager can also assign different contacts as needed. See [Create an issue for a third party or engagement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-ws-issue-create.md) and [Manage issues](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-ws-issue-manage.md).
