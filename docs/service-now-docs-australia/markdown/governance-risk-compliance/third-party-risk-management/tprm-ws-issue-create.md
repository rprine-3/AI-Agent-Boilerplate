# Create an issue for a third party or engagement

Create an issue to help ensure that your concerns about a third party or engagement are remediated.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor

## About this task

In an iterative process, before the TPR manager closes an assessment, the TPR manager can generate non-compliance issues and tasks. The TPR manager communicates with the TP contacts and engagement contacts by using comments to close the issues and tasks. The TPR manager can also assign different contacts as needed.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Quick actions** box on the TPRM home page \[Omitted image "icon-tprm-ws-home.png"\] Alt text:, select **Create issue**.

2.  Select a template to fill in several fields on the form.

    You can filter the template list and add templates to your custom **My templates** list.

3.  Fill in the form and then select **Save**.
