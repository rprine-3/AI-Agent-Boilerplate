# Register a risk intelligence provider

Create a record for each risk intelligence provider from which you’ll request reports. The risk scores and ratings that risk intelligence providers generate are analogous to personal credit scores. The scores provide insight on how trustworthy and safe a particular third party can be.

## Before you begin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Risk Intelligence Provider Setup** &gt; **Providers**.

2.  Select **New**, fill in the form, and then select **Submit**.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Unique name of the risk intelligence provider.|
    |Short description|Description of the provider and possibly of the services provided.|

    |Provider logo|Image of the provider's logo. This image appears on TPRM reports for the provider.|


## Result

You can now specify the services and levels of service that you might later request from the provider.

Services that you have associated with the provider appear in the Risk intelligence provider services related list. To add a service, select **New** in the related list and then follow the instructions in [Set up a risk intelligence provider service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintelprvdr-set-up.md).

**Important:** The **Order reports** option on the Risk intelligence provider form must be selected for providers to be available for risk intelligence report requests.
