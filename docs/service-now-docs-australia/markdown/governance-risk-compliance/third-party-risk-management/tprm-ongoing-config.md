# Classic assessment configuration

The TPR manager and TPR admin roles involve a broad variety of responsibilities. After the TPRM base system is set up, you configure additional settings that enable and enhance everyday risk-assessment tasks.

## Assessment setup overview

By performing the tasks in the Assessment setup checklist for TPRM, you’re setting up and configuring the TPRM application to address your unique requirements for scoring and assessing risk for third parties, engagements, and other entities using the classic assessment engine.

**Note:**

For any custom messages you create, it is your responsibility to generate the corresponding `sys_ui_message` records. This step is crucial if you want the custom messages to be extracted and translated.

Set up risk rating scales for scoring assessments and questionnaires.

</td><td>

You can configure the risk rating scale that is selected by default for all questionnaires.

For more information, see [Set up risk rating scales for scoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-risk-rating-scales-config.md).Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up third-party risk domains or areas.

</td><td>

You can configure the scoring method and weight that is selected by default for all third parties associated with a specific risk area.

 For more information, see [Define third-party risk area criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-risk-domain-criteria-df.md).Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up third party and engagement component criteria.

</td><td>

Components are entities that can be assessed for risk. Component criteria are groups of components that are related to a particular type of third party or engagement.

 You can’t add new components or modify existing ones. You can, however, define the criteria \(in terms of scoring method and weight\) to be used to assess the components. You can update the **Default scoring method** to specify how multiple scores for each risk area are calculated. You can use the **Default weight** to adjust the weight of third-party provider scores in the third party's overall risk rating.

 The following component classifications are available.

-   Third-party components
    -   Third-party risk assessments \(External risk assessments\)
    -   Subsidiaries
    -   Engagements
    -   Risk intelligence rating
-   Engagement components
    -   Engagement risk assessments
    -   Product
    -   Principal
    -   Facility
    -   Other

 For more information on setting up component criteria, see [Define component criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-component-criteria-define.md).

 For more information on how engagement components impact third-party elements, see [Monitoring third-party elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-monitor-tp-elements.md).
