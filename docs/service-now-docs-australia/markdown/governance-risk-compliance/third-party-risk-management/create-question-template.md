</table>**Note:** A questionnaire template must have at least one category. Each category must contain at least one question.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations:

    -   **All** &gt; **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Assessment setup** &gt; **Questionnaire Templates** or **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Assessment Setup** &gt; **Document Request Templates**.
    -   **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then navigate to **Assessment setup** &gt; **Questionnaire Templates**.
2.  Select **New \(Designer\)**.

    |Tab|Description|
    |---|-----------|
    |Controls|Supported question data types are available in the Controls palette. Drag a control onto the designer canvas to create a question of that type.|
    |Questions|A library of questions for various categories, so you don’t have to build each questionnaire from scratch.|
    |Categories|Assessment open in the **Design** view. The questionnaire **Name** field appears above the first category in the canvas. An empty question field appears in the category container.|

3.  Enter a name and then drag a control onto the designer canvas to create a question of that type.

    **Note:** Selecting the scored option \(**Scored** check box\) is optional. All question responses unless otherwise stated are scored. The scored option changes the scoring behavior. If selected, the score is based on a binary system \(0 or 100\) reflecting whether the answer is correct or incorrect. If not selected, the score is calculated using a scale definition, involving the questionRating, questionPercentContribution, and questionNormalizedValue formulae, and the MaximumNormalizationInput field can influence the normalized value. For more information, see [Scoring calculations using the classic assessment engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/vendor-ratings-scoring.md) and [Normalize the scores for metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/set-max-norm-input.md).
