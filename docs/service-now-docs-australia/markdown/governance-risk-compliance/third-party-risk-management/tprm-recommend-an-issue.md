# Activate TPRM issue recommendation skill

Activate the TPRM issue recommendation skill from ServiceNow Otto for TPRM to generate recommendations for TPRM issues.

## Before you begin

Install the ServiceNow Otto for TPRM plugin \(sn\_tprm\_gen\_ai\).

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Important:** After installing ServiceNow Otto for TPRM, all ServiceNow Otto for TPRM skills are activated by default.

The recommendation skill helps third-party risk assessors quickly identify issues by generating AI-driven suggestions based on the content of assessment responses. Recommendations simplify the process of associating issues and creating tasks, and are accessible when an external assessment questionnaire has received responses.

To generate meaningful recommendations, data must be available from completed prior assessments and previously created issues. The recommendation skill uses these historical issues, along with their associated questions and responses, as reference data.

**Note:** The skill can identify a question-and-answer pair as a potential issue only if a similar question-and-answer pair was previously flagged as an issue in the historical data.

After recommendations are generated, you can accept or dismiss them individually. For more information, see [Generate issue recommendations for TPRM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/create-recommendation-tprm-issue.md).

**Note:** If you want generated issues to be created using historical data for individual third party, you need to navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All** select `sn_tprm_genai.same_vendor_required` and set the property to true.
