# Smart assessments with Third-party Risk Management

With the integration of Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\), TPRM now supports both the Classic assessment engine and SAE. You can create questionnaire templates and add instructions, questions, and reference information by creating templates using SAE in the Vendor Management Workspace.

## SAE overview

The Smart Assessment Engine in Vendor Management Workspace enables you to create both internal and external questionnaires using configurable templates, logical grouping of questions, inline guidance, and automations.

In the Vendor Management Workspace, you can view the templates available for TPRM. Confirm that the assessment template category is set to one of the supported TPRM template purposes. Also confirm that assessment targets are set to **Third party** and **Engagement**, along with any related components such as subsidiaries or engagement risk assessments that apply to your assessment. Only the assessment templates that are published are available for performing the assessments.

For more information about the Smart Assessment Engine application, refer to [Exploring Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/smart-assessment-engine-cf-explore.md).

**Note:** To use Smart Assessment Engine, you must enable the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled\] property. After setting this property, you can't create new assessments and questionnaire templates using the Classic assessment engine.

For the full list of prerequisites, including required scoped applications and template migration, see [Migrating from Classic Assessment Engine to Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-migrate-asmnt-sae.md) and [Migrate a template to an SAE template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-asmnt-tmplt-migrate-metrics-to.md).

## Benefits of using the Smart Assessment Engine experience

The new assessment experience offers the following benefits.

-   Enhanced navigation: Use the improved navigation for a better user experience.
-   Assessment support: Conduct assessments for both internal and external parties in one standard UI. TPRM SAE questionnaire templates are extended to include additional attributes such as the risk area and the option to include previous responses, which aren’t available in the base SAE templates. TPRM SAE templates must be created directly within the Vendor Management Workspace to ensure that they include the necessary attributes and can be used for TPRM assessments.
-   Organize questions: Group questions into subsections and sections for better organization.
-   Add attachments: Attach the files directly to the individual questions.
-   Add reference information: Add reference information to a questionnaire template to help ensure that assessors and respondents can access the necessary information they need while completing a questionnaire.
-   Filter questions: Quickly identify and filter unanswered questions.
-   Auto-save for questionnaires: Save your work automatically as you complete each question within a questionnaire.
-   Standardized risk rating scale definition: Override the default risk rating scales at the template level for both internal and external assessments.
-   Assessment duration: Define the duration of an assessment when creating a questionnaire template.
-   Combine assessments: Respond to questionnaires by using the same SAE template in a single, streamlined view.
-   Risk scoring and score normalization: Standardize the risk scores for a consistent evaluation using the more flexible scoring settings available in SAE.
-   Support for the GRC and third-party portals: Internal assessment responders can use the GRC portal to access and complete internal assessments and external assessment responders can use third-party portal to complete external assessments.
-   Question-level comments, worknotes, and flags are available in SAE assessments. Any user with read access to an assessment instance can add and view question-level comments. Worknotes and question flags require a role assigned at the template category level. TPRM reviewers, assessors, and managers have this access in all out-of-the-box TPRM template categories. Third party and engagement contacts can view and respond to question-level comments but cannot access worknotes or set question flags.
-   When a question triggers a skip, downstream conditional questions are hidden and sections containing only skipped questions are visually de-emphasized. Assessments render in a continuous scroll layout, making it easier to focus on relevant questions without scrolling past hidden content.

## Smart Assessment template versioning

SAE templates in TPRM now support explicit versioning. Each version is a full copy of the template \(deep copy\). When a new version is published, the previously published version is automatically retired. Retired versions remain visible for reference but cannot be used for new assessments.

To create a new version of a template, use the **Create Version** action on the template record in the Vendor Management Workspace. Editing a published template in place is no longer supported — you must create a version instead. Template versions can also be deleted.

For more information on template versioning in SAE, see [Template versioning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/template-versioning.md).

Templates shipped through the Unified Content Management \(UCM\) module are also versioning-compatible. For more information about activating and updating templates through UCM, see [Activate or update Smart Assessment templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/activate_sae_ucm.md).

## Smart Assessment Engine limitations

SAE with TPRM has the following limitations.

-   All new assessments must use SAE questionnaire templates.
-   Third-party risk assessors can no longer create issues from the View responses page. Issues generation rules can be used to create issues automatically.
-   The signature feature isn’t supported.
-   Automatic attachment of questionnaires to external assessments based on inherent risk questionnaire \(IRQ\) responses or IRQ-calculated risk tiers is currently not supported in Smart Assessment Engine.
-   The following question types aren’t supported: Percentage, ranking, image scale, and custom metric aren’t supported. You must either convert these question types to supported formats before migration or create new questions in the template designer after migration.

    **Note:** For the percentage and image scale question types, customers can use the Number type and Radio button type, respectively. Ranking and custom metric question types aren't supported.

-   In the Third‑party portal,the Excel export option available for Classic assessments is not supported for SAE assessments.
-   If a section in the classic template contains only unsupported questions, an empty section is created in the TPRM SAE template. TPRM SAE templates with empty sections can’t be published; therefore, you must either add replacement questions to these sections or delete the empty sections before publishing.

    For more information on migration results, migration limitations, and creating TPRM SAE questionnaires, see [Results of migrating a template to a TPRM SAE template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-migrate-asmnt-template-result.md) and [Create a TPRM SAE questionnaire or document request template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/create-sae-q-template.md).

-   Repeating assessments aren’t supported. You can use Event-driven management rules.
-   When transferring TPRM SAE questionnaire templates between instances, the update set won’t include the duration information. Users must export the duration information manually from the `sn_smart_asmt_duration` table and import it into the target instances.
-   If an assessment template isn’t updated to support SAE assessments, the related tier-based, provider-based, and event-driven management rules won’t run as expected.
-   The TPRM scoring migration proceeds only if there were no errors during the template migration. If there were errors, the TPRM scoring migration doesn’t occur.

**Note:** For more information on migration results and migration limitations, see [Results of migrating a template to a TPRM SAE template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-migrate-asmnt-template-result.md).

## What to explore next

To get started, the TPR admin configures the assessment questionnaire and the TPR manager configures the tier-based, provider-based, or event-driven management rules that determine when an assessment is sent to a third party or engagement. Based on the assessment results, appropriate risk mitigation measures are identified and implemented.
