# Create a branch and enhance digital resilience data

Create a branch record in Digital resilience third-party registers using Third-party Risk Management. You can then enhance its digital resilience information for compliance with DORA regulation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor

## About this task

A legal entity can operate multiple branches across various cities or countries, all of which can be documented on the form. If a new branch is launched, its information is also required for regulatory reporting.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then navigate to **Digital resilience third-party registers**.

2.  Select **Branches** and then create a branch by selecting **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For descriptions of all these fields, see [Create New Branch form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-create-new-branch-form.md).

    Users typically fill in the following details of the branch:

    -   Branch name and its description
    -   Owner's details
    -   Tagging of business units and departments for reporting purpose
    -   Specifying the branch as a head office or as a different branch other than the head office
    -   ID of the branch and its originating country
    The number for the branch is auto-generated. Once the branch details are complete, the information is ready to be captured in the information register.

    **Note:** When you enter or update an LEI code field on the branch form, the system validates it against the GLEIF database and auto-populates the name and country fields. If you then edit the name or country to a value that no longer matches GLEIF data, an inline warning is displayed on the edited field. You can still save the record. For more information, see [Validate Legal Entity Identifier codes for DORA reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-valid-lei.md).

4.  Select **Save**.

5.  To edit a Legal entity record, navigate to the legal entity tab of a company record, select the legal entity you want and select **Save** after making your edits.

6.  To edit the branch record, select it from the list and select **Save** after making your edits.

7.  To export the branch records, select **Export**.


## What to do next

Specify the functions that are associated with a branch.
