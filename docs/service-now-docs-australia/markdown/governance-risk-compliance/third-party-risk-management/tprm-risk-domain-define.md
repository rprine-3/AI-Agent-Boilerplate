# Define a third-party risk domain

A risk domain defines the type of risk to assess for a third party. For example, you might want to assess a data-management third party in terms of security risk and a bank in terms of financial risk. Security risk and financial risk are risk domains. Some platform applications refer to risk domains as "risk areas."

## About this task

**Note:** Risk domains are called "risk areas" in some platform applications.

You can better understand and mitigate the risks that a third party poses to your organization by identifying the domains of their business to assess for risk and quantifying the importance \(weight\) of each domain.

-   Security risk domain: A third party that handles sensitive personal data in their infrastructure might need to be assessed against their security posture.
-   Reputational risk domain: If that personal data were breached, it could cause damage to your reputation due to negative media attention.
-   Financial risk domain: If a third party fails to deliver on time, you might have to pay fines, settlements, or both resulting in financial loss.

In this procedure, you create a Risk domain definition. In each definition, you specify the criteria that determine which organizations should be assessed for a particular type of risk.

**Note:** Risk domain definitions are called Risk area definitions on the forms.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Scoring Setup** &gt; **Risk Domains**.

Description

Name

</td><td>

Name of the risk domain.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

A description of the risk domain that helps colleagues to understand the intent of the definition. See the example.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default scoring method

</td><td>

The default scoring method for third parties in this risk domain. The scoring methods are based on how well a third-party contact answers 100 questions:-   Average Risk: A rounded average of the ratings earns an Average Risk \(Moderate\) for the third party.
-   Max Risk: A score of 0 indicates that all questions were answered incorrectly and the risk for that third party would be Max Risk \(Critical\).
-   Min Risk: A score of 100 indicates that all questions were answered correctly and the risk for that third party would be Min Risk \(Minor\).
**Note:** Each organization in a particular risk domain inherits the scoring method and weight of the risk area definition. Third-party risk managers can override the values when needed.
