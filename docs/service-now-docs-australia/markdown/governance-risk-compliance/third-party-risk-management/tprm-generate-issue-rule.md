# Create an issue generation rule

Create an issue generation rule that will automatically create an issue based on question responses to external assessments. Issues help ensure that your concerns about a third party or engagement are remediated.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_admin

## About this task

In an iterative process, before the TPR manager closes an assessment, the TPR manager can generate non-compliance issues and tasks. The TPR manager communicates with the TP contacts and engagement contacts by using comments to close the issues and tasks. The TPR manager can also assign different contacts as needed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Issues** &gt; **Issue Generation Rules** or **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text:, and then navigate to **Assessment setup** &gt; **Issue Generation Rules**.

2.  Create an issue generation rule by selecting **New** and fill in the form.

<table id="table_krg_p53_2yb"><thead><tr><th>

This option is set automatically when an SAE questionnaire or document request template has been added manually.

When you create a new rule template and have the Smart Assessment Engine property enabled, this field is selected by default after saving the template.
