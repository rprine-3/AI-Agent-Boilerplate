# Activate or update Smart Assessment templates

Manage SAE templates for TPRM from the Unified Content Management page in the Vendor Management Workspace. You can view available templates, select template versions, activate or update templates for use in Third-party Risk Management assessments, and update templates when newer versions are released.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager

You must have the Unified Content Management application installed and you must set the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled\] property. After setting this property, SAE becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience.

**Warning:** After this option is enabled, this selection can’t be reversed.

For more information, see [Configure TPRM properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-properties-configure.md), [Migrating from Classic Assessment Engine to Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-migrate-asmnt-sae.md), and [Managing TPRM SAE templates with Unified Content Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-integrating-ucm.md).

## About this task

Use Unified Content Management to control which TPRM SAE templates are available for use in new Third-party Risk Management assessments. Activating a template version makes it available when creating new assessments. Updating a template applies a newer released version for future assessments.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, and on the **Risk** tab, select the Unified Content Management icon \[Omitted image "unified-content-mgmt-icon.png"\] Alt text:.

2.  View templates by state by selecting **Active** or **Inactive**.

    Inactive templates are not available for new assessments until a year is selected and activated.

3.  Select the year from the dropdown menu for the template you want to activate or update.

    SIG Full 2026, SIG Core 2026, and SIG Lite 2026 templates are available for selection. These templates are available in both Classic and SAE format. For more information, see [Using the SIG questionnaire for a risk assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-sig-use-and-support.md).

4.  Choose the action you want to perform.

    |Action|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Activate a template version**|Make the selected year of the inactive template available for use by selecting **Activate**.|
    |**Update a template version**|Apply the selected year of the template as the active version by selecting **Update**.|

    1.  Review the disclaimer, then select **Agree**.

    2.  Review all sections of the template and, after confirming they meet your requirements, select **Submit**.


## Result

If you activated the template, the selected year is available for use when creating new TPRM assessments. If you updated the template, the selected year is applied as the active version used for future assessments.

## What to do next

Review related assessments and configuration to help ensure that the appropriate template versions are in use.

To modify template content, contact a team member with the TPR admin \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_admin\] role. TPR admins can edit templates by navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Assessment Workspace**, selecting the template you want to edit, and then selecting **Edit**.

**Note:**

To create a new version of a published template, use the **Create Version** action on the template record in the Vendor Management Workspace. Editing a published template in place is no longer supported. For more information, see [Smart assessments with Third-party Risk Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-sae-using.md).

You can also copy an existing template, including all questions, sections, instructions, and configurations.
