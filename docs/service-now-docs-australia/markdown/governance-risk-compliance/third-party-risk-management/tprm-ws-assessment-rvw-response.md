# Review responses to external questionnaires

Third-party contacts use the Third-party portal to complete assessments and collaborate with the TPR manager in the comments section for each question. When assessments reveal gaps, the TPR manager or the TPR assessor can generate an issue or task. In addition, the Vendor Management Workspace application can auto-generate issues.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor

## About this task

If the TPR manager or TPR assessor decides that an assessment response is unsatisfactory, they can return some of the questions or document requests in the assessment. Incorrect answers to questions can automatically generate issues, or issues can be generated manually from the question. The comments identify the issues to the third-party contact.

To enable TPR assessors to modify responses, configure the **Allow TPR assessors to modify responses in third-party questionnaires** \[`sn_svdp.allow_assessor_edit`\] system property. You can set the following options:

-   Enable TPR assessors to answer questions or modify responses \(default\)
-   Enable TPR assessors to modify responses
-   Do not enable TPR assessors to answer questions or modify responses

See [Configure TPRM properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-properties-configure.md).
