# Manually add a risk to a third party or engagement

If you’re using both Risk Management and Third-party Risk Management, you can associate risks and risk statements with third parties and engagements. These associations influence risk posture and scoring.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_admin

## About this task

When you associate a risk with a third party or engagement, the risk becomes part of the entity’s risk profile and can be included in scoring calculations. This does not automatically trigger assessments unless configured through TPRM rules.

Controls are automatically generated when you associate a policy with an entity type or an entity type with a control objective. A control is created for each entity listed in the entity type for the control objective. Controls can also be manually created.

For more information on creating risk statements and risks in Risk Management, see [Create a risk statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/t_CreateRiskState.md), [Create a risk manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/t_CreateRisk.md), and [Generate a risk from a risk statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/t_GenRiskFromRiskFrameProfile.md).

To understand the difference between a control objective and a control, see [Relationship between risks, risk events, and risk statements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/manage-risk-events.md).
