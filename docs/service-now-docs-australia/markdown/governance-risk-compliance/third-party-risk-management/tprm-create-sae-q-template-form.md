# Create New TPRM SAE questionnaire template form

Use the Create New TPRM questionnaire template form to capture all the information that you need to create a TPRM SAE questionnaire template using the Smart Assessment template designer. As a third-party risk admin, you can create a questionnaire template.

<table id="table_krg_p53_2yb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Template name

</td><td>

Unique meaningful name for the template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Third-party risk area

</td><td>

The third-party risk area that applies to this questionnaire template.

 **Note:** This option is only available when you create an internal or external questionnaire template using the Vendor Management Workspace.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Purpose

</td><td>

Purpose for the new template.

**Note:** Known as Template classifications in the Classic assessment engine, TPRM has a **Purpose** for each classic template classification.

TPRM purpose options include:

-   TPRM external 3rd-party element questionnaire
-   TPRM external 4th-party questionnaire
-   TPRM external document request
-   TPRM external questionnaire
-   TPRM internal IRQ
-   TPRM internal tiering questionnaire

**Note:** Only use the available template purposes. Creating custom purposes \(categories or classifications\) will cause SAE assessments to fail during m2m linkage processing. When creating or migrating SAE questionnaire templates, make sure the Purpose field is set to one of the supported categories only.

To view a TPRM TPRM questionnaire template you must have the TPR assessment reviewer role \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessment\_reviewer\]. For more information on creating assessment template purposes, see [Create an assessment template category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-category-create.md).

**Note:** You can create an assessment only from a published assessment template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Include previous responses

</td><td>

Option to pre-populate the questionnaire with responses from a completed questionnaire \(state is **Complete**\).

**Important:** If you have the TPR assessor \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\] role, you can override the option that is specified in the questionnaire template while editing a questionnaire in the draft state.

 The entry in the Third-party portal notifies the third-party contact that responses were copied. The notification includes a link to the assessment that supplied the responses and its last updated date.

 -   The responses are populated when the new questionnaire is submitted to the third-party contact.
-   The source questionnaire must be based on the same template as the current questionnaire.
-   The responses are populated from the most recently completed questionnaire.
-   Answers of the attachment, duration, and signature type aren’t copied.
-   The setting can’t be changed after the questionnaire is sent to the third party.

 To specify the maximum age for source questionnaires, configure the **Maximum age for reusing responses** `sn_vdr_risk_asmt.max_age_for_questionnaire_reuse` system property. See [Configure TPRM properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-properties-configure.md).

 **Note:** This option is only available when you create a questionnaire template using the Vendor Management Workspace.
