# Risk intelligence report requests management

You can view a list of risk intelligence report \(RIR\) requests, their associated providers, scores, and report URLs. In addition, you can create requests and make updates by using the Third-party Risk Management application.

## Risk intelligence report request process

If you have the third-party risk \(TPR\) assessor \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_assessor\] or TPR manager \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager\] role, you can request a RIR or score. You can create a RIR request that is associated with a third party or due diligence request. If you want to associate an RIR request with a due diligence request, it must be after an inherent risk questionnaire \(IRQ\) has been completed \(that is when the due diligence request has entered the IRQ in progress state\). You can update the Sanction section at any time.

For more information, see [Request a risk intelligence report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintel-request-tp.md), [Request a risk intelligence report associated with a due diligence request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintel-request-dd.md), [Risk intelligence report request form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-rir-form.md), and [Track sanctions-related information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-riskintel-track-sanctions.md).

The following example shows how a new risk intelligence report request appears in Vendor Management Workspace.

</table>## Risk intelligence report requests tab

While viewing the data for a third party, you can select the **Risk intelligence report requests** tab to view the list of report requests.

The following example shows the **Risk intelligence report requests** tab in Vendor Management Workspace.

## Risk intelligence report request states

The RIR requests have the following potential states:

-   **Open**

    An RIR request enters this state after the record has been created and saved by the Third-party Risk \(TPR\) manager, TPR assessor, or contract negotiator that is assigned to the due diligence request. For each risk intelligence request, the system auto-assigns a unique ID number that starts with the text RIR.

-   **Order pending**

    An RIR request enters this state after the record has been reviewed and submitted by the Third-party Risk \(TPR\) manager, TPR assessor, or contract negotiator that is assigned to the due diligence request.

    The following changes take place:

    -   The order has been submitted to the provider.
    -   The **Request date** field has been populated with the date that this record was submitted on.
    -   All fields in the Risk intelligence report request section are read-only.
-   **Order in progress**

    An RIR request enters this state after the order has been received by the provider.

    The following changes take place:

    -   The score records are generated with the report request.
    -   The **Score generated on** field is updated.
-   **Closed incomplete**

    An RIR request enters this state after the order was received by the provider but couldn’t be processed due to an error, and the order was closed.

-   **Closed complete**

    An RIR request enters this state after the order was received and processed by the provider.

-   **Canceled**

    An RIR request enters this state after a TPR manager, TPR assessor, or contract negotiator cancels the report request. If you must cancel a request, it can be done while the request is in the **Open** or **Order pending** state. If you want to create a duplicate of a canceled request, you can’t edit that record. You must create a new RIR request.


-   **[Risk intelligence report request form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-rir-form.md)**  
Use the risk intelligence request form to capture all the information that you need to request risk intelligence using Third-party Risk Management. As a third-party risk manager, third-party risk assessor, and contract negotiator that is assigned to the due diligence request, you can request risk intelligence.
