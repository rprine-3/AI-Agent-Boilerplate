# Add Digital resilience information to third-party engagements

Add Digital resilience information to third-party engagements by creating ICT third-party service provider records in Digital resilience third-party registers using Third-party Risk Management. Add details such as name of the service provider, its identification code, type of ICT services, currency, and so on. This enhances the digital resilience information of its associated third-party engagement for compliance with DORA regulation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then navigate to **Digital resilience third-party registers**.

2.  Select **Third-party engagements** and select an engagement record you want.

3.  Select the **Digital resilience information** tab and then create an ICT third-party service provider by selecting **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For descriptions of all these fields, see [Create New ICT third-party service provider form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-create-ICT-thirdparty-serv-prov-form.md).

    **Note:** When you enter or update an LEI identification code \(when Type of code is set to LEI\), the system validates it against the GLEIF database and auto-populates the legal name and country of headquarters fields. If you then edit those fields to values that no longer match GLEIF data, an inline warning is displayed on the edited field. You can still save the record. For more information, see [Validate Legal Entity Identifier codes for DORA reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-valid-lei.md).

5.  Select **Save**.

    The ICT third-party service provider record is created and its details are displayed in the **Details** tab of the ICT third-party service provider record. You can confirm which third-party engagements have digital resilience information associated with them by reviewing the Digital resilience information column of the Third-party engagements list. If the column field shows Yes, digital resilience information is associated with the third-party engagement record.
