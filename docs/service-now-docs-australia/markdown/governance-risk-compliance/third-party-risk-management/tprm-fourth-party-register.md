# Register a fourth-nth party

Register fourth-nth parties after collecting responses from a third party by using the fourth-party registration questionnaire in the Third-party Risk Management application. With the fourth-party registration questionnaire, you can create multiple fourth-nth party records at a time.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_assessor

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Fourth-party templates** tab of a new or active external assessment.

2.  Assign a Fourth-party registration questionnaire to the external assessment by selecting **Add** and then selecting a questionnaire.

    The questionnaire you are using for fourth-party registration can only be sent to third parties.

    You can use the fourth-party registration questionnaire that is included as part of the base system or a custom questionnaire that has the Fourth-party template classification and has a Fourth-party information metric category added.

    The third party must answer the first two questions in each Fourth-party information section. Don’t alter the first eight questions of each section because they’re used for mapping the responses to the new fourth-party record.

    For more information on assessments, see [Assessing your third-party risk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-assessing-tpr.md).

3.  When you receive responses from the third-party contact, navigate to the **Downstream Suppliers** tab of the assessment and review the fourth-nth party information that was collected.

4.  Review each fourth-nth party in the list and confirm if that party exists and select **Create new fourth-party** if it doesn’t.
