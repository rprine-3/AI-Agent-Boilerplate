# IRQ process management

The first internal step after an engagement request is approved is to start the IRQ process to scope the risk by determining the third party's risk score.

## Accessing the IRQ process

On the Due diligence management page, select the **DDR** number for any due diligence request and then select the **Internal assessments** tab.

The tab displays the list of all IRQ processes for the engagement request. For each IRQ process, the system auto-assigns a unique ID number that starts with the text INA.

An engagement risk-scoring rule specifies component criteria that determine which engagements are selected for assessment. For example, a rule could enable assessments for engagements that involve more than $40,000 annual business. Engagement scoring rules apply only to engagements.
