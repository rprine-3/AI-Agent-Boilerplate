# Automate actions upon risk intelligence updates

A provider-based submission rule is a set of conditions and actions. In a rule, you can specify that an update to a rating from a risk intelligence provider is the condition that triggers the action that is specified in the rule. The action might be to create and send a third-party risk assessment, issue, task, or email.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessment\_reviewer

## About this task

When you enter a rating from a risk intelligence provider, the system normalizes the value to convert it to the appropriate TPRM rating. When you enter a score from a risk intelligence provider, the TPRM generates both a normalized rating and a normalized numerical score.

Follow this procedure to define a rule to perform an action when a provider sends an updated rating or score.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Assessment Submission Rules** &gt; **Provider-based Submission**.

2.  Select **New** and then fill in the form.
