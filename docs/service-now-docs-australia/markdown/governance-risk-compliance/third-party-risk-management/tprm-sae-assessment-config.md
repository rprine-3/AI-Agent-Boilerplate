# Smart assessment configuration

The TPR manager and TPR admin roles involve a broad variety of responsibilities. After the TPRM base system is set up, you configure Smart Assessment Engine specific settings as well as other assessment settings that enable and enhance everyday risk-assessment tasks. TPRM admins can enable SAE and work with SAE templates.

## Assessment setup overview

By performing the tasks in the Assessment setup checklist for TPRM, you’re setting up and configuring the TPRM application to address your unique requirements for scoring and assessing risk for third parties, engagements, and other entities using the Smart Assessment Engine for TPRM assessments.

**Note:**

For any custom messages you create, it is your responsibility to generate the corresponding `sys_ui_message` records. This step is crucial if you want the custom messages to be extracted and translated.

You can’t add new components or modify existing ones. You can, however, define the criteria \(in terms of scoring method and weight\) to be used to assess the components. You can update the **Default scoring method** to specify how multiple scores for each risk area are calculated. You can use the **Default weight** to adjust the weight of third-party provider scores in the third party's overall risk rating.

The following component classifications are available.

-   Third-party components
    -   Third-party risk assessments \(External risk assessments\)
    -   Subsidiaries
    -   Engagements
    -   Risk intelligence rating

Manage Smart Assessment template versions

</td><td>

This task is optional.SAE template versioning uses a deep copy approach: each version is a full copy of the template. When you publish a new version, the previously published version is automatically retired. Retired versions remain visible but cannot be used for new assessments. Template versions can also be deleted.

To create a new version, use the **Create Version** action on the template record in the Vendor Management Workspace. Editing a published template in place is no longer supported.
