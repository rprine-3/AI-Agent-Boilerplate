# Manage the access for your third-party contacts

View your existing third-party contacts and adjust their information and access permissions as needed by using Third-party Risk Management. When you keep the contact details up to date, you can help to avoid your third-party contacts from getting unauthorized access or losing authorized access to the third-party portal.

## Before you begin

The third-party risk \(TPR\) manager must contact a team member with the admin role to complete the last 3 options of step 3.

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager and admin to complete the last 3 options of step 3.

## About this task

Your third-party contacts are external users at the third-party organization. They use the third-party portal to securely organize, prioritize, and perform tasks like responding to questionnaires for assessments and communicating with your risk-assessment staff about issues. You can also adjust the access to the third-party portal and permissions for your third-party contacts.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Third-party Risk Management** &gt; **Third Parties** &gt; **Third-party Contacts** to view your existing third-party contacts.

    The number of contacts is listed for each third party on the third-party contacts page.

2.  Select the third party that you want to view the list of associated contacts for and then select the third-party contact.
