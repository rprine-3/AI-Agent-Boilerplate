# Share a TPRM dashboard

Share a dashboard with other users, groups, or roles to create a shared view of data that you can use to collaborate. You can grant viewing permissions or both viewing and editing permissions.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_admin or sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager can share the Third-party Insights and TPRM Custom Analytics dashboards.

Any role for dashboards that you own or ones that you have been given permission to share.

## About this task

You can share dashboards that have been shared with you, if sharing is enabled. If you have permissions to edit a dashboard that has been shared with you, you can pass that ability along to whomever you share it with. Users with the administrator role can share all dashboards.

Edit permissions granted by sharing a dashboard don’t apply to the underlying data visualizations on the dashboard. View permissions granted don’t apply to that dashboard's visualizations outside of the dashboard itself.

Only admins can see roles in the Sharing panel.

**Note:** Data visualizations based on table data are automatically shared with users that you share a dashboard with.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**

2.  Select the dashboard page icon \[Omitted image "icon-tprm-ws-dashboard.png"\] Alt text: and then select the dashboard you want to share.

3.  Select the more actions menu icon \[Omitted image "context-menu-db-element-ac.png"\] Alt text: and select **Share**.

4.  Enter the names of one or more users, groups, or roles you want to share the dashboard with.

5.  To enable the people you share the dashboard with to share the dashboard as well, select **Allow recipients to add, edit, or delete sharing permissions associated with this dashboard**.

    When you add a user, group, or role as a viewer, they can only share the dashboard as a viewer. When you add a user, group, or role as an editor, they can share the dashboard as a viewer or as an editor.

    **Important:** Granting permission to share a dashboard or data visualization includes the ability to add, edit, and delete sharing permissions for any user, group, or role on that dashboard or data visualization. A user can’t use this ability to give themselves or others edit permissions if they weren’t originally given edit permissions.

6.  Select one of the following options.

<table id="choicetable_yxb_j15_q5b"><tbody><tr><td id="d76309e145">

**Add as viewer**

</td><td>

Grant only viewing permissions to the users, groups, or roles you’re sharing the dashboard with. They can’t edit it.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d76309e154">

**Add as editor**

</td><td>

Grant editing permissions to the users, groups, or roles you’re sharing the dashboard with.You must be in the same application scope as the dashboard to add a user as an editor.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>7.  Select **Copy link with filter** or **Copy link** to copy the dashboard's URL to the clipboard.

    The URL points to the tab that was open when you opened the **Share dashboard** dialogue. **Copy link with filter** also applies the filters as they're configured on the dashboard or dashboard tab.

8.  Select **Confirm**.

9.  Select the dashboard details icon \[Omitted image "InformationIcon.png"\] Alt text: to view who the dashboard has been shared with and where it’s visible.
