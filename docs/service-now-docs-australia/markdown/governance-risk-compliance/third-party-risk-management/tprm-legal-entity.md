# Create a legal entity and enhance digital resilience data

Create a legal entity record in Digital resilience third-party registers using Third-party Risk Management. You can then configure digital resilience information for the legal entity such as its name, type, country, and hierarchy.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor

## About this task

When you select the Legal entities list within the Digital resilience third-party registers in the Vendor Management Workspace, you can view the existing legal entity records in the system.

**Note:** Existing third parties aren’t shown in the Legal entities list. Company records can only be defined as a Third party or Legal entity. For companies and legal entities, the Vendor option is set to **False**. \(The check box isn’t selected.\)

When you install Digital resilience third-party registers, the **Legal entities** tab gets added to existing company record pages that aren’t already defined as a third party. You can select the tab and configure the details for that Legal entity.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Vendor Management Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then navigate to **Digital resilience third-party registers**.

2.  Select **Legal entities** and then create a company record by selecting **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For descriptions of all these fields, see [Create New Company form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-create-new-legal-entity-form.md).

4.  Select **Save**.

    The company record is set up. Users can set up the legal entity for the company and the digital resilience information on the **Legal entity** tab of the company record.

5.  To create a legal entity record and set up its digital resilience information for DORA regulation, navigate to the **Legal entity** tab and select **New**.

    The Legal entity record contains the fields that provide the information required for the regulatory reporting of the legal entity. This includes details such as Legal Entity Identifier \(LEI\), name, country of registration, entity type \(as defined by the regulator\), and more. These fields are offered as choice lists within the system for users to select from.

    **Note:** When you enter or update the LEI code field, the system validates it against the GLEIF database and auto-populates the name and country fields. If you then edit the name or country to a value that no longer matches GLEIF data, an inline warning is displayed on the edited field. You can still save the record. For more information, see [Validate Legal Entity Identifier codes for DORA reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-valid-lei.md).

    For information on setting up the digital resilience information for a legal entity, see [Create New Legal entity form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-create-new-legal-entity.md).

6.  Select **Save**.

    The company record is now associated with a legal entity. You can confirm this by reviewing the Legal entity column of the Legal entities list. If the column field shows Yes, a legal entity is associated with the company record.

7.  To edit a Legal entity record, navigate to the legal entity tab of a company record, select the legal entity you want and select **Save** after making your edits.

8.  To export Legal entity records, select **Export**.
