# Tables installed with Operational Resilience

Several types of tables are installed with the Operational Resilience application.

## Tables installed with Operational Resilience

|Table name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|Activity log \[sn\_oper\_res\_activity\_log\]|Activity log for the application.|
|ASMT rating scale \[sn\_oper\_res\_asmt\_rating\_scale\]|ASMT rating scale.|
|BCM plan \[sn\_oper\_res\_bcm\_plan\]|BCM plan.|
|Choice \[sn\_grc\_choice\]|List of all GRC choices.|
|Change request \[sn\_oper\_res\_change\_request\]|Change request created for the application.|
|Critical service outage \[sn\_oper\_res\_critical\_service\_outage\]|Outage of the critical service.|
|Event \[sn\_oper\_res\_event\]|Event recorded for the application.|
|Failed control \[sn\_oper\_res\_failed\_control\]|Failed control.|
|GRC Profile \[sn\_grc\_profile\]|List of all GRC entities.|
|Importance impact tolerance assessment \[sn\_oper\_res\_importance\_impact\_tolerance\_assessment\]|Importance of the impact tolerance assessment.|
|Incident \[sn\_oper\_res\_incident\]|Incident registered due to an event.|
|Issue \[sn\_oper\_res\_issue\]|Issue logged due to an event.|
|M2M tables|
|Service mapping \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_scenario\_analysis\_service\_mapping\]|Many-to-many relationship table that maps scenario analyses to service mapping configurations.|
|Dependency mapping \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_scenario\_analysis\_dependency\_mapping\]|Many-to-many relationship table that maps scenario analyses to dependency mapping configurations.|
|Scenario analysis \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_scenario\_analysis\_scenario\]|Many-to-many relationship table that links scenario analyses to related scenarios.|
|Reference data \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_scenario\_analysis\_reference\_data\]|Many-to-many relationship table that maps scenario analyses to reference data.|
|Supporting tables|
|Issues \[sn\_oper\_res\_scenario\_issues\]|Issues logged and tracked in relation to a scenario analysis.|
|Model profile \[sn\_oper\_res\_statistical\_model\_profile\]|Profile configuration for a statistical model used in scenario analysis.|
|Model registry \[sn\_oper\_res\_statistical\_model\_registry\]|Registry of statistical models available for use in scenario analysis.|
|Model parameter \[sn\_oper\_res\_statistical\_model\_parameter\]|Parameters defined for a statistical model used in scenario analysis.|
|M2M analysis participant \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_analysis\_participant\]|Association between analysis and participant.|
|M2M analysis scenario event \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_analysis\_scenario\_event\]|Association between analysis and scenario event.|
|M2M scenario analysis service \[sn\_oper\_res\_scenario\_analysis\_service\]|Association between scenario and analysis service.|
|M2M scenario event \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_scenario\_event\]|Association between scenario and event.|
|M2M service importance impact tolerance assessment \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_service\_importance\_impact\_tolerance\_assessment\]|Association between service and importance of the impact tolerance assessment.|
|Operational Resilience profile \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\]|Operational Resilience entity.|
|Profile type \[sn\_grc\_profile\_type\]|List of all GRC entity types.|
|Risk \[sn\_oper\_res\_risk\]|Risk defined in the application. Starting with the Xanadu release \(Release 19.0.4\), the Advanced Risk Assessment \(ARA\) integration with Operational Resilience uses the **Status** field. When an entity is shared between Operational Resilience and ARA, and ARA has highest risk rating with a **Completed** status, a record is created for the ARA integration. The record is stored in the \[sn\_oper\_res\_risk\] table.|
|Scenario \[sn\_oper\_res\_scenario\]|Scenario defined in the application.|
|Scenario analysis \[sn\_oper\_res\_scenario\_analysis\]|Scenario analysis defined in the application.|
|Service impact analysis \[sn\_oper\_res\_service\_impact\_analysis\]|Service impact analysis defined in the application.|
|Service process pillar \[sn\_oper\_res\_service\_process\_pillar\]|Service process pillar defined in the application.|
|Task \[sn\_oper\_res\_task\]|Task defined in the application.|
|Vulnerability profile \[sn\_oper\_res\_vul\_profile\]|Vulnerability profile defined in the application.|
|Services with operational vulnerabilities \[sn\_oper\_res\_vulnerability\_profile\]|Services with operational vulnerabilities.|
|M2M scenario event participant \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_scenario\_event\_participant\]|Each participant can be associated with one or more scenario events. This table stores many-to-many relationships between the participant and scenario events.|
|M2M scenario event issue \[sn\_oper\_res\_m2m\_scenario\_event\_issue\]|Stores many-to-many relationships between the issues and scenario events.|
|Service related information \[sn\_oper\_res\_service\_related\_info\]|Service related information defined in the application.|
|Service Summary \[sn\_oper\_res\_service\_summary\]|Service summary defined in the application.|
|Service tasks \[sn\_oper\_res\_resp\_task\]|Service tasks defined in the application.|
|Response tasks \[sn\_oper\_res\_response\_task\]|Response tasks that are defined in the application.|
