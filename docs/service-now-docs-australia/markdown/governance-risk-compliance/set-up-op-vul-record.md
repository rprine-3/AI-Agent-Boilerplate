# Report an operational vulnerability from the module

Report an operational vulnerability from the Operational vulnerability module in the Operational Resilience Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## About this task

When an operational vulnerability is reported, it is opened in the **New** state, marking the beginning of its initial review.

Users of the operational vulnerability are listed in the Assignment section on the form and can find their tasks if their names are listed on any of the following fields:

-   The Operational vulnerability record is assigned to the person who reports the vulnerability. The name of the person is listed in the **Requester** and **Analyst** fields. The analyst receives a notification when the vulnerability is assigned to them.
-   Typically, Operational Resilience administrators and Operational Resilience managers are part of the assignment group. The names of the groups are listed in the **Assignment group** field.
-   The requester can report the vulnerability on behalf of someone by selecting the person in the **Requested on behalf of** field.
-   The requester can add one or more approvers of the vulnerability in the **Approvers** field. The approvers receive a notification when the vulnerability is moved to the **Pending approval** state.
-   The requester can add one or more persons on the watchlist of the vulnerability in the **Watchlist** field.
-   The requester of the vulnerability and persons on the Watchlist and Requested on behalf of fields do not receive any notifications when a vulnerability is assigned to them.
