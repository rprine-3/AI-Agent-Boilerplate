# Configure Model Workflow Settings

Configure the conditions and frequency for scheduling assessment and validation tasks to maintain a structured and timely approach to model risk management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_model\_risk\_mgmt.model\_governance or sn\_model\_risk\_mgmt.admin

## About this task

This task explains how to configure the frequency for assessment and validation tasks, and define filter conditions. You can schedule assessment and validation tasks for a model risk in the Monitor stage. Based on the configuration, tasks are automatically created for model risks that match the defined conditions in the workflow settings.

**Note:** Models with customized frequencies at the model risk record level aren’t affected.

To manually schedule assessment and validation tasks from the model risk record, refer to [Schedule assessment and validation tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/schedule-assessment-and-validation-tasks.md).

## Procedure

1.  If you're a Model Risk Management admin \[sn\_model\_risk\_mgmt.admin\], navigate to **All** &gt; **Model Risk Configuration** &gt; **Model Workflow Settings**, and continue from step 3.

2.  Users with sn\_model\_risk\_mgmt.model\_governance role, navigate to **All** &gt; **Model Risk Workspace** and do the following:

    1.  Select the list \[Omitted image "list-icon-mrm.png"\] Alt text: icon.

    2.  From the list, navigate to **Model risk configurations** &gt; **Model workflow settings**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the Create New Model Workflow Settings form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Unique name of the model workflow settings.|
    |Table|Table that the workflow setting applies to. This field is automatically set to **Model Risk**.|
    |Priority|Priority level for this workflow setting. If multiple workflow settings match the same conditions, the system uses the one with the highest priority.|
    |Active|Option to activate the workflow setting. When active, the defined scheduling rules and frequencies are applied to the filtered models.|
    |Filter condition|Conditions that determine which model records the workflow applies to. Select **Set conditions** to choose filter criteria. For more information, refer to [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).|

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  To update task schedules, go to the **Frequency settings** tab.

7.  Define the task frequency for Model risk assessment and Model validation task types.

8.  On the Frequency form, fill in the fields.
