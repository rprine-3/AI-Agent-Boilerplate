# Setting up the Crisis Map

Before integrating the Crisis Map with asset locations, configure settings to display active alerts.

## Understanding feed, alert, and event

-   **Feed**

    A feed is news content updated frequently and provided on a world-wide website. You can subscribe to a news feed by manually entering the web address or URL of the feed channel in the **Web** field of the Feed form.

-   **Alert**

    An alert is a notification that reports that an incident happened at a particular place and time. First, an incident or an event reportedly happens. Then, the alert triggers a notification that reports or notifies the incident to the concerned people to take an action.

-   **Event**

    Based on the severity of the alerts, you can take actions by just notifying the stakeholders of the incident that happened or declare a crisis event. An event can become a crisis event if it disrupts the business operations. In such a case, you can run the [Crisis Management workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/bcm-recovery-exercise-management.md) to activate the business continuity and disaster recovery plans for the locations impacted by the event.


## Setup steps to integrate crisis map

You require these configurations for the threat and alert feeds to show up in the crisis map visualization.

-   To search locations on the crisis map, [set up the system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/crisis-map-place-api-configuration.md).
-   To manage your threat feed subscriptions sourced internally and externally, [configure scheduled data imports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/crisis-map-scheduled-data-imports.md).
-   To plot your organization's assets or resources on the crisis map, [configure the resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/crisis-map-configure-resource.md).
-   To specify the conditions under which a feed should bubble up as an alert on the crisis map, [configure alert rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/crisis-map-alert-configuration.md).
-   Finally, to act on a critical alert from the crisis map dashboard, [configure an alert action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/crisis-map-alert-actions.md).
