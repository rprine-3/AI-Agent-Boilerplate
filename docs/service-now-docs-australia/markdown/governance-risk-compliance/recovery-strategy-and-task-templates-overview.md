# Recovery strategy and task templates

Business continuity planners often rebuild the same recovery structures each time they author a plan. Reusable templates remove that repetition by capturing standard strategies, tasks, and task groupings once and applying them wherever they are needed.

Recovery strategy templates capture the implementation profile of a strategy \(estimated time to implement, maximum duration of use, estimated % of operations achieved, and comments\). The same strategy can be applied to loss scenarios across plans.

-   Task templates are standalone, reusable tasks that you can add to a recovery task or event task on an ad hoc basis. Individual task templates do not carry dependencies.

-   Task template groups bundle multiple task templates and define dependencies between them. A group can apply to all element definitions or to specific ones \(for example, Business service or Linux server\). It scopes the groups offered when you add them from a loss scenario or recovery strategy.


Templates can be associated with plan templates at the plan, loss scenario, and recovery strategy levels. Then a plan created from the template generates the full hierarchy in a single operation.

If you are upgrading from a version without templates, you do not have to start from scratch. Select existing recovery tasks or event tasks and save them as a new group \(dependencies preserved\). Add them to an existing group, or save them as individual task templates.
