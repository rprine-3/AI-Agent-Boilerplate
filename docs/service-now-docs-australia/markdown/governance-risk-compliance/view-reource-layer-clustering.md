# View resource layer clustering

View your assets or resources on the map.

## Before you begin

Role required: BCM admin or BCM Program Manager

## About this task

The layers that you see in the map like the assets, datacenters, and core companies are the resources that you have configured. Each of these layers fetches data from the respective resource tables. The assets, datacenters, and core companies resources retrieve data from the location, datacenter, and company tables, respectively.

Asset locations that are nearby to each other are clustered and a cumulative count of the assets is displayed next to the asset icon.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Business Continuity** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  Click the map icon \(\[Omitted image "CrisisMapIcon.png"\] Alt text: Crisis map icon\).

3.  Click the layers icon \(\[Omitted image "BCMLayersIcon.png"\] Alt text: Layers control icon.\).

    The layers on the map appear just as pins on a Google map and are configurable. All the layer details like the asset locations, assets, datacenters, and core companies are displayed on the map by their configured icons.

    Use the layers control to view only the selected or all assets that can be toggled on and off on the map. As a crisis manager, when viewing active alerts you can make informed decisions by focusing on the most critical asset at that moment.

4.  To display a selective resource or asset on the map, select the check box of that asset.

    \[Omitted image "AssetLayersControls.png"\] Alt text: Control assets on the map.

    The icons of the selected asset are displayed on the map. Layer icons are displayed within black borders, whereas alert icons are within a white circle.

5.  Click an asset icon on the map to view its details.

    For example, if you click a datacenter icon \(\[Omitted image "BCMDatacenterIcon.png"\] Alt text: datacenter icon.\) that has no number or a count next to it, a pop over appears with the display information that you have configured in the Resource Configuration table \[sn\_fam\_resource\_config\].

    If you configure **Power** and **Power consumption** fields from the datacenter table \[cmdb\_co\_datacenter\] as display fields in the Resource Configuration form, the popover displays power consumption details and location coordinates.

6.  Select an asset icon with a number next to it.

    The map zooms in to show all the assets that match with the count in that cluster. You can further select each asset within the cluster and drill down to any asset to view its details on the pop over.

    You can view only one pop over at a time. The pop over disappears on clicking another node.

7.  Select the reset icon \(\[Omitted image "BCMResetIcon.png"\] Alt text: Map reset icon.\) to clear the search results on the map.
