# GRC notification redirection

When you receive notifications for GRC records, you're directed to either the workspace view or classic view based on your access permissions and role. This feature enables you to work directly in the appropriate interface without manual navigation.

## How it works

When you select a link in a notification, the system determines where to direct you based on your workspace access:

-   If you have access to a workspace, you're directed to the workspace view of the record.
-   If you don't have workspace access, you're directed to the classic view of the record.
-   If you have access to multiple workspaces, you're directed to the workspace view of the record in the workspace that takes precedence based on your administrator's configuration. For workspaces where dynamic routing is configured, routing is applied automatically.

## Benefits

-   You remain in your preferred interface without having to switch manually between workspace and classic views.
-   You have a consistent experience across notifications and workspaces.
-   Reduced confusion and fewer steps when accessing records.
-   If your workspace access can't be determined, you're directed to the classic view so that you can still access records from notifications.
