# Update an Issue Page Configurations record

Update an existing Issue Page Configurations record in the classic user interface to update the issue page configurations that are displayed in the Issues overview landing page in the workspace. After modifying the configurations in the Issue Page Configuration record, the issues, issue triages, and tracking status of the issues are displayed for the users in the desired workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Landing Page Configurations** &gt; **Issue Page Configurations**.

    The names of the available workspaces are listed in the Issue Page Configurations record.

2.  Select the workspace configuration record that you want to update.

    The Issue page configuration record for the selected workspace displays a list of the tabs. You can check the filter conditions for the selected table displayed in the respective tabs and update the fields if necessary.

    -   Name: Name of the tab that is displayed in the workspace.
    -   Issues: Configuration to be performed to display the issues widget in the workspace.
    -   Issue triage: Configuration to be performed to display the issue triage widget in the workspace.
