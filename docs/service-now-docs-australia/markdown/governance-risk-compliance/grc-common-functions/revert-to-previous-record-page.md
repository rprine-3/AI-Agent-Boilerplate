# Revert record page templates to the pre-17.x version

If you’re an existing customer and have a customized record page, you can revert to that old page.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Select the workspace in which you want to make changes, from the **My Experiences** list.

3.  Select **Record** page that belongs to your workspace from the list.

4.  In the record page, select **Developer** listed under **Menu** tab and select **Open variant collection**.

    In the **UX Screens** tab, you see two screens, **Record default** and **Risk record page**.

    **Note:** The two screens are shown only if you’re upgrading to version 17.x.

5.  Select the variant for which you want to change the order.

    If you give a high-order value, you revert to the old record page. If you want to switch to the new record page, set to low-order value.
