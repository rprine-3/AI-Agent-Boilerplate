# View your operational status

View the Operational Status modules for a list of the CIS Controls and technology Controls. Each control also includes the technology used to validate compliance, type of indicator template available, and the control's source table.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sn\_compliance.reader

## About this task

Starting with Version 12.0.2, the Operational Status modules provide a view of all of your CIS Controls and/or ISO 27002-based indicator templates mapped to specific CIS/ISO controls in one place. This information can be useful for monitoring your controls and the health of your system. The application is able to scan your instance and determine which controls you have implemented, along with the various technologies available for validating each control and protecting your data.

Beginning with the Australia release, Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator provides pre-packaged CIS v8 controls and indicator templates.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Technology Controls Monitoring** &gt; **Operational Status**.

    **Note:** The CIS controls module is renamed from CIS controls @R to Cybersecurity Controls. The Indicator Templates module is renamed to CIS Indicator Templates.

2.  Select either **CIS Controls** or **Technology Controls**.

    **Note:** The screen shown below results from selecting **CIS Controls**. The default columns will be slightly different if you select **Technology Controls**. However, you can select the gear icon to add or remove columns as needed.

    Each control includes the following information.
