# Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator

The Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator ™ enables users to easily adopt the CIS Controls from The Center for internet Security ™ to enhance their overall security preparedness and cyber-defense posture.

CIS Control adoption is further enhanced by targeting the leading cybersecurity methodologies to the user's maturity and readiness level.

The Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator contains the CIS Controls version 7.1 authority document, 191 associated CIS citations, and 191 CIS control objectives that are related to the citations.

The [Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/tech-controls-monitoring-accel.md) application \(com.sn\_grc\_infosec\), which must also be downloaded to use the Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator, includes 171 \(26 basic\) predefined indicator templates that are mapped to the CIS Controls. These indicator templates provide automated control validation and continuous monitoring.

## Support for CIS Controls ™ v8

Beginning with the Australia release, Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator supports CIS Controls ™ v8 authority documents, citations, and control objectives that are related to the citations.

## Content for CSA CCM v4.0

Beginning with the Australia release, Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator supports the Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix \(CSA CCM v4.0\) content such as Authority Document, Citations, and Control Objectives.

</table>As previously mentioned, the [Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/tech-controls-monitoring-accel.md) application \(com.sn\_grc\_infosec\) is a dependant application when you download the Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator application. The [Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/tech-controls-monitoring-accel.md) application provides predefined indicator templates that are mapped to the CIS Controls.

**Note:** Should you decide not to implement the Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator application, you can still use the [Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/tech-controls-monitoring-accel.md) to validate compliance with CIS and ISO 27002 via the Unified Compliance Framework \(UCF\) from the Policy and Compliance Management application. For more information, see [Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/tech-controls-monitoring-accel.md).

## UCF controls mapped to indicator templates

If you use the CIS or ISO authority documents imported from UCF, you can still manage compliance activities using the 285 \(171 CIS and 114 ISO\) automatically monitored indicator templates.

The 171 indicator templates are mapped to the 171 CIS control objectives provided with the Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator application.

**Note:** the information in the 26 basic indicator templates is drawn from various ServiceNow ITx applications, as shown in the following example.

|CIS Control|Description|ITx Source applications|
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|
|CIS Control 1.1|Utilize an active discovery tool to identify devices connected to the organization's network and update the hardware asset inventory.|Discovery|
|CIS Control 1.2|Utilize a passive discovery tool to identify devices connected to the organization's network and automatically update the organization's hardware asset inventory.|Discovery|
|CIS Control 1.4|Maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of all technology assets with the potential to store or process information. This inventory shall include all hardware assets, whether connected to the organization's network or not.|Discovery|
|CIS Control 1.5|Ensure that the hardware asset inventory records the network address, hardware address, machine name, data asset owner, and department for each asset and whether the hardware asset has been approved to connect to the network.|Discovery|
|CIS Control 1.6|Ensure that unauthorized assets are either removed from the network, quarantined, or the inventory is updated in a timely manner.|Discovery|
|CIS Control 1.7|Utilize port level access control, following 802.1x standards, to control which devices can authenticate to the network. The authentication system shall be tied into the hardware asset inventory data to ensure only authorized devices can connect to the network.|Discovery|

|CIS Control 19.6|Publish information for all workforce members, regarding reporting computer anomalies and incidents to the incident handling team. Such information should be included in routine employee awareness activities.|Security Incident Response|
|CIS Control 19.8|Create an incident scoring and prioritization schema based on known or potential impact to your organization. Utilize score to define frequency of status updates and escalation procedures.|Security Incident Response|

Control objectives that are downloaded from UCF have UCF as the source, as shown below.

If you click the **Citations** related list, you can see that two citations are present: one obtained from CIS and one from ISO 27001 authority documents from UCF.

\[Omitted image "ucf-control-objective-citations.png"\] Alt text: Citations included in a UCF control objective

These citations allow you to use the CIS controls downloaded from UCF, instead of the CIS Controls included with the Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator application while still associating the controls with the indicator templates provided.

If you want to associate this UCF control objective to similar indicator templates, you can click the **Indicator Templates** related list and then click the **Suggested** button.

A list of indicator templates that may apply to the selected control objective are shown.

Select the indicator templates you want to map to the UCF control objective and click **Add**.
