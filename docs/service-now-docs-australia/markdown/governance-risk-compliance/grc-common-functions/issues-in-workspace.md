# Issues in the Workspace

You can track all your issues or one specific issue from the Workspace. Issues are listed under the **Issues** module in the list view of the Workspace.

## Issue overview page

The issue form displays the details about your issues. You can see information about an issue's description, state, status, work notes, and what activity has occurred so far. The information about an issue is organized in different tabs such as the **Overview** tab and the **Details** tab as shown in the following example.

In the **Details** tab, you can find information about the issue, assignment, schedule, issue grouping, action plan, confidentiality, and activity and settings.

**Note:** The details section has been removed from the **Details** tab.

## Associating objects that are related to an issue

GRC user or business user or business user lite of Issue personas can associate objects, such as the control, risk, risk event, entities, engagements, control objectives, risk statements, policies, authority documents, or processing activities, or remove the existing objects that are related to the issue.

For example, consider an entity that you can select as a related list. You can either add the other related entities or remove the existing entities by using the **Add** or **Remove** UI buttons of the entity form.

The related lists on the issue form display the dependencies that are related to the issues. The following table lists a description of the tabs and sidebar on the Issue form.

## Recommended actions

Recommended actions are system-generated suggestions that can help you quickly select a remediation task or assign an issue to the correct person.

\[Omitted image "recommended-actions.png"\] Alt text: Remediation tasks recommended actions

As shown in the figure, recommended actions for remediation tasks are shown in the right side pane. You can see the list of recommended actions and perform the following:

-   **Use**: When you select a **Use** button, a form is shown with pre-populated data. You can assign to any user using the **Assigned to** field and select **Save**. You can see this record in the **Remediation tasks** tab.
-   **Dismiss**: If you don't want to use the recommended action, select **Dismiss**.

**Important:** Recommendations are shown only to the users with the following roles:

1.  Users with minimum roles of `sn_grc.business_user`, `sn_grc.business_user_lite`. You must add the `sn_nb_action.next_best_action_use` role to the `sn_grc.business_user` and `sn_grc.business_user_lite`.
2.  Users who have minimum role of `sn_grc.user` though they are not part of the issue persona.
3.  Users with minimum role of `sn_grc.business_user` and `sn_grc.business_user_lite` must be part of the issue persona.

As shown in the figure, system-generated recommendations are shown for the **Assigned to** field. You can see the top three predictions \(John Retak, James Vittolo, and Jerrod Bennett\) above the list of alphabetized users.

-   **[Configuring an issue relationship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/issue-relationship-configuration.md)**  
If an issue isn't reusable and you know that multiple similar issues were created for different controls, risk statements, or control objectives, you can still configure the issue relationship to reuse the issue in the GRC application.
