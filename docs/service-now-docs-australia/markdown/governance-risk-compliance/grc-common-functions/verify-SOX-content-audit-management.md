2.  Under the Profile filters related list, a filter is added to query the SOX processes table for the generation of SOX profiles.

    The **SOX Audit** engagement has been added in the Scope state with the following fields set as empty:

    -   **Assigned to**
    -   **Auditor**
    -   **Approver**
4.  Navigate to **Audit** &gt; **All Audit Tasks**.

5.  In the search bar, enter `SOX` in the **Name** field.

    The SOX Audit tasks have been added with the following fields:

    -   **Type** is interview or walkthrough
    -   **Assigned to** is empty
    -   **Assigned parent \(engagement\)** is SOX Audit
6.  Navigate to **Audit** &gt; **Audit Testing** &gt; **Test Templates**.

    The SOX test templates have been added and assigned to policy statements.

7.  Navigate to **Audit** &gt; **Audit Testing** &gt; **Test Plans**.

    The SOX test plans have been generated for controls based on the test templates.
