# Indicator templates for controls

The Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator includes 273 indicator templates \(94 Basic, 174 Manual, and 5 Scripted\) for CIS v7 and includes new 67 indicator templates \(64 Basic and 3 Scripted\) for CIS v8.

When the Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator is used along with the Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator application, you can manage indicator templates within the Cybersecurity Controls Accelerator application.

When Technology Controls Monitoring Accelerator is run as a standalone application; however, it can be run with the Policy and Compliance Management application. You can also [map UCF controls to indicator templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/cybersecurity-controls-accelerator.md) from with the Policy and Compliance Management application.

**Note:** For information on the different types of indicator templates, see [Using indicator templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/using-indicator-templates.md).

## Indicator templates for CIS v8 Controls

The following table lists the indicator templates for CIS v8 Controls.

**Note:** Controls currently not covered by either basic or scripted indicator templates have manual indicator templates defined for the purposes of compliance validation. For more information on CIS v8 indicator templates, see [KB0555526](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=/kb%3Fid=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0555526).

Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory:

 Establish and maintain an accurate, detailed, and up-to-date inventory of all enterprise assets with the potential to store or process data, to include: end-user devices \(including portable and mobile\), network devices, non-computing/IoT devices, and servers. Ensure the inventory records the network address \(if static\), hardware address, machine name, data asset owner, department for each asset, and whether the asset has been approved to connect to the network. For mobile end-user devices, MDM type tools can support this process, where appropriate. This inventory includes assets connected to the infrastructure physically, virtually, remotely, and those within cloud environments. Additionally, it includes assets that are regularly connected to the enterprise’s network infrastructure, even if they are not under control of the enterprise. Review and update the inventory of all enterprise assets bi-annually, or more frequently.

Apply Secure Design Principles in Application Architectures:

 Apply secure design principles in application architectures. Secure design principles include the concept of least privilege and enforcing mediation to validate every operation that the user makes, promoting the concept of "never trust user input." Examples include ensuring that explicit error checking is performed and documented for all input, including for size, data type, and acceptable ranges or formats. Secure design also means minimizing the application infrastructure attack surface, such as turning off unprotected ports and services, removing unnecessary programs and files, and renaming or removing default accounts.

Leverage Vetted Modules or Services for Application Security Components:

 Leverage vetted modules or services for application security components, such as identity management, encryption, and auditing and logging. Using platform features in critical security functions will reduce developers’ workload and minimize the likelihood of design or implementation errors. Modern operating systems provide effective mechanisms for identification, authentication, and authorization and make those mechanisms available to applications. Use only standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed encryption algorithms. Operating systems also provide mechanisms to create and maintain secure audit logs.

 Conduct threat modeling. Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing application security design flaws within a design, before code is created. It is conducted through specially trained individuals who evaluate the application design and gauge security risks for each entry point and access level.
