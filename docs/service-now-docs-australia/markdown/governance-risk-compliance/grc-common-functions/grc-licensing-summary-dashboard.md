# GRC licensing summary dashboard

Use the GRC licensing summary dashboard to track license usage trends and next month's projected usage. You can see the aggregated counts of license consumption across different product families. You can also search for roles to identify their combined GRC license treatment when these roles are assigned to a user.

The GRC licensing summary dashboard displays the monthly aggregated counts of license consumption across different product families including Integrated Risk Management, Business Continuity Management, and Privacy Management.

You must have the product owner role \(sn\_irm\_shared\_cmn.product\_owner\) to access the dashboard. Navigate to **All** &gt; **GRC Licensing Overview** &gt; **Licensing Summary Dashboard**.

## GRC licensing summary dashboard tabs

The GRC licensing summary dashboard has the following three tabs:

-   License consumption- Shows the license utilization, usage trend analysis using a filter for product family, and license utilization month on month.
-   Estimated next month usage- Shows the estimated license usage for the next month based solely on the current roles assigned to users.
-   Role attribution to licensing mapping- Shows the license mapping of default GRC roles, users license treatment, license treatment for users who are part of a user group based on the roles assigned to the user group, and license treatment based on combination of multiple roles.
