 During an upgrade to either version 11.x or 12.x of GRC: Profiles, users who have previously performed a GRC operation in the past 90 days are automatically assigned with the sn\_grc.business\_user role. This is a one-time event. The group and role are assigned once during the 11.x or 12.x upgrade.

 For more information on the sn\_grc.business\_user role, see [KB0864247](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0864247).

**Note:** You must log in to Now Support to view the Knowledge Base articles.

 **Note:** You can manage who can access your GRC records with the GRC user roles. Earlier, your users with the snc\_internal role could also access the GRC records. As part of the security updates, each GRC application has modified access control lists \(ACLs\) where access to the GRC records is restricted only to the users with the GRC roles.

**Note:** When you \(a GRC user\) run a job to create a record, this will create an entry to the user in the Unique user table.
