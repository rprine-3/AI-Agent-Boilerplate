# Create data relationships

Create a path to go from a record in the template configuration to any table that you require. When you create these paths, you can get the necessary data from each of these paths in your audit report template.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_doc\_design.admin and sn\_audit.admin

## About this task

When you create data relationships, for example, for an audit engagement, you can specify how the issues, remediation tasks, test plans, and so on, are related to the record in the template relationship registry and you create a path to navigate to these respective records. You can create as many relationships as you require.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Audit** &gt; **Audit Report** &gt; **Template configurations**.

2.  Open the template configuration that you created.

3.  In the Data relationships related list, select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the field.

<table id="table_zb5_hgc_pcc"><thead><tr><th>
