# NIST RMF Use Case Accelerator dashboards and reports

The NIST RMF Use Case Accelerator contains various reports displayed on different dashboards, available within each of the sections in the NIST RMF process: Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, and Monitor.

**Note:** Starting with version 10.1.0, the NIST RMF Use Case Accelerator will be supported only for customers who currently use the product. New and existing customers should consider using the GRC: Continuous Authorization Monitoring application. For details, [Continuous Authorization and Monitoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/continuous-risk-monitoring/grc-cam-landing-page.md).

<table id="table_rjy_xcy_3hb"><tbody><tr><td>

Targets with no Baseline Controls

</td><td>

Targets with completed security impact analysis with no baseline control generated. Baseline Controls are recommended set of security controls from National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) which when implemented and determined to be effective, would mitigate security risk while complying with security requirements. The Baseline Controls to be implemented can be determined from the recommended Baseline Policy Statements on the Target.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Targets pending Impact Analysis

</td><td>

Security impact analysis when conducted by the organizations, determines the extent to which proposed or actual changes to the target or its environment of operation can affect or have affected the security state of the target. Changes to the target or its environment of operation may affect the security controls currently in place \(including system-specific, hybrid, and common controls\), produce new vulnerabilities in the target, or generate requirements for new security controls that were not needed previously.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Targets status

</td><td>

Targets organized by their current state of Risk Management process. The Risk Management process is provided by National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) Risk Management Framework \(RMF\) is a disciplined and structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Confidentiality Impact

</td><td>

Targets grouped for each confidentiality rating value. National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) defines Confidentiality as preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. Confidentiality is expressed as High, Moderate, and Low values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Integrity Impact

</td><td>

Targets grouped for each Integrity rating value. National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) defines Integrity as guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity. Integrity is expressed as High, Moderate, and Low values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Availability Impact

</td><td>

Targets grouped for each Availability rating value. National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) defines Availability as ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. Availability is expressed as High, Moderate, and Low values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Impact

</td><td>

Targets grouped for each Impact rating value. National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) defines Impact as the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have: \(i\) a limited adverse effect; \(ii\) a serious adverse effect; or \(iii\) a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Whereas security impact analysis is defined as organizations determination of the extent to which the security state is affected. Impact is expressed as High, Moderate, and Low values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review Baseline Controls

</td><td>

Provides an overview for the NIST Risk Management select step of the framework in-order to facilitate review of the baseline policy statements and controls. NIST RMF &gt; Select &gt; Review Baseline Controls launches this dashboard

</td></tr><tr><td>

Baseline Security Policy Statements

</td><td>

Baseline Security Policy Statements are recommended set of security control definitions from National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) which when implemented and determined to be effective, would mitigate security risk while complying with security requirements.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Baseline Security Controls

</td><td>

Baseline Security Controls are recommended set of security controls from National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) which are being implemented and if determined to be effective, would mitigate security risk while complying with security requirements.
