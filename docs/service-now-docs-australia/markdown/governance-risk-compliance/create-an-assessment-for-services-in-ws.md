# Create an Importance and impact tolerance assessment

Determine the importance and impact tolerance of a business service by conducting an assessment using either Smart Assessment or Legacy assessment. The assessment questionnaire helps you to measure the service's importance and its impact on customers based on their responses. By evaluating the feedback, you can effectively gauge the significance of your business service and understand its effects on your customers.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.user, sn\_oper\_res.manager

## About this task

Operational Resilience Managers \(sn\_oper\_res.manager\) have the Smart Assessment reader role \(sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_reader\). They have read-only access to the Smart Assessment template, enabling them to view but not create or edit it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **List** &gt; **Importance and impact tolerance assessment** &gt; **All assessments**.

    The Importance and impact tolerance assessments \(IIA\) in the Operational Resilience application are displayed in the All assessments list view as shown in the following example.

    \[Omitted image "list-view-of-assessments.png"\] Alt text: List view in the All assessments form.

2.  To create an assessment, select **New**.

    This action opens an assessment form where you can add the details about the assessment. The system auto-assigns a number for the Importance and impact tolerance assessment, such as IIA0010018.

3.  In the **Name** and **Description** fields, provide a name and description for the assessment.

4.  Select the type of assessment in the **Assessment type** field.

    You can select the following types of assessment in the **Assessment template** field:

    -   Smart Assessment: You can add multiple smart assessment templates for the `Assessment type: Smart assessment` in the **Smart assessment templates** field.
    -   Legacy Assessment: You can add a single assessment template for the `Assessment type: Legacy assessment` in the **Assessment template** field.

Smart Assessment method for performing the importance and impact tolerance assessment using the Smart Assessment Engine.

 To perform Smart Assessment and measure the importance and impact tolerance, the base version includes the following templates. You can select one or multiple templates:

-   **Importance assessment template**: Use this template to measure the importance of a service.
-   **Impact tolerance assessment template**: Use this template to measure the impact tolerance of a service.
-   **Importance and impact tolerance assessment template**: Use this template to importance and assess the impact tolerance of a service.
**Note:** Templates are provided as demo data only. You can modify the existing templates or use them to create new templates for your specific requirements.

 You can select multiple templates and assign them to different users, enabling for separate assessments. For example, one user can work on the importance assessment and another user can work on the impact tolerance assessment.

 **Note:** To make the desired Smart Assessment templates visible in the drop-down of the IIA form in the Operational Resilience Workspace, ensure that following steps are completed in the Assessment Workspace.

-   Select the necessary template, such as the Importance and impact tolerance assessment template, in the Details section.
-   Choose either the **Importance assessment**, **Impact tolerance assessment**, or **Importance and impact tolerance assessment** category in the **Assessment template categories** field. If you choose a different category, the desired template will not be shown in the Operational Resilience Workspace.
-   Choose **Importance and impact tolerance assessment** as the target in the **Assessment targets** field.
-   To read the assessment, specify the reader role \(sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_reader\) as the minimum role in the **Assessment reader role** field of the Settings section.
-   Publish the assessment template.
Only when these conditions are met, the template is available for selection in the drop-down on the IIA form.

 Operational Resilience administrators can edit or create Smart Assessment templates in the base version and update their automation logic to suit the business needs.
