# Create an auditable unit and scope entities at risk

Create auditable units to identify business entities that can possibly be at risk and scope them into audits.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_audit.manager, sn\_audit\_ws.supervisor, sn\_audit.user, sn\_audit\_ws.auditor

## About this task

Auditable units are a combination of different entities such as business units, products or services, legal entities, regulatory required audits, processes, programs, systems, policies, regulation, financial statements, and others.

After you determine the nature and scope of the auditable units, your goal is to perform risk assessments, and scope auditable units and entities based on the risk rating.
