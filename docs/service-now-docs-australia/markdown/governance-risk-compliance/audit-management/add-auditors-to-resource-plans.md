# Add auditors for an engagement from resource plans

Assign audit tasks to auditors in an engagement from the resource plans. Resource plans track the cost associated to auditors. Considering this cost is important while planning the engagement.

## Before you begin

If you have an engagement record with a resource plan created, the resource plan must be in Allocated state. The users in the Resource Allocations section of the resource plan contain resources that can be added as auditors. The auditors you add must have sn\_audit.user or external auditor role, and pps\_resource role. The Resource Plans related list with its associated workflow is only available when the GRC Advanced Audit and the Project Portfolio Management plugins are activated.

Role required: sn\_audit.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Audit** &gt; **Engagements**.

2.  Open the engagement record to which you want to add auditors.

3.  Click the Resource Plan related list.

4.  Click the **Add Auditors** button.

    The resources who have the required roles are automatically added to the auditors field, if they are not already present.
