# Request evidence using Audit Workspace to Assest Audit Response

Request evidence at any stage during an audit using the Audit Workspace. The details about the items for which evidence is requested are also provided to the person responsible for providing the evidence.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc-advance.evidence-requestor

## About this task

Selecting **Create a new evidence request task** in this procedure allows you to create an response directly. This bypasses the need to first create collection details. Typically, a response is created for each collection detail before working on the evidence response — this step is skipped when creating the task directly.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Audit** &gt; **Engagements** &gt; **My Engagements**.

2.  Open the engagement record, and select the related list from which you want to request evidence.

3.  Select the **Evidence** tab.

4.  Select **New** to create a new evidence request task.

    **Request evidence** page is displayed.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.
