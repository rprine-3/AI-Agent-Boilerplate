# Evidence request workflow

Evidence request helps users to electronically request the information that they need from the first and second line of defense. The individuals being audited can then immediately upload their documents to the system, significantly reducing manual processing time.

The evidence request workflow is as follows:

1.  An audit user with the sn\_audit.user role requests evidence and assigns the request to another user. This requester can either request the evidence for themselves or raise a request on behalf of another audit user or GRC user. If the requester determines that an evidence task has been created erroneously, then the requester can cancel that particular evidence task. The ability to cancel the evidence request is available when the request is in **Draft** state. A requester can cancel the evidence request tasks any time until the tasks reach the **Review** state.
2.  While creating an evidence request, you can choose between the two-step or three-step flow.

    **Note:** The two-step evidence request functionality is available starting with GRC: Advanced Core, version 23.0.2.

3.  The assignee then receives an email with the link to provide the requested evidence.

    **Note:** If the requester changes the assignee after requesting evidence, then the original assignee can no longer view the request. Only the person who is assigned the request can view the request. This feature provides confidentiality.

4.  The assignee can either attach the requested evidence or provide a URL or location that contains the required evidence.
5.  The assignee can also add an approver for verifying and approving the evidence. Adding approvers is necessary if the evidence is sensitive and confidential in nature.
6.  The approver can then review the evidence and either approve it, request revision, or request further details about the evidence.
7.  If the approver approves the evidence, the requester receives the evidence and can process it further.
8.  The requester can then review the evidence and do one of the following:
    -   accept the evidence.
    -   request a review.
    -   request further details about the evidence.
    -   cancel the evidence request if it is not required anymore.
    -   delete the request.
9.  If the requester accepts all the evidence tasks, the request is closed.
