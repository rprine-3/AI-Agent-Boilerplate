-   GRC Advanced Core
-   GRC Advanced Risk

You can choose to create audit plans for the engagement.

**Note:** To know more about the applications in GRC module, see [Governance, Risk, and Compliance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/r_WhatIsGRC.md).
