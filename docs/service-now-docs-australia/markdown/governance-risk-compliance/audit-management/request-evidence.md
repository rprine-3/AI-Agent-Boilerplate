# Request evidence for audit using two-step process

Request evidence at any stage during an audit. The details about the items for which evidence is requested are also provided to the person responsible for providing the evidence.

## Before you begin

Role required: The role required for Audit Management is sn\_audit.user.

Following are the roles required for Lite Audit:

-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_reader
-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_requester
-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_responder
-   sn\_grc\_advanced.evidence\_admin

## About this task

Evidence can be requested in the following three ways:

-   By creating an evidence record from the **My Evidence** module.
-   From the Entity, Control, Audit Task, Control Test Issue, and Other Issues related lists in an engagement record. To request evidence from these sources, navigate to **Audit** &gt; **Engagements** &gt; **My Engagements**. Open the engagement record, and select the related list from which you want to request evidence. From the **Action on selected rows** list, select **Request Evidence**. Here, you can either create an evidence request or add more requests to an existing evidence request. The evidence request is created but not the evidence request tasks.

    Select **Create an evidence request task** in the **Request evidence** page to create request task.\[Omitted image "request\_evidence\_itam.png"\] Alt text: New evidence form.

-   From the following tables: Entity, Control, Control Objective, Control Test, Engagement, Issue. However, when the users request evidence from these tables, the evidence request is created, not the actual evidence request task. The users must go to the evidence request record that is generated and then add evidence request tasks.

In this procedure, the method to request evidence from the **My Evidence** module is described.

You can request evidence by using two different processes:

-   Three-step process \(standard\) The standard approach creates an Evidence Collection Details record as an intermediate step. This provides additional organization and context before evidence submission. → Continue with step 1 below.
-   Two-step process \(streamlined\) Skip the Evidence Collection Details step and move directly to evidence submission. Use this for simpler requests where collection instructions are minimal. → Jump to "Two-step process \(simplified\)" section below.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Audit Workspace** &gt; **Engagement record \(in Validate state\)** &gt; **Evidence related list** and select **New**.

    The **New** button on the Evidence related list is shown in the example.

    The Request evidence form displays.

    \[Omitted image "req-evi-skip-colle-det-selected.png"\] Alt text: Skip collection detail.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    To follow the two-step process, check the **Skip collection detail** check box.

    To follow the three-step process, leave the **Skip collection detail** check box unchecked.

4.  Follow these steps to create a response using two-step process \(if you selected the **Skip collection detail** check box in step 2\).

    1.  Click to open the Evidence request.

        In the Evidence request record, the **Details** tab shows that the **Skip collection detail** option is selected. The record is in **Work in progress** state. The work note shows that "Skip Collection" is enabled.

        The Evidence related list shows the response.

        \[Omitted image "evi-response-created.png"\] Alt text: Evidence response created.

5.  Follow these steps to create a response using three-step process \(if you did not select the **Skip collection detail** check box in step 2\).

    After completing steps 2 and 3 \(with **Skip collection detail** check box unchecked\), another Evidence request is created.

    The **Details** tab of the Evidence request record shows that the record is in the **Draft** state, the **Skip collection detail** option is not selected, and the work note shows the activity details. A **New** button is not displayed on the Evidence related list.

    The Evidence collection details related list appears with a **New** button. This related list is used to list the items for which evidence is requested.

    **Note:** If there are no Evidence collection details and the Evidence request record is in **Draft** state, the **Skip collection detail** field is editable. The field is not editable when the evidence request record is in the **Work in Progress** state. You can select the check box and follow the two-step process as outlined in step 4.

    1.  Select **New** in the Evidence collection details related list.
