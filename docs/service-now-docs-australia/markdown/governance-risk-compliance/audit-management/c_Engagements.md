# Manage engagements

The audit engagement process involves creating, planning, scoping, and conducting engagements as well as reporting on engagement findings.

## Engagement process

The base system audit engagement process includes steps for scoping, validating, conducting, and approving engagement results. It also contains steps for following up on open audit tasks and issues, and finally closing out the audit engagement.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Scope

</td><td>

During the **Scope** state, audit managers define which entities are involved in the audit engagement. For example, for a financial audit, one may include all business services that the finance department relies on and the finance department itself.

 See [Add entities to an engagement scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/audit-management/add-profiles-to-engagement-scope.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Validate

</td><td>

After an engagement has moved to the **Validate** state, all the risks, controls, and test plans associated with the entities in the engagement's scope are associated with the audit. Indicator results collected during the audit period are also associated with the audit. Audit managers can review the risks, controls, test plans, and indicator results, and update the scope of the engagement, if necessary. Audit managers can also begin creating and planning audit tasks for the engagement.

 To move an engagement into the **Validate** state, click **Validate** on any engagement currently in the **Scope** state.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Fieldwork

</td><td>

Auditors complete their assigned audit tasks during the **Fieldwork** state. These tasks include control testing, interviews, walkthroughs, and other activities. Issues that are found during control testing are associated with the engagement. Auditors can also create general issues associated with the engagement. Audit managers can create additional audit tasks as needed. When the audit is done, audit managers specify the result of the engagement, whether it's satisfactory, adequate or inadequate, and provide details on their opinion.

 To move an engagement into the **Fieldwork** state, click **Advance to Fieldwork** on any engagement currently in the **Validate** state.

 See [Audit task management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/audit-management/c_AuditTasks.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Awaiting Approval

</td><td>

During the "Awaiting Approval" state, the approvers specified in the **Approvers** field of the engagement review the results of the audit tasks conducted and the issues that were created. After reviewing the results of the engagements, approvers approve or reject the engagement.

 To move an engagement into the **Awaiting Approval** state, click **Request approval** on any engagement currently in the **Fieldwork** state.

 See [Approve or reject an engagement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/audit-management/approve-reject-engagement.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Follow Up

</td><td>

After an engagement is approved, it automatically goes into the **Follow Up** state if there are remaining open tasks, issues, or milestones \(in case of GRC Advanced Audit\). During this stage, auditors must close out all remaining issues, tasks, and milestones before the engagement is marked as complete.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed

</td><td>

Engagements move into the "Closed" state under one of three conditions:

-   The engagement is closed as incomplete during the **Scope**, **Validate**, or **Fieldwork** states.
-   There are no open audit tasks, issues, and milestones after the engagement is approved. In this case, the engagement automatically moves from the **Awaiting Approval** state to the **Closed** state.
-   All follow-up tasks, issues, and milestones are closed out. In this case, the engagement automatically moves from the **Follow Up** state to the **Closed** state.

After defining a control, audit managers create control tests that run periodically and provide documented evidence of whether the associated control is operating correctly. After creating multiple control tests on an engagement, use the Control tests grid to view, manage, and request evidence for all tests in one place.
-   **[Create an audit task activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/audit-management/t_CreateAnActivity.md)**  
After defining a control, audit managers create activities that explore and provide documented evidence of whether the associated control is operating correctly.
