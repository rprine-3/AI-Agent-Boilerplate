# Create a milestone for an engagement

Create a milestone for an engagement to track the progress of an engagement. You can also add audit tasks to a milestone.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_audit.manager, sn\_audit\_ws.supervisor

## About this task

A milestone is used to track the progress of an engagement.

After you create milestones for an engagement, you can also add audit tasks to the milestone. You can track those tasks as milestones.

You can assign a milestone to a user who is responsible for the milestone. The assigned user must have the sn\_audit.user role. The assigned user then receives a notification about the assignment.

If an engagement moves to the Follow Up state, and if there are no open audit tasks, open milestones, or open observations, then the engagement moves to the **Closed** state.
