</table>    -   **Confidentiality flag to control access of audit records**

        You can set the confidentiality flag at the record level for an issue, engagement, observation, control test, activity, interview, and walkthrough records. The users whom you determine to view and update these records are confidential users.

        When the **Confidentiality** option is selected, a list of users who can be an engagement lead, auditors, and approvers are auto-populated as **Confidential users**.

        You can add more audit users or GRC business users to the list or remove some of the existing users based on your access control criteria and can set them as confidential users.

        Additionally, you can also add random users to the record, who are neither audit users nor GRC business users. However, an email notification is sent to all confidential users who have neither an audit user nor a GRC business user role intimating them to acquire the confidential role \(sn\_grc.confidential\_user\) from the admin if they are to access the record.

        You can also select groups as **Confidential groups** who can access the record as well. For more information, see Confidential records in GRC common features.

        To enable the Confidentiality property at the system level:

        1.  Navigate to **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.
        2.  Select **sn\_grc.enable\_record\_confidentiality** system property.
        3.  Enter **true** in the **Value** field. This action enables record level confidentiality.
        4.  Select **Update**.
8.  Select **Save**.

    You can monitor the state of the observation record in the **State** banner of the default Overview page as the record progresses through the different states.
