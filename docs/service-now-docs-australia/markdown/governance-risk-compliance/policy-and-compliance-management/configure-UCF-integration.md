# Configure the UCF integration using the UCF Common Controls Hub

Compliance administrators can download content from Network Frontiers Unified Compliance Framework \(UCF\) to use as GRC authority documents, citations, controls, and control objectives.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_comp\_ucf.admin and oauth\_admin

The documents can be updated on pre-defined intervals. You must have a UCF Common Controls Hub account to create shared lists and import them into the ServiceNow® instance. API access is required to download UCF content from the UCF-CCH.

**Note:** Please take note of the following guidelines before configuring the UCF integration using the UCF Common Controls Hub

-   Only the UCF Oauth administrator has access to the system Oauth tables. You must grant the UCF Oauth administrator role to the GRC UCF administrator, so the UCF administrator can set up UCF configuration page.
-   UCF integration requires that GRC is configured and users must be a Common Controls Hub administrator.
-   The configuration page for the global domain is loaded by default. If you are using Domain Separation, delete the default configuration page, and create one specific to your domain.

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Unified Compliance Integration**.

2.  Click the UCF configuration.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Client ID

</td><td>

Enter the Client ID or UCF OAuth Client ID provided by Customer Service and Support. See [Create a Now Support Case for UCF-CCH account integration information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/create-hi-request-ucf-integration.md) for information.

 **Note:** Configuration information is specific to the ServiceNow® instance. Be sure to enter accurate information for any test, development, or production instances you are using. Do not include spaces in the entry.

</table>4.  Right-click the form header and click **Save**.

5.  In the UCF Integration dialog that appears, click **Request New Token**.

    **Note:** For initial configuration, a user with an UCF administrator account performs this setp and the next step.

7.  In the application authorization message that displays, click **Authorize**.

8.  Select a shared list and click **Save Configuration**.


## What to do next

If UCF introduces new fields and content, administrators can use staging tables and transform maps to accommodate those changes to UCF data formats. This is an advanced configuration and not required. The following import sets and tables can be configured to customize the UCF download logic.

|Staging table|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|UCF Authority Document \[sn\_comp\_ucf\_authority\_document\]|The UCF Authority Document staging table is used to store authority documents that are downloaded from the UCF Common Controls Hub|
|UCF Citation \[sn\_comp\_ucf\_citation\]|The UCF Citation staging table is used to store citations that are downloaded from the UCF Common Controls Hub|
|UCF Control \[sn\_comp\_ucf\_control\]|The UCF Control staging table is used to store controls that are downloaded from the UCF Common Controls Hub|
|UCF Citation to Control \[sn\_comp\_ucf\_m2m\_control\_citation\]|The UCF Citation to Control staging table is used to store citation to controls that are downloaded from the UCF Common Controls Hub|

|Transform maps|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|Default Authority document transform|Transforms data from the UCF Authority document staging table into the Authority Document table|
|Default Citation Transform|Transforms data from the UCF Citation staging table into the Citation table|
|Default Control transform|Transforms data from the UCF Control staging table into the Control Objective table|
|Control to Citation transform map|Transforms data from the UCF Citation to Control table into the Control Objective to Citation table|
