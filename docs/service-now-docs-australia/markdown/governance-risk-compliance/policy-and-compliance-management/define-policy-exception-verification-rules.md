# Define policy exception and extension rules

Configure granular approval rules for policy exceptions and extensions using the GRC Approval Configurator.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance.manager to create the policy exception and extension rules.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assignment and Approval Configurations** &gt; **Approval Configurations**.

    The Approval Configurator is shipped with default templates for verification, final approval, and extension. The priority is set for each of them. By default, verification configuration is set with priority 1, approval configuration is set to priority 2, and extension approval configuration to priority 3.

2.  Select the configuration template.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Enter a name for this configuration.|
    |Active|Select this option to activate the configuration.|
    |Applies to|Ensure that **Policy exception \(sn\_compliance\_policy\_exception\)** option is selected.|
    |Domain|Search for and select the functional group or role that should be associated with the approval flow.|
    |Filter Condition|Use filter conditions to define when the configuration should be activated. The available values are sourced from the Policy Exception table. You must set both the State and Sub-state conditions. Use logical operators such as AND or OR to build complex condition sets.|

4.  Select **New** in the **Approval Levels** table to add approval levels to the configuration.

    1.  Provide a name.

    2.  Assign a level.

    3.  Select **Submit**.

    You can add multiple levels for the configuration. Each level can have its own rule, assigned users or groups, and triggering conditions.

5.  Select the approval level you have created and select **New** to add the rule to the approval level.

    1.  Fill in the following fields.

-   **Dynamic approvers**: Define approvers dynamically using the source. Apply static or advanced dynamic conditions to filter approvers. You can select a user field, group field, or both to determine who should approve.
-   **Scripted approvers**: Use a script to programmatically determine approvers. The script must populate the users and groups variables.
