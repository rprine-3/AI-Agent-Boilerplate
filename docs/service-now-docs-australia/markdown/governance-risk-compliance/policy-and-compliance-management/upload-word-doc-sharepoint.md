# Upload a Microsoft Word document to Microsoft SharePoint

Upload a Microsoft Word document that exists in your local machine to Microsoft SharePoint and link the document with the policy. As a user, you can access the document from any device and enable multiple users to collaborate on the policy document.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance\_ws.corporate\_compliance\_analyst; mp\_document\_user

**Note:** Verify that you have set up the pre-requisite steps appropriately to upload the Microsoft Word document to the cloud. For more information, see [Pre-requisites to enable policy redlining feature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/pre-req-policy-redlining.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**.

2.  In the Compliance Workspace, select the \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon icon.

3.  Navigate to **Compliance library** &gt; **My policies**.

4.  Select a policy and select the Policy text related list to upload a document.

    You can upload a Microsoft Word document that exists locally in your machine.

5.  To upload a Microsoft Word document that exists in your local machine to the Microsoft SharePoint site, select the **Enable document editing** button.

6.  Select the **Upload a document** option.

7.  To copy the URL of the Microsoft SharePoint site, navigate to the Microsoft SharePoint site Home page, select **Share** and click **Copy link to page**.

8.  Enter the copied URL of the Microsoft SharePoint site in the **Site URL** field.

9.  Enter the path of the folder where the document must be uploaded in the **Folder Path** field.

10. Select the Add File link to browse and open the Microsoft Word document that exists in your local machine.

    The name of the Microsoft Word document defaults as the **Title** of the file in the Upload a file pop-up. If necessary, you can change the name of the file in the **Title** field.

    **Note:** You can upload only one file at a time to the folder.

11. After you have selected the file as an attachment, select **Upload**.

12. After the file is attached, select **Upload**.

    If personal authentication is enabled and this is the first time you are performing a document operation in this session, a one-time authentication prompt appears. For SharePoint, the prompt uses the logged-in Microsoft O365 session automatically.

    The selected file from your local machine is uploaded to the folder path that you'd specified in the Microsoft SharePoint site. The document is registered in SharePoint under your personal account identity.
