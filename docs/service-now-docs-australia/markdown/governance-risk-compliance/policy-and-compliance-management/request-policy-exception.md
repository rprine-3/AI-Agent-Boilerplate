# Request a policy exception

Users can request exceptions for policies, control objectives, or issues by specifying the reason of exception on a particular list of the systems, applications, networks, or entities for which the exception will apply. The user must also specify the duration for which the exception is required.

Role required: sn\_grc.business\_user, sn\_grc.business\_user\_lite

## About this task

Exceptions provide temporary relief for users unable to meet compliance requirements due to extraordinary situations. For example, if the user is unable to meet a control that stipulates that all critical OS servers must be patched within 48 hours after the OS vendor releases patches.

## Procedure
