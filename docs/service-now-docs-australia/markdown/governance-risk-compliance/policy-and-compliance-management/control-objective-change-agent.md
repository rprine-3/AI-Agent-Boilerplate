# Control Objective Change Agent

When a citation is updated, such as changes in security guidelines or regulatory requirements, associated control objectives must also reflect those changes to maintain compliance accuracy.

This agent supports multiple Large Language Model \(LLM\) providers, such as Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Claude.

2.  Control objective details updater skill: The AI agent monitors these impacted objectives and validates whether updates are truly required. Using the Control objective details updater skill, the agent fetches and applies updated descriptions and supplemental guidance to the relevant control objectives. It intelligently considers all associated citations while filtering out irrelevant details to ensure precise updates.
3.  User feedback and refinement: An interactive ServiceNow Otto panel provides a feedback loop. Users can review the AI-generated suggestions and:
    -   Accept the proposed updates.
    -   Add or remove specific details.
