Create a policy text document in Microsoft OneDrive and enable document editing with the approvers, reviewers, and contributors. You can share the document with your stakeholders and collaborate on the document editing in real-time.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance\_ws.corporate\_compliance\_analyst; mp\_document\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**.

2.  In the Compliance Workspace, select\[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lists icon. from the sidebar.

3.  Navigate to **Compliance library** &gt; **My policies**.

    You can [create a new policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/create-policy-ws.md) or open a record to enable the redlining feature.

4.  Select a policy to open.

5.  For Microsoft OneDrive, select the Policy text related list to view the contents of the policy text.

    1.  Select the **Enable document editing** button.

        If the policy is in **Draft** state, then the policy owner can alone create a document or associate a document from Microsoft OneDrive to enable the policy text for editing by the approvers, reviewers, and contributors.

    2.  To create a document as a policy owner, select **Create new document** in the **Enable document editing** list.

    3.  Enter the path of the folder where the document resides in the **Folder location** field.

        For example, GRC/Folder.

    4.  Enter the name of the document in the **Document name** field.

    5.  Select **Create**.

    6.  To view the document that is created, select the **Open in Word** button.

6.  To view the users that have read or write access to the document, navigate to the Document access related list.

7.  To create another document or connect to a different document for a redlining-enabled policy, select the **Enable document editing** button.

    To create another document, select **Create new document** that opens the Create a document pop-up.

8.  To update the content of the document in the **Policy text** field, select the Update link below the document link.

9.  If the policy has been drafted and is complete, the policy owner can request a review by selecting the **Request review** button.

10. Enter a message for the reviewers in the Request review pop-up.

11. Select **Request**.

    As a reviewer, you can view the policy, if ready for review, when you log in to **My pending tasks** in the Tasks view.

12. Select the **Submit review** button.

    You can review the policy text, add a comment in the Submit review pop-up, and submit it.

13. To preview the document and to get the latest update after your collaborators have edited, select the Update link in the **Policy text** tab.

    As a policy owner, you can edit the content of the document in Microsoft OneDrive to maintain a sync between the document in Cloud and the policy text of the policy.

    All activities between the policy owner and the reviewers are captured in the **Activity** tab of the **Details** related list. If all reviewers have completed the review, then the policy owner can complete the publishing checklist.

14. Select the **Complete publishing checklist** button.

    If all reviews are complete, then as a policy owner you can complete the publishing process. This action creates a playbook. The policy owner must go through the publishing checklist before requesting approval. See, [Complete publishing checklist for the policy and request approval](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/complete-publishing-checklist-redlining.md).

15. To view the history of the policy, select the Policy history related list.
