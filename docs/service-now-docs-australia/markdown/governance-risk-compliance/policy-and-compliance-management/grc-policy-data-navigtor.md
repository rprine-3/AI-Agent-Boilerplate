# 360° Relationship Visualization for Policy and Compliance Management

When you launch the 360° view from a particular compliance record, you can instantly explore the relationship between the selected record and all its associated objects in a distinctive visualization.

## 360° view

In Policy and Compliance Management, the 360° relationship view button is enabled in the following workspace forms:

-   Authority document \[sn\_compliance\_authority\_document\]
-   Policy \[sn\_compliance\_policy\]
-   Citation \[sn\_compliance\_citation\]
-   Control \[sn\_compliance\_control\]
-   Control objective \[sn\_compliance\_policy\_statement\]

To explore the 360° view and for instructions to launch the view, see [Exploring the 360° view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-360-degree-relationship-visualization/understanding-360-view.md).

## 360° view of compliance objects integrating with issue in an m2m relationship

The 360° views from the compliance objects such as authority document, policy, control, control objective, and engagement in the Compliance Workspace give you a comprehensive and detailed overview of the issues that are linked to these objects in a many-to-many \(m2m\) relationship.

For example, selecting **360° view** from the authority document that is linked to an issue launches the 360° view enabling you to view the issues that are open for the authority document. You can get more details of the issues when you click the Open issues link.

Similarly, you can navigate to the Issue's Overview page and click the **360° view** button. If the issue applies to any of the objects, or if it is linked to the objects in an m2m relationship, then the view gives you comprehensive integration details.

You can click the View all link to view all the compliance objects that the issue applies to.

\[Omitted image "360DegIssueViewAppliesto.png"\] Alt text: Objects to which the issue applies.

If you had selected **Attestation** in the **Attestation method** for the control, then you can view the attestations added as a component in the 360° view of the control. Select and click the Attestations link in the donut and you can view the Attestations panel on the right with the assessment instance and template details.
