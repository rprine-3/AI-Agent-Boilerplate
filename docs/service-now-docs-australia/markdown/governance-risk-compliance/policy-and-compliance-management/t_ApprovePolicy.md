# Approve and publish a policy

When a policy is approved, it is automatically published.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance.user or sn\_compliance.manager

**Note:** For more information:

-   About a policy, see [An overview of policy life cycle in Policy and Compliance Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/pc-policy-life-cycle-ovrvw.md).
-   About GRC application, see [Governance, Risk, and Compliance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/r_WhatIsGRC.md).

## About this task

Prior to Version 11.0.2 of the GRC: Policy and Compliance Management application, a new knowledge base article overwrote the previous version whenever you made changes to a policy. Starting with Version 11.0.2, when you again approve a policy, a new version of the KB article is created and listed in the **Policy Versions** tab, along with a history of previous versions.

This feature requires that you manually install and activate the Knowledge Management Advanced Installer \[com.snc.knowledge\_advanced.installer\] plugin. For more information, see [Activate a plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateAPlugin.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Policies and Procedures** &gt; **Policies**.

2.  Open the policy record.

3.  Review the policy details.

4.  Click the **Request Approval** button.

    Reviewers cannot request approval for a policy. To request approval, the policy owner must have at least the **sn\_compliance.user** role, which is the minimum role required. Users with the **sn\_compliance.manager** role can also request approval.

    After the approval is granted, the policy is published, and a knowledge base \(KB\) article is automatically created with the policy details.

5.  Any time you need to make changes to the policy, you can click **Edit policy** and enter a message in the pop-up, and click **Request Approval**. Add a comment in the pop-up. When approval is granted, a new version of the knowledge base article is created.

    **Note:** As described above, if you activated the Knowledge Management Advanced Installer \[com.snc.knowledge\_advanced.installer\] plugin, a new version of the KB article is created and listed in the **Policy Versions** tab, along with a history of previous versions as shown below.

    So, if you create links to this policy from the Service Portal or elsewhere, the latest version of the KB article is always displayed.
