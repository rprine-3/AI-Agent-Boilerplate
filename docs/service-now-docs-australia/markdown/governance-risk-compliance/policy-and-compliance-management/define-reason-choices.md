# Define policy exception reason choices

You can define reason choices to be available to any user who requests an exception.

## Before you begin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Policy Exceptions** &gt; **Exception Reason Choices**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Label|Enter a unique label for this choice.|
    |Value|Enter a unique value for this choice.|
    |Order|Enter an order for this choice. Reasons are ordered based on this number.|
    |Default|Select this check box to indicate that this reason choice will be available whenever an ad hoc policy exception is requested. If the integration registry does not contain any application-specific choices, all reason choices with **Default** selected will be available.|
    |Active|If this is selected, this choice is displayed in the list of reason choices.|

4.  Click **Submit**.

    The reason choice is added and will be available in the **Reason** field of the policy exception request form for the selected application.
