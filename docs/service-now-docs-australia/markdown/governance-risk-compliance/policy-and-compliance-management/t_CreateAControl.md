**Note:** The **Frequency** field is intended for reporting purposes only and defines how often the control is expected to be tested or executed. It does not influence the attestation schedule. The **Attestation Frequency** field, however, governs how often attestations are triggered for the control.

This separation allows customers to track control testing independently from attestation cycles.
