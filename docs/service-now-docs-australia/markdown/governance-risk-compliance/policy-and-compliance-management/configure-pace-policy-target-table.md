# Configure compliance data source registry

Set up the Compliance Data Source Registry \(CDSR\) that provides the ability to associate policies in other ServiceNow products with control objectives in Policy and Compliance to inform an organization’s overall compliance stand, and to perform policy exceptions when required.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance.admin

## About this task

Based on the association, entities are generated for the associated assessed objects from the target application table and controls are generated automatically. CDSR facilitates easy integrations between GRC and other ServiceNow products such as DevOps, HR, SecOps, and others to meet the customers’ compliance validation and management needs across the enterprise.

Select the application table that is linked to the assessed object table. Establish a relationship between an item in the application table and a control objective in a target table. To do this, the items must first be configured and mapped to the control objective. Secondly, establish a relationship between the target table and the entities in the entity table.

Incidentally, entities are people, processes, departments, applications, or objects that must be measured for compliance against control objectives.
