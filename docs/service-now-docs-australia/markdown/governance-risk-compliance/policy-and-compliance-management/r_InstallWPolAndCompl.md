## Access limitations for GRC business user role

The access control limitations \(ACLs\) or no role conditions with snc\_internal role \(or no role\) is replaced with sn\_grc.business\_user role to control the access level of different users to compliance tables and also to track their usage.

-   **GRC business user \(sn\_grc.business\_user\) role**

    GRC business user role is granted to users who could perform any GRC operations. It is also granted to users with snc\_internal role who have performed all operations like creating policy exception, issues, and responding to attestations, acknowledgements, and other operations. This role comes with installing GRC Profiles plugin.

-   **GRC business user – lite \(sn\_grc.business\_user\_lite\) role**

    Users who could do limited operations with snc\_internal role are considered as lite operators. Such users are given the GRC business user – lite \(sn\_grc.business\_user\_lite\) role so as to track the lite usage of compliance tables using the role. This role is granted through explicit roles plugin, GRC: Business User – Lite, which can be installed by users with maint access or ServiceNow support teams.
