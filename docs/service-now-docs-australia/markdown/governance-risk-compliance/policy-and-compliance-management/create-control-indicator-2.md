# Manage control indicators

Continuous monitoring involves activities related to identifying and creating key risk and controls indicators. The Compliance Overview is available to compliance administrators and compliance managers, providing an executive view into compliance requirements, overall compliance, and compliance breakdowns.

Supporting information can be collected for indicators through automatic data collection or manual tasks. Indicator results are then used to create issues for controls, update risk scores, and provide supporting information for audit activities and control testing.

-   **Indicators**

    Indicators collect data to monitor controls and risks, and collect audit evidence. Indicators monitor a single control or risk.

-   **Indicator templates**

    Indicator templates allow the creation of multiple indicators for similar controls or risks.


**Note:** The Entity Based Access provides a framework for more granular approach to management of data access to objects associated with an entity. Administrators can grant access to an entity's related records by adding users or user groups, or by using entity user fields for entity-based access configuration. For more information, see [Entity Based Access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/entity-based-access.md). When a user is qualified based on these configurations and has the minimum required roles, they will have access to the following tables:

-   Indicator
-   Indicator task
-   Indicator result

## Compliance Overview

|Name|Visual|Description|
|----|------|-----------|
|Compliance Requirements|Donut chart|Select a wedge to focus on a specific compliance area.|
|Overall Compliance|Donut chart|Displays the overall compliance of all the control requirements in the system. Selecting a specific wedge in the previous widget brings that area into focus.|
|Entity|Drop down list|Select one or more entities to view and compare their compliance across multiple items.|
|Control State|Check list|Select or clear check boxes to view filter reports by control state.|
|Compliance by Authority Document|Bar Chart|Compare level of compliance depending on the selected entity and/or authority document.|
|Compliance breakdown|Multi-level Pivot|View a breakdown of control compliance by related authority documents and policies.|
|Non Compliant Entities|Column Chart|Count of non-compliant control requirements grouped by entity.|

## Authority Documents

Authority documents define policies, risks, controls, audits, and other processes to ensure adherence to the authoritative content. Each authority document is defined in a record and the related lists on that record contain the individual conditions of the authority document.

The relationships of these authority document related list items are visible in the GRC Workbench in the Policy and Compliance Management application.

**Note:** You can [add content reference tags to authority documents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/content-references.md). Content reference tags allow you to filter records in order to more easily identify the content packs, integrations, and use case accelerators associated with the authority documents.

## Citations

Citations contain the provisions of the authority document, which can be interrelated. Citations break down an authority document into manageable themes.

You can create citations or import them from UCF authority documents and then create any necessary relationships between the citations.

**Note:** You can [add content reference tags to citations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/content-references.md). Content reference tags allow you to filter records in order to more easily identify the content packs, integrations, and use case accelerators associated with the citations.

</table>4.  Select **Submit**.

    **Note:** As a compliance manager or compliance admin, you can assign the indicator task to a user with Business User Lite role. If you assign a user with a Business User Lite role as an owner in the **Owner** field and **Execute** the indicator, an indicator task is created in the Open Tasks related list. This indicator task is assigned to the owner with the Business User Lite role.

    As a user with the Business User Lite role, you can navigate to **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Indicators** &gt; **My Indicator Tasks** to view the indicator tasks that are assigned to you. You can view the indicator by selecting the information icon next to the Indicator field. You can also update the **Result** field, **State** field, **Value** field, **Additional comments**, and **Work notes** in the Indicator Task form.

-   **Basic**: Basic indicators are automated indicators based on an indicator source. The indicator source specifies a table and a frequency at which the scores from this table are saved.
-   **Script**: Scripted indicators use a custom script to collect the data.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Result if the value meets or exceeds the target value

</td><td>

Result configuration field. The choices are as follows:-   **Passed**
-   **Failed**
 For example, assume you enter `100` in this field. If the indicator result output is more than 100, then the indicator status will pass or fail based on the value configured in this field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target Type

</td><td>

Type of the target value. The choices are as follows:-   **None**: Use this option if you do not want to set up any target or threshold for the indicator.
-   **Percentage**: Use this option to determine the indicator result by a percentage value.
