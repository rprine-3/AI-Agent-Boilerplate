# Create a policy

A policy defines an internal practice that processes must follow. Policies are defined as policies, procedures, standards, plans, checklists, frameworks, and templates.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance.admin or sn\_compliance.manager

Users with Compliance user \(sn\_compliance.user\) role can also create policies.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Policies and Procedures** &gt; **Policies**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

The state is a read-only field. Possible choices are: -   **Draft** In this state, all compliance users can modify the policy and control objectives. All compliance users can click **Request review** button. Enter a message in the Request review pop-up and click **Request**, which sets the state to Review.
-   **Review** In this state, the owner, owning group, and reviewers can modify the policy and control objectives. The owner, owning group, and reviewers move the policy back to Draft, by clicking **Back to draft**, as well.

Reviewers cannot request approval for a policy. However, the owner of the policy with sn\_compliance.user, which is the minimum required role, and users with compliance manager role can request approval for a policy.

-   **Awaiting approval** In this state, the policy and control objectives are read- only for all. Approvers can approve the policy by updating the approval state in the **Approvals** Related List on the policy form, or by viewing **My Approvals**. If the policy is approved, the policy goes to the **Published** state. Otherwise, it goes back to the **Review** state.
-   **Published** In this state, the policy and control objectives are read-only for all. Admins can click **Retire** which sets the state of the policy to **Retired**
-   **Retired** In this state, the policy is read-only for all.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Specifies the date and time when the policy becomes effective.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Valid to

Specifies the date and time until which the policy remains valid.**Note:**

By default, when a policy expires, it doesn't automatically trigger a new approval process. Instead, it remains in the **Published**state until the specified number of days \(configured in the **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties** page\) have passed.

After this period, the policy transitions to either the **Review** state \(if reviewers are assigned\) or the **Draft** state \(if no reviewers are assigned\).

The field specifying the number of days is labeled: **Number of days after reaching a policy 'Valid to' date in which the expired policy will automatically move from its Published state back to a Draft/Review state**.
