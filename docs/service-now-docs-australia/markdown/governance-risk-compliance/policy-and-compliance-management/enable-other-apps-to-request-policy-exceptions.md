# Register other applications to request policy exceptions

Enable other applications to request policy exception from any table such as Problem or Incident and so on. The applications must be added and configured in the Integration Registry.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance.manager

The GRC business user \(sn\_grc.business\_user\) or business user – lite \(sn\_grc.business\_user\_lite\) is the minimum required role to raise a policy exception from an upstream application.

## About this task

Starting with the New York release, users from any ServiceNow application can request for policy exceptions using \(GRC\)’s policy exception management capability. For example, users can request policy exception for a problem related to a group of incidents that cannot be resolved for a specific duration. To be able to request policy exception, you must register the application for policy exception and create a UI action for requesting policy exception, unless one is provided with the ServiceNow application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Policy Exceptions** &gt; **Integration Registry**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
