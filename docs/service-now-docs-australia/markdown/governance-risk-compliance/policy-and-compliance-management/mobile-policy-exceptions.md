# Process pending approvals for Policy exceptions with the GRC Mobile application

Approve or reject pending policy exceptions and policy exception extension requests that are assigned to you.

## Before you begin

Role required: Compliance manager \(sn\_compliance.manager\)

## About this task

With this applet, you can perform the following tasks on a list of policy exception records:

-   Edit
-   Request more information
-   Approve, or reject pending policy exceptions or extension requests
-   View the details of the record or add a work note prior to processing the request

Time to complete this task: 5-10 minutes.

## Procedure

1.  If you are not logged in to your ServiceNow AI Platform instance on your mobile device, for more information see [Log in to the GRC Mobile application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/mobile-login-P-C-app.md).

2.  With the Policy and Compliance landing screen displayed, tap **Policy Exceptions**.

    If you navigate away from the GRC Mobile application after you have logged in, tap the Now Agent app at any time to return to the last screen you had displayed.

3.  If you want to reduce the number of records that are displayed on the screen, see [Filter records with the GRC Mobile application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/mobile-pc-set-filters.md) to search for records that match specific search criteria.

    Filtering records on screens in the mobile app works like filtering with a condition builder on the ServiceNow AI Platform. Setting filters can reduce the number of records that are displayed on screens.

4.  To edit, approve or reject, or request more information about a policy exception directly from the list of records displayed on the screen, swipe left on a record to open the menu.
