# Attest a control

Attestations are surveys that gather evidence to prove that a control is implemented. If the control attestation and respondents fields are selected, when the control moves from the **Draft** state to the **Attest** state, a notification is sent to the attestation respondents.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc.business\_user, sn\_grc.business\_user\_lite

Users can create multiple attestation types and set their control objectives to different attestations. A sample attestation called **GRC Attestation** is also provided as the default attestation.

## About this task

When controls are attested, a new questionnaire is created. As a result, attestations do not appear in the **Self-Service** &gt; **My assessments &amp; surveys** module. Hundreds of GRC assessment records could be generated at once and should be separated from other assessments in a separate list view.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Controls** &gt; **My Attestations**.

2.  Open the attestation and review the details.

<table id="choicetable_ehk_qqs_dw"><tbody><tr><td id="d427065e101">

**If you are unable to answer the questions**

</td><td>

1.  Reassign the attestation to another user in the **Assigned to** field.
2.  Click **Update** and close the record.
 **Note:** Only a user with the sn\_grc.user role can be re-assigned the attestation.

 The list of attestations refreshes when you reassign an attestation to another user.

</td><td>

2.  Answer the questions and attach information, as required.
3.  Click **Submit**.
 The list of attestations refreshes when you close the **Take Assessment** pop-up window.
