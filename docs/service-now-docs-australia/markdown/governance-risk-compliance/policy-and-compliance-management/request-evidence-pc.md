# Request evidence during audits

Request evidence at any stage during an audit. The details about the items for which evidence is requested are also provided to the person responsible for providing the evidence.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_audit.user

## About this task

An evidence can be requested in the following three ways:

-   **My Evidence**

    By creating an evidence record from the **My Evidence** module.

-   **Request Evidence**

    From the Entity, Control, Audit Task, Control Test Issue, and Other Issues related lists in an engagement record. To request evidence from these sources, navigate to **Audit** &gt; **Engagements** &gt; **My Engagements**. Open the engagement record, and select the related list from which you want to request evidence. From the **Action on selected rows** list, select **Request Evidence**. Here, you can either create a new evidence request or add more requests to an existing evidence request. The Evidence request is created but not evidence request tasks. For more information on adding existing evidence, see [Reuse existing evidence from the related items of an engagement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/request-evidence-existing-pc.md).

-   **Entity, Control, Control Objective, Control Test, Engagement, Issue tables**

    From tables such as Entity, Control, Control Objective, Control Test, Engagement, Issue. However, when the users request evidence from these tables, the evidence request is created not the actual evidence request task. The users must navigate to the evidence request record that is generated and then add evidence request tasks.


In this procedure, the method to request evidence from the **My Evidence** module is described.
