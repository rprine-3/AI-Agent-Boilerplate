# View the general details of a business continuity plan

Use the **Details** tab of the plan to view the general information about the template that is used for the plan, its type, and other details.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin, sn\_bcm.program\_manager, or sn\_bcm.planner

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Business Continuity** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  Click the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "ListsIcon.jpg"\] Alt text: Lists icon\).

3.  Click **In Draft** state in the Planning list.

4.  Click the link to the plan record in the **Name** column.

5.  Click the **Details** tab of the business continuity plan \(BCP\).

    This tab gives you a summary of the plan details. You can edit the information if required.

6.  Click **Save** after updating the plan details.

7.  To generate a PDF and download a copy of the BCP to your local hard drive, click **Generate PDF**.

    A message appears with a downloadable link to the BCP PDF.

    **Note:** After the plan is approved, the PDF is generated and attached to the plan.

8.  To move a plan from **Approved** to **Draft** state, select the **Edit** button.

9.  To create a copy of the plan, click the **Copy** button.

    If you have the permission to edit the plan, you can also copy it. A BCM planner and program manager can delete a plan and its related table records when the plan is in Draft, In Review, and Returned states. BCM admin can delete a plan irrespective of its state.

    1.  Enter the name of the new plan in the Copy plan pop-up.

    2.  Click **Confirm**.

        -   The copy action creates an exact replica of the plan with the name that you enter in the Copy plan pop-up. The copied plan is moved to **Draft** state.
        -   The action copies plan assets, documentation sections, recovery teams, loss scenarios, related asset dependencies, recovery strategies, and recovery tasks to the new plan.
        -   The documentation sections of the copied plan are in **Pending** state. Edit each section, if required, and move it to **Complete** state.
        -   Dependencies are populated when the plan is copied.
