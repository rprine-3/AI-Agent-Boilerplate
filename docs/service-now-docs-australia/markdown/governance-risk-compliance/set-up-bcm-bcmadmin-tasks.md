# General administration setup for BCM

If you are the BCM administrator, you can set up the Business Continuity Management application by performing certain administrative tasks.

## General Administration module

The administrative tasks that are associated with the BCM application are listed in the **General Administration** module in the application UI as shown in the example.\[Omitted image "gen-admin-module.png"\] Alt text: General Administration module.

The Business Continuity Management administrator with the sn\_bcm.admin role is responsible for performing the administrative tasks that are associated with the Business Continuity Management application.

Business Continuity Management administrators perform these administrative tasks:

-   Configure the impact categories and documentation sections. For more information, see [Configure impact category for BIA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-impact-category-uib-ws.md) and [Configure documentation section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-doc-section-for-bcp.md).
-   Configure the element definitions, element variables, loss scenarios, and impact ratings. For more information, see [Configure element definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-element-definition-bia-uib-ws.md), [Configure element variables for element definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-element-variable-uib-ws.md), [Configure loss scenarios in the plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-plan-loss-scenario-uib-ws.md), and [Configure impact ratings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-impact-rating-uib-ws.md).
-   Configure the recovery tiers and recovery timeframes. For more information, see [Configure recovery tiers for BIA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-recovery-tier-bia-uib-ws.md) and [Set up recovery timeframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-recovery-timeframe-bia-uib-ws.md).
-   View the My tasks page configurations module, approval configurations, and properties. For more information, see [My tasks page configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/my-tasks-page-config-module.md), [Approval configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/bcm-approval-configuration.md), and [BCM properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/bcm-properties-module.md).
-   For more information on the grid configurations and categories, see [Configure grid for BIA assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-grid-configuration-uib-ws.md) and [Configure grid categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-grid-category.md).

## Custom queue for the Update dependencies process

Previously, Update dependencies events were added to the platform default queue, which is shared across all ServiceNow applications. During periods of high activity, this could result in delays in processing BCM dependency updates. It can happen either because other applications saturated the queue, or because a long-running BCM process affected other items in it.

With the Australia release and later, the Update dependencies process uses a dedicated custom queue \(bcm\_dependencies\) instead of the platform default queue. This is a backend change with no visible indicator in the UI.

The dedicated queue ensures that Update dependencies events have their own processor and do not compete with or block other platform activity.

If you previously configured a custom queue for BCM dependency processing on your instance, remove it — BCM now provides this configuration natively.

For more information about custom queues and the event registry, see [System Events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/events.md) and [Event registry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_EventRegistry.md).

This change applies to the Australia release and later.

## BIA Configuration module

The BCM administrator configures the BIA templates in the BIA Configuration module. Configuring the BIA templates is a pre-requisite for performing the business impact analysis.

The **BIA templates** menu option in the BIA Configuration module is shown in the example.\[Omitted image "bia-config-module.png"\] Alt text: BIA Configuration module.

For more information on configuring a BIA template, see [Configure BIA templates with legacy assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-bia-template-uib-ws.md).

## Plan Templates module

The Business Continuity Management administrator uses the **Plan Templates** module to configure a business continuity plan template. The **Plan Templates** module is shown in the example.\[Omitted image "plan-templates-module.png"\] Alt text: Plan Templates module.

For more information on configuring a business continuity plan template, see [Configuring plan template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/bcp-admin-plan-templates.md).
