Entity filter type: **Build your own conditions**

</td><td>

Type of the entity filter that is used for filtering the data. Use the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) Query Builder to build your own query.

 The Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) is used to search the database for the entities. It provides the following methods for filtering:

 -   **Build your own conditions**
-   **Select from predefined queries**

 Complete the following steps for the **Build your own conditions** entity filter type:

1.  In the **Entity filter type** field, select the entity filter type as **Build your own conditions**.
2.  In the **Table** field, select a table from the populated list.
3.  In the **Filter condition** field, click **Set conditions**, build a filter condition, click **Set**, and view the matching results.

Entity filter type: **Select from predefined queries** option

</td><td>

Predefined query to scope the entity. Complete the following steps for the **Select from predefined queries** option:1.  In the **Query** field, select a predefined query such as **Business Apps using Information Object** that is applicable for the selected entity.

Table associated with the entity when a predefined query is selected. The table is automatically populated.

2.  In the **Information objects** field, select only the applications and processes that have information objects associated with them. To add more information objects, click **Information objects** and type information objects such as `Email`.

 **Note:** To use a predefined CMDB query for entity scoping, GRC administrators must assign the **GRC Scoping** tag to the selected CMDB query.

As a sn\_grc.admin user, navigate to **Policy and Compliance &gt; Administration &gt; GRC Properties** or navigate to **Risk Administration &gt; GRC Properties** in an instance, set the **Enable entity scoping for CMDB query** property as **Yes** and click **Save**.
