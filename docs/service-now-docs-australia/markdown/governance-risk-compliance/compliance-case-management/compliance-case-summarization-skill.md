# GRC case summarization skill for compliance cases

The GRC case summarization skill uses a large language model \(LLM\) to generate a structured AI summary of a compliance case record. The summary is generated on demand from case data and can be saved to the record for future reference.

## Overview of the GRC case summarization skill

Compliance cases can span multiple action tasks, stakeholders, and regulatory requirements. The GRC case summarization skill generates a concise AI summary of key case details, so case analysts and managers can quickly understand the context and take informed action.

The skill collects data from predefined fields and related lists across the case record. This data is assembled into a prompt and sent to the configured LLM service provider, which then returns a structured summary.

To summarize compliance case records, the skill must be activated from the AI Admin Hub console. Once it's activated, case analysts with the appropriate user role can trigger the skill on a compliance case.

## User roles

The user roles required to activate, configure, and use the GRC case summarization skill are:

-   sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin: Grants an admin access to activate or edit a ServiceNow Otto skill.
-   sn\_comp\_case.compliance\_case\_analyst: Grants access to compliance case records.
-   sn\_grc\_sharegenai.grc\_case\_ai\_user: Grants users access to use the GRC case summarization skill.

    **Note:** The sn\_grc\_sharegenai.grc\_case\_ai\_user role must be explicitly assigned and isn’t inherited through the case analyst role.


## LLM service providers

An administrator must set a default LLM provider before the skill can be used. The following providers are supported:

-   Azure OpenAI
-   AWS Claude
-   Google Gemini

To set a default provider for the GRC case summarization skill, see [Manage model providers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/edit-model-providers.md).

## Components of a compliance case summary

The summary reflects case data at the time of generation. As the case progresses, you can regenerate the summary to capture the latest information. Once generated, you can review and edit the summary before saving it to the case record.
