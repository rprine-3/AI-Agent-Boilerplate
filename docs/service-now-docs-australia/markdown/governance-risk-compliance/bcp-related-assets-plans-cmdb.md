# Add related assets and related plans

Identify related assets and their referred plans to recover the assets in your planning stage. Reuse the configuration item relationship data that flow from CMDB to business impact analysis \(BIA\) during dependency assessment to identify the assets in your plan.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin, sn\_bcm.program\_manager, or sn\_bcm.planner

## About this task

This feature enhancement allows configuration item relationship data from CMDB to flow into BIA when you [Add dependencies based on CI relationships in CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/add-dependencies-based-on-cmdb.md). If you have done the BIA, then the related assets data flow to the planning phase. In the planning phase, you can identify these BIA-dependent items as related assets. If you have completed a BIA and your related assets have associated plans, you can add those plans as related plans in planning phase. You can add them as sub-plans in execution phase of event recovery process.

Instead of identifying new assets and creating recovery plans, you can use BIA-dependent items added as configuration items from CMDB based on their CI relationships. You can then reuse these items as related assets in the planning stage.

This feature gives you the ability to:

-   Identify the related assets based on dependencies established in the CMDB and BIA during planning.
-   Create a main plan and set a task that refers to another related plan.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Business Continuity** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  Click the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "ListsIcon.jpg"\] Alt text: Lists icon\).

3.  Click **In Draft** state in the Planning list.

4.  Click the link to the plan record in the **Name** column.

5.  Click the **Related Assets** tab to view the assets that are pulled from the BIA to the plan.

    If you have added a business process or a location as an item in the **Scope** tab, and if the scoped item is related to the BIA, then all the related assets of the BIA are lined into the **Related Assets** tab of the plan. In other words, the CMDB configuration item added as a dependency in BIA is pulled into the plan as related assets. The source of these related assets is displayed as BIA.

    When you create a plan, you also select a primary element that the plan covers. Based on the [scope that you selected in the business continuity plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/add-plan-asset-scope-bcp.md) or the primary element of the plan, the application adds the related assets and related plans during the planning phase. These items could be business processes, critical business applications, data centers, or resources working from a location. Dependencies stored in the BIA are copied to the plan's **Related Assets** tab, along with other dependencies added during BIA creation.

    **Note:** Unless you do the business impact analysis, the related items of the configured item data will not flow to the plan, although you have the option to manually add the related assets and related plans in the planning phase.

6.  To add an asset manually, click the **Add** button.

    1.  Select a type of the impacted item in the Add Items pop-up.

    2.  Click **Next** and select the items that belong to the impacted item type.

    3.  Click **Add**.

        **Note:** If the item did not come from the BIA but added during the planning phase, then the source of the impacted item that you added is **Manual**.

7.  To remove a related asset, select the related asset and click **Remove**.

8.  Click the **Related Plans** tab to view the plans that are related to the items in the **Related Assets** tab.

    After the assets are copied over to the plan, if there are plans attached to any of the related assets, then these plans are automatically pulled and listed in the **Related Plans** tab. Assets in the plan are those that are to be recovered by the plan during the event.

    When the related plans are pulled into the planning phase, you can also create the recovery tasks. As a planner you can set a sequence to the execution of the recovery tasks of the main plan and its dependent sub-plans.

    If you have not done the BIA or scoped the plan to a BIA, you can manually add plans at this stage.

9.  To add a plan manually, click the **Add** button.

    1.  Select a plan in the Add pop-up.

    2.  Click **Add**.

        **Note:** The source of the related plan that you added is **Manual**, as the plan did not come from the BIA but added during the planning phase.

10. To remove a related plan, select the related plan and click **Remove**.


## What to do next

You can [refer one of the related plans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/bcp-recovery-tasks-grid.md) in a recovery task of the main plan and sequence the order of execution in the event.
