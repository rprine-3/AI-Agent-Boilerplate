# Create, update, and group recovery tasks

Create tasks in a plan to recover your business from various disaster situations. Prioritize the tasks by determining the critical assets that have to be recovered and estimate the time by which the task must be completed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin, sn\_bcm.program\_manager, or sn\_bcm.planner

## About this task

Assign the task to a group, identifying an owner, to execute the processes and procedures of a recovery. The task has details of the item to be recovered and the time by which it should be accomplished.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Business Continuity** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  Click the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "ListsIcon.jpg"\] Alt text: Lists icon\).

</table>        **Note:** You can create a recovery task at the recovery strategy level and also at the plan level.

    2.  Click **Create**.

    -   **Recovery task grid**

        All recovery tasks that you have created for the plan appear in a grid. You can group the recovery tasks based on the fields in the recovery task table. Grouping helps you to group the recovery tasks the way you want, focus, and manage the task groups.

        **Note:** To group by a field, you must set up the group criteria value as a BCM admin by selecting the **Group recovery tasks** option and a value in the **Group by** field of the plan template before creating the plan.

    -   **Dependencies**

        The dependencies column displays recovery tasks that match the asset scope level and the plan level. However, If it is at scope level, then it displays recovery tasks that match the scope level and also tasks that do not have a scope.

        If it is at the Plan level, then the recovery tasks that match only at the plan level are displayed. Considering that the plan level recovery task does not have any scope.

        If there is a cyclic dependency between tasks, then those recovery tasks are not displayed in the **Dependencies** column.

    -   **Task group**

        Groups the tasks based on the **Group by** field in the plan template.

7.  To edit the data in a cell, double-click and click again in the cell.

8.  To apply grouping and filter, click the vertical ellipsis icon.

    -   **Sort**

        You can sort the data at each column level. The first click in the column header sorts the data of the column in ascending order \(\[Omitted image "AscendingIcon.png"\] Alt text: Ascending icon\). The next click makes the sort descending \(\[Omitted image "DescendingIcon.png"\] Alt text: Descending icon\). Another click removes the sort.

    -   **Filter**

        Apply column filter to filter data that have simple text. For example, you can filter tasks with short descriptions that talk about safety. Use the simple number filter to filter time critical data. For example, you can apply the filter to the **Completion deadline** column to filter the tasks that have to be completed within an hour of a business disruption.

10. To delete one or more recovery tasks, select the record or records and click the **Remove** button.
