# Schedule assessment and validation tasks

Schedule assessment and validation tasks for model risks in the Monitor stage to ensure regulatory compliance and effective risk management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_model\_risk\_mgmt.model\_governance or sn\_model\_risk\_mgmt.risk\_coordinator

## About this task

You can schedule assessment and validation tasks for a model risk in the Monitor stage. You can also configure the conditions and frequency for these tasks in the model workflow settings. Based on the configuration, the assessment and validation tasks are created automatically. For more information, refer to [Configure Model Workflow Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-model-workflow-settings.md).

This task guides you on how to schedule assessment and validation tasks manually from the model risk record.
