# Add an asset to the scope

Use the **Scope** tab to add an asset to the scope of the plan. If the business impact analysis \(BIA\) application is installed, you can view primary elements defined in the plan template, its RTO and RPO details, and the BIA.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin, sn\_bcm.program\_manager, or sn\_bcm.planner

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Business Continuity** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  Click the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "ListsIcon.jpg"\] Alt text: Lists icon\).

3.  Click **In Draft** state in the Planning list.

4.  Click the link to the plan record in the **Name** column.

5.  Click the **Scope** tab.

    If the plan is created from a plan template, you can view the primary elements defined in the plan template.

6.  To add new scope to the plan, click **Add**.

7.  On the Add Items modal, select the plan asset.

8.  Click **Add**.

    Assets that are displayed in the Add Items modal belong to the element definition type identified in the **Primary element recovered** field of the plan template.

    If an asset has an approved BIA attached to it while adding the plan asset, then the approved BIA is automatically added in the **BIA** column of the asset.

    If the BIA is attached to the plan scope, then you cannot edit the RTO and RPO as they are values populated from the BIA.

    **Note:**

    -   If the BIA application is installed, then **RTO** and **RPO** fields are visible and non-editable. **BIA** field is visible and editable. You can attach a BIA by clicking the link BIA icon \(\[Omitted image "LinkBIAicon.png"\] Alt text: Link BIA icon\).
    -   If BIA is not installed, then **RTO** and **RPO** fields are visible and editable.
    -   If an approved BIA is attached to the plan, then **RTO**, **RPO**, and **BIA** fields are populated with values and they are read only and non-editable.
9.  To update a plan asset or to link a BIA to it, click the asset in the **Name** column.

    1.  Select the link BIA icon \(\[Omitted image "LinkBIAicon.png"\] Alt text: Link BIA icon\).

        If there is an approved BIA for the asset, then the BIA is automatically attached to the asset when you select the link. If you have adjusted the RTO and RPO values based on asset criticality, the Adjusted RTO and Adjusted RPO values take precedence over the system-calculated values. The adjusted RTO and RPO values are displayed in the **Recovery Time Objective** and **Recovery Point Objective** fields when you select \[Omitted image "LinkBIAicon.png"\] Alt text: Link BIA icon.

    2.  Click **Save**.

10. To remove an asset from the plan list, select the item and click **Remove**.
