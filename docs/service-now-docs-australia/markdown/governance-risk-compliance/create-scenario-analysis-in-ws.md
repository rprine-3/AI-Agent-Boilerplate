# Create a legacy scenario analysis

Create a scenario analysis for the business service in Operational Resilience Workspace. You can analyze the impact of the scenarios and associated events. You can then calculate the disruptions and determine if any of your services are breached.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## About this task

If you have the sn\_oper\_res.manager role, you can create a scenario analysis. Only the owner of the scenario analysis and the user with the sn\_oper\_res.admin role can edit the analysis. After you review the analysis, you can request an approval. When the analysis is in the **Approved** state​, you can close it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\) and then navigate to **All scenario analysis**.

2.  To create a scenario analysis, select **New**.

    The Create New Scenario analysis form is displayed.

3.  In the Scenario analysis panel, enter the name, description, and goal for the scenario analysis.

    The number for the scenario analysis is auto-filled by the system.

4.  In the **Analysis start date** field in the Milestones panel, enter the start date for the analysis in the **YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss** format.

    A notification is sent to the participants to start their analysis on the Analysis start date.

5.  In the **Plan approver** field in the Assignees panel, select the plan approver for the analysis.

6.  In the **Analysis approver** field, select the owner, plan approver, and analysis approver for the analysis.

    The logged-in user is automatically assigned as the owner of the analysis.

    For the descriptions of the field values on the User New record form, see [Create Scenario analysis form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/scenario-analyses-reference-in-ws.md).

    A sample scenario analysis form is shown in the following example.

    2.  Include a brief message for the participants.

    3.  Select **Start discussion**.

8.  To delete the scenario analysis, select **Delete**, confirm the deletion, and select **OK**.
