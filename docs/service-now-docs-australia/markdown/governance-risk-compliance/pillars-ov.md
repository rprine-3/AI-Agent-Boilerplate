# Pillars overview tab

A pillar is a foundational element that supports your organization's operational resilience. You can map business services and processes to these pillars in the Operational Resilience application to establish relationships and monitor their status on the dashboard in the Operational Resilience Workspace.

## Pillars overview tab on the landing page

The **Pillars overview** tab on the landing page of the Operational Resilience Workspace provides information on the pillars, which are part of the base system in Operational Resilience. From the dashboard, you can monitor the status of the services for each pillar. The Pillars overview section displays data filtered for the selected pillar as shown in the example.

## Report on the red flags

The Red flags report on the **Pillars overview** tab shows the total number of red flags that require immediate attention. These red flags are associated with assets, controls, issues, and risks related to the selected pillar. The report breaks down details based on integrations with the Operational Resilience application. For example, if you have installed the Risk Management application, data for the risk ratings is pulled from that application and displayed in this report.

If you install optional applications from the GRC product suite, such as Business Continuity Management and Vulnerability Response, additional reports appear on the dashboard. You can view the Business Continuity plan and Vulnerability Response reports.

A sample Red flags report for the pillars is shown in the example.

\[Omitted image "p-red-flags.png"\] Alt text: Red flags.

The following data is displayed for the pillars in the Red flags report:

-   Assets without business continuity plans and Assets not recovered in recent DR exercise: These red flags are shown for the selected pillar in the example as the Operational Resilience application is integrated with the BCM application.
-   Major open incidents
-   Scores for Risk rating, Control effectiveness, and Issues

## Suggestions for mitigating the issues

The Suggestions report on the **Pillars overview** tab offers recommendations and workarounds to mitigate issues and risks for various resilience metrics associated with the pillar.

\[Omitted image "p-suggestions.png"\] Alt text: Suggestions.

Depending on the applications integrated with Operational Resilience, suggestions are displayed in the report. For example, if you have installed the Policy and Compliance Management, Risk Management, and Vulnerability Response applications, the following suggestions are displayed in the report.

-   Top controls to be strengthened
-   Top risks to be mitigated
-   Top vulnerabilities to be fixed
