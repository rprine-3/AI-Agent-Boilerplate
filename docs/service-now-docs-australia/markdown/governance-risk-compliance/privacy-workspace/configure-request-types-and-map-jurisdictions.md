# Configure request types and map jurisdictions

Configure new privacy request types by adding a request type with relevant details, and then map it to a specific jurisdiction.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_pdr.pdr\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Personal Data Rights** &gt; **Request Configuration** &gt; **Request Types**.

2.  Select **New** to create a new request type, and fill in the following fields:

    -   Label: Enter the display name for the request type \(for example, Right to data portability\).
    -   Name: Specify a unique system identifier for the request type. It should contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores.
    -   Parent: Select an existing parent category or request type if you want to create a subtype or group related rights.
    -   Active: Set to “Active” to make the request type available on forms.
    -   Category: Assign the request type to a category for organizational or reporting purposes \(for example, “Access Rights,” “Correction Rights”\).
    -   Description: Provide a brief summary of the request type’s purpose and scope.
3.  Select **Submit**.

4.  Select the newly added request type from the list.

5.  In the Jurisdictions section, select **New**, and fill in only the following fields:

    -   Name: Enter a descriptive name for the mapping.
    -   Country: Select the country where this request type should be available.
    -   State: For the United States and Canada, select both the country and the specific state or province to enable region-specific rights.
    **Note:**

    -   For most countries, mapping by country is sufficient.
    -   For the United States and Canada, privacy rights might vary by state, so always specify both country and state when applicable.
    -   Regularly review and update jurisdiction mappings to stay compliant with changing regulations.
6.  Select **Submit**.
