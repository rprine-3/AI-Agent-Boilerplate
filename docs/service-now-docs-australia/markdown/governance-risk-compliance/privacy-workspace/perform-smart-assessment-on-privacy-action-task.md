# Perform smart assessment on privacy action task

Use the **Tasks** page on the Employee Center for a consolidated view of all your privacy tasks, including all assessments, enabling you to access and complete them efficiently.

## Before you begin

Ensure that following:

-   the **sn\_grc\_case\_mgmt.enable\_smart\_assessments** system property is enabled.
-   the assessment templates are configured and published.

Role required: sn\_comp\_case.privacy\_case\_business\_user

## About this task

## About this task

When a privacy case action task moves from **Draft** to **Assigned** state, an assessment is initiated. When you perform smart assessment on an action task that is of type **Assessment**, and the smart assessment property is enabled, the smart assessment appears on the unified tasks page which is present on the Privacy Case Management. The tasks that appear in the Compliance Workspace are unique to the logged in user and therefore can complete all assigned tasks. If you're not the rightful responder of the assessment, you can reassign the assessment to the correct responder.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Center** &gt; **GRC Tasks** &gt; **My to-dos** &gt; **Open** &gt; **My pending tasks** &gt; **Action tasks**.

2.  Select the action task you want to assess.

3.  Select **Start**.

4.  Respond to the questionnaire.

    You can view detailed guidance for each question on the right hand side of the screen. The guidance helps you in responding to the questions.

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  On the success dialog box, select **OK**.

7.  After you submit the assessment, to view the assessment, select **View**.


## Result

After the assessment is submitted, the state of the assessment gets updated to **Review** and the status of the assessment is set to **Completed**. A compliance case analyst reviews the assessment and updates the state of the assessment to **Close Complete**.
