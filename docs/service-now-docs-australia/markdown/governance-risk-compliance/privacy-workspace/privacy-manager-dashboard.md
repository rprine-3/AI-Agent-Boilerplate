# Privacy Management home page

The Privacy Management home page provides an overview of the complete privacy risk and compliance posture with details, such as the processing activity criticality score, privacy risk assessment status, privacy impact assessment status, control attestations, issues-specific status, and privacy cases.

The home page is organized into four tabs: **Processing activity**, **Risk and compliance**, **Operations**, and **Privacy cases**.

Use the **Explore** button to analyze privacy data in the workspace using natural language queries with AI Data Explorer. For information on installing, configuring, and using AI Data Explorer, see [Use AI to explore data with AI Data Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/ai-data-explorer.md).
