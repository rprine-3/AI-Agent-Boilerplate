# Processing activity overview page

The processing activity overview page provides the privacy risk and compliance posture for a processing activity. This page contains details, such as compliance score, criticality score, risk posture and heatmap, privacy and risk assessment status, issues and policy exceptions, and control assurance status.

The vertical layout of a processing activity provides a structured, top-down view that presents information in a clear and sequential manner. This design facilitates an intuitive understanding of the data processing lifecycle by visually representing each step of the workflow in a linear progression. You can easily trace the flow of information from initiation through to completion, enabling better insight into how personal data is collected, used, shared, and retained. This layout supports streamlined navigation and improves the ability to identify key elements and dependencies within the processing activity, enhancing both usability and compliance oversight.
