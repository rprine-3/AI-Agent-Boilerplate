# Use Risk assessment summarization skill to generate summary

Use Risk assessment summarization skill to generate a risk assessment summary that is based on inherent risks, residual risks, target risks, and control effectiveness data. Your approvers get the key insights to understand the context quickly, and you can reduce the time involved in creating summaries manually.

## Before you begin

Install the ServiceNow Otto for Privacy Management application to generate a risk assessment summary. For more information, see [Install ServiceNow Otto for Privacy Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/privacy-install-now-assist.md).

Role required: The sn\_prm\_gen\_ai.user role must be assigned manually to your role to generate the risk assessment summary.

## About this task

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

Privacy managers can generate the risk assessment summary and save the summary in the **Risk assessment summary field** only when they are submitting the assessment. After submission, both assessors and approvers can generate the summary and share it in the work notes. You can also summarize the assessment for object based assessments.

**Note:** This feature is available only on the Privacy Workspace.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Privacy Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon.

3.  Under Risk center, select **All risk assessments**.

4.  Select the risk assessment for which you want to generate a summary.

    **Note:**

    Check whether your role has the sn\_prm\_gen\_ai.user role to generate risk assessment summary.

5.  Generate a risk assessment summary from the risk assessment landing page by selecting **Summarize**.

    A summary is generated. Read the summary to quickly understand the overall privacy risk posture of a process and take informed actions without reviewing every detail of the assessment.

    You also have the options to generate the summary again, expand, collapse or close the panel, provide feedback, or copy the information.
