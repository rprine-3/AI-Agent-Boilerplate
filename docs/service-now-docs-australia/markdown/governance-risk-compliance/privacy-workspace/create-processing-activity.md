# Create or update a processing activity

Manually create a processing activity or update a processing activity that is automatically created out of a privacy screening assessment. You can also update a processing activity that is created from an entity record. When you update a processing activity, you can fill in the relevant details about the personal data that is being processed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy.analyst \(who owns the processing activity\) or sn\_privacy.manager

## About this task

You can create a processing activity in two ways:

-   Manually create a processing activity for a business application or process that handles personal data.
-   Update a processing activity that was automatically created when a privacy screening assessment determined that personal data is being processed. Screening assessments include automation rules that create processing activities based on specific responses. To configure automation in your assessment template, refer to [Post-assessment automations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/impact-automation.md).
