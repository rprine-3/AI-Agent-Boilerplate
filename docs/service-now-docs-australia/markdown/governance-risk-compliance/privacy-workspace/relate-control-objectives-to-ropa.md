# Map a control objective to a question response

Map the control objectives to the responses of the assessment questions to automatically create and apply the respective controls on the processing activity.

## Before you begin

You can apply active and inactive controls to an assessment response. However, when an assessment is submitted by the business user, only the mapped control objectives that are in the **Active** state are considered to create and apply the controls on the processing activity.

Role required: sn\_privacy.admin and sn\_privacy.manager

## About this task

-   Choice
-   Image scale
-   Numeric scale
-   Ranking
-   Boolean
-   Template
