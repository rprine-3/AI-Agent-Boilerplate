# Generate action tasks for a personal data rights request

Automatically create action tasks for a personal data rights request. These action tasks are generated based on the data registry that is created by the personal data rights admin and are assigned to the right data owners.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_pdr.pdr\_agent

## About this task

Creating a data registry helps identify which user should be assigned personal data rights \(PDR\) request tasks. When you generate action tasks based on the data registry details, they are created and assigned to the appropriate data owners. Once these tasks are created, they must be moved to the assigned state for the data owners to begin working on them. The action tasks use provided task templates, which are applied to the auto-generated tasks, to ensure they meet the specific requirements of the request type.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Personal Data Rights Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Personal data rights** &gt; **All requests**.

2.  Open the request for which you want to generate tasks.

3.  Select the **Details** tab.

4.  Select **Generate tasks**.

5.  Select the generated tasks and select **Move to the Assign state**.

6.  Select the More actions icon on the top-right and select **Compose Email** to inform the right users that the request is being worked upon.
