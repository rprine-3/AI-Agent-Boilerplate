# Add hierarchical relationships between entities

Define hierarchical relationships between entities \(Global → Regional → Country-level\) using Upstream and Downstream options. Adding an hierarchy creates a clear organizational structure.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Privacy Workspace** &gt; **List**.

2.  Under Scoping, select **Entities**.

3.  Select the entity you want to configure.

4.  In the entity record, navigate to the **Hierarchy** tab.

5.  To add a parent entity, select **Add** under Upstream entities.

    An upstream entity represents higher-level entity in the hierarchy. For example, for a Regional entity, the upstream entity is the Global entity.

6.  To add a child entity, select **Add** under Downstream entities.

    A downstream entity represents a lower-level entity contained within the current entity.

7.  Select **Save**.
