# Configure smart assessment templates for impact assessments

Create privacy assessment templates using the Smart Assessment Engine as a base for sending privacy impact assessments and using them to detect the privacy risks and mitigate those risks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Privacy Management** &gt; **Privacy Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Configure privacy management** &gt; **Assessment template configuration**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_a3j_zhx_ydc"><thead><tr><th>

</table>4.  Select **Save**.

    A new tab titled **Sections** appears that contains the questionnaire that is fetched from the Smart Assessment Engine.

5.  Select **Add**.

    1.  Select **Personal data**.

    2.  Select **Add**.

    The Sections tab now displays two sections: Personal data and Questionnaire. You can modify the label and the description of the personal data section and these will be visible to the responder on the assessment page.

6.  Select **Save**.

7.  To add subsections to a section, open the section for which you want to add subsections.

    1.  Select **Subsections**.

    2.  Select **Add**.

    3.  Select the subsections to add.

    4.  Select **Add**.

    For example, for the Personal data section, you can add Data elements, Data subject types, Hierarchy, and Legal basis. The details in the **Guidance** field of the subsections appear during the assessment to help the responder understand the questions in the assessment.


## What to do next

Publish a new version of the template to revise a published template without disrupting in-progress assessments.

The Smart Assessment Engine uses one published version of a template at a time. When you publish a new version, the prior version is retired and no new assessments can be sent against it.

**Note:** Assessments already in Draft, Assigned, or Work in progress state continue against the version they were created with.

To create a version of an existing template, see [Update a privacy assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/create-new-smart-asmt-version.md).
