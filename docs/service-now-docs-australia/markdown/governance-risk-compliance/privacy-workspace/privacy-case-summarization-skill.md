# GRC case summarization skill for privacy cases

The GRC case summarization skill uses a large language model \(LLM\) to generate a structured AI summary of a privacy case record. The summary is generated on demand from case data and can be saved to the record for future reference.

## Overview of the GRC case summarization skill

Privacy cases can involve multiple coordinators, complex activity logs, and breach assessments. The GRC case summarization skill generates a concise AI summary of key case details, so assignees and approvers can quickly understand the context and support efficient decision-making.

The GRC case summarization skill collects data from predefined fields and related lists across the case record. This data is assembled into a prompt and sent to the configured LLM service provider, which then returns a structured summary.

To summarize privacy case records, the skill must be activated from the AI Admin Hub. Once it's activated, case analysts with the appropriate user role can trigger the skill on a privacy case.

## User roles

Important user roles to activate and use this skill are:

-   sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin: Grants an admin access to activate or edit a ServiceNow Otto skill.
-   sn\_privacy\_case.privacy\_case\_analyst: Grants access to privacy case records.
-   sn\_prm\_gen\_ai.user: Grants access to the ServiceNow Otto for Privacy Management skills.

    **Note:** Users with the sn\_prm\_gen\_ai.user role automatically have the sn\_grc\_sharegenai.grc\_case\_ai\_user role, which is the minimum role required to use the GRC case summarization skill.


All members of the **Assignment group** on a case record can view the summary that has been saved to the record.

## LLM service providers

An administrator must set a default LLM provider before the skill can be used. The following providers are supported:

-   Azure OpenAI
-   AWS Claude
-   Google Gemini

To set a default provider for the GRC case summarization skill, see [Manage model providers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/edit-model-providers.md).

## Components of a privacy case summary

The summary reflects case data at the time of generation. As the case progresses, you can regenerate the summary to capture the latest information. Once generated, you can review and edit the summary before saving it to the privacy case record. The saved summary appears in the **Overview** tab and in the **Activity** stream of the **Details** tab.
