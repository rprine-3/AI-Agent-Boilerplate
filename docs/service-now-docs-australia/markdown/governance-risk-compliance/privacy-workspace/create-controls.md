# Create or manage a control on a processing activity

Add new controls or manage the controls that are automatically added to the processing activity from the assessment responses. Adding controls ensures that the appropriate regulations are applied to the processing activity.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy.analyst who owns the processing activity or sn\_privacy.manager

## About this task

You can add or manage controls to a processing activity in the following ways:

-   Selecting control objectives: You can add existing control objectives to a processing activity. When you add a control objective to a processing activity, the controls associated with that particular control objective are added to the processing activity.
-   Creating controls: You can create controls and add them to the processing activity.
-   Selecting from the recommended controls: This option enables you to choose from a list of recommended controls based on the information object that is mapped to a processing activity. If an information object is mapped to one or more control objectives, and the same information object is mapped to a processing activity, the system recommends the corresponding control objectives.
-   Managing the automatically added controls: You can manage the controls that are automatically created based on the assessment responses.
-   Applying controls from entities: You can apply privacy-related controls on the processing activity from the related entity.
-   Adding common controls: You can add common controls to a processing activity so that the privacy teams can be notified of control failures and avoid duplicate common control attestation process. For more information on common controls, refer to [Testing common control and implementing results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/common-controls-multiple-rel-entities.md).
