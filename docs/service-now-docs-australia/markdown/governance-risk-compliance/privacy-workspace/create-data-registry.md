# Create a data registry

Create a repository of the users and specify the owners of various applications. This repository helps to identify which user must be assigned the personal data rights \(PDR\) request tasks.

## About this task

A data registry provides information about the business application or business process, its owner, and the type of data it stores, such as customer data, employee data, prospect data, or ex-employee data. When a privacy data rights request is created, based on this registry or repository, the action tasks are created for the right owners.
