# Define the workflow states for a privacy case

Define the workflow states for a privacy case that govern the lifecycle of the case.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy\_case.privacy\_case\_admin

## About this task

A privacy case typically goes through the following workflow states that can be configured in the Privacy Case Management application:

-   New: The case has been opened and is in the initial stage of review.
-   Triage: The case is being evaluated to determine the appropriate course of action.
-   Investigate: The case is being actively investigated to gather information and evidence.
-   Resolve: The case is being worked on to find a resolution.
-   Post case review: A review of the case is being done after it is resolved.
-   Close: The case is closed and is no longer active.
-   Cancel:The case is cancelled and it is no longer being pursued.

These states can vary depending on the organization's privacy case management process.
