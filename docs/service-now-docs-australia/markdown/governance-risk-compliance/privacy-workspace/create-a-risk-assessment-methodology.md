# Create a Risk Assessment Methodology

Configure a risk assessment methodology \(RAM\) in the Privacy Management application so that you can assess the risks in your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy.manager or sn\_privacy.admin

## About this task

Create a standardized method to support risk-based decision-making across departments, projects, and systems. By using a RAM, your organization can have different methodologies for assessing risks.

After you move a RAM to the **Retired** state, you can also move it back to the **Draft** state if you want to make some changes later. You can only move a RAM to the **Draft** state if it doesn’t have any assessments in the **Monitor** state or the **Closed** state. When you move a RAM back to the **Draft**, the on-going assessments and the associated scopes are deleted.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Privacy Management** &gt; **Risk Assessments** &gt; **Risk assessment methodologies**.

2.  On the Risk Assessment Methodology page, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill the details.

    For a description of the field values on the risk assessment methodology form, see [Risk Assessment Methodology form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-risk-management-workspace/risk-assessment-methodology-form.md).

4.  Right-click and save the form.

5.  To configure the various assessments, select one of the following options.

6.  Select **Publish**.

    **Note:** After a new assessment is created on the same risk and the assessment is in the **Monitor** state, the other assessments automatically move to the **Completed** state. When an assessment instance is in the **Monitor** state, you can’t move the RAM back to the **Draft** state. A RAM can only be moved back to the **Draft** state if there are no assessment instances.


## Result

A new Risk Assessment Methodology is created and is available for use.
