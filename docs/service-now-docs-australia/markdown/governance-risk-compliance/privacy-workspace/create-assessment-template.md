# Create a privacy assessment

Create various types of assessments and send those assessments to the business process or business application owners to collect their responses. The responses help you to understand how personal information \(PI\) is being used or stored in a processing activity.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_privacy.admin and sn\_privacy.manager

## About this task

Using the privacy assessment capability, you can create various types of assessments such as privacy screening initial assessments, privacy impact assessments \(PIA\), and privacy readiness assessments.

The following capabilities are provided to configure the assessments:

-   Mapping control objectives to the responses of the question.
-   Mapping information objects to the responses of the question.
-   Mapping the processing activity fields to the responses of the questions.

While configuring the assessments, consider the following terminology:

-   Metric type refers to the assessment template.
-   Metric category refers to the section label in the assessment.
-   Metric refers to a question.

## Result

The assessment template with the questions is ready to be sent to the entity owner.

## What to do next

After the template is published, send it to the entity or processing activity owners to collect responses. For more information, see [Send a privacy assessment to an entity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/send-privacy-assessmt-entity.md) and [Respond to a privacy screening assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/respond-to-privacy-assmnt.md).

After responses are submitted, review and approve the assessment. For more information, see [Review a privacy assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/review-a-privacy-assessment.md).

To map assessment responses to a processing activity, see [Map the processing activity fields to a question response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/copy-responses-to-ropa.md).

To publish a new version of an existing privacy assessment template, see [Update a privacy assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/create-new-smart-asmt-version.md).

-   **[Write a processing activity script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/configure-a-processing-activity-script.md)**  
Write custom scripts on the assessment templates to update the processing activity fields using a script. The script runs when the assessment response is completed. You can write multiple scripts for both screening assessments and impact assessments.
-   **[Map a control objective to a question response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/relate-control-objectives-to-ropa.md)**  
Map the control objectives to the responses of the assessment questions to automatically create and apply the respective controls on the processing activity.
-   **[Map an information object to a question response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/relate-io-to-ropa.md)**  
Map the \[PI\] Information objects to the responses of the assessment questions that must be associated to the processing activity. This association helps the privacy teams to understand what personal information is being processed by the processing activity.
-   **[Map a risk statement to a question response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/map-risk-statements-to-pa.md)**  
Map the risk statements to the responses of the assessment questions to automatically create and apply the respective risks on the processing activity.
-   **[Map the processing activity fields to a question response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/privacy-workspace/copy-responses-to-ropa.md)**  
Map some of the processing activity fields with the responses of the assessment questions to update the processing activity details based on the assessment response.
