# 360° Relationship Visualization

The 360° Relationship Visualization application allows you to visually explore the relationships between the different types of critical data that affect your business, such as controls, risks, and issues. The visualization also facilitates quick actions upon the information, such as adding a relationship, closing an issue, or approving a policy exception.

Before you can use the 360° Relationship Visualization application, you must set up the data registry to define the kinds of relationships to be viewed and to configure the views of the data to be shown in the 360º View.

## Who uses the 360° Relationship Visualization

360° Relationship Visualization is used by GRC practitioners, such as compliance managers and analysts, risk managers and analysts, and auditors. 360° Relationship Visualization helps GRC practitioners to understand the critical data that affects their business. It also aids in effectively communicating the relationships and their impacts to C-suite executives or business users such as application or business service owners.

This table contains the responsibilities of all stakeholders involved with the 360º Relationship Visualization application and the Data Registry.
