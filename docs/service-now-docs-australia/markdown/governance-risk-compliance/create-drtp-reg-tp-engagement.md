# Create a third-party engagement and enhance data

Create a third-party engagement record in Digital resilience third-party registers. Add details of the third-party engagement such as name of the third party, its type, annual spend, engagement tier, and so on. You can then enhance its digital resilience information for compliance with DORA regulation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## About this task

By selecting the Third-party engagements menu item within the Digital resilience third-party registers from the Operational Resilience Workspace, you can access and view the existing third-party engagements in the system.

The **Digital resilience information** tab is also available for the Third-party engagement module, allowing you to report on third-party engagements at a more detailed, granular level. This module is visible only when the Third-party Risk Management application is installed. If you don't have this application, you can still use the Third-Party tables and digital resilience information for your third parties.

Upon installing the Digital resilience third-party registers, the **Digital resilience information** tab is added for third-party engagements. You can open this tab and set up the digital resilience information details.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **Digital resilience third-party registers** &gt; **Third-party engagements**.

    For more information, see [Create a third party engagement form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-new-tp-engmt-form.md).

    When the Identification code type field is set to LEI and a valid LEI is entered, the system validates the code in real time against the GLEIF database. It auto-populates the associated name and country fields. If you edit auto-populated field so that the value no longer matches GLEIF data, a warning message is displayed on edited field. You can still save the record \(warn-and-save\).

4.  Select **Save**

5.  Add digital resilience information.

    For more information, see [Add Digital resilience info to third-party engagements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/tp-eng-add-digi-resi-info.md).
