## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

    **Note:**

    Starting with Orlando, dependency plugins are automatically activated when you activate a core application. For example, when you activate the Audit Management application, the Audit Management Dependencies plugin is also activated.

    **Important**The information in the previous Note does not apply to the Vendor Risk Management application. If you are activating Vendor Risk Management, proceed with the next step. If you are activating any of the other GRC applications, steps 2 through 5 are optional.

2.  Search for the dependencies plugin for the application you want to activate.

    For example, if you are activating Security Incident Response, locate the Security Incident Response Dependencies plugin.
