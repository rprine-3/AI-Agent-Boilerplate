# Configure a business impact analysis template

Define the business impact analysis \(BIA\) template to create and assign BIAs with standard object types. The object types can be business processes, applications, facilities, and others, the impact of which are assessed in a BIA.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin

## About this task

By configuring a BIA template, you can:

-   Define the primary object type that the template is to be used for.
-   Choose the specific impact categories to be assessed during the BIA.
-   Define the types of dependencies that should be identified during the BIA.

When conducting a business impact analysis of a primary element, you can assess its recovery time based on data backup requirement. If your primary element is a technology asset related to a server or database, it requires data backup for critical information. You can filter the impact categories that contribute either to Recovery Time Objective or Recovery Point Objective. This helps you to identify the recovery objective of critical primary elements when you do an impact analysis.

If the primary element requires data backup \(**Requires data backup** field is **Yes** in [Element Definition form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-element-definitions.md)\), all impact categories appear in the &lt;uicontrol&gt;Impact Categories&lt;/uicontrol&gt; field. This includes categories that contribute to Recovery Point Objective or Recovery Time Objective. If the primary element does not require data backup, then the impact categories that contribute to RTO alone are displayed.
