# Certifying services using self-attestation

Certify the operational resilience status of your business services by completing the self-attestation process in the Operational Resilience Workspace. Complete the self-assessment questionnaire about the services, generate a self-attestation report, and upload the PDF so that you can have a copy of the report for your records. You can perform self-attestation on the selected business service and its child records.

## Creating a self-attestation

To create a self-attestation in the Operational Resilience application, navigate to **All** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **All self attestations** in an instance.

Use the self-attestation template supported by the Smart Assessment Engine to submit an assessment on the services. The following example shows the self-attestation template in the Operational Resilience Workspace.

## Self-attestation tasks and the states related to each task

With the sn\_oper\_res.manager role, you can complete the following self-attestation tasks in Operational Resilience Workspace:

1.  Initiate a self-attestation to attest one or more business services.​
2.  Select the assessment type as Smart Assessment.
3.  Select the Operational Resilience Attestation Template as the attestation template.
4.  Use the Default Self Attestation HTML Template as the PDF template for the self-attestation in the self-attestation form. This template provides the format for the PDF and an option to include your e-signature in the report. For instructions on configuring the attestation template, see [Create and edit the attestation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-new-attestation-template.md).
5.  Add the services that you want to certify the status for in the self-attestation form. Respond to the pre-defined set of questions in the assessment. These questions include the names and description of the services, details on the scenario analysis of the important services, and your approach for the scenario analysis.
6.  Submit the assessment and attest for the services.
7.  Download a PDF of the self-attestation from the Activity section of the self-attestation form and save a copy of the report for your records. For instructions on configuring the attestation PDF template, see [Create HTML and PDF document templates​](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-an-html-template.md).
8.  Close the self-attestation so that the self-attestation process is complete.

As you complete the self-attestation tasks outlined in the self-attestation process, the associated states are automatically updated in a predetermined sequence. The states and corresponding UI actions for these tasks are detailed in the following table.

The self-attestation is then deleted from the self-attestations list in Operational Resilience Workspace.

## Downloading the PDF of the self-attestation

As an owner of the self-attestation, you can download the PDF from the Activity section of the self-attestation form. You can also share it offline with the auditors, external contacts, or stakeholders.

## Roles required to perform the self-attestation tasks

If you're a user of Operational Resilience Workspace, you can perform different self-attestation tasks with the following roles:

-   With the sn\_oper\_res.admin role, you can create and maintain the pre-defined assessment questionnaire templates.
-   With the sn\_oper\_res.manager role, you can complete the self-attestation of the operational resilience profile of the services by selecting one or more services, by choosing the template for the self-attestation, and by providing the answers to a pre-defined set of questions.

    **Note:**

    If you're the owner of the self-attestation with the Operational Resilience manager or the Operational Resilience administrator role, you can create a self-attestation, update its details, or delete the self-attestation.

    As an Operational Resilience administrator, you can create and modify the assessment questionnaire template. You must have the Operational Resilience manager role to respond to the assessment questionnaire in the Operational Resilience application.
