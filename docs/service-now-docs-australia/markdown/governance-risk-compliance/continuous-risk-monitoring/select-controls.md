# RMF step 2 - Select controls for an authorization package

When the impact levels for the package have been approved, it is time to select baseline controls.

## Before you begin

Role required: To write to the sn\_im\_cont\_baseline\_control\_objective table: sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.system\_owner, sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_officer, sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.admin

To access **Mark as not Applicable**: sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_officer, sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_manager, sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.admin.

## GRC Continuous Authorization and Monitoring

GRC: Continuous Authorization and Monitoring quick start tests require activating the Continuous Authorization and Monitoring plugin \(com.sn\_compliance\) and loading the demo data.

## About this task

When approval was received on the Authorization Package form, a **Control overlays** field and a series of **Controls** related lists appeared on the form.

## Procedure

1.  Select the **Baseline Controls** related list.

    The list shows the baseline controls for the calculated impact level of the package. The number of controls to be implemented \(as defined by NIST\) depends on the Impact level \(High, Moderate, and Low\).

2.  You can perform the following actions on the list of controls.

<table id="table_d4j_jry_2nb"><thead><tr><th>

Action

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Add controls to the list

</td><td>

Select **Add**, select the controls you want to add, and then select **Create Baseline Controls**.**Note:** When adding control objectives, you cannot select multiple control objectives with the same reference ID to add to the baseline controls. You cannot add a control objective if its reference ID already exists in the baseline controls list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Add controls using a control overlay

</td><td>

Select a control overlay from the **Control overlays** field. **Note:** Privacy overlays and other types of control overlays might be mandated by government agencies, but you can create them to add a specified number of controls to your list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Identify certain controls as being non-applicable

</td><td>

Select the controls, select **Select**, enter a justification, and then select **Confirm**.

 The controls you marked this way are removed from the **Baseline Controls** list to the **Not Applicable Controls** related list.

 **Note:**

-   You cannot move control objectives with the same reference ID from the baseline controls list to the not applicable controls.
-   You cannot move control objectives with the same reference ID from baseline controls to not applicable controls, or from not applicable controls to baseline controls.
-   When you select two control objectives with the same reference ID from the Not Applicable Controls list, the Return to Baseline Control action is disabled.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Inherit controls from common controls

</td><td>

You can create common controls to which other, subordinate controls can be assigned so they can inherit risk guidance from them. For example, if you have a control that handles an entire facility, you can identify related controls that will inherit protection and compliance from the common control.

 To create a common control, select the control, select **Create Common Control**, select **OK** to confirm. For information on allowing a control to inherit from a common control, see [Inherit from a common control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/continuous-risk-monitoring/create-common-control.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Select **Request Approval**.

    An approval request is sent to the authorizing official, who will access My Approvals from the navigation pane and review the information in the package. When approval is received, the package transitions to the **Implement** state.

    To send the package back to the Categorize state, select **Back to previous step**. All baseline controls are removed and the package must receive approval to advance again to the Select state.
