# Control Requirement Details View

The CAM view of the Control form has fields that have been added to capture the control requirement details.

To accommodate the control requirement details in the CAM view of a Control objective form a Control objective requirements related list is added.

**Note:** The views of the Control objective form and Control form in the CAM view are almost the same as the Control objective and Control forms used in Policy and Compliance Management. However, some fields have been removed and some added in the forms to capture the control requirement details.

## CAM view of a Control objective form

<table id="table_FloorForm"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Reference

</td><td>

Unique numerical identifier or the content reference number.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Family

</td><td>

</td><td>

Option to activate a control objective.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Family ID

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source

</td><td>

Source of the control objective, which is NIST 800-53 revision 5 for which the test templates are provided.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent

</td><td>

Control objective that is not a child of the current control objective. This relationship is to avoid cyclic parent – child relationship.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Compliance Score \(%\)

</td><td>

Compliance score percentage calculated for this control objective and its color code: -   80 and higher in green
-   80 to 50 in yellow
-   below 50 in red

</td></tr><tr><td>

Creates controls automatically

</td><td>

Option to indicate that controls are automatically created when an entity is associated from the Additional entities related list by selecting **Add relationship** and the entity.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create control requirements

</td><td>

Option to generate control requirements automatically for the control objective.**Note:** If there are no control objective requirements, then there won’t be any control requirements either.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Attestation

</td><td>

Reference to the metric type. **GRC Attestation** is chosen by default.**Note:** If the user changes the control attestation, the related control objective attestation type is changed also.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Impact

</td><td>

Potential impact to business functions because of loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of target and data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Organizational guidance

</td><td>

Security control definitions from NIST, which when designated as common control definitions by organizations, are inheritable by one or more organizational targets.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Description of the control objective.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Supplemental guidance

</td><td>

If it is control objective sourced by NIST 800-53 revision 4, then a direction for the control objective implementation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Discussion

</td><td>

If it’s a control objective sourced by NIST 800-53 revision 5, then content-related information that is sourced by NIST.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>Control objectives are just guidelines and aren’t specific to an entity or any object. You can link one control objective with any control objective requirement, and one control objective requirement with any number of control objectives, as the relationship between the control objective and the control objective requirement is many-to-many.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Requirement number|Requirement number of the control objective.|
|Active|Option to make the requirement active.|
|Description|Detailed description about the requirement for the control objective.|

In the Control objective requirements related list, you can select **New** to create a requirement for the control objective if necessary, based on which requirements are generated. Or, select **Edit** to add an existing control objective requirement to the control objective.

**Note:**

-   If the control objective is in the Inactive state, you cannot create or add control objective requirements. Therefore, **New** and **Edit** are not available.
-   If the control objective requirement is inactive, you cannot add a control objective to the control objective requirement.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Reference

</td><td>

Unique identifier.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the control.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

Unique identification number of the control.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Entity

</td><td>

Related entity.**Note:** If you change the state of the entity to Active from Retired state, then the manually created control on the entity also moves to the Draft state.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Control objective

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Owner

</td><td>

User who owns the policy.**Note:** The owner is always added as a respondent. The control owner that you select belongs to the owning group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

Control status. Possible choices are:-   **Compliant**
-   **Non-compliant**
-   **Not applicable**

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

Control state. Possible choices are: -   **Draft**: When the control is created from a control objective, controls are in this state. In this state, all compliance users can modify the control. Only available when creating a one-off control. One-off controls are possible but not recommended.
-   **Attest**: When you select **Attest** and take attestations, the control moves to this state.

**Note:** When a control is set back to draft, the attestation is canceled.

-   **Review**: Controls are automatically moved to review from the attestation phase.
-   **Monitor**: In this state, all compliance managers can move the control from review to monitor.
-   **Retired**: Compliance managers or administrators can move a control from Monitor to Retired.

**Note:** When a control is retired:

    -   Associated indicators don’t run
    -   Associated attestations are canceled
    -   Changes to associated control objectives don’t update the control
