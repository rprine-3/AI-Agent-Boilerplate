# RMF steps 4, 5, and 6 - Assess, authorize, and monitor

After you have implemented controls, you can assess internal and external controls, generate Plans of Action and Milestones \(POA&amp;M\), and manage change requests and vulnerable items.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.system\_owner
-   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_officer
-   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.authorization\_official
-   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_manager
-   sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.admin

## About this task

The Assess process is generally performed by a user other than the system owner or the personnel who implemented the controls.

The Assess state adds **Control Assessments** and **Risk Summary** related lists, as well as **POA&amp;M**, **Change Requests**, **Security Incidents**, and **Vulnerable Items** tabs to the Authorization Package form.

**Note:** CAM performance may slow when a high volume of Change Request, Incident records, or both is related to a single authorization package. If you experience long transaction response times, consider performing the procedures detailed in [KB0861865](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id=6076cbb61b3b94508672ea89bd4bcbca).

## Procedure

1.  For an authorization package in the Implement state, select **Assess**.

    \[Omitted image "assess.png"\] Alt text: Transition to the Assess state

    **Note:** An Audit Engagement is automatically created.

    To send the package back to the Implement state, select **Back to previous step**. The state of the engagement becomes Closed Incomplete. On selecting **Assess**, an engagement is created.

2.  Select the **Control Assessments** related list to view the Audit engagement.

    \[Omitted image "control-asmts.png"\] Alt text: Control Assessments

    **Note:** The Audit Engagement is automatically assigned to the SCA.

3.  Select the engagement number to open it.

    Notice that the **Entities** tab is displaying the authorization boundary for the package.

    \[Omitted image "entity.png"\] Alt text: Tabs for assessment.

4.  Select the **Controls** tab to view all the controls that your team implemented.

    \[Omitted image "controls-tab.png"\] Alt text: Controls

5.  Select the **Test plans** tab.

    Test plans are automatically created for the control. For more information on test plans, see [Generate assessment procedure plans for a test plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/cam-assess-controls-assess-obj.md).

6.  Select the **Control tests** tab to view the tasks for assessing the controls.

    **Note:** The **Audit tasks** tab in the Default view is renamed as **Control tests** tab in the CAM view. The names of the related list labels vary and are specific to the Default view or CAM view. You can change the view by selecting the Additional actions icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_MenuIcon.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions menu icon.\).

    \[Omitted image "cam-control-tests.png"\] Alt text: Control tests tab.

    For more information on test plans, see [Determine control effectiveness of a control test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/cam-control-effectiveness-control-test.md).

    1.  Select a control test.

        \[Omitted image "cam-assessment-proc.png"\] Alt text: Assessment procedures related list.

    2.  From the **Assessment procedures** list, select a record.

    3.  Select the **Attach File** link to attach an evidence document as a proof of the test.

    4.  Select the **Notes** field to enter additional assessment details.

        \[Omitted image "cam-assessment-proc-ws.png"\] Alt text: Assessment procedure record view.

7.  In the Default view, select an audit task and perform the Design Test and Operation Test to judge the control's effectiveness.

    For details on this process, see [Manage engagements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/audit-management/c_Engagements.md).

    **Note:** Any issues that arise during the Assess phase appear in the **POA&amp;M** tab. Additionally, any open Change Requests or Vulnerable Items targeting the system elements in the package appear under those tabs.

8.  The system owner must review and document any POA&amp;M issues, change requests, and vulnerable items that potentially threaten your systems.

9.  When the review is complete, select **Authorize**.

    **Note:** In the Monitor state, continuous monitoring is achievable if you have indicators. If not, you can manually review the controls. For more information, see [Manage control indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/manage-indicators-policy-comp.md).

    You can select **Generate Report\(s\)** to generate a FedRAMP System Security Plan \(SSP\) document for the authorization package in PDF format.

    The package transitions to the **Authorize** state. When you’re satisfied that all is in order, select **Request Approval**. An approval request is sent to the Authorizing Official, who will access **My Approvals** from the navigation pane and review the information in the package. When the approval is received, the package transitions to the **Monitor** state.
