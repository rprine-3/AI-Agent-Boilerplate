# Create a GRC indicator template using the Compliance Workspace

Compliance or risk managers create indicator templates in the Compliance Workspace from which many indicators can be created.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_compliance.admin or sn\_compliance.manager
-   sn\_risk.admin or sn\_risk.manager
-   sn\_audit.admin or sn\_audit.manager
-   sn\_grc.user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations:

    -   **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace** &gt; **Indicators** &gt; **Indicator Templates**.
    -   **Risk** &gt; **Indicators** &gt; **Indicator Templates**.
    -   **Audit** &gt; **Indicators** &gt; **Indicator Templates**.
2.  Select the **Create** list and click **Indicator**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ynl_yjz_dv"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the indicator.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Description of the indicator.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Category for which you’re creating an indicator template. For example, select **Risk Indicator Template** to create a risk indicator template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option that determines whether the indicator template is active.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Method

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Method used to determine the type of indicator template. The choices are as follows:-   **Manual**: Manual indicators are used for data that can’t be retrieved from a ServiceNow instance because it comes from an external system, such as customer data from a third-party sales system.
-   **Basic**: Basic indicators are automated indicators based on an indicator source. The indicator source specifies a table and a frequency at which the scores from this table are saved.
-   **Script**: Scripted indicators use a custom script to collect the data.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Target Type

</td><td>

Type of the target value. The choices are as follows:-   **None**: Use this option if you don’t want to set up any target or threshold for the indicator.
-   **Percentage**: Use this option to determine the indicator result by a percentage value.
-   **Count**: Use this option to determine the indicator result by a count value or total number.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Result if the value meets or exceeds the target value

</td><td>

Result configuration field. The choices are as follows:-   **Passed**
-   **Failed**
 For example, assume you enter `100` in this field. If the indicator result output is more than 100, then the indicator status will pass or fail based on the value configured in this field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target

</td><td>

Value to determine if the indicator will pass or fail.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Value mandatory

</td><td>

Option to decide if a value must be compulsory in the indicator task for a manual indicator. **Note:** This option appears only if **Manual** is selected from the **Type** field. This option is automatically selected if **Count** or the **Percentage** is selected from the **Target type** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Instructions

</td><td>

Additional instructions for the template.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Supporting Data

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

**Note:** Starting with version 10.1, the actual historical data for the supporting data records from the indicator results or indicator tasks are displayed. Earlier, only the real-time state of the records collected could be viewed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Collect supporting data

</td><td>

Option to enable collecting supporting data or evidence every time the indicator runs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table used for collecting supporting data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Supporting data fields

</td><td>

Fields of the source table to be used for collecting the supporting data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sample size

</td><td>

Minimum number of records that must be used for collecting supporting data.For example, a basic indicator could query a large table, returning thousands of records with each indicator execution. You don't have to save all of them; just a sample of those records. If you enter a sample size of 100, only 100 records are saved, even though the query returned thousands.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Basic Criteria

</td></tr><tr><td>

Criteria

</td><td>

Criteria to filter the data from the source table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use reference field

</td><td>

Reference field

</td><td>

Connection between the supporting data table and the **Applies to record** field of the entity.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Additional Criteria
