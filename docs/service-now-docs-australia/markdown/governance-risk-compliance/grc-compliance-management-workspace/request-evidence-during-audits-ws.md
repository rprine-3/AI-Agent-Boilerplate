# Request evidence during audits using the Compliance Workspace

Request evidence at any stage during an audit using the Compliance Workspace. The details about the items for which evidence is requested are also provided to the person responsible for providing the evidence.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_audit.user

## About this task

Evidence can be requested in the following three ways:

-   **My Evidence**

    By creating an evidence record from the **My Evidence** module.

-   **Request Evidence**

    From the Entity, Control, Audit Task, Control Test Issue, and Other Issues related lists in an engagement record. To request evidence from these sources, navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**. In the List view of the workspace, select **Engagements** in the Control testing list. Open the engagement record, and select the related list from which you want to request evidence. Select the **Request Evidence** button. Here, you can either create an evidence request or add more requests to an existing evidence request. The Evidence request is created but not the evidence request tasks.

    You can inform the user of the evidence records that already exist for any of the related item tables of the engagement, which they can reuse.

    1.  To create a new evidence request, select **Create a new evidence request** in the **Select method** list of the Request Evidence pop-up. Enter the details and select the **Request** button.
    2.  To view the information about existing related evidences, select the **View** link in the Request Evidence pop-up.

        **Note:** If there is no existing evidence, then the message does not appear in the Request Evidence pop-up.

        \[Omitted image "ViewLinkReqEvidencePopup.png"\] Alt text: View link in Request evidence pop-up.

    3.  To view all existing evidences created on the related items, select the Evidence related list.

        When the evidence is in **Closed Complete** state, the UI action buttons such as **New**, **Add existing evidence**, **Remove**, and **Delete** are disabled. You can perform these UI actions only when the engagement or any other audit and compliance object is in an active state.

    4.  To add existing evidence, select the **Add Existing Evidence** button and select the evidence.

        **Note:** The **Add Existing Evidence** button is available in the Evidence related item of all compliance and audit objects in the Compliance Workspace such as Engagement, Audit task, Issue, Policy, Entity, Control, Control Objective, Authority document, Citations, and Evidence request.

    5.  To remove the association of the evidences linked to the engagement, select the evidences in the Evidence related list and select the **Remove** button.

        **Note:** The action only removes the association of the existing evidence records from the engagement and doesn’t remove the evidence record from the database.

    **Note:** The logged-in user must also have access to the engagement for which evidence records exist or must be the user who has access to the record to view and add them. If the logged-in user doesn’t have access to those records, although there are evidenced existing on those related items, they aren’t displayed for the user to add.

-   **Entity, Control, Control Objective, Control Test, Engagement, Issue tables**

    From tables such as Entity, Control, Control Objective, Control Test, Engagement, Issue. However, when the users request evidence from these tables, the evidence request is created not the actual evidence request task. The users must navigate to the evidence request record that is generated and then add evidence request tasks.


In this procedure, the method to request evidence from the **My Evidence** module is described.
