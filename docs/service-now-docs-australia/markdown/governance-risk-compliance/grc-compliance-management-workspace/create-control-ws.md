# Create a control using the Compliance Workspace

Controls are automatically generated when you associate a policy with an entity type, or an entity type with a control objective, or when an entity is added to a control objective. A control is created for each entity listed in the entity type for the control objective. Controls can also be manually created using the Compliance Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance\_ws.corporate\_compliance\_analyst, sn\_compliance\_ws.corporate\_compliance\_manager, sn\_compliance\_ws.it\_compliance\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**.

2.  Select the **Create** list and click **Control**.

</table>4.  Select **Copy entity frequency** related link to copy the value of the **Attestation frequency** field of the entity to the **Attestation frequency** field of the control.

    When you select the **Copy entity frequency** related link, the respective entity’s attestation frequency gets copied to the **Attestation frequency** field in the Attestation section of the control table, and does not update the **Frequency** field of the control table.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The control is created and all related lists are visible.

    If you had created a common control, then there are Reliant entities and Reliant entity types related lists along with other related lists of the control. Use the Reliant entities related list to associate entities to the common control. Or, you can use the Reliant entity types related list to add a group of entities of an entity type instead of associating them one by one.

    \[Omitted image "RelEntitiesRelList.png"\] Alt text: Related lists to associate entities as reliant entities.

    **Note:** For more information on the reliant entity association for a common control, see [Convert standard control to common control and add reliant entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/convert-standard-control-common.md).

6.  From the **Overview** page, click the **Issues**.

    You can add existing one or more related issues to the control that you created. By mapping the existing issues to the control, you can reduce the count of open issues on the document.

    When you add an issue to a control, a record is created associating the item that is the control with the issue, in the Issue to Control \[sn\_grc\_m2m\_issue\_item\] table.

    1.  To add an issue to the control, click the **Add** button.

    2.  Select the issue or issues related to the control from the Issues pop-up.

    3.  Click the **Add** button.

        The selected issues are added to the control as related issues. You can also create an issue for the control by clicking the **New** button.

    4.  To remove an issue that is already added to the control, select the issue and click **Remove**.

        The associated record mapping between the issue and control is removed from the Issue to Item table.

        **Note:** The UI action buttons such as New, Add, Remove aren’t available if the control is in Retired state.
