# Review related evidence using the Compliance Workspace

The Evidence Request feature includes a related list called Related Evidence that is not visible by default.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

This related list provides a list of evidence that is not directly requested for the current record, but is associated to a related record. For example, the Related Evidence list on the Control Objective form shows evidence requested for associated controls.

The Related Evidence related list is available to a wide variety of forms throughout the Evidence Request feature; however, it is not visible in the base system. You can personalize any of the forms in which it is available, but keep in mind that activating this related list can impact system performance.

|Table name|Type of related evidence displayed|

|Authority document|Evidence request tasks created on the citations mapped to this authority document.|
|Citation|Evidence request tasks created on the control objective associated to the citation.|
