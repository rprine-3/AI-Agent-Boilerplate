# Request a policy exception using the Compliance Workspace

Use the Compliance Workspace to request exceptions for policies, control objectives, or issues by specifying the reason of exception on a particular list of the systems, applications, networks, or entities for which the exception applies. You must also specify the duration for which the exception is required.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc.business\_user, sn\_grc.business\_user\_lite

## About this task

Exceptions provide temporary relief when you are unable to meet compliance requirements due to extraordinary situations. For example, you are unable to meet a control that stipulates all critical OS servers must be patched within 48 hours after the OS vendor releases patches.

**Note:** For more information on policy exceptions, see [Manage policy exceptions and extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/manage-policy-exceptions.md).

## Procedure

</table>    **Note:** In versions prior to Version 10.1, the **Risk assessment** related list was called **Business Impact Analysis** and required that the GRC: Risk Management application be activated. Starting in Version 10.1, the dependency on Risk Management has been removed and the associated field names have changed.

    **Approved extensions**, **Remaining extensions**, **Date approved**, **Extension date**, **Extension reason**, **Original valid to** fields appear only when you’ve requested an extension on the policy exception and has been approved by the approver.

    With regard to the m2m association of an issue with policy exceptions, there are certain considerations you must know about the values populating in the **Issue** field, **Control objective** field, and in the Impacted control tab:

    1.  If you select an issue in the **Source type** field, then the **Issue** reference field lists issues that have one or more active controls associated with them. Active controls are the ones in Attest, Review, or Monitor states and not in Draft or Retired states. You can navigate to the Impacted controls tab to view the controls associated to the issue.
    2.  If the issue is linked to only one control objective, then that linked control objective is populated in the **Control objective** reference field. If the issue is linked to more than one control objective, then no value is populated in the **Control objective** field. Click the **Control objective** reference field to select a control objective.
    3.  If you didn’t select an issue in the **Issue** field, but a control objective is populated in the **Control objective** reference field, then the Issue reference field will list only those issues that are linked to this control objective.
    4.  As soon as you add an issue in the **Issue** field, then all the controls linked to the issue are added in the Impacted controls tab. However, when you select a control objective in the **Control objective** reference field, then all the controls listed in the Impacted controls tab are replaced with only those controls that are linked to the selected control objective and the issue. Controls can be in any state but not in Draft or Retired state.
    5.  An impacted control linked to one issue of a policy exception will not be listed for you to add in another policy exception because that control is already listed in the Impacted control tab of the first policy exception. If you add more controls to the issue later, and when you link the issue to the second policy exception, then all the newly added controls will be added as impacted controls but not the one that was already added as an impacted control of the first policy exception.
4.  Save the policy exception.

    The Policy exception is in **New** state.

5.  Click the **Request approval** button.

    If verification rules are configured, then verification approvals are triggered. After the verification approvals are approved, the policy exception moves to Analyse state.

    After the policy exception is approved and if the **Valid to** date is reached, then the state moves to **Closed** and the substate moves to **Expired**.

    You can also withdraw the policy exception anytime before the policy exception is approved, if it's no longer required, right from the **New** state.

6.  To withdraw the policy exception, click the **Cancel Request** button.

    The state moves to **Closed** and the substate to **Canceled**.


## What to do next

As a requester you can request extensions to a policy exception that is in the Approved state more than once. Configure the **Number of extensions allowed for a policy exception** property to request policy extension multiple times.

To set up the property, see [Configure the number of extensions allowed for a policy exception](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/request-policy-extension-platform.md).

To request extension, click the **Request extension** button and [enter the details in the Request extension pop-up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/policy-and-compliance-management/request-policy-extension-platform.md).

Click **Request**. You can see the policy extension details in the [Schedule tab of the Policy exception form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/request-policy-exception-ws.md) after the requester has requested for an extension and the policy extension has been approved by the approver.
