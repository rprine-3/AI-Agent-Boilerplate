</table>6.  Click **Save**.

    To view and manage the details of the control objective that you created, see [Manage a control objective from the overview page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/co-overview-pc-ws.md).

    The control objective is created and all related lists are visible.

    -   A control is created for every control objective when a policy is associated with an entity.
    -   The control attributes default to the same attributes as the related control objective.
7.  From the **Overview** page, click the **More** tabs and select **Issues** tab.

    You can add existing one or more related issues to the control objective that you created. By mapping the existing issues to the control objective, you can reduce the count of open issues on the control objective.

    1.  Click the **Add** button.

    2.  Select the related issue or issues from the Issues pop-up.

    3.  Click **Add**.

        The selected issues are added to the control objective as related issues and an m2m relationship is created between the control objective and the issues in issue to control objective \[sn\_grc\_m2m\_issue\_content\] table. You can also create an issue for the control objective by clicking the **New** button.

    4.  To remove an issue that is mapped to the control objective, select the issue and click **Remove**.

        The remove action only removes the mapping between the control objective and the issue. The action doesn’t delete the issue record.

        **Note:** The UI action buttons such as New, Add, Remove aren’t available if the control objective is in Retired state.
