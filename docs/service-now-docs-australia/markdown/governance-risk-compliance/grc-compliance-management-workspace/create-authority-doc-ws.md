# Create an authority document using the Compliance Workspace

Authority documents manage a process, and citations are created within them to manage the points of the process. For example, the process called Building Security contains a citation for Entry Control.

</table>4.  Select **Save**.

    The authority document is created and all its related lists are available for your view. By default, the Overview page opens up to display the **Description** of the authority document record and highlights the record details in the sidebar of the page.

5.  From the **Overview** page, select the **Issues**.

    You can add existing one or more related issues to the authority document that you created. By mapping the existing issues to the authority document, you can reduce the count of open issues on the document.

    1.  Select the **Add** button.

    2.  Select the related issue or issues from the Issues pop-up.

    3.  Select **Add**.

        The selected issues are added to the authority document as related issues. You can also create an issue for the authority document by selecting the **New** button.

    4.  To remove an issue that is mapped to an authority document, select the issue and click **Remove**.

        The remove action only removes the mapping between the authority document and the issue, and doesn’t delete the issue record.

        **Note:** The UI action buttons such as New, Add, Remove aren’t available if the authority document is in Retired state.
