# Remediate an issue using the Compliance Workspace

After an issue has been identified, triaged, and investigated using the Compliance Workspace, you can remediate it.

## Before you begin

Role required: \(per product\)

-   In Policy and Compliance Management: compliance\_admin, compliance\_manager, or sn\_compliance.user
-   In Risk Management: risk\_admin, risk\_manager, or sn\_risk.user
-   In Audit Management: audit\_admin, audit\_manager, audit\_admin, or sn\_audit.user

## About this task

Remediating an issue marks an intention to fix the underlying issue causing the control failure or risk exposure. Accepting an issue marks an intention to create an exception for a known control failure or risk. Controls that are **Accepted** remain in a non-compliant state until the control is reassessed. In this way, the issue can be used to document observations during audits.

2.  Click the **Remediation Tasks** tab.
