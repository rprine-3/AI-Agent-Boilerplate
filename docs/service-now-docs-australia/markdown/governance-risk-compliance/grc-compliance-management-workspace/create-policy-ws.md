</table>4.  Select **Save**.

    In the reporting overview page of the policy, you can see the description of the policy, its state, and its status of overall compliance, entities, control objectives, and control. It also gives you the tracking information of policy acknowlegements, policy exceptions, and issues. The non-compliant entities widget also lists all the non-compliant reliant entities, each with its compliance score. For more information, see [Manage compliance of a policy from the overview page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-compliance-management-workspace/policy-overview-pc-ws.md)

5.  Select any of the related lists to provide more information for the policy.

6.  From the **Overview** page, select the **Issues** tab.

    You can add existing one or more related issues to the policy that you created. By mapping the existing issues to the policy, you can reduce the count of open issues.

    1.  Select the **Add** button.

    2.  Select a related issue or issues from the Issues pop-up.

    3.  Select **Add**.

        The selected issues are added to the policy as related issues and an m2m relationship is created between the policy and the issues in the Issue to Document \[sn\_grc\_m2m\_issue\_document\] table. You can also create an issue for the policy by selecting the **New** button, which takes you to the Create New Issue form.

    4.  To remove an issue that is mapped to the policy, select the issue and select **Remove**.

        The remove action only removes the mapping or the association between the policy and the issue in the m2m table and doesn’t delete the issue record.

        **Note:** The UI action buttons such as New, Add, Remove aren’t available if the policy is in Draft or Retired state. A policy in draft state is considered inactive and becomes active when it moves to Review state.

7.  To mark the policy ready for review, select **Request review**.
