# Configuring Business Continuity Management

Configure the Business Continuity Management application to perform the business continuity tasks for your organization.

## Configuration overview

Configuring Business Continuity Management involves installing the application from ServiceNow® Store and setting it up by the administrators.

**Note:** If you have the BCM role, you can perform the setup tasks that are described in this section.

-   Install the Business Continuity Management application from store. For more information, see [Install Business Continuity Management from ServiceNow Store](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/install-business-continuity-management.md).

    **Note:** Installing GRC: Business Impact Analysis, GRC: Business Continuity Planning, or GRC: Crisis Management automatically installs GRC: Business Continuity Management – Core and GRC: Business Continuity Management – Components.

-   Verify that you have assigned users with the required roles. For detailed instructions and a list of roles, see [Components installed with Business Continuity Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/installed-with-bcm.md).
-   Set up the Business Continuity Management application by performing the administrative tasks with the BCM administrator role. For more information, see [General administration setup for BCM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/set-up-bcm-bcmadmin-tasks.md).

    **Note:** You can view **My tasks page configurations** and **Properties** in the **General Administration** setup.

-   Complete the setup for a business impact analysis by performing the administrative tasks with the BIA administrator role. For more information, see [Setup for a business impact analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/bcm-admin-tasks.md).

    **Note:** When you create a business impact analysis in BCM UIB Workspace, you can assign a BCM lead to the analysis in the BIA form itself.

-   Complete the setup for a business continuity plan by performing the administrative tasks with the BCP administrator role. For more information, see [Setup for a business continuity plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/bcp-admin-tasks.md).

    **Note:** When you create a business continuity plan in BCM UIB Workspace, you can assign a BCM lead to the plan in the BCP form itself.

-   Format the PDF templates for a business impact analysis, a business continuity plan, or an event. For more information, see [Format PDF templates for BIAs, BCPs, and Events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/update-pdf-format-for-bia-bcp-event.md).
