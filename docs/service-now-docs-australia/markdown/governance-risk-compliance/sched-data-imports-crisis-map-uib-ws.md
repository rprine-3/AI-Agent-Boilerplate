# Configure Scheduled Data Imports records

Configure a Scheduled Data Imports record for the Crisis map application. You can then manage your subscriptions to the threat feeds from an internal or external source in the BCM Configurable Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

You must set up the Google maps for enabling the crisis map functionality. For more information, see [Set up Google Maps API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/set-up-google-maps-api.md).

## About this task

Threat feeds provide a situational awareness of potential or current threats to the security of your organization. Threat alerts can be weather alerts, pandemic alerts, geopolitical situations, or internal events like security incidents and system outages.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Threat and Alert Data Feeds** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Scheduled Imports**.

    Following two scheduled data imports exist within the base system.

    |Name|Data source|
    |----|-----------|
    |GDAC Feed Source|GDAC Feeds|
    |Weather.gov Severe Alerts Scheduled Import|Weather Gov Alerts|

2.  To add a new scheduled data import record, select **New**.

    The Scheduled Data Import form is displayed.
