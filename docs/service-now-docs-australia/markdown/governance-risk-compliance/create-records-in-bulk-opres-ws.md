# Create records in bulk

Create records in bulk from the Digital resilience third-party registers using Third-party Risk Management rather than creating one record at a time for single or multiple entities. You can save time and effort by working on multiple records at a time.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.admin

## About this task

Only DORA administrators can view the **Upload** option and perform this task.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **Digital resilience third-party registers** &gt; **Excel download/upload requests**.

2.  Create an Excel upload request by selecting **New**.

3.  On the form, select **Upload** as the request type and fill in the remaining fields.

    **Note:** Only DORA administrators can see the **Upload** option type and perform this task.

    For descriptions of all these fields, see [Create New Excel download/upload request form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/third-party-risk-management/tprm-excel-upload-download-req.md).

    **Note:** You can only upload one type of record for each upload request. For example, if you made an upload request for Assessment records, you can only include Assessment record information in the template.

4.  Select the type of record, for example, Assessments or Branches.

5.  Enter the short description for the request.

    This field is mandatory.

6.  Select **Save**.

    A template file is generated and available for download. The **Download template** UI action is displayed.

7.  Download the default template by selecting **Download template** and fill it out.

    1.  Save the downloaded template and assign it a name in the **Save as** field.

    2.  Select **Save**.

        The file download is in progress. Once it completes, you can close the modal window.

8.  Open the saved template and fill it up as required and save your changes.

    You can view instructions for filling out the template by navigating to the **Instructions** tab of the template file. You can add your record creation information by navigating to the **Digital resilience information** tab and filling out the template.

9.  To select the completed template file and attach it to the request, select **Attach File** and select the file from your local hard drive.

10. Select **Upload**.

    The Microsoft Excel is attached to the form.

11. View the **Result** section of the upload request to view the records that were uploaded successfully and any errors.

    The Result panel of an Excel upload request shows the skipped, inserted, and updated record counts and warning messages.

    \[Omitted image "excel-upload-request-result-panel.png"\] Alt text: Result panel of an Excel upload request showing skipped, inserted and updated record counts and warning messages.

    The Number of skipped records, Number of inserted records, and Number of updated records counts summarize the upload outcome. The Messages text area lists per-row WARNING and INVALID\_VALUE entries, such as "LEI not found in GLEIF database", "Entity status is NULL, expected ACTIVE", or "Entity name mismatch".

    Use these messages to identify the spreadsheet rows that need correction before re-uploading.

    1.  Correct the errors in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

12. Repeat the steps until all errors are resolved and all records are uploaded successfully.

    The records are uploaded in bulk from the Digital resilience third-party registers.
