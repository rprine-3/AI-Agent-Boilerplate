# Export OSCAL Assessment Results

Export the OSCAL Assessment Results \(AR\) file for an authorization package from the CAM Workspace.

## Before you begin

-   The authorization package must be in the Assess, Authorize, or Monitor step.
-   At least one control test in the engagement must have a closed state. Accepted closed states are:
    -   Closed Complete
    -   Closed Incomplete
    -   Closed Skipped

Roles required:

-   Information System Security Manager \(sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_manager\)
-   Information System Security Officer \(sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_officer\)
-   CAM Administrator \(sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.admin\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CAM Workspace**.

2.  In the CAM Workspace, select the **List** icon.

3.  Select **Authorization packages** from the RMF list.

4.  Select the authorization package record in the Assess, Authorize, or Monitor step for which you want to generate an AR file.

5.  Select **Generate OSCAL**.

    A banner appears with the message: `The files are being generated. Refresh the page after some time, then select Download OSCAL Files to download the OSCAL files.`

    The system starts generating OSCAL files asynchronously. This process takes a few minutes depending on package complexity. The Download OSCAL Files button appears when the process is complete.

    A single AR JSON file is generated for each engagement linked to the authorization package. If the package has multiple engagements, multiple AR files are generated.

    **Warning:** Each time you run a generate operation, any previously generated OSCAL files for the package are deleted and replaced.

6.  After the files are generated, select **Download OSCAL Files**.

    \[Omitted image "download-oscal.png"\] Alt text: Download OSCAL files

    The **Download OSCAL Files** button appears only after file generation completes. If generation is in progress, the button is unavailable.

    **Note:** Confirm that the pop-up blocker is turned off for the URL so that the ZIP file downloads automatically to your local machine.

    A ZIP file is downloaded containing the following OSCAL files:

    -   Catalog JSON file
    -   Profile JSON file
    -   SSP JSON file
    -   Overlay Catalog JSON file \(if overlays are configured. Also includes overlays from associated control tailoring requests\)
    -   Assessment Plan \(AP\) JSON file \(one per engagement\)
    -   Assessment Results \(AR\) JSON file \(one per engagement\)
    -   POA&amp;M JSON file \(included if POA&amp;M items exist\)
    The exported OSCAL AR JSON file contains the following structure:

    -   Reviewed controls: Control selections with control IDs and statement IDs from completed control tests
    -   Control objective IDs: References to test templates associated with the engagement
    -   Findings: Array of issues linked to control tests that failed assessment
        -   UUID corresponds to the issue or POAM record
        -   Target contains control test reference and UUID
        -   State is "not satisfied" when findings exist
        -   Description and title provide issue details
    -   Attestations: Objects for all completed controls including:
        -   Responsible parties \(control test owner and UUID\)
        -   Control test title and UUID
        -   Operational effectiveness rating from the control test
        -   Assessment procedures linked to the control test with their operational effectiveness ratings
    -   Metadata and Local Definitions
        -   Metadata: Responsible parties, roles, and all engagement fields
        -   Local definitions: Related controls with control IDs, control objectives, and assessment procedure labels

## What to do next

Validate these files using the OSCAL CLI validator and import them into other systems or share them with external auditors for assessment planning.
