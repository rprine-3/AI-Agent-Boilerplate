# Workflow configuration

Define workflow, framework, regulation, and its associated versions, impacts, and view rules. CAM ships National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) workflow configuration by default, but you can create additional workflows for other frameworks such as Protective Security Policy Framework \(PSPF\) or custom internal frameworks.

## Before you begin

-   The **Enable CAM workflow configuration** property must be turned on. For more information, see [Enable CAM workflow configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/enable-cam-workflow-configuration.md).
-   You must run the migration scheduled jobs to associate existing authorization packages and boundaries with the workflow after enabling the CAM workflow configuration property. For more information, see [Run migration scheduled job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/run-migration-scheduled-job.md).
-   With CAM advanced plugin \(app-grc-cont-auth-monitor-advanced\): You can create unlimited workflow configurations. If you don’t have CAM advanced plugin, you can create a maximum of two workflow configurations \(including the NIST workflow\).

Role required: sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Continuous Authorization and Monitoring** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Workflow Configurations**.

2.  To create a workflow configuration, select **New**.

3.  On the **Workflow Configuration New record** form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ofh_sqz_thc"><thead><tr><th>

Fields

</th><th>

Descriptions

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Enter a name for the workflow.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State Model

</td><td>

Select the state model to which you want to associate this workflow.**Note:** You must create the state model before you can map it to the workflow configuration. For more information, see [GRC state model configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/cam-create-state-model.md).

4.  Select **Submit** to create the workflow.


## What to do next

To add versions, impact, and view rules to the workflow, see:

-   [Add version to workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/add-version-and-impact-to-workflow.md)
-   [Add impact to version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/add-impact-to-version.md)
-   [Add view rules to workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/add-view-rules-to-workflow.md)

-   **[Add version to workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/add-version-and-impact-to-workflow.md)**  
Add workflow versions to a workflow configuration to support different revisions or iterations of your workflow. Workflow versions filter control objectives based on the version requirements.
-   **[Add view rules to workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-continuous-authorization-and-monitoring-workspace/add-view-rules-to-workflow.md)**  
Configure custom view rules to display specific fields, sections, or layouts for authorization packages using a particular workflow configuration. View rules enable workflow-specific user interfaces without modifying the base package form.
