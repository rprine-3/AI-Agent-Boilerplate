# Get regulatory analysis agentic workflow

The get regulatory analysis workflow provides AI-driven insights into regulatory alerts, identifying impacted areas, compliance gaps, and recommended actions for risk mitigation.

## Get regulatory analysis agentic workflow overview

If you have the RCM user \[sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user\] role and the sn\_grc\_comp\_genai.reg\_change\_ai\_agent\_user role, you can analyze and enrich regulatory alerts using the get regulatory analysis agentic workflow in the ServiceNow Otto panel.

This workflow uses web search to enhance alert context, summarizes the alert, and recommends potential impacts on citations, policies, and control objectives to support faster and more accurate compliance decisions.

After the workflow is started, it combines multiple AI agents to perform key activities: enriching the alert with external context, generating recommendations, and structuring outputs for clarity.

Key Inputs:

-   Regulatory alert fields: Title, Description.
-   Processing Jobs:
    -   Regulatory alert enrichment agent: Performs web search to enrich alert context and updates the enriched insights.
    -   Regulatory alert recommendation agent: Generates recommendations for impacted areas \(citations, controls, policies\) based on alert content and templates.

Key Outputs:

-   Enriched insights with key dates, fines, and source references
-   Categorized recommendations for impacted areas
-   Option to accept recommendations and convert them into actionable compliance tasks

You can activate it by selecting **Get analysis** from the **Ask ServiceNow Otto** action menu on a regulatory alert page or by selecting **Get Regulatory Analysis** from the ServiceNow Otto panel.

By reducing manual research and supporting decision-making, the workflow helps organizations address compliance requirements across multiple regulatory frameworks while providing a structured approach for accuracy, scalability, and operational efficiency.

## Benefits of the workflow

-   Comprehensive AI-driven Impact Analysis: Identifies impacted controls, policies, and citations from regulatory alerts, enriches them with external context, and leverages generative AI with predictive models to suggest mitigation steps. Continuously improves recommendations through machine learning feedback loops and enables immediate conversion of accepted suggestions into actionable tasks for compliance teams.
-   Scalable and configurable: Supports multiple regulatory domains and record types, allowing customization of analysis parameters and display options.
-   Compliance accuracy: Delivers AI-powered insights to support better decision-making.
-   Manual effort reduction: Automates regulatory impact analysis to help save time and resources.
-   Clear visibility: Highlights affected areas to support faster prioritization and response.
-   Enhanced scalability: Enables organizations to manage multiple regulatory frameworks efficiently.
-   Enriched alerts with external context: Adds relevant information for better prioritization of compliance actions.
-   Automatic classification and summarization: Helps accelerate and reduce manual review.
-   Immediate task creation: Enables users to convert accepted recommendations into actionable tasks seamlessly.
-   ServiceNow Otto panel integration: Offers a unified experience for accessing generative AI capabilities within Regulatory Change Management \( RCM\).

**Note:** Only users with sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user and sn\_grc\_comp\_genai.reg\_change\_ai\_agent\_user roles can access this workflow.

Generate regulatory action plans by using the generate regulatory action plan agentic workflow in the ServiceNow Otto panel. This agentic workflow analyzes impacted areas and similar historical alerts to create change tasks and action tasks that help implement regulatory change.For more information, see [Activate the Generate regulatory action plan agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/regulatory-change-management-service-portal/activate-rcm-agent-actions-workflow.md) and [Generate regulatory action plans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/regulatory-change-management-service-portal/generate_regulatory_action_plans.md).

</table>**Note:** The get regulatory analysis agentic workflow relies on recommendation templates and alert configurations to generate actionable insights and tasks. Ensure that templates are properly set up and alerts are categorized to support workflow execution.
