# Regulatory change tasks

When a manager or user marks an unassigned regulatory alert as applicable, a regulatory change task is created to analyze the impact of the regulatory change and coordinate the required compliance activities.

A regulatory change task serves as the parent record for all action tasks created to address an applicable regulatory alert. Action tasks represent the specific activities required to implement regulatory changes, such as updating policies, controls, or risk statements in the regulatory library.

A manager with the `sn_grc_reg_change.manager` role assigns a regulatory change task to a user with the `sn_grc_reg_change.user` role. The task captures key information such as the assignment group, approver, assignee, and related regulatory alert to support visibility and accountability throughout the change process.

Starting with version 21.0.1, regulatory change tasks support earlier execution of compliance activities. Tasks can enter the **Implementation** state before approval is requested, allowing teams to begin work while approvals proceed based on workflow configuration.

A regulatory alert can be closed after all required regulatory change tasks and their associated action tasks are completed, and any required approvals are finalized, in accordance with the configured workflow.
