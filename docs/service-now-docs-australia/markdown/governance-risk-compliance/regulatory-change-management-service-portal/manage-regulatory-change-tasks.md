# Manage the regulatory change tasks

Manage the regulatory action tasks in the Regulatory Change Tasks module so that you can use these tasks to identify and comply with the regulatory changes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager, sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user, or sn\_grc\_reg\_change.admin

## About this task

Regulatory change tasks are automatically created whenever a regulatory event alert is marked as applicable after the applicability assessment. Regulatory Compliance team members craft an action plan to identify the changes that need to be implemented so that your organization complies with the regulatory change.

Starting with version 21.0.1, regulatory change tasks do not require approval before work begins. Tasks can move into the **Implementation** state before entering **Awaiting Approval**, allowing teams to start compliance activities earlier. Approval remains part of the workflow but is no longer enforced as a mandatory gate before implementation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Application** &gt; **Regulatory Change Management** &gt; **Regulatory Change Tasks**.

2.  Select a regulatory change task.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Selecting OK will cancel them. Do you want to proceed?`

</table>4.  Select **Update**.

5.  If you want to add new action tasks that are related to the regulatory change task, select **New** in the Action Tasks related list.

6.  If approval is required, log in as an approver and select **Request Approval** to request an approval.

    If approval is requested, the state of the regulatory change task is updated to the **Awaiting Approval** state. In the Approvers related list of the regulatory change task, the state of the approval is updated to **Requested**. The manager with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager role, the user with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user role, or the admin user with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.admin role can view the request in **My Approvals** of the regulatory change tasks.

7.  Select **Approve** to approve the request.


## Result

The regulatory change task continues through the workflow based on its current state. Approval can occur before or after the task enters the **Implementation** state, depending on workflow configuration. When the action tasks associated with the regulatory change task are completed, the regulatory change task is closed.
