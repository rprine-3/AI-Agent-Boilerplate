# Accept or dismiss recommendations for regulatory alert impacted citations

Accept recommendations to mark specific business areas as impacted, helping compliance practitioners capture and address relevant regulatory alerts for citations. Dismiss recommendations to filter out irrelevant or unnecessary information.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

Role required: To view your assigned regulatory alerts, you need the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user and sn\_grc\_comp\_genai.reg\_change\_ai\_user roles.

For more information on related roles and regulatory alerts, see [Types of alerts, user roles, and states of regulatory alerts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/regulatory-change-management-service-portal/user_roles_and_actions.md).

**Important:** Be sure to check AI-generated recommendations for accuracy. If no information is available, the generated recommendations display "No recommendations available", "None", "No records to display", and so on.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations:

    -   **Workspaces** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**, select the list icon \[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then navigate to **Regulatory alerts**.
    -   **Workspaces** &gt; **Compliance Workspace** select the Regulatory Change Management dashboard icon \[Omitted image "reg-change-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then in the Activity overview, Tracking, or Trends section, select any segment or value in an Alerts related widget to open the list of regulatory alerts with that state.
2.  Select the regulatory alert that you want and review the recommendations by selecting the Recommendations tab.

    **Note:** If recommendations haven’t already been generated, you can generate recommendations for a regulatory alert in any state except Closed or Cancelled by completing one of the following.

    -   On the Overview tab, select **Recommend**.
    -   On the Recommendations tab, select **Show recommendations**.

3.  Review potential impact areas by selecting the Citations tab in the Recommended areas of the impact section.

    The recommended citations only include citations that are part of the existing inventory.

    If recommendations are available, you can scroll through the generated list of citation recommendation cards and review the information about each control, such as its name and compliance status.

4.  Review potential impact areas by selecting the Citations tab in the Recommended areas of impact section.

    If recommendations are available, you can scroll through the generated list of citation recommendation cards and review information about each citation, such as its name and authority document.

    Before you act on a recommendation, you see a summary of the impact areas and associations that you’re accepting or dismissing.

    If you accept the recommendation, it’s marked as an impacted area and is added to the list of impacts. If you dismiss the recommendation, it’s marked as dismissed and isn't shown again for that specific regulatory alert.


## What to do next

If you accepted any recommendations, confirm the creation of an impacted area by navigating to the Impacted areas tab. If you dismissed all recommendations or must add more impacted areas, you can manually add impacted areas. For more information, see [Add impacted areas manually to a regulatory alert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/regulatory-change-management-service-portal/add-impacted-area-reg-alert.md).
