# Manage and assign regulatory event alerts

Assign regulatory event alerts that are received from the regulatory intelligence provider to an appropriate user. You can review other properties of the regulatory event alert.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager

## About this task

Regulatory alerts are displayed under the Regulatory Alerts module in the Regulatory Change Management application.

As a manager, you can view and assign the regulatory event alerts to users with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user role. The user can then perform actions on the regulatory event alerts.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Application** &gt; **Regulatory Change Management** &gt; **Regulatory Alerts** &gt; **Unassigned Alerts**.

    All the regulatory alerts in your instance are displayed. You can view the unassigned alerts and assign them to a specific user. An incoming alert is automatically assigned to the New state.

2.  In the regulatory alert list, select a regulatory event alert by using the Type column.

    The alert record for the regulatory event alert is displayed.

3.  To assign the alert, set the **Coordinator** field to the appropriate user.

    You can review the other properties of the alert to help you determine the appropriate user to assign to.
