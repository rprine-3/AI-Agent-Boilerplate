# Regulatory Change Management overview page

The Regulatory Change Management overview page provides a high-level view of the regulatory activities in your organization. If you have the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager role, you can view this page in the Compliance Workspace.

**Note:** The Overview Dashboard in the Classic UI is no longer available from the Yokohama release.

The prerequisites for displaying the Regulatory Change Management overview page in the Compliance Workspace are:

-   Download the GRC: Regulatory Change Management application from the ServiceNow Store in your instance.
-   Log in as a user with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager role into the Regulatory Change Management application.

Use the \[Omitted image "reg-change-icon.png"\] to access the landing page.

The Regulatory Change Management application managers with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager user role assign the regulatory alerts and monitor the associated regulatory change tasks, import document tasks, and action tasks.

The Regulatory Change Management application in the Compliance Workspace is designed for the users with the following roles:

-   Regulatory Change Management application managers with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager role: Only the users with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager role can view the Home page of the Regulatory Change Management application in the Compliance Workspace.
-   Regulatory Change Management application users with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user role: Users with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user role can view the tasks assigned to them in the Regulatory Change Management application, but they cannot view the Regulatory Change Management application landing page in the Compliance Workspace.

## Overview page view

The overview page consists of the data visualization widgets that display the regulatory activity across your organization. The data visualization widgets are selectable widgets that use color coding to distinguish the states of the alerts and the tasks. You can click each widget to view all the associated regulatory alerts or tasks. The color scheme for each donut chart or bar graph is displayed in each subsection.

The GRC: Regulatory Change Management landing page displays the following sections:

-   Activity overview
-   Trends
-   Tracking
