# Activate Regulatory alert recommendation skill

Configure the recommendation skill from ServiceNow Otto to generate the recommendations of the impacted areas for a regulatory alert.

## Before you begin

Install the ServiceNow Otto for IRM plugin \(sn\_irm\_gen\_ai\).

Role required: admin or sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

## About this task

**Important:** After installing ServiceNow Otto for IRM, all ServiceNow Otto for IRM skills and agentic workflows are activated by default.

Recommendation skills help regulatory analysts quickly identify impacted areas by generating AI-driven suggestions based on the content of a regulatory alert. These skills can be configured to be available at all times or conditionally triggered depending on the alert’s status. They’re typically accessible when the alert is in any state except Closed or Cancelled. To generate meaningful recommendations, the LLM analyzes defined data sources and input fields. After recommendations are generated, you can accept or dismiss them individually, with accepted recommendations helping to streamline impact analysis and improve compliance accuracy. For more information, see [Recommendation contexts and templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/recommendation-contexts.md).
