# AI-generated recommendations for a regulatory alert skill

The recommendations framework is designed to deliver actionable, AI-driven insights directly within the user interface. It provides rich contextual information about recommendations, empowering users to make well-informed decisions and take follow-up actions seamlessly. The scalable and flexible design supports multiple recommendation types and complex business scenarios.

Enhancing the recommendations framework empowers regulatory change managers to use the AI-driven recommendations for better identification of impactful business operations based on regulatory changes.

A default recommendation context named `Suggest business operations affected by regulatory alert` powered by ServiceNow Otto for IRM is shipped along with the Regulatory Change Management product. This recommendation context is used for generating recommended citations and control objectives for a regulatory alert.

**Note:** Only users with the sn\_grc\_comp\_genai.reg\_change\_ai\_user role are able to see the option to generate recommendations for a regulatory alert. This role must be manually assigned to an RCM user.
