# Create regulatory event alerts manually

Create a manual entry of the regulatory changes or updates so that they can be routed to the correct subject matter experts for further analysis.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager

## About this task

Users with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.manager role can create the regulatory alerts manually. Creating the regulatory alerts manually provides the following benefits:

-   Recognize and fix human instinctive errors accurately.
-   Assign an ad-hoc or the submitted regulatory event alert to the subject matter experts for further review and analysis, thus ensuring accountability.
-   Ensure that the data entered manually in the system has high quality and a high level of integrity.
