# Explore ServiceNow Otto skills and agentic workflows in Regulatory Change Management

With ServiceNow Otto skills and agentic workflows in Regulatory Change Management \(RCM\), you can streamline the analysis, summarization, and impact assessment of regulatory alerts. These capabilities empower compliance teams to act swiftly and accurately on regulatory changes.

## ServiceNow Otto in RCM overview

Organizations working in regulated environments must regularly interpret new and complex regulatory requirements, triage alerts, and determine which business areas are affected. These activities are often performed manually, which can result in delays, inconsistent analysis, and difficulty referencing previous regulatory responses.

ServiceNow Otto in RCM provides a set of generative AI skills and agentic workflows designed to address these challenges.

The summarization skill enables you to generate summaries of a regulatory alert and recommend impacted areas, including citations, control objectives, controls, and policies, for alerts in any state except Closed or Cancelled. The recommendation skills analyzes incoming alerts against existing citations, control objectives, controls and policies to generate suggestions, leveraging generative AI to support more consistent and efficient compliance analysis.

The Get Regulatory Analysis agentic workflow analyzes and enriches regulatory alerts in any state except Closed or Cancelled by leveraging web search and organizational data. It provides additional context for each alert and recommends potential impacts on citations, control objectives, controls, and policies. The Generate Regulatory Action Plan agentic workflow generates regulatory action plans for regulatory alert in the In Progress state by analyzing impacted areas and referencing similar historical alerts. It creates change tasks and action items that help teams implement regulatory changes.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## ServiceNow Otto in RCM benefits

The generative AI skills in Regulatory Change Management offer the following benefits:

-   Automated summarization of regulatory alerts, reducing manual effort in interpreting complex regulatory language and surfacing key details such as important dates, regulatory authority, key changes, and penalties/fines.
-   AI-powered recommendations of impacted areas, including citations, control objectives, and controls, helping compliance teams quickly assess business impact and prioritize responses.
-   Minimized human intervention in repetitive tasks, enabling regulatory analysts to focus on strategic planning, risk mitigation, and stakeholder engagement.

The agentic workflows in Regulatory Change Management offer the following benefits:

-   Context-enriched regulatory analysis, enabling you to enhance alerts through an automated agent that surfaces relevant external and internal references, helping to reduce time spent manually researching regulatory context.
-   Automated impact mapping, enabling workflows to recommend affected citations, control objectives, policies, and controls based on historical data and organizational frameworks helping to accelerate impact analysis and reduce the risk of oversight.
-   Actionable task generation, where workflows automatically create change tasks and action plans aligned with regulatory requirements, helping teams move from insight to execution without manual task creation.
