# Create an action task for the alert

Create a new action task for the alert so that you can assign it to compliance or risk users and mark a due date for the action tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user

## About this task

The user with the sn\_grc\_reg\_change.user role assigns the selected action task to the users with the sn\_compliance.manager and sn\_risk.manager roles depending on the action area of the alert such as compliance or risk. Once the compliance and risk users complete the action tasks associated with the alert, the alert and the parent regulatory change task are closed automatically.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Regulatory Change Management** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**.

    The Regulatory Change Management application in the Compliance Workspace is displayed.

2.  In the List view, navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Regulatory Alerts** &gt; **Assigned Alerts** view.

3.  Complete one of the following tasks depending on the type of the alert.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Regulatory event alert**|Select the regulatory event alert for which the regulatory change task is in the **In progress** state and the Action tasks related list is displayed in the alert UI page.|
    |**Source document alert**|Select the source document alert for which the source document import task is in the **In progress** state and the Action tasks related list is displayed in the alert UI page.|

4.  Navigate to the Action Tasks related list and select **New**.

    **Note:** Only when the regulatory task is in **New**, **Work in Progress**, or **Implementation** states, you can create a new action task.

</table>5.  In the action tasks form, verify that the mandatory fields are updated.

    The action task is marked for the sn\_compliance.manager or the sn\_risk.manager users.

6.  To save the changes, select **Save**.


## Result

The action task is marked for the users with the sn\_compliance.manager or the sn\_risk.manager roles.

If you specified an impacted area on the action task, the corresponding compliance library record for that impacted area links the action task in its **Regulatory action tasks** tab. This allows you to navigate between the action task and the impacted area record in either direction.

**Note:** The **Regulatory action tasks** tab is visible on citations, control objectives, controls, and policies.
