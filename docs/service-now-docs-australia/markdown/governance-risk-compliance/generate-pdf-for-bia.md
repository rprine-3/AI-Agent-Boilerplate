# Generate BIA reports in PDF or Microsoft Word formats

Generate a PDF or Microsoft Word copy of a business impact analysis in the BCM Configurable Workspace and save it for future reference.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.program\_manager, sn\_bcm.planner

## About this task

To format the PDF for your business needs, see [Format PDF templates for BIAs, BCPs, and Events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/update-pdf-format-for-bia-bcp-event.md).

Beginning with the Xanadu release, the content in PDFs of Business Impact Analyses, Plans, and Events is improved by implementing a new layout:

-   Arrange the various event tasks in a table format.
-   Include details of the asset owner and the description from the Business Impact Analysis.
-   Display a table that outlines the dependencies of the plan assets.
-   Mark the date of the PDF creation on the front page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  In the List view, navigate to **Business Impact Analysis** and select any business impact analysis record that is in the **Review** or next state.

3.  Select **Generate PDF** in the form.

    The example shows the **Generate PDF** option in the business impact analysis form.
