# Add or create an issue from a crisis event

Add an existing issue or create an issue to track problems identified during a crisis event.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_recovery.event\_manager, sn\_recovery.event\_user, sn\_bcm.program\_manager

The **Issues** related list appears on a crisis event record when GRC: Profiles is installed. For more information, see [Managing issues from Business Continuity Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/managing-issues-in-bcm.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  Complete the following steps to create or manage an issue from a crisis event.

<table id="choicetable_p55_b3s_jkc"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d391146e97">

**Create or add an issue from the event record**

</td><td>

1.  Open the crisis event record from the Business Continuity Workspace list view.
2.  Select the **Issues** tab in the record.

It shows the issues associated with the crisis event.

3.  To create a new issue, select **New**, complete the issue details, and select **Save**.

This step creates a new issue directly from the crisis event.

The Create new issue form is shown in the example.

The classification, issue source, and issue source reference are set automatically. The Issue source is Crisis event, classification is Business Continuity Management, and Priority is set to 2-High by default.

4.  To add an active issue to the event, select **Add** in the record.

Use this option when you want to associate an existing issue with the crisis event as an additional source. The event is recorded as a secondary source of the issue.

5.  To remove an issue, select it from the list and select **Remove**.

The issue association is removed from the event; the issue record isn't deleted from the instance.
