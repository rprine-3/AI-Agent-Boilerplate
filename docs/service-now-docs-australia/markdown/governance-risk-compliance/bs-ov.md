For example, if you have installed Policy and Compliance Management, business services data for failed controls is pulled and displayed in this report.

A sample Red flags report for the business services is shown in the example.

-   Red flags by type: The counts for incidents, outages, change requests, operational vulnerabilities, risks, failed controls, and issues are updated on the service's overview page.

    -   Issues
    -   Failed controls
    -   Risks
    -   Outages
    -   Incidents

    **Note:**

    As an administrator, you can navigate to **System properties &gt; All properties** in your instance and configure the **sn\_oper\_res.red\_flags\_exclusion** property for the red flags section.
