# Exploring Model Risk Management

Learn how you can use the Model Risk Management application to identify, assess, and mitigate risks related to the quantitative models.

## Model Risk Management overview

The Model Risk Management \(MRM\) application provides a unified solution to help organizations proactively manage the risks associated with the use of models. It offers a structured approach to identify, assess, validate, and address model risks throughout the model life cycle. This approach reduces operational and compliance risks caused by inconsistent or inadequate model oversight.

For example, a financial institution uses a Value at Risk \(VaR\) model to estimate potential trading losses. Without proper validation, the model can underestimate risk, leading to poor capital allocation. By using the MRM application, the bank can validate the model regularly, document assumptions, track issues, and confirm it meets regulatory standards. This reduces risk and supports better decision-making.

## Model Risk Management users

|User|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Model Owner|Oversees the model life cycle and monitors its performance.|
|Model Developer|Designs and builds models aligned with business requirements.|
|Model Validator|Performs independent validation to confirm model accuracy, reliability, and robustness.|
|Model Governance|Reviews models for risk and compliance and approves models based on governance standards.|
|Executive Management|Provides strategic oversight and makes high-level decisions informed by model risk insights.|

## Model Risk Management workflow

The following section describes the steps from the submission of a model risk in the Employee Center to the assessment and monitoring of the risks associated with that model.

\[Omitted image "mrm-workflow.png"\] Alt text: Infographic showing how Model Owner, Model Governance, and Model Validator submit, assess, validate, and monitor a model risk. For details, refer to the following description.

1.  An employee can use the Employee Center and submit a new model request.
2.  A new model record is automatically created in the model inventory and can be assessed in the Model Risk Workspace.
3.  The Model Governance team reviews the submitted model, fills in the required details such as stakeholders, and then creates relevant assessments.
4.  The Model Owner performs the risk assessment on the model and submits it to the Model Governance team for review. The assessment task is then sent for approval to the defined approvers configured in the Approver Configurator.
5.  The Model Governance team reviews and approves the assessment. The model then moves to the Pre-deployment stage.
6.  The Model Governance team creates and assigns the validation task to the validator.
7.  The model validator validates the model, collects required documents, reports any issues, and decides if the model is fit for use.
8.  The validation task is then sent for approval to the defined approvers configured in the Approver Configurator.
9.  The model then moves to the Monitor stage.
10. The Model is periodically assessed and validated to confirm regulatory compliance and effective risk management.
