-   **TPRM is not installed**

If TPRM is not installed, Operational Resilience users cannot access risk red flags without the IRM roles.

-   **TPRM is installed**

However, if TPRM is installed, Operational Resilience users can access both risk red flags and Third-party Risk Management red flags because they are assigned the TPRM viewer role. The TPRM viewer role includes risk viewer capabilities, thus eliminating the need for IRM roles.
