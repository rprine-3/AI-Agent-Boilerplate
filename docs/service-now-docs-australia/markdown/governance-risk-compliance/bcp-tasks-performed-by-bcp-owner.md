# Structured workflows for BCPs

Perform the structured workflows that are outlined in this section to create a business continuity plan in Business Continuity Workspace \(also known as BCM Configurable Workspace\).

The business continuity plan owner creates plans using templates, adds assets and scope, creates documentation sections, adds recovery teams, defines loss scenarios with recovery strategies, and generates PDFs.

## Hierarchical plan structure enhancement

Starting with BCM, version 9.x.x, the hierarchical structure of parent-child plans verifies logical organization and execution of recovery tasks. When an event is triggered, only relevant child plans are included, allowing plan execution and dependencies to cascade downward in a controlled manner.

Parent plans are excluded to prevent the inclusion of unrelated scenarios that may require subsequent cancellation. This approach confirms that only relevant plans are considered, maintaining a focused and efficient recovery process.

The system also performs cyclic dependency checks automatically, ensuring that the hierarchy flows uni directionally—from parent plans to child plans.

Implementing the hierarchical plan structure offers these key benefits:

-   Logical task execution: Only after the necessary tasks in the parent plans have been completed, tasks in the child plans are executed, ensuring a controlled and sequential recovery process.
-   Avoidance of circular dependencies: The system is designed to prevent circular dependencies, maintaining a unidirectional flow from parent to child plans and avoiding potential conflicts.
-   Parallel execution: Tasks within the same plan can be executed in parallel when possible, optimizing recovery time and efficiency.

By introducing this hierarchical structure, the system provides an organized and manageable approach to plan management, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in disaster recovery planning and execution.

## Nested related plans

Beginning with the Xanadu release, the handling of nested related plans has improved. This enhancement helps in managing potential cyclic dependencies by detecting and highlighting any problems that could cause cyclic dependencies during the execution of tasks.

Additionally, the refined recovery timelines enable you to monitor the planned and actual timeframes. A task can be applied to all assets within a plan or to none, facilitating accurate aggregation of recovery timeframes across assets, tasks, and plans.

-   **[Add loss scenarios](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/add-loss-scenario-recovery-task-bcp-uib-ws.md)**  
Add a loss scenario and define the related asset dependencies in your business continuity plan. You can then view the details of the assets in BCM UIB Workspace and then plan a recovery strategy for an identified loss scenario.
-   **[Add recovery strategies for dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-new-recovery-strategy-for-loss-scenario-uib-ws.md)**  
Add a recovery strategy for the related asset dependencies and estimate the time to implement the strategy. You can then get the assets up and running quickly in an identified loss scenario.
-   **[Configure a recovery strategy template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/configure-recovery-strategy-template-uib-ws.md)**  
Configure a reusable recovery strategy template so business continuity planners can apply a pre-defined strategy to loss scenarios without re-entering the implementation details each time.
-   **[Mapping recovery tasks to phases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/mapping-recovery-tasks-to-phases.md)**  
Starting with BCM, version 9.x.x, BCM administrators set up active phases for plans and events, enhancing recovery and event task management. BCM managers then map these phases to recovery and event tasks, executing them in a desired, logical sequence.
-   **[Add recovery tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/add-a-recovery-task.md)**
