# Download the manifest file

Install ServiceNow Document designer manifest file. This add-in should be enabled for customizing the reports and Microsoft Word templates, according to your business needs.

## About this task

An Office add-in manifest is an XML \(or JSON for unified manifests\) file that describes an add-in to Microsoft Word. It includes its name, ID, version, and permissions. It specifies how the add-in integrates with Microsoft Word, such as defining custom UI elements \(ribbon buttons\) and HTML files.

Starting with Digital Resilience Incident Reporting, version 22.3.0, the Document designer add-in manifest is merged with Microsoft 365 reporting add-in manifest. When you side-load Document designer with Word add-in, the **Add Content** and **Manage Content** icons are available in the task pane.

\[Omitted image "document-designer-add-manage-content-icons.png"\] Alt text: Microsoft Word toolbar with the Document Designer task pane open, showing Add Content and Manage Content icons.

You can use the icons to insert Microsoft 365 reporting items into a Microsoft Word template without installing a second add-in.
