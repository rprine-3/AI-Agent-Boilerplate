# Complete action tasks and report incidents

Report incidents or security incidents associated with multiple regulations for various legal entities. The automated workflow generates regulatory reporting assessments of IT incidents, and Digital resilience incident \(DRI\) Initial, Intermediate, and Final reports, all within regulatory timelines. Complete the action tasks and generate reports in Microsoft Word format, as required by regulatory authorities for analysis.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## About this task

**Note:** The regulation status, previously a field on the Digital resilience incident reporting \(DRIR\) case form, is now displayed within the Regulations related list.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **Digital resilience incident reporting** &gt; **All incident reporting cases** and open the incident reporting case from the list that you want to work on.

    From the Digital resilience incident reporting \(DRIR\) cases in the instance, DRI0001003 is selected for this example.

    \[Omitted image "drir-cases-created-opres.png"\] Alt text: Cases.

    Its automated workflow generates the Regulatory reporting assessment of IT incidents, DRI Initial report, DRI Intermediate report, and DRI Final report action tasks.

2.  Review the incident record's 'Action tasks' and 'Regulations' related lists for assigned tasks and mapped regulations.

    The examples show that an action task is assigned automatically.

    \[Omitted image "ent-acer-w-dora-regulation.png"\] Alt text: Action task is assigned automatically to the case.

    A regulation is mapped to the case.

    \[Omitted image "ent-acer-w-dora-regulation-mapped.png"\] Alt text: Regulation is mapped to the case.

3.  Review the details of the Digital resilience incident reporting case and verify that the owner of the case is a member of the assignment group.

    A sample Digital resilience incident reporting incident is shown. The source is Incident, Source record is in the New state, the source record is an Incident INC0010005, and the date of discovery is listed. The case is assigned to the 'Digital Resilience Incident Managers' assignment group.

    \[Omitted image "inci-assigned.png"\] Alt text: Incident assigned.

4.  As a Digital Resilience Incident Manager, log in to the case record, assign it to an analyst from your group, and select **Save**.

    The example shows that an analyst, Opres manager01, is assigned to the 'Digital resilience incident reporting: Facility issue' case.

    \[Omitted image "dri-case-to-analyst.png"\] Alt text: Case assigned.

    As the assigned analyst, you can begin working on the action tasks.

5.  Open the first action task in the case, verify that it’s assigned to a user, and update the state of the action task to **Assigned**.

    The example shows that the 'Regulatory reporting assessment of IT incidents' action task is updated to the **Assigned** state.

    \[Omitted image "update-state-assigned.png"\] Alt text: Action task state is updated.

    \[Omitted image "act-task-assigned.png"\] Alt text: Action task is in the assigned state.
