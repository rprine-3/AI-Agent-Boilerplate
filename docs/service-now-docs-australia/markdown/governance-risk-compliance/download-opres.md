# Install Operational Resilience application

Install the GRC: Operational Resilience application from the ServiceNow Store and run it in your instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the GRC: Operational Resilience \(App id: sn\_oper\_res\) application using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you cannot find an application, you may have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  Select **Install**.

    The application dependencies are installed by default.

    **Note:** If you purchased the IRM Professional SKU \(alone or with BCM Professional\), you must install the IRM plugins manually. If you purchased only the BCM Professional SKU, you cannot install the IRM plugins. For more information, see [Roles installed with Operational Resilience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/roles-installed-with-op-res.md).

4.  To install Digital resilience incident reporting, search for 'Digital resilience incident reporting' \(com.sn\_app\_digital\_resilience\_incident\_reporting\), select **Install** and confirm the install on your instance.

    The plugin requires an active IRM application-family entitlement.

    1.  Verify that all the dependent plugins listed in the 'List of required plugins' table are installed.

        The Store install process activates most of them automatically; activate any that remain in the inactive state from **System Definition &gt; Plugins &gt; Activate/Upgrade Plugin**. After installation, the 'Digital Resilience Incident Reporting' module appears in the Operational Resilience Workspace and the Digital Resilience Incident Case Type module is added to the configuration navigator.

5.  If demo data is available and you want to load it, select **Load demo data**.

    Some applications include demo data, which are sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

    **Note:** If you do not select the **Load demo data** check box for a store application during installation, demo data is not available to install from the **Application Manager** later. For information on how to install or reinstall demo data after the initial installation, see the [Workaround to install demo data if application is already installed \[KB0722909\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0722909) article in the HI Knowledge Base.

6.  Select **Install**.
