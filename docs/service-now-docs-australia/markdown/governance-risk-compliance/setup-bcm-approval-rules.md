# Set up approval rules

Set up rules for approvals at each approval level by selecting an approver type and the requirement of approval from either one or all the stakeholders. Define filter conditions on the source table to which the approval rule is applied.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin

## About this task

You can select specific approvers, approvers from the selected source table, dynamic approvers, or approvers that you choose to approve your business documents. The approvers can be a BIA owner, BCM lead, BCM manager, BCM admin, contributors, or one or all of them from the source table that you select.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assignment and Approval Configurations** &gt; **Approval Configurations**.

2.  Click an approval configuration record in the list.

3.  Click the approval levels record in the **Name** column of the Approval Levels section.

4.  Click **New** in the Approval Rules section.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

**Note:**

For security reasons, the BCM admin doesn’t have write access to the **Script** field on the Approval Rule form. Only the Approver Configurator developer has create and write access to the **Script** field on the Approval Rule form.

If you have the BCM admin role, you can set up an approval rule only with types of approvers from the Approver type list:

-   Specific approvers
-   Approver from source
