# Generate reports for BIAs, BCPs, and events

Generate customized reports for BIAs, BCPs, and events directly from their respective records in Microsoft Word format. This functionality enables you to streamline reporting of impact analyses, plans, and events within your organization.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.manager and sn\_grc\_doc\_design.reader

## About this task

You can control whether to retain or replace the existing report attachments by configuring the **sn\_bcm.retain\_report\_attachments** system property.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Business Continuity** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  Open a BIA, BCP, or event record from the list view.

3.  To generate a report of the record in Microsoft Word format, select **More \(...\)** and then choose **Generate MS Word** in the record view.

    A BIA record with the UI action is shown in the example.

    \[Omitted image "gen-ms-word-action.png"\] Alt text: BIA record.

    The Generate report window is displayed.

    \[Omitted image "generate-report.png"\] Alt text: Generate report window.

4.  Select the report template for the BIA, BCP, or event and add the name of the report.

5.  Select **Generate**.

    A message is displayed on the screen: `Report is being generated. Refresh the record shortly to view the updates.`

6.  Navigate to the **Details** tab of the record and view the report listed in the Activity section.

    The report is generated in Microsoft Word format and it is displayed in the Activity section of the record.

7.  Download the report in your ServiceNow instance or in the cloud \(Microsoft Office 365\).

    You can save the generated reports of the BIAs, BCP, and events in your ServiceNow instances or in Microsoft Office 365 for future references.

    Starting with BCM Core version 12.x.x and later, Word reports for events generated from the base version template include a **Collaboration threads** section in tabular form. This section appears after **Action items** and before **Similar tasks groups** in the report's table of contents. To customize this into a block with a nested action items table using Document designer, see [Update the Word template with a collaboration block](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/add-collaboration-block-docudesigner.md).

    Starting with BCM Core version 12.x.x and later, issues related to plans and events appear in separate sections in the Word report. Group ownership details for BIA, plan, and event records also appear in separate sections.
