# Report an operational vulnerability from Self-attestation

Report an Operational vulnerability from the Self-attestation module in the Operational Resilience Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **Self-attestations**.

    A list of the available Self-attestations is displayed.

2.  Select a Self-attestation record from the list.

    If you create a Self-attestation record and save it, the Operational vulnerabilities related list is displayed.

    The Self-attestation record with the Operational vulnerabilities related list is displayed.

3.  Check the state of the Self-attestation record.

    If the self-attestation is in the **Attestation received** state, you cannot add or remove a vulnerability at this stage.

4.  Add a service to the self-attestation record.

5.  Open the Service record, select **More** and add the **Operational vulnerabilities** related list.

6.  Select **New** in the Operational vulnerabilities related list and add an operational vulnerability.

7.  On the Vulnerability New record form, fill in the fields.

    The source of the vulnerability is the Self-attestation. Therefore, the **Source** field on the form shows the source as Self attestation and the **Source table** field on the form shows the table as Self attestation. The **Source table** field is auto-filled.

    To view more information on the fields, see the [Create Operational vulnerability form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-new-op-vul-form.md).

8.  Select **Save**.

    The following example shows how the Self-attestation record is displayed in the Operational vulnerabilities related list and the Operational vulnerability is associated with the Self-attestation for critical services.
