# Create contacts for emergency notifications

Use the ServiceNow users list to create contacts manually and synchronize the contacts with Everbridge to send emergency notifications.

## Before you begin

Role required: BCM admin \(sn\_bcm.admin\)

## About this task

After creating the contact from the user list, you can update the contacts and synchronize them with Everbridge.

Delivery channels are imported from Everbridge to the delivery channels table. Using the imported delivery channels, you can manually create contact delivery details or the system administrator can do an easy import.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Business Continuity** &gt; **Everbridge Contact Configuration** &gt; **Contacts**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>    You can delete a contact that you created manually from the User table. However, the contact must be in **New** state. If the referenced user record is deleted, then a scheduled job that runs weekly deletes the contact from the Contacts table.

4.  Click **Submit**.

5.  To create delivery details for the contact you created, click **New** in the **Delivery details** related list.

    1.  Select the Delivery channel from the list that you imported.

    2.  Enter a value.

        If the delivery channel is email, then enter an email ID.

    3.  Enter the order of preference in which the delivery channels are prioritized to send notifications.

    4.  Click **Submit**.

6.  To import contacts using a sync rule, you must first [create a contact import rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/contact-import-sync-rule.md).

7.  To import contacts based on contact sync rules, click **Import users** button.

    Refresh the form page to get the imported list of users.

    **Import users** action reads the Users table \[sys\_user\] based on the contact sync rules and creates a record in the Contacts table.

8.  To synchronize your list of contacts with that of Everbridge, click the **Sync with Everbridge** button.

    After the contacts are synchronized with Everbridge, the status of the sync action is recorded in the **Sync status** field. The unique ID of the contacts that are synced successfully in Everbridge are recorded as the **External contact ID** of the Contacts table.
