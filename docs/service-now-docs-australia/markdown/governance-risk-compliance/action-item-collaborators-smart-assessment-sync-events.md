# Action item collaborator synchronization with Smart Assessment

When users are assigned to a recovery action item, they are automatically synced as collaborators on the linked Smart Assessment instance.

When an action item of type Assessment transitions to **Work in progress**, a linked Smart Assessment Engine instance is created. The users assigned to the action item are synced as the assessor and collaborators on that instance.

## Assessor assignment

User in the action item's **Assigned to** field becomes the assessment assessor. If **Assigned to** is empty, the assignment group manager becomes the assessor.

This applies both when the assessment is created and after the action item is updated.

## Collaborator sync

The following users are added to assessment collaborators:

-   Users from Additional assignee list
-   Members of the assignment group
-   Assignment group manager \(unless already the assessor\)

**Note:** The current assessor is excluded from the collaborator list.
