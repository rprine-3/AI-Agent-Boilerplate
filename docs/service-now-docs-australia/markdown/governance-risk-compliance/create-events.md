# Create an event for the scenario

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter the name for the event.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter the description for the event.

5.  In the **Event group** field, select an event group.

    For a description of the field values in the form, see [Event record form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/event-reference.md).

    **Note:** You can add an event to many scenarios, but you can add an event to a scenario only once.

6.  Click **Submit**.

    You can classify an event under an event group as shown in the following example.
