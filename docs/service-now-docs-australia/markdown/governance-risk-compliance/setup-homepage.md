# Landing page and dashboard views

The landing page in the Operational Resilience Workspace provides a single-pane overview of the services, business services, and pillars in your organization. The dashboard displays resilience metrics, including operational status, completed activities, red flags, and suggestions for improvement.

The flexible data model introduced with Operational Resilience, Release 21.0.x provides a foundation for the dashboards and tracks the flow of dependent services. Changes to the flexible data model update the dashboard with data including red flags by type, such as failed controls, incidents, and outages. Business service metrics such as number of flags, importance, and impact tolerance are also updated.

\[Omitted image "dashboard-data.png"\] Alt text: Dashboard data.

The data shown in the example is for business services such as business service by number of red flags, business service by importance, business service by impact tolerance. You can change it service offerings, business processes, or application services by configuring the **sn\_oper\_res.top\_class\_name** property. You can then change the top class to another object and the system shows data with respect to that specific top class.

## Calculation and roll up of red flags

The dashboard shown in the earlier example displays a range of 1-30 red flags. Upon selecting, it shows a detailed breakdown, showing a total of 20 red flags, with 3 specifically attributed to the "cards and payments" level. This illustrates the roll-up functionality, which aggregates red flags beneath the selected "Cards and Payments" business service, providing a hierarchical view of the data.

\[Omitted image "red-flags-breakup.png"\] Alt text: red flags.

The Total red flags count column shows the value "24". This is the roll-up value of red flags for all entities under the "Cards and Payments" business service.

The **Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies** scheduled job does not create new records in the \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\] table. Instead, it recomputes the impacted objects for the existing sn\_oper\_res\_profile records using data from the \[sn\_grc\_m2m\_profile\_profile\] table.

The **Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies** scheduled job fetches the red flags for the profiles in the \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\] table only when the following conditions are met:

-   The **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.pillar** is not empty.
-   The **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.applies**\_to field is not empty.

The red flags fetching mechanism can use either the **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.profile** condition, the **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.applies\_to** condition, or a combination of both.

The red flags also inherit the impacted objects and impacted object classes from the \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\] record. For example, an application service's Operational Resilience profile might list Business service, Offering, and Business process as impacted objects. These objects are copied to all associated red flags for the application service and its related entities.

**Note:** Beginning with Operational Resilience release 22.x.x, the **Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies** and **Update CSDM and other dependencies** scheduled jobs are deactivated by default for new installations. For existing installations, these jobs retain their current state \(active or inactive\).

## Conditions for calculating the red flags

This section uses the **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.profile** and **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.applies\_to** conditions for reference. The criteria for calculating red flags and the relevant tables are detailed in the Red flags calculation table.

</td><td>

For all these risks, staging records are created in the \[sn\_oper\_res\_risk\] table.

Failed controls: Step 1 \(Optional\)

</td><td>

\[sn\_compliance\_m2m\_control\_entity\] \(sn\_compliance\_control ← → sn\_grc\_profile\)

</td><td>

Conditions:-   entity=profile

Conditions:-   entity=profile or sys\_id in the list of controls
-   control.status=non\_compliant

-   control.state=monitor
-   control.active=true

</td><td>

For all these controls, staging records are created in the \[sn\_oper\_res\_failed\_control\] table.

Issues: Step 2 \(Optional\)If one of the following pillars is used, then this step is considered:

A joint query is performed using the two tables and \[sn\_grc\_issue\] is fetched for the service, business service, and offering.

These are appended in the list of issues from step 1.

    -   validity&gt;now
