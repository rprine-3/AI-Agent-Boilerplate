# Create a business impact analysis

Create a business impact analysis \(BIA\) to get the necessary information for a plan.

</table>4.  Click **Submit**.

    A BIA is created in **In Draft** state.

    State transitions for a BIA:

    -   **In Draft**

        It is the state where your BIA is under edit. Add RTO, RPO, and dependency assessments. Either you can submit the BIA for review, in which case confirm that a BCM Lead is assigned to the BIA. Or, as a BIA owner you can submit the BIA for approval.

    -   **In Review**

        Review the BIA and submit it for approval. In this state, the BCM admin can modify the BIA owner and BCM lead.

    -   **Pending Approval**

        When you click **Submit for Approval**, the BIA is set to **Pending Approval** state. The approval configurations, approval levels, and approval rules are evaluated against the BIA to determine the approvers. If there are no approval records in the requested state for the BIA, then as a BCM program manager you can either **Reject** or **Approve**. You must add RTO, RPO, and dependency assessments before you submit for approval. In pending approval state, the BIA is read only and the RTO, RPO, and dependency assessment details cannot be modified. The state of the plan and its related tables becomes read only.

    -   **Returned**

        BIA is editable. BCM admin can change the BIA owner in this state. When the BIA is rejected, it is set to **Returned** state.

    -   **Approved**

        When a BIA is in an approved state, it becomes read only and the RTO, RPO, and dependency assessment details cannot be modified. Your only option to change the status is to move it to **Archived** state.

    -   **Archived**

        When the BIA is archived, it becomes read only. All the underlying tables are set to read only. You can no longer edit the information in these tabs. In this state, you can also generate a PDF of the BIA.

    **Note:** A scheduled job runs weekly to move the BIAs that have expired to **Archived** state.
