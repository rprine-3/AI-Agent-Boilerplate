# Submit the scenario analysis and receive an approval

Submit the scenario analysis for an approval in the Operational Resilience Workspace. The analysis approver for the scenario analysis reviews the details and subsequently approves it. Having a scenario analysis is the final step in the workflow.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the scenario analysis that you're working on in one of the following ways:

    -   **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **All scenario analysis**
    -   **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **Tasks** &gt; **Scenario analysis approvals**
    If you navigate to the scenario analysis from the Tasks page, skip steps 2 and 3. Update the state of the scenario analysis as outlined in step 4.

2.  Select **Request analysis approval**.

    **Note:** To submit the analysis result, you must select at least one scope, one participant, and one event.

    The state of the scenario analysis is updated to **Pending analysis approval**.

3.  Ensure that the scenario event associated with the scenario analysis is completed and its status is shown as **Completed**.

    **Note:** The potential start date time and end date time cannot be empty before completion of the scenario event.

4.  As the analysis approver for the scenario analysis, log into the instance and navigate to the scenario analysis.

5.  To approve, reject, or cancel the scenario analysis, double-click the State column in the **Approvals** tab.

6.  Update the state of the scenario analysis to **Approved**.

7.  Select **Save**.

    The scenario analysis is approved by the analysis approver and the state of the scenario analysis is updated to **Approved**. This action completes the scenario analysis workflow.
