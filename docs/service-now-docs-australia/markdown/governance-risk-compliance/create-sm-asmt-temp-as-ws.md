# Create a Smart Assessment template

Create a Smart Assessment template and impact automation that can be used in the vulnerability types of an operational vulnerability.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.admin

## About this task

Operational Resilience administrators contain the flow\_designer role, enabling them to update automation flows as needed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Assessment Workspace** or navigate to **All** &gt; **Smart Assessment Engine** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Template Categories**.

2.  Select **New template**.

    You can create assessment templates to manage your assessments in the Assessment Workspace. The following example shows demo data in an instance.

    When you select **New template**, the form is displayed.

3.  In the Create assessment template form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Template name|Unique meaningful name for the template, for example, BIA template using Smart Assessment.|
    |Description|Description of the template such as why it is being used.|
    |Purpose|Purpose or intended use of the template, such as, Self attestation assessment.|
    |Assessment target|Table records that are used for the assessment.|

    You can now fill in the template with instructions, questions, and optional guidance for responding to a question, as well as sections that group the related questions.

4.  Navigate to the **General** tab.

    1.  Verify the template details, displayed in the **Details** section of the **General** tab.

    2.  In the Settings section, assign the Assessment reader role in the **Assessment reader role** field.

    3.  Select **Save**.

    For information on creating an assessment template, see [Create an assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-create.md).

5.  Navigate to the **Questions** tab and set up the assessment questions.

    For information on adding instructions and questions to the assessment template, see [Add instructions and questions to an assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-populate.md).

6.  Select **Publish**.

7.  In the **Automations** tab, view the user responses and select **Open** to view the actions that are automatically triggered based on user responses.

8.  Select **Save** and **Publish**.

    **Note:** Starting with GRC: Operational Resilience, version 22.3.1, Smart Assessment templates support version control, and version details are displayed on each template.

    A message is displayed that the assessment template is published and it can be used to send assessments. You can select **OK** or select **Return to template list**. The **Automations** and **Scoring** tabs are displayed in the assessment template. The Smart Assessment template is created and saved in the instance.
