    The settings on the form are described in [Trigger Smart Assessment action form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-smart-asmnt-action-form.md).

4.  Test the action as described in [Building flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flows.md).

    For descriptions of all these settings, see [Settings in the Test action pop-up window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-test-action-popup.md).
