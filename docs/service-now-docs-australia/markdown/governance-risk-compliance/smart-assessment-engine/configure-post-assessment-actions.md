# Configure post-assessment actions

Automate actions based on assessment responses in Smart Assessment Engine. Template designers can predefine actions using a rule engine, such as updating fields, creating follow-up assessments, or generating other records.

## Before you begin

-   A subflow must be available and mapped to the assessment template category for which you want to configure post-assessment actions. For more information about how to create and build subflows, see [Create a subflow in Workflow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/create-subflow.md) and [Building subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/subflows.md).
-   To make actions available in post-assessment workflows, link the subflow to the appropriate template category. For more information, see [Link subflow to template category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/link-subflow-to-action-set.md).
-   The Reusable Impact Framework plugin \(sn\_impact\_fwk\) and Post Assessment Actions for Smart Assessments plugin \(sn\_smart\_imp\_auto\) must be installed.

Role required: sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin or sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_manager and sn\_smart\_imp\_auto.automation\_creator

## About this task

\[Omitted video\] Description: Configuring post assessment actions

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Assessment Workspace** to access the Assessment Workspace landing page.

2.  Create an assessment template or open an existing assessment template for which you want to configure post-assessment actions.

    Post-assessment actions can only be set on a published assessment template and remains in the Draft state until manually activated. After activated, post-assessment actions can’t be moved back to the Draft state while the template remains published. They can only be deactivated.

3.  Select the **Automations** tab.

4.  Select **Create Automation**.

5.  Provide a unique name and a description for the automation.

6.  Add either a conditional action set or a standalone action set.

<table id="choicetable_v2z_xht_42c"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d375666e151">

Option

</th><th align="left" id="d375666e154">

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d375666e160">

**Choose a conditional action set**

</td><td>

1.  Select **Add a conditional action set**.
2.  Select **If** and then select **+New condition set**.
3.  Create the conditional action set using the condition builder. For more information, refer to [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).
4.  Select **Save**.
 **Note:** You can select **+New condition set** to add multiple conditions.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d375666e206">

**Choose a standalone action set**

</td><td>

Select **Add a standalone action set**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>7.  To set a condition for the conditional action set, select **If**.

8.  In the **Set actions** dialog box, fill in the fields as appropriate.

9.  To set an action for the standalone action set, select **then**.

10. Select an option for the **Action type** list.

    Based on the selected action type, new fields appear requiring additional details.

    The options displayed in the **Action type** field are subflows linked to the chosen template's categories. For more information on automated actions, see [Post-assessment automations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/impact-automation.md).

    **Note:** Responses from dropdown, check box, radio, and attachment question types cannot be passed as action parameters because they return structured or binary data that action parameters cannot accept.

11. Select **Activate**.

12. Acknowledge the **I understand the automation will no longer be editable** informational check box and then select **Activate**.

    The automation is now activated, and a confirmation message is displayed. When the assessor submits the assessment, the automation you set up is executed.


## Result

The automation is activated and will execute when the assessor submits an assessment that matches the configured conditions.
