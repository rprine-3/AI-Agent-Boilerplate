# Create assessment template form

In Smart Assessment Engine, the **Create Assessment Template** form contains the following fields for creating an assessment template.

<table id="table_krg_p53_2yb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Template name

</td><td>

Unique meaningful name for the template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment name

</td><td>

Add separate assessment name \[Omitted image "separate-assessment-name.png"\] Alt text: Separate assessment name icon.icon that includes an optional alternative name for generated assessments. The respondent sees this name rather than the template name.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Text that helps others to understand what the template is being used for.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Purpose

</td><td>

Purpose that the new assessment template should be a member of. For example, Risk, Performance, Security, and so on.

Template purposes enforce data segregation for templates. A purpose controls which users can view a template. Each assessment template is associated with a purpose. To view a template within a specific purpose, you must have a category role associated with that purpose.

For more information, see [Create an assessment template category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-category-create.md)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessment target

</td><td>

Table records that are selected to be assessed — the assessment's scope items. For an explanation of scope items, including how they are set and where responders see them, see [Scope items in an assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-scope-items.md).**Note:** Assessment targets \(context items\) are configured after the template is created, not during initial creation. Adding assessment targets requires the sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin role and can only be done while the template is in draft state. This is because assessment targets define the scope records that questions operate on, and the template structure must be finalized before they can be attached.
