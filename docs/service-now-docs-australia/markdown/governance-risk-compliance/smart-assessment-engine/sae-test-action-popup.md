Assessment template

</td><td>

Assessment template that is the basis for the generated assessments.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assessors

</td><td>

Persons who are notified of the assessment and typically respond to the assessment or assign it to another user. One assessment instance is assigned to each assessor.

 Assessors have the Assessment actor \[sn\_smart\_asmt.actor\] role. See [Roles installed in Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-roles-defined.md).

Requester

</td><td>

Contact for questions from the assessor. Each generated assessment includes the contact information.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Text that helps others to understand the intent of the generated assessments.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Template category

</td><td>

Category that the assessment template should be a member of. For example, Risk, Performance, Security, Personal data, and so on.

Template purposes enforce data segregation for templates. A purpose controls which users can view a template. Each assessment template is associated with a purpose. To view a template within a specific purpose, you must have a category role associated with that purpose.

For more information, see [Create an assessment template category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-category-create.md).**Note:** You can create an assessment only from a published assessment template.

Table records that are selected to be assessed — the assessment's scope items. For an explanation of scope items, including how they are set and where responders see them, see [Scope items in an assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-scope-items.md).
