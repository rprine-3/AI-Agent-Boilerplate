# Create an assessment template category

Create an assessment template category in the Smart Assessment Engine application so that you can organize and grant access to the assessment templates that are related.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin

## About this task

Template purposes enforce data segregation for templates. A purpose controls which users can view a template. Each assessment template is associated with a purpose. To view a template within a specific purpose, you must have a category role associated with that purpose.

Additional fields may appear on this form depending on which plugins are active. If the Basic Scoring for Smart Assessments \(com.sn\_smart\_scoring\) is installed, the following fields are available: Enable normalization, Normalization strategies and Default normalization strategy fields.

Use the **Allow user delegation** field to let users delegate their assessments in this category.

If you use question banks, this form also includes a **Question bank category roles** field. This field controls access to the question banks associated with this category, separately from the **Category roles** field that controls access to templates. For more information, see [Question bank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/question-bank.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Smart Assessment Engine** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Template Categories**.

2.  On the Assessment template categories list, select **New** and then fill in the form.

<table id="table_krg_p53_2yb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Unique meaningful name for the template category. For example, `Food storage compliance`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category roles

</td><td>

Specifies the minimum roles required to view templates within this category. To create or view a template in this category, a user must have one or more of these roles in addition to their base SAE role \(such as template\_manager or template\_reader\). This is a multi-select field, allowing each category to be linked to multiple roles.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Question bank category roles

</td><td>

Specifies the minimum roles required to access question banks associated with this category. To create or view a question bank, users must have one or more of these roles. They must also have a base question bank role, such as **question\_bank\_manager** or **question\_bank\_reader**. This is a multi-select field, allowing each category to be linked to multiple roles. This field is separate from Category roles, which governs access to templates.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Text that helps others to understand the purpose of including templates in this category.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to activate the category.

 By default, newly defined template categories are active.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Is AI response enabled

</td><td>

Option to activate automated AI-generated responses for assessments associated with that category. When this option is selected, responders working on assessments triggered from templates in this category see the **Draft responses with AI** action and can run the Smart Assessment Response Assist skill on those assessments. The Smart Assessment Response Assist skill must also be turned on in the AI Admin Hub console for the action to be functional. For more information, see [Activate Smart Assessment response assist skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/activate-smart-assessment-response-assist-skill.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow user delegation

</td><td>

Option that lets users with assignments in this category have another user act on their behalf, using the platform delegation feature. This option is off by default.

 When selected, a user can name a delegate who can act on their Smart Assessments in this category during a set period. For more information, see [Delegation in Smart Assessment Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/delegation-in-sae.md).

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

General settings

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable quick edit

</td><td>

When enabled, allows users with the template\_manager role to modify published templates assigned to this category. Changes affect both ongoing and future assessments. When inactive \(default\), published templates are locked and can't be edited.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Inherit read access for embedded assessment

</td><td>

Option that enables read-access inheritance from a parent record to assessments triggered from templates in this category. When selected, assessments in this category inherit read access from the parent record in which they are embedded — a user must have both the Smart Assessment role required for the assessment and read access to the parent record to view the assessment.

 For more information on embedded assessments, see [Embedded assessments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/embedded-assessments.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Embedded assessment parent table

</td><td>

Table of the parent record from which assessments inherit read access. The trigger configuration for assessments in this category must pass the sys\_id of a record in this table when the assessment is created.

 This field appears only when **Inherit read access for embedded assessment** is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Access settings

</td></tr><tr><td>

Worknotes roles

</td><td>

Multi-select field that specifies which user roles can view and post work notes on questions in assessments associated with this template category.

 This field is empty by default and work notes are inactive. When the field is empty, only the assessment administrator can see the Work notes tab. Add one or more roles to enable work notes for users with those roles. Users without one of the configured roles don't see the Work notes tab.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Set defaults for templates

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable normalization

</td><td>

Automatically enables normalization when this category is assigned to an assessment template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Normalization strategies

</td><td>

Normalization strategies available. This field appears only when **Enable normalization** field is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default normalization strategy

</td><td>

Default normalization strategy for an assessment assigned with this category. This field appears only when **Enable normalization** field is selected.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Select **Submit**.

    The system generates the assessment template category and adds it to the list of categories that can be specified when designing an assessment template. Active categories are only available for use while categorizing templates.


## Result

The assessment template category is created and available for use when designing assessment templates.
