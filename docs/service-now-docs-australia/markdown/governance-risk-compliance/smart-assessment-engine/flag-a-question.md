# Flag or resolve a question

In SAE, flag a question on an assessment to indicate that it needs attention. After the response is updated, mark the question as resolved or remove the flag.

## Before you begin

Flagging is enabled for all roles by default. If the assessment administrator has configured the **Question flag roles** field on the template category, your user account must have one of the configured roles to change a question's flag state. For more information, see [Create an assessment template category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-category-create.md).

Role required: none.

## About this task

A question's flag has one of three states:

-   **Unflagged**

    No flag is set on the question. This is the default state for every question.

-   **Flagged**

    The question is marked as needing attention. The flag icon on the question card is highlighted.

-   **Resolved**

    The question was previously flagged and has been addressed. The flag icon shows the resolved state.


For more information, see [Collaboration in assessments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/collaboration-in-assessments.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your workspace and then to your list of assessments.

    Here’s an example of how to navigate to this list in the Compliance Workspace.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**.
    2.  Select the tasks icon \[Omitted image "list-icon.png"\] Alt text:.
    3.  Select the **Control attestations** &gt; **Smart Assessments** on the left panel.
    4.  The smart assessments list is displayed.
2.  Select the assessment in which you want to flag or resolve a question.

3.  Open the question that you want to flag, resolve, or unflag.

4.  Select the flag icon at the bottom of the question card to cycle the question state: **Unflagged** → **Flagged** → **Resolved** → **Unflagged**.

    The flag icon cycles the question through three states each time you select it: **Unflagged**, **Flagged**, and **Resolved**. The icon and tooltip update to reflect the current state.

    -   From **Unflagged**, the icon appears as an outline flag \[Omitted image "question-flag.png"\] Alt text:. Selecting it sets the question to **Flagged**.
    -   From **Flagged**, the icon appears as a filled flag \[Omitted image "question-flagged.png"\] Alt text:. Selecting it sets the question to **Resolved**.
    -   From **Resolved**, the icon appears as a check mark \[Omitted image "question-flag-resolved.png"\] Alt text:. Selecting it returns the question to **Unflagged**.

## Result

The question flag state is updated and visible to all collaborators on the assessment.

## What to do next

To focus your review on flagged questions, use the **Flagged** filter from the filter list. You can combine this filter with other filters, such as **Unanswered** or **With comments**, to narrow your view further. For details on the available filters and how to combine them, see [Filtering questions in an assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/filtering-questions-in-an-assessment.md).
