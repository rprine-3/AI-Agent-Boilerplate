# Add reference information to an assessment template

Add reference information to an assessment template so that assessors can access the information they need while responding to assessments by using the Smart Assessment Engine. With an assessment template, you can minimize the need for external references and can improve the efficiency of the assessment process.

## Before you begin

You must select one or more assessment targets as part of the assessment template. The assessment targets are the table records that are selected to be assessed — the assessment's scope items. For an explanation of scope items, including how they are set and where responders see them, see [Scope items in an assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-scope-items.md). For more information, see [Create an assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-create.md).

Role required: sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_manager or sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Open an assessment template for updates by either going to the landing page or when you create a template and save it.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Existing template**|On the Assessment Workspace landing page, select an existing template.|
    |**New template**|When you have created a template and select **Save**, the template opens on the **General** tab.|

    The Details page on the **General** tab displays the information that you provided to create the template.

2.  Select the **Questions** tab and then select **Add assessment reference**.

3.  In the **Card description** field, enter the text describing what information is being provided in the reference card.

4.  Select the **Assessment target** for the reference card.

    This table is referenced when populating the reference card with information. You can select fields that are available within the current assessment target \(application scope\) or dot walk to access fields from the assessment target's related tables. The **Assessment target** field is automatically filled in if only one **Assessment target** was selected for the template.

5.  In the **Available columns** section, select the fields that you want to be used to fill in the reference card.

    You can drag the field selections into any order in the **Select columns** section. The information appears in the same order in the reference card.

6.  Select **Add** and then **Save**.


## Result

The reference card is saved and available to assessors in the reference panel when they respond to the assessment.
