# Exploring Smart Assessment Engine

The ServiceNow®Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) helps you reduce the manual burden and costs of your assessment processes through automation.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Smart Assessment Engine Overview

## Smart Assessment Engine

In Governance, Risk, and Compliance \(GRC\) workflows such as compliance management, vendor risk management, privacy management, audit management, business continuity, and operational risk management, organizations face challenges in gathering input from employees and making informed decisions. Manual processes can be inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors, leading to increased operational costs and compliance risks.

SAE is designed to automate and optimize assessment processes, reducing manual efforts and costs. It provides an intuitive, configurable, and access-controlled assessment experience, enabling organizations to design and execute assessments seamlessly while ensuring compliance and efficiency. SAE is a versatile and business-friendly assessment engine that simplifies data collection, risk analysis, and compliance management. It supports a drag-and-drop template designer for effortless assessment creation and includes predefined roles to align with standard user personas. SAE ensures end-to-end workflow automation, post-assessment actions, and seamless collaboration.

By implementing SAE, organizations can streamline assessments, enhance accountability, and ensure regulatory compliance while optimizing overall efficiency. It enables organizations to track risks, maintain compliance, and improve decision-making through standardized evaluation processes.

</table>## Roles of SAE users

-   **Assessment actor**

    A user with the assessment actor \[sn\_smart\_asmt.actor\] role can respond to the assessments that are assigned to them. They can also reassign these assessments.

-   **Assessment reader**

    A user with the assessment reader \[sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_reader\] role can read the assessments within the categories that they’re assigned to. Additionally, they can read and comment on the assessments they created, and view and comment on the assessments that are generated from those templates.

    **Note:** The Assessment reader role field in the template determines the minimum user role that is required to view and comment on assessments. Only users with the specified role and the Assessment reader \[sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_reader\] role can access the assessments that are generated from this template.

-   **Assessment Admin**

    A user with the assessment admin \[sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin\] role can create, view, update, and delete both template categories and assessment templates. Additionally, the user with this role can view all the assessments, modify their states, reassign the assessments, and migrate the existing metric types to new assessment templates.

-   **Template reader**

    A user with the template reader \[sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_reader\] role can read specific assessment templates that are based on the categories mapped to the templates.

    **Note:** Each template must be mapped to one or more template category. A template reader must have this role to view the templates that are mapped with that category. A template reader must be able to access a template category to view the template.

-   **Template Manager**

    A user with the template manager \[sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_manager\] role can read, write, or create specific assessment templates that are based on the categories that are mapped to these templates. Their access to the template categories during the creation process is governed by the same rules that apply to the template readers.
