# Generate BCP reports in PDF or Microsoft Word format

Generate a PDF or Microsoft Word copy of a business continuity plan in the BCM Configurable Workspace and save it for a future reference.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.program\_manager, sn\_bcm.planner

## About this task

To format the PDF for your business needs, see [Format PDF templates for BIAs, BCPs, and Events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/update-pdf-format-for-bia-bcp-event.md).

Beginning with the Xanadu release, the content in PDFs of Business Impact Analyses, Plans, and Events is improved by implementing a new layout:

-   Arrange the various event tasks in a table format.
-   Include details of the asset owner and the description from the Business Impact Analysis.
-   Display a table that outlines the dependencies of the plan assets.
-   Mark the date of the PDF creation on the front page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Business Continuity Workspace**.

2.  In the List view, navigate to **Planning** and select any business continuity plan record that is in the **Review** or next state.

3.  Select **Generate PDF** in the form.

    The example shows the message that is displayed on the screen: `<Name of the BCP> PDF has been successfully generated for download.`

    The example shows the PDF of a business continuity plan.

    \[Omitted image "bcp-pdf-for-modification.png"\] Alt text: BCP PDF.

6.  Save the PDF on your system.

    You can save the PDF for future reference.

7.  To create the BCP report in Microsoft Word, select **Generate MS Word**.

    Generate a report of the BCP record in Microsoft Word format. The Microsoft Word copy of the BIA record is successfully generated that you can download.
