# Configure alert rules to display alerts in crisis map

Set alert rules to specify conditions under which a feed has to be bubbled up and displayed in the dashboard as an alert. You can also specify the conditions under which an alert is no longer valid and dismiss it from the dashboard.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.planner, sn\_bcm.program\_manager

## About this task

Configure an alert to notify the crisis manager of an impending danger, potential harm, or risk that can cause business disruption. Set up filter conditions to notify events or feeds that can happen within a boundary from the location of your assets.

Configuring an alert rule: Define simple conditions to evaluate an alert rule and determine the feed items that generate an alert. These alerts are displayed on the Crisis Management map.

-   **Feed condition filters**

    Use these filter conditions to set your rules for a feed alert. Filter conditions help you identify alerts that are critical to your business locations from the thousands of feeds you have subscribed to. Business locations can be corporate offices, employee locations, data centers, suppliers, and others.

-   **Advanced condition script filters**

    Use the advanced rules option to set a filter rule with a condition script. For example, you can set a condition based on the proximity of the crisis to your asset locations. You can also make the rule active.
