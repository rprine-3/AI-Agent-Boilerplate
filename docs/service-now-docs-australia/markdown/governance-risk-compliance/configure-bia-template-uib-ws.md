# Configure BIA templates with legacy assessment

Configure a business impact analysis \(BIA\) template in the Business Continuity Workspace with a legacy assessment. Select the type of elements, impact categories, and dependencies to be assessed. The legacy assessment uses the older method of selecting impact categories.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bcm.admin

## About this task

You can use the preconfigured BIA templates that are provided with the base system.

-   Application Technical Impact Assessment
-   BIA for Business processes
-   Business Process Impact Assessment
-   Business Service Impact Assessment
-   Data Center Analysis Template
-   Service Offering Impact Assessment
-   Workplace Impact Assessment

You can configure the BIA template with the legacy or Smart assessment. The Legacy Assessment shows only drop-down questions. The Smart Assessment enables multiple question types and configures RTO, RPO, and recovery tier calculations based on the responses to the questionnaire.
