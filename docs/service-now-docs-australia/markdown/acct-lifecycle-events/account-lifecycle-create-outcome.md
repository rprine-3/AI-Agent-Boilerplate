# Add a primary success outcome

Create a primary success outcome that can be used to measure the achievement of a success objective.

## Before you begin

Primary success outcomes are measurable components of success objectives. They’re both measurable and actionable. Progress can be tracked automatically using data collected by the Data Context Engine, or manually for outcomes that aren't easily tracked through metrics.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspace** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** and select the **List** icon.

2.  Navigate to the **Customer Success** &gt; **All Outcomes** and select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
