# Create a risk signal

Create a risk signal to identify any risk or issues that can occur during the engagement lifecycle.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent

## About this task

Risk Signals and Issues are used to record and manage risks associated with an engagement so that appropriate actions can be taken. Risks may have different degrees of severity and must be evaluated before they’re addressed. For example, an external system may flag missing information to the customer success manager who may address the issue using an internal play. If the risk is low in impact, the customer success manager may decide to accept the risk and proceed with the engagement. See [Define risk criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/acct-lifecycle-events/account-lifecycle-setup-risk-defn.md) for details.
