# Product and capability usage records

The product and capability usage records are automatically created and updated when changes occur in sold product configurations, capability mappings, or in the data context engine.

Product and capability usage records are created or updated when:

-   A record is added or modified in the Applicable Sold Products table. If product capability records for the sold product exist, corresponding capability usage records are created.
-   The Adoption score for a sold product is calculated. A Product Usage record is created for the sold product and the Adoption score field is updated.
-   A new active record is added to the Product Capability table. A capability usage record is created and the Total Capabilities in Use field is updated in the corresponding Product Usage record.
