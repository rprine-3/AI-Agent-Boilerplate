# Configure Zoom to create a touchpoint meeting summary

Set up the Zoom spoke integration and the bi-directional web hook to generate summaries for virtual touchpoint meetings.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_application\_admin

## Procedure

1.  To configure the Zoom spoke, follow the steps listed in [Set up the Zoom spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/setup-zoom.md).

    A token is generated for Zoom connectivity.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties**, edit the **sn\_acct\_lc.zoom\_integration\_user\_id** property, and specify the Zoom account User ID in the Name field.

    These steps enable you to generate a Zoom meeting link when you create a touchpoint meeting.

3.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zoom Spoke** &gt; **Zoom Webhook Validations** and select **New**.

4.  Enter the following details:

    -   Name: A unique name to identify the webhook validation record. For example, Zoom spoke webhook validation.
    -   Secret token: Secret token of the app in your Zoom account.
5.  Log in to your Zoom marketplace, open the General app, select **Access** &gt; **Event Subscriptions**.

6.  Add the **Meeting summary has been completed** event and specify the **Event notification endpoint URL**.

    The next step is to register a Zoom webhook in ServiceNow to track events occurring in Zoom.

7.  In your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Zoom Spoke** &gt; **Zoom Webhook Registries**.

8.  Select **New**.

9.  On the form, fill in the fields.
