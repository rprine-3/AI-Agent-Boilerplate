# Create an internal play

Create an internal play to define planned or unplanned activities that the customer does not have access to during the engagement lifecycle.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent

## About this task

An internal play is used to monitor internal activities that the customer does not have access to during the engagement lifecycle. For example, the renewal phase of a contract can be triggered 90-120 days before it is due to expire. This can launch a series of planned internal actions that can increase the chances of the contract being renewed or extended. An internal play can contain one or more sub-tasks and follows a playbook with predefined activities.
