# Create a customer success definition record

Define categories and subcategories for success play workflows.

## Before you begin

-   Define and configure the subflow that triggers the success workflow before starting.
-   Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.ale\_success\_play\_admin

## About this task

The customer success definition table controls what appears in the success play workflow. The category and sub-categories that appear in the success play correspond to a customer success definition record that matches the selected category. When you select a success play, the selected linked flow runs. The flow creates a record in the target table, triggers a playbook, or performs another action as specified in the subflow.

2.  Navigate to the **Customer Success** &gt; **Customer Success Definition** and select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
