13. Select **Create**.

    You will see a message indicating that the opportunity record has been created. You can login to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM platform to view this record.

    **Note:** You can create the record only if you have defined the mappings in the **DynamicsCRMMappingConstants** script include. See [Enable integration with Microsoft Dynamics CRM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/acct-lifecycle-events/account-lifecycle-crm-integration.md) for details. If the mappings have not been configured, you will see the recommended action but the **Create** option will not work.
