# Create a customer success choice record

Create a Customer Success Choice record to define a value for a dropdown or lookup field in the Customer Success Management application.

## Before you begin

## About this task

The customer success choice record defines the set of values that appear in the drop-down and lookup fields. Each choice record specifies a name and a category. The category determines the field in which the values are displayed.

For example, if you select the Category as **Service Bridge Integration**, and you create the following customer success choice records:

-   Onboarding
-   Foundation data sync
-   Remote catalog
-   Remote task

These will appear as choices in the Service bridge integration field on the Account Onboarding Case form.
