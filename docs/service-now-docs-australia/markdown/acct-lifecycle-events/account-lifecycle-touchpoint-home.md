# Touchpoint home page

During the engagement lifecycle, customer success agents schedule regular touchpoints with customers to evaluate progress, provide feedback, and offer guidance.

Touchpoints enhance communication between customer success teams and customer throughout the engagement lifecycle. Regular touchpoints ensure that the internal and external teams are aligned on the objectives and outcomes of the engagement.

Internal touchpoints ensure that only internal teams are involved in that particular touchpoint.
