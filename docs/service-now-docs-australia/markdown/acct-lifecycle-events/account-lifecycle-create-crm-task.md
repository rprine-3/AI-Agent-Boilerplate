# Create a task in Microsoft Dynamics CRM

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Success** &gt; **All Risks and Issues**.

    A new task is created in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM platform. The details of the account, engagement, and contracts associated with the risk record are displayed.

    **Note:** If you modify or update Priority or Status fields in the task that was created, the updates are displayed as worknotes in your ServiceNow instance.

    Worknotes are displayed if you have configured:

    -   The Microsoft Dynamics CRM update mechanism \(so that Microsoft Dynamics CRM can access the Microsoft Dynamics spoke webhook\) when the configured event occurs in the task table.

        -   Webhook \(Dynamics Webhook Callbacks\)
