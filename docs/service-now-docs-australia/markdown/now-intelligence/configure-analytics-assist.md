# Activate the data visualization generation skill

Give users generative AI capabilities for creating data visualizations from the ServiceNow Otto panel by activating the data visualization generation skill.

## Before you begin

The data visualization generation skill is included in Generative AI Controller, which is in most ServiceNow Otto® applications from the ServiceNow® Store.

The Query Generation skills "analytics query generation" and "analytics insight generation" are required. To support queries on indicator data, the Query Generation skill "analytics query generation for indicators" is required. These skills are active by default. For more information, see [Query Generation skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/enable-query-generation.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **Skills**.

2.  In the product area pane, select **Data and Analytics** &gt; **Analytics**.

3.  In AI skills for Analytics, search for the data visualization generation skill.

    \[Omitted image "nowass-data-viz-gen-skill.png"\] Alt text: AI Skills tab of AI Admin Hub, showing the Data visualization generation skill under Data and Analytics.

4.  To see information about the skill, select **View details**.

    The information includes the following details:

    -   A description of the skill
    -   Key benefits
    -   Dependencies and other recommended skills, if applicable
5.  Select **Turn on**.

6.  In the **User access - Access Control List \(ACL\)** page, you can add roles who can use this skill.

    By default, the now.assist.creator.analytics and now\_assist\_analytics\_generation roles have these rights. Think carefully before making any changes.

    All **Analytics** skills have this option. The data visualization skill and Query Generation skills should have one role in common. Note that both default data visualization generation roles contains the sn\_query\_gen.user role, which is the default role for Query Generation skills.

    After installation, you can return to the AI Admin Hub and change role access for the skill. Select **Edit Configuration** on the tile for an activated skill to reopen the **User access - Access Control List \(ACL\)** page.


## Result

If the skill was successfully activated, the system notifies you.
