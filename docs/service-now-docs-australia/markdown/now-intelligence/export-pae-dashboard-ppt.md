# Export a Platform Analytics dashboard

Export a Platform Analytics experience dashboard to PDF or Microsoft PowerPoint.

## Before you begin

Role required: Any, as long as the user has access to the dashboard.

**Note:**

-   This task only applies to dashboards created in the inline editor. Technical dashboards don't have the **Export** option in the **More actions** menu. For more information, see [Technical dashboards compared to inline dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/technical-vs-in-line-dashboards.md).
-   Dashboards can be exported only as PowerPoint and PDF, however, in a dashboard some of the data visualizations can't be exported, as shown in the following table:

<table id="table_rfj_tf5_zjc"><thead><tr><th>

File type

</th><th>

Supported DV type

</th><th>

Unsupported DV type

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

PDF

</td><td>

-   Pivot tables
-   Lists
-   Other data visualizations


</td><td>

-   Calendar reports
-   Indicator scorecards
-   Geomap
-   Non-data visualization dashboard elements, like Headings


</td></tr><tr><td>

PowerPoint \(PPT\)

</td><td>

-   Pivot tables
-   Other data visualizations


</td><td>

-   Calendar reports
-   Indicator scorecards
-   Geomap
-   Non-data visualization dashboard elements, like Headings


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>-   Only the supported data visualizations and Lists are exported, not Headings or Rich Text or any other element.
-   Content is not necessarily exported in the order it appears on the dashboard.
-   Because the length of a list can't be predicted, list visualizations are intentionally placed at the end of exported PDFs.
-   Depending on your entitlements, you may be able export a dashboard conversationally through the ServiceNow Otto panel. See [Export dashboards and data visualizations from the ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/export-db-dv-now-assist-panel.md).
-   Dashboards exported to PowerPoint include the title above and the description below each visualization in an editable format if this information is provided in the source visualization.

-   You can also export individual data visualizations from a dashboard to a PNG or JPEG file. For more information, see [Download a data visualization from a dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/export-data-vis-from-dboard.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Select the dashboard that you want to export.

3.  Select the dashboard's **More actions** menu \[Omitted image "csm-ws-dashboards-more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More action icon and choose **Export**.

    \[Omitted image "export-pae-db-menu-option.png"\] Alt text: More actions menu with Export item highlighted

4.  In **File type**, select PDF or PowerPoint.

5.  If you're exporting to PDF, specify the page format and orientation.

    **Note:** For PowerPoint, the export creates a separate slide for each visualization in the dashboard, not one slide for each tab on the dashboard.

6.  Set the following options:

<table id="table_vxw_nnz_d2c"><thead><tr><th>

Option

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Export all tabs

</td><td>

If the dashboard has more than one tab, you can select whether to export them all or only a subset.Default: On

</td></tr><tr><td>

Export all visualizations in the top layout

</td><td>

If the dashboard has more than one tab and you aren't exporting all of the tabs, you can set whether to export any visualizations that are in the layout outside the tabs.\[Omitted image "db-top-level-layout-mini.png"\] Alt text: Dashboard with visualizations in a tab and in the top layout.

Only the supported data visualizations and Lists \(PDF\) are exported in the top layout. Headings, Rich Text, and other element aren't supported.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select tabs

</td><td>

If you aren't exporting all tabs, select which tabs to export.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Export with applied filters

</td><td>

You can select whether to apply to the export any values that have been set in filters on the dashboard. For example, say your dashboard has an Incident Category filter and a single-score visualization showing the number of incidents. With nothing chosen in the filter, the visualization shows 6884 incidents. With the Software category chosen in the filter, it shows only 5278 incidents. Now you export the dashboard with Software chosen in the filter. If **Export with applied filters** is on, the slide for that visualization shows 5278 incidents; with it turned off, it shows 6884.Default: On

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>7.  Choose the delivery method, **Download file** or **Send via email**.

    |Delivery method|Result|
    |---------------|------|
    |Download file|When the export is complete, you're prompted to download the export.|
    |Send via email|Choose the users to send it to. You can select only users on your instance. Security constraints may restrict who you can email. You must specify a subject, and you can add a message.|

8.  Select **Export**.


## Result
