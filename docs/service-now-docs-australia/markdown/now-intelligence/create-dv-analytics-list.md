# Create a list visualization in the Visualization Designer

Create a list of table records that can be drilled down to from chart interactions. List visualizations display table data in columns. By default, the columns match the default list view of the table.

## Before you begin

Role required: Anyone with access to data can create a visualization of that data on any dashboard that they can edit. Users with the itil, report\_user, admin, or viz\_creator role can create a visualization in the Visualization Designer. When you create a visualization in the Visualization Designer, it is saved to the Library. For more information on access, see [Report\_view access control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/report-view-access-control.md) and [Platform Analytics roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/platform-analytics-roles.md).

## About this task

**Warning:** If you want to modify the selection of columns, first save the List visualization. Otherwise, the default columns are removed from the List. Ignore this warning if you do not want to keep any of the default columns. If you do not have the latest Platform Analytics bundle installed, you must add the default columns manually instead of just saving the visualization.

In the Zurich release, this List replaces the simple list visualization. Upon migration, all simple lists are migrated to the new List.

**Note:**

-   You can include Spotlight information in a list visualization. Configure the list to display information from the Spotlight \[spotlight\] table. For more information, see [Spotlights on Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/spotlight/spotlights-configurable-workspaces.md). For general information about the Spotlight feature, see [Ranking records with Spotlight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/spotlight/spotlight.md).
-   It is not possible to configure auto refresh on the List visualization. To refresh a List visualization on a dashboard, select the More Options icon \[Omitted image "icon-vert-3dot-p.png"\] Alt text: Context menu icon and choose **Refresh**.
-   The option to show the total number of records is not available in the new List visualization.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**, or open an in-line dashboard and select **Edit**.

2.  Select **Create data visualization**.

3.  Select the List \(\[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: List visualization icon\) visualization type from the category labeled **Other**.

4.  Select **Add data source**.

5.  Select a table, using either the dropdown list or the Search sources box.

    You can only select Table data sources, such as the Incident \[incident\] table.

    The list of records for that table appears. It is populated with a default selection of columns depending on the default view of the selected table. You can change the columns in the Columns and rows section. Save the List before changing the column selection.

6.  Configure the **Header and border**. Header and border options are the same for all data sources.

    |Header and border fields|Description|
    |------------------------|-----------|
    |Show header|The visualization header, including title and icons.|
    |Show header separator|Option to display a line separating the header from the rest of the component.|
    |Chart title|Title of the visualization.|
    |Description|A short overview about the visualization that the end user sees. Descriptions help users find the visualization.|
    |Wrap title|Option to wrap long titles onto a second line. If false, displays an ellipsis to truncate long titles.|
    |Show border|Option to display a line around the component.|
    |Bare|Option to remove padding around data visualization to provide more compact positioning on the page. Only available when **Show border** is turned off.|
    |Header background color|Specify the color behind the title of the visualization.|
    |Title color|Specify the text color. The default title color is black, but you can choose a color that contrasts better with the header background.|

7.  Configure the data fields.

<table id="table_list-data"><thead><tr><th>

Data fields

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="group-by-heading"><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Group by

</td></tr><tr id="row_group-by-field"><td>

Group by \(optional\)

</td><td>

The field to group by. For example, in a visualization of incident data grouped by **Assignment group**, all incidents that belong to Software, Service Desk, and Network are placed in separate groups. If the table contains variables or question fields, you have the option to group by one of them at the end of the list of fields.**Note:**

-   It is not possible to group or stack data by the **Tags** field, or by certain field types, such as MEDIUMTEXT.
-   For fields with continuous values, such as date or integer, values are automatically grouped according to any report ranges defined for the data. For more information, see [Report ranges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_ReportRanges.md).


</td></tr><tr id="alternative-group-by"><td>

Add alternative group by

</td><td>

This selection opens a dialog in which you select additional items that the data in the visualization may be grouped by. The viewer of the visualization can then select which of these items to group the data by. The viewer toggles the visibility of the selector in the visualization's More actions menu. In the additional items dialog, you can set whether this selector is visible by default by toggling **Selector visible by default**.If you select a value in **Group by**, that is the default group-by value. You do not have to select a **Group by** value to specify alternative group-by values. In this case, no default group-by value is used.

For more information about the viewer experience selecting from alternative group-by values, see [Select a group-by value in a data visualization as a viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/select-group-runtime.md).

**Important:**

-   Only up to three metrics on one visualization support alternative group-by.
-   Alternative group-by does not support data binding on the data source

You can create a list visualization with variables columns based on a data source or table that has variables associated with it. For example, if an item has a variable called **Storage**, you can create a list report that has a column for the values in this variable.
-   **[Column filters in list components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/column-filters-in-lists.md)**  
If column filters are activated, viewers of a List can filter the list by the contents of individual columns. Filter options depend on the column type.
