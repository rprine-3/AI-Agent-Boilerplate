# Add the ServiceNow Otto context menu to an in-line dashboard

Use the ServiceNow Otto context menu to enable ServiceNow Otto skills to be displayed directly in the dashboard.

## Before you begin

Role required: Any user with an internal role can add the context menu to an inline dashboard.

## About this task

By default there is a ServiceNow Otto context menu added to the dashboard configured with the role sn\_pa\_aia\_insights.summary\_user. This role enables users to generate AI-powered summaries from dashboard data. You can add additional context menu elements and configure these with other AI skills.

-   Results apply only to the tab the context menu element is placed on. Results apply to the entire dashboard when the element is placed above the tabs.
-   Any applied filters on the dashboard are taken into account in the summary output.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Select [Create a dashboard with the in-line editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-db-in-ac.md) or open the dashboard you want to add the context menu to.

3.  Expand **Add New Element**.

4.  Select the **ServiceNow Otto context menu** element.

5.  Place the element where you want it on the dashboard.

6.  Associate a ServiceNow Otto context menu skill with the element.

    1.  Select the **Dashboard Summary** element that you added.

    2.  In the Configuration panel, select the magnifier icon \[Omitted image "magnifier-zoom.png"\] Alt text: Magnify zoom icon. for the skill configuration.

    3.  Select the skill you want to add.

        **Note:** Not all skills on the resulting list are configured for the **ServiceNow Otto context menu** element. Only the skills configured on the Par\_dashboard table are appropriate for this element.
