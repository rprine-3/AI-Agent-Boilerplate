# Disabling KPI Signals

KPI Signals can be disabled on request.

KPI Signals is activated by default. If you do not want this feature, request a ServiceNow AI Platform administrator to set the property **com.snc.pa.activate\_kpi\_signals** to **false**. Because this property does not exist by default, the administrator must add it. You can refer them to [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).

**Important:** If you reactivate KPI Signals, signal detection resumes from the time you originally deactivated the feature, not from the time you reactivated it.
