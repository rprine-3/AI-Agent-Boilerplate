# Platform Analytics dashboard roles

Platform Analytics dashboards have few role restrictions. Editing rights are granted by sharing, independent of role.

Users with any role can create dashboards and share them with groups, users, and roles. These users can share a dashboard that has been shared with them if sharing rights were also granted. They can pass along editing rights if granted.

The dashboard\_admin role allows a user to configure, edit, or delete any dashboards, regardless of ownership or editing rights. Certain configuration tasks also require dashboard\_admin, as described in [Configuring dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/configuring-dashboards.md).

Tasks that integrate dashboards with Process Mining require the sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst role. These tasks are listed in [Configuring dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/configuring-dashboards.md).

Users with the analytics\_categories\_admin role can create, edit, or delete dashboard categories.
