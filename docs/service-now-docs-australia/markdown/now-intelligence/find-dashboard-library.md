# Dashboards in the library

Use Platform Analytics dashboards to access, organize, and share data in a visual format. Dashboards contain data visualizations, filters, and other visual elements.

## Dashboards overview

On Australia instances, you can find both Core UI dashboards and Platform Analytics experience dashboards in the Dashboards library.

To find dashboards in Platform Analytics, navigate to the [library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/dashboards-glossary.md) at **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**. You can also navigate to this library from other Platform Analytics library pages.

Library pages like this one include a navigation pane that provides access to the other libraries and the Usage Insights page. Use it to navigate between the libraries without interrupting your workflow.

The configuration of the Dashboards page and the data access depends on the user roles. Users without an admin role have limited capabilities, as compared to the users with an admin role. For more information on the types of admin roles in Platform Analytics, see [Platform Analytics roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/platform-analytics-roles.md). To know more about the dashboards for users with the admin roles, see [Dashboards for analytics admins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/dashboards-for-admin-users.md).

For users without an admin role, the navigation pane provides a direct access only to the [Dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/find-dashboard-library.md), [Data Visualizations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/explore-data-vis-library.md), and [Indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/your-kpis.md) from the Platform Analytics library.

For information on role-based access for the left navigation pane and Platform Analytics overview page, see [Roles applicable for Platform Analytics overview page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md).

The following example shows what a user can see in the Platform Analytics Dashboards library for users without an admin role.
