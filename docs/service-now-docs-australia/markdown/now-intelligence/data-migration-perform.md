# Perform full data migration

Migrate your existing dashboards, reports, interactive filters, and Performance Analytics widgets to the Platform Analytics experience.

## Before you begin

Role required: To perform the full migration and activate Platform Analytics experience: admin. Users with other admin roles \(pa\_admin, report\_admin, and dashboard\_admin\) have access to the Migration Center to evaluate the migration.

## About this task

This topic assumes that your instance is not a net new Xanadu, Yokohama, Zurich or Australia instance. The Migration Center is only available on upgrading instances.

Run and test the migration on a single, non-production instance. After you’re satisfied with the results of a full test migration, launch the migration on the production instance. Select **Try your content** to test the output on a limited number of dashboards.

**Note:**

You cannot use update sets to move the migrated material from a non-production instance to a production instance. Test the migration on the non-production instance and then use Migration Center functionality to migrate the production instance.

If you change a Core UI dashboard after migration and migrate it again, the changed dashboard overwrites the originally migrated dashboard.

If you change a report, and perform full data migration again, the changed Core UI report overwrites the originally migrated content, and any changes you have made to the associated Platform Analytics experience visualization. Changed Core UI reports do not overwrite changes when you perform a partial migration of Core UI dashboards.

Dashboards migrated in compatibility mode may experience performance issues.

Migrated dashboards appear in the Platform Analytics library. Links to the original Core UI dashboards redirect to the library as well.

Reports associated with chart to chart drilldown are saved to the Visualization Library.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics** &gt; **Migration Center**.

2.  Review the information about the migration process under Learn about Platform Analytics experience.

    The tabs provide more information about the migration process and what you can expect from Platform Analytics.

3.  Select **Start moving** to migrate all of your content.

    The length of the migration process depends on the number of dashboards, reports, filters, and Performance Analytics widgets you have on your instance.

4.  Select **Prevent users from creating Core UI analytics during migration**.

    New Core UI analytics content may need to be migrated at a later time.

5.  Select **Migrate** to start the migration process.

6.  [Evaluate the results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/data-migration-evaluate.md).

7.  Select **Activate** to complete the migration process.

    The newly migrated content is not available in the Platform Analytics experience until you select **Activate**. Any menu item previously connected to Core UI dashboards and reports automatically redirects to the new migrated version.


## Result

Your dashboards and other migrated content are now found under the library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library**.
