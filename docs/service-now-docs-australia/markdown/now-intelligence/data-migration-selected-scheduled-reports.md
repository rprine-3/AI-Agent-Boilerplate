# Migrate a selection of scheduled Core UI reports

Migrate a selection of scheduled reports to the Platform Analytics experience Scheduled export.

## Before you begin

Role required: report\_admin or report\_scheduler

## About this task

The underlying reports in the scheduled export are migrated to the Platform Analytics library. The original scheduled report is labeled Active=False.

**Note:** You cannot use update sets to move the migrated material from a non-production instance to a production instance. Test the migration on the non-production instance and then use Migration Center functionality to migrate the production instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to `sysauto_report.list`.

2.  On the Scheduled Email of Reports list, select the scheduled reports you want to migrate.

3.  From the **Action on selected rows** menu, choose **Migrate Scheduled Report**.

    If any of the reports are not compatible, you’ll see the message `Migrating X of Y scheduled reports`.\[Omitted image "data-migration-mig-sched-reports.png"\] Alt text: Scheduled report list with two reports highlighted as well as the Migrate Scheduled Report link on the Actions on selected rows menu

4.  When the migration is complete, select the banner link to view the migrated reports in the Platform Analytics Scheduled exports library.


## What to do next

Edit the migrated scheduled export as needed. For more information, see [Export a data visualization from the Visualization Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/export-visualization-vd.md).
