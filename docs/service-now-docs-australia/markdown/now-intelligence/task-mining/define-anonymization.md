**Note:** You can't add new anonymization configuration records.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Task Mining Workspace**.

2.  Select the Configuration icon \[Omitted image "task-mining-configuration-icon.png"\].

4.  Select the anonymization configuration record that you want to modify.

    The available records are:

    -   **Event Field Replacement Value**

    -   **Minimum level of anonymization**
