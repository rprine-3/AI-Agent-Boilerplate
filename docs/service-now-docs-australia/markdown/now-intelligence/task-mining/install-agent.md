# Install the Task Mining agent

The Task Mining agent is a service installed on workstations that logs certain events from desktop applications.

Role required: Task Mining Agent Install

**Note:** You must be a part of the Task Mining Agent Install group with roles itil, sn\_tm\_core.service\_user, and agent\_client\_collector\_admin to install the Task Mining agent. If the group doesn't exist, create a group with that name and those roles manually. For more information, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).

The process to install a Task Mining agent is as follows:

1.  A data request is submitted by a Task Mining analyst or power user.

    When a Task Mining adds a workstation user to a Task Mining project, a data request is sent to all managers of every workstation user. For more information, see [Add workstation users to a Task Mining project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/task-mining/add-users-to-task-mining-project.md).

2.  The manager approves the request.

    When the manager approves the data log request, the Task Mining agent can be installed. For more information, see [Approve workspace user data collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/task-mining/approve-workspace-user-log-requests.md).

3.  Installation is performed by an IT or security user who is a part of the Task Mining Agent Install group with admin rights on the target workstation.

    -   [Install the Task Mining Portable Windows agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/task-mining/install-task-mining-portable-agent.md)
    **Note:** Use the standard Windows Agent unless instructed otherwise. The Portable Windows agent is only designed for users in a proof of concept state and shouldn’t be used in production.

4.  Workstation users are notified about workstation monitoring.
