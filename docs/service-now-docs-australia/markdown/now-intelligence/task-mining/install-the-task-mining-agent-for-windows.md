# Install the Task Mining agent for Windows

Install the Task Mining desktop agent on Windows workstations using the installation wizard. Convert the agent installer to `.intunewin` format and deploy it to managed Windows devices through the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## Before you begin

Role required: Task Mining Agent Install

**Note:** You must be a part of the Task Mining Agent Install group with roles itil, sn\_tm\_core.service\_user, and agent\_client\_collector\_admin to install the Task Mining agent. If the group doesn't exist, create a group with that name and those roles manually. For more information, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).

You have access to the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## About this task

The Task Mining agent for Windows can be installed interactively using the installation wizard or silently from the command line. Both methods require a **Registration key** and **Instance URL** obtained from the Agent Installation page.

Deploying the Task Mining agent using Microsoft Intune involves converting the installer to `.intunewin` format using the Win32 Content Prep Tool, then configuring and deploying the application through the Intune admin center.

## Procedure

1.  Obtain the **Instance URL** and **Registration key**.

    The instance URL and registration key values are the same for Windows and macOS agents.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Task Mining** &gt; **Agent Installation**.

    2.  Select an existing key or create one.

    3.  Copy the **Instance URL** and **Registration key** on the Agent Installation page.

    \[Omitted image "tm-agent-4.png"\] Alt text: Screenshot of instance URL and registration key.

2.  Install the Windows agent by running the script.

    1.  Select the **Windows** tab on the **Agent Installation** page.

    2.  Select **Copy** next to **Download and Install** to collect the one-line installation script.

        \[Omitted image "tm-agent-6.png"\] Alt text: Screenshot of Windows command line.

    3.  Open Windows **PowerShell** as an administrator.

    4.  Paste the script and press **Enter**.

    5.  Verify the instance URL, registration key, and installation destination, and select **Install**.

    The script downloads the installer, runs it with the instance URL and registration key, and reports whether installation succeeded or failed.

    The installer performs the following actions:

    -   Extracts application files to `C:\Program Files\ServiceNow\tm-agent` \(default\).
    -   Creates the **Task Mining Agent** \(`TaskMiningAgent`\) system service.
    -   Creates a folder for global configuration and logs at `C:\ProgramData\ServiceNow\tm-agent`.
    -   Creates a folder for gathered data and user-level logs at `C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\ServiceNow\tm-agent`.
    -   Writes to the Windows Registry at:
        -   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Task Mining Agent x.x.x.x`
        -   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TaskMiningAgent`
    **Note:** For a manual install, download the .exe by selecting **Download**, then install it manually either by running the .exe to start the installation wizard, or by using this command line: `tm-agent-setup-3.0.0.x.exe /S /INSTANCEURL="enter-instance-url" /REGKEY="enter-registration-key"`

3.  Download `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` from the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool GitHub repository and save it to a known location.

4.  Convert the agent installer to `.intunewin` format.

    1.  Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder containing `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`.

    2.  Run `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`.

    3.  Enter the following values:

        -   **Source folder**: the folder containing the agent package \(for example, `C:\Temp\Task Mining Agent\Package`\).
        -   **Setup file**: `Deploy-Application.exe`.
        -   **Output folder**: the destination for the `.intunewin` file \(for example, `C:\Temp\Task Mining Agent\Intune File`\).
        -   **Catalog folder**: `N` \(No\).
    When conversion reaches 100%, `Deploy-Application.intunewin` is created in the output folder.

5.  In the Intune admin center, navigate to **Apps** &gt; **All Apps** &gt; **Create**.

6.  Select **Windows app \(Win32\)** as the app type.

7.  Upload the package file.

    1.  Select **Select app package file**.

    2.  Upload `Deploy-Application.intunewin` and select **OK**.

    3.  Update the **Name**, **Version**, **Publisher**, and **Description** fields.

    4.  Select **Select image** to add a logo and browse to the logo file.

8.  Configure the program settings, then select **Next**.

    -   **Install command**: `Deploy-Application.exe -DeploymentType "Install"`
    -   **Uninstall command**: `Deploy-Application.exe -DeploymentType "Uninstall"`
    -   **Device restart behavior**: **No specific action**
9.  Specify the device requirements, then select **Next**.

    -   **Operating system architecture**: 64-bit
    -   **Minimum OS version**: Windows 10 21H1 \(or as per your organizational policy\)
10. Configure the detection rules.

    1.  From the **Rules format** list, select **Manually configure detection rules** and select **+ Add**.

    2.  From the **Rule type** list, select **Registry**.

    3.  Enter the following values:

        -   **Key path**: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CSE\Packages\Servicenow_TaskMiningAgent_2024.1.99`
        -   **Value name**: `Installed`
        -   **Detection method**: String Comparison
        -   **Operator**: Equals
        -   **Value**: `True`
    4.  Select **OK**, then select **Next**.

11. Configure dependencies, supersedence rules, or scope tags, or select **Next** through these pages.

12. Choose the deployment method, then select **Next**.

    -   **Available for enrolled devices**: users install the app from the Company Portal.
    -   **Required**: the app installs automatically on targeted devices or for specific user groups.
    **Important:** Test the deployment with a pilot group before rolling it out to a larger organization.

13. Review all settings, then select **Create**.


## Result

Check the Notifications section for upload progress. Once the package is uploaded, the application is ready for deployment.

## What to do next

Verify the deployment by opening the company portal on a target device, search for Task Mining Agent, and check the installation status.
