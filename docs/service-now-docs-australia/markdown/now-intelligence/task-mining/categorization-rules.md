# Categorization rule form in Task Mining

Organize and add context to your data by grouping similar workstation activities with user-friendly category names. Categorization rules have a fixed order value that determines how information from apps and windows is shown on an analysis.

For information about categorization, see [Categorize workstation activities to simplify analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/task-mining/define-default-categorization-rules.md).

You build the conditions for a rule in the **Conditions** section of the **Create rule** or **Edit rule** panel. A condition is a combination of a field, an operator, and a value. Combine conditions with **and** and **or** logic, and apply more than one condition to the same field.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Application Name|Matches the file name of the application, for example, ms-teams.exe.|
|Window Name|Matches the window title captured for the activity.|
|URL|Matches the URL captured for the activity.|

|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Equals|The activity value matches the entered value exactly.|
|Contains|The activity value contains the entered value anywhere in the text.|
|Starts with|The activity value begins with the entered value.|
|Ends with|The activity value ends with the entered value.|
