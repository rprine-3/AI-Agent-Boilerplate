# Integration with Automation Center

Create automation requests for your tasks directly from Task Mining. Capture both steps and desktop actions automation properties in a single recording session, instead of recording the same process twice. When a Task Mining analyst submits an automation request, the recording is delivered to the automation team with all UI properties needed to build desktop actions.

You must install and configure the Automation Center plugin before using the integration. To use the ServiceNow Otto feature in the integration, you must install ServiceNow Otto for Platform and activate the User Task Step Summarization skill. For more information, see [Install Automation Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/install-automation-center.md).

## Building desktop automations

Submitting an automation request from Task Mining is the entry point to building a complete desktop automation. Automatically convert desktop processes into executable AI agents: capture the task \(desktop processes\) in Task Mining, create desktop actions \(automation blocks\) and AI agent in Automation Center, and test and deploy the AI agent in AI Agent Studio.

For more information, see [Building desktop automations from Task Mining data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/better-together/creating-desktop-actions-tm-ac.md).

## Initiate an automation request from the Task timeline analysis

1.  As a Task Mining analyst, you create a Task Mining project with a Task timeline analysis as a Mining analysis goal. For more information, see [Create a Task Mining project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/task-mining/create-task-mining-projects.md). You group user actions as a task to provide data for the analysis. For more information, see [Define user actions for task logging](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/task-mining/mine-data.md).
2.  Run a mining job on the Task Mining project to generate the Task timeline analysis of your project data.
3.  Go to the project's Task timeline analysis, and select a task to see a detailed list of the steps of the task.
4.  Create a copy that you use for automation without affecting the original. In the duplicate task, edit any of these steps if you want to change task details.
5.  When you're ready, select Take action and select the Request automation improvement action.
6.  Fill out the Automation Center Create New Automation Request form. Use the Generate details option to populate the description and detailed sequence of steps fields.

    **Note:** The generate details option is available only if ServiceNow Otto for Platform is installed and the User Task Step Summarization skill is activated.
