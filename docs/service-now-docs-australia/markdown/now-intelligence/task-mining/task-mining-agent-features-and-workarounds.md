# Task Mining agent

The Task Mining agent is a service installed on a user's workstation that captures workstation logs for active windows only. Task Mining agent user-initiated recording supports mouse actions, hotkeys, and authentication integrations.

Certain user interactions aren't captured automatically.

**For workstation users:** Use mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts instead of drag-and-drop or trackpad scrolling so that all interactions are accurately recorded.

**For Task Mining analysts:** Expect agent UI events in your Task Mining data. Plan for manual filtering or post-processing steps to exclude them. You can also use workarounds to capture equivalent data for processes affected by these limitations.

## Unsupported features and workarounds

This table describes these limitations and provides practical workarounds.

|Limitation|Workaround|
|----------|----------|
|Drag-and-drop interactions aren't captured|Document the sequence of individual clicks and keyboard modifiers that achieve the same result|
|Tab navigation accuracy is limited on some browser-based applications|Document navigation using mouse clicks instead of keyboard tab sequences|
|Task Mining agent UI events can't be automatically excluded from recordings|Filter agent events manually during analysis or apply filters during post-processing|
|Duplicate actions aren't automatically removed|Review recordings and filter duplicate actions manually|
|Trackpad gesture-based scrolling is not detected|Use a traditional scroll wheel or keyboard navigation instead|
