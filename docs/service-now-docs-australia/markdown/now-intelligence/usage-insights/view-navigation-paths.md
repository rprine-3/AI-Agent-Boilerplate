# Navigation paths

Navigation paths enable you to quickly understand and isolate users' journeys through your web or mobile application. Assess the most and least common navigation paths your users take and how you can improve them.

Navigation paths give insights into the paths users follow from a root screen. These can help you:

-   Identify user journeys that show user confusion, for example, navigation back and forth between two screens.
-   Identify critical journeys that end prematurely.
-   Understand the effect of pop-ups on user navigation.

A navigation path shows the frequency of specific, ordered paths within the application, enabling you to see the most common paths that users take. Each screen can appear multiple times within a navigation path.

**Note:** Navigation path data is sampled to 15% by default. Toggle **Use data sampling** off to analyze the full data set.

## Viewing and interacting with a navigation path

The Navigation Paths screen shows an initial visualization which contains data for all screens contained in the selected application. Each circle on the visualization represents a navigation level, and shows the numbers of navigations from the previous screen, up to five levels. You can choose whether to display the visualization with analytics for **All Users**, **New** users, or **Returning** users.

You can interact with a navigation path in these ways.

Select **Add Filter** to add filters to the current session that are appropriate to the application you're analyzing.The **User type** filter enables you to select New or Returning. Clear the selection to show analytics for all users.

Change the root screen several ways:-   Choose a start screen from the list labeled **Navigation path analysis starting with**.
-   Select any node and select it a second time to make that node the root.

Choose Session start from the **Navigation path analysis starting with** list to return to the full navigation path analysis.
