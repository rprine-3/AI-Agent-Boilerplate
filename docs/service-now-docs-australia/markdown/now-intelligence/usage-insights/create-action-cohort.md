# Create a cohort

Define the predetermined sequence of actions a group of users complete so you can track conversion rates at each step.

## Before you begin

Role required: Users with the analytics\_viewer, portal\_analytics\_viewer, mobile\_analytics\_viewer, core\_ui\_analytics\_viewer, now\_experience\_analytics\_viewer roles can create, edit and delete cohorts for the applications they have access to.

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Usage Insights**.

2.  From the Applications list, select the application to create a cohort for.

3.  Select **Analysis** &gt; **Cohort Analysis**.

4.  Select the Create new cohort button \(\[Omitted image "uxa-create-cohort-button.png"\] Alt text: Create new cohort button\).

5.  Enter a name and a description for the process you want to measure.

6.  Select two step types and their values and select **Add**.

    The step types are:

    -   Visited a Screen
    -   Triggered an Event
    -   Performed an Action
    -   Started any Session

    The actions are dependent on the step type.

7.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

View the cohort to see how many of the users who performed the first defined action returned to perform the second action. When you view the cohort, you can filter on Aggregation, Date range, User type, Country, and add filters as necessary.
