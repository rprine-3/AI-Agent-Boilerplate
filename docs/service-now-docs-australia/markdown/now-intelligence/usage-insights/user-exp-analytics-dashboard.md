# Navigating the Usage Insights application

Understand how to navigate the Usage Insights application, including the **All Applications** and individual application views.

Users with any Usage Insights viewer role can access the application by navigating to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Usage Insights**.

Different users have different rights and privileges in the Usage Insights application. For more information, see [Roles installed with Usage Insights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/usage-insights/components-installed-user-exp-analytics.md).

## All Applications view

When you launch Usage Insights, there are two tabs: Overview and Events. The Overview tab allows you to view aggregate usage within a given time frame across all of your tracked applications. There are a number of filters you can configure to see scores for Active users, Sessions, and Average session duration, as well as a list showing usage by individual application. The Events tab enables you to filter a list of tracked user interactions across enabled Usage Insights applications.

## Metrics across all applications

You can view basic application usage and event details for all applications within an instance. Select **All Applications** from the applications list to see these metrics simultaneously.\[Omitted image "uxa-overview-all-apps-australia.png"\] Alt text: See basic metrics for all applications within an instance
