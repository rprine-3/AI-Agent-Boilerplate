# Viewing user analytics

The Users page within the Data Foundation module enables views of individual user journeys through your applications, from their first session to the most recent within the defined date range.

View user analytics and behavior, including taps and swipes, and other timeline actions. Select the users that you want to see, set filters, and drill down into individual user sessions for closer insights.

## Active users breakdown analysis

You can view a breakdown analysis of active users by grouping them according to country, state, device type, hourly usage, and so on. The Geographic Analytics visualization, which was available until the Xanadu release, has been replaced by this analysis Breakdown.

## Filter options

You can filter the Users list by date range, User type, and Country by default. Using the **Add filter** option, you can filter on Locale, Department, Role, Group, and Manager, as well as by your custom User filters.

**Note:** The Add filter options use a logical AND operator. Meaning that the results must meet both the criteria in the default filters AND the criteria in the additional filters to be included in the visualizations.
