# Create a conversion funnel

View conversion rates and trends in aggregate user behavior to uncover the reasons behind success or failure of a specific in-application user goal. Investigating a conversion funnel can help you measure and optimize the conversion rates of relevant processes within your application.

## Before you begin

Role required: Users with the analytics\_viewer, portal\_analytics\_viewer, mobile\_analytics\_viewer, core\_ui\_analytics\_viewer, now\_experience\_analytics\_viewer roles can create, edit and delete funnels for the applications they have access to.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Usage Insights**.

2.  From the Applications list, select the application for which you want to create a conversion funnel.

3.  Select **Analysis** &gt; **Conversion funnel**.

4.  Select the **Create new funnel** button \(\[Omitted image "uxa-create-cohort-button.png"\] Alt text: Create new funnel button\).

5.  Enter a name for the relevant process you want to measure and, optionally, a description, and select **Next**.

6.  From the **Step Type** options, select steps you want to measure, and screens, events, or actions as applicable.

**Event Trigger**

</td><td>

Select [User Analytics Events KPIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/usage-insights/view-events.md) to measure. To match a selected event by a certain property, select **Filter properties**, select a property from the drop down, and enter a value for the property.

-   **[Create cross-application conversion funnels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/usage-insights/create-conversion-funnel-for-cross-application.md)**  
Conversion funnels outline a sequence of steps to measure user progression, identify drop-off points, and track the time taken for each transition. The cross-application capability eliminates the requirement for every step to be in the same application.
