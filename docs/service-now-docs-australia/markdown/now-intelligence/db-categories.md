# Platform Analytics experience dashboard categories

Dashboard categories enable searching and filtering dashboards using general terms assigned to multiple dashboards.

**Note:** Core UI dashboard groups are migrated into categories.

Users with the platform\_analytics\_admin or analytics\_categories\_admin can create, edit, and remove dashboard [categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/dashboards-glossary.md). Users can then apply one or more categories to dashboards they create and can filter the dashboards in the Dashboards library by category.

When there are enough categories, you can search for categories in the dashboard overview. Otherwise, all categories that have been assigned to dashboards are visible under **Filter by categories**. Categories that have not been assigned in the dashboard's Information panel do not appear in the overview.

Navigate to analytics\_category.list to view all categories.
