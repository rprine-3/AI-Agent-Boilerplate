# Dashboards and data visualizations in the ServiceNow Otto panel

Generate and export Platform Analytics artifacts from conversational interactions. For example, ask for information about the number of open incidents and get a single-score data visualization. Then export that visualization as a PDF file, all in the ServiceNow Otto panel.

</table>**Important:**

-   Not all model providers are available for customers with in-country SKUs, and some AI products/features are currently unavailable for in-country customers. For more information, see the [KB1584492](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1584492) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Be sure to check for model provider availability updates in future releases.
-   Some AI products/features are currently unavailable for customers in the FedRAMP, NSC DOD IL5, or Australia IRAP-Protected data centers, self-hosted customers, or in other restricted environments. For more information, see the [KB0743854](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0743854) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Be sure to check for availability updates in future releases.

## AI limitations

This application uses artificial intelligence \(AI\) and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study that generate predictions based on patterns in data. As a result, this application may not always produce accurate, complete, or appropriate information. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this application has been fully trained or tested for your use case. To mitigate these issues, it is your responsibility to test and evaluate your use of this application for accuracy, harm, and appropriateness for your use case, employ human oversight of output, and refrain from relying solely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making purposes. This is especially important if you choose to deploy this application in areas with consequential impacts such as healthcare, finance, legal, employment, security, or infrastructure. You agree to abide by [ServiceNow’s AI Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.servicenow.com/ai-acceptable-use-policy.html), which may be updated by ServiceNow.

## Data processing

This application requires data to be transferred from ServiceNow customers' individual instances to a centralized ServiceNow environment, which may be located in a different data center region from the one where your instance is, and potentially to a third-party cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure. This data is handled per ServiceNow's internal policies and procedures, including our policies available through our [CORE Compliance Portal](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0564067).

## Data collection

ServiceNow collects and uses the inputs, outputs, and edits to outputs of this application to develop and improve ServiceNow technologies including ServiceNow models and AI products. In addition, this application will collect information from tables and indicators that will be used to generate analytics. For example, information from the Incident table or the Number of open incidents indicator could be collected for requests for incident data visualizations. Customers can opt out of future data collection at any time, as described in the [Now Assist Opt-Out page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/opt-out-of-data-sharing-for-now-assist.md).

For more information, see the [Now Assist documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/platform-now-assist-landing.md).
