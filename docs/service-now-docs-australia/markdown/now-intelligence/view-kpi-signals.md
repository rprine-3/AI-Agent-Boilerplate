# View KPI Signals

Access KPI Signals from the KPI Details page.

## Before you begin

Role required: Any roles necessary to access the workspace. The access control lists \(ACLs\) for indicators and breakdowns are also respected.

## Procedure

1.  Open KPI Details for an indicator as described in [View KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/view-kpi-details.md).

2.  Open the **Filters** \(\[Omitted image "filter-icon.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon\) panel and select one breakdown and one element.

    KPI Signals can monitor each first-level breakdown and element applied to an indicator. It cannot monitor second-level breakdowns.

    **Note:** In the context of KPI Signals, the term KPI refers to an indicator with optionally a first-level breakdown and element.

3.  Select the Open KPI Signals icon.\[Omitted image "open-kpi-signals-icon.png"\]

    The KPI Signals panel opens.

4.  If KPI Signals monitoring is not active for this KPI, you can follow the instructions in [Activate KPI Signals monitoring for an indicator \(KPI\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/activate-signals-monitor.md).

    If you do not have a role that allows you to activate KPI Signals monitoring for a KPI, contact an administrator instead.


## KPI Signals with a breakdown element

In the following example, you see the KPI Signals panel for the Number of open incidents indicator. This indicator is filtered on the Priority: 1 - Critical breakdown element. No signals have been detected.
