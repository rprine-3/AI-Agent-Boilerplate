# Edit a copy of a shared dashboard element

To configure a shared element that you added to a dashboard from a library, make a local copy that is not linked to a library. You only have to do this if you do not have permission to edit the version in the library.

## Before you begin

Role required: Any

## About this task

You may find yourself needing to reconfigure a data visualization or a filter on a dashboard to which you have editing rights. However, if it is a visualization or filter that is shared from the library, you would be editing the library copy that other people use. You might not have the permissions to do so. In this case, you see a notification that the owner has not shared the element with editing permissions.

\[Omitted image "cannot-configure-element.png"\] Alt text: Message that you cannot configure an element because you do not have editing permissions.

However, as long as you can edit the dashboard, you can unlink a visualization on the dashboard from the library. Then you have a local version that you can edit freely.

**Note:** If you have the right to edit a shared element, you are given the choice to change the configuration in the library, which affects all dashboards that contain it, or to create a local copy. You do not need to unlink the element.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards** and open your dashboard.

2.  Select **Edit** to put the dashboard in edit mode.

3.  Focus on the element you want to edit.

4.  On the element, expand the **Actions** menu.

    \[Omitted image "dv-on-db-unlink.png"\] Alt text: Actions menu on data visualization, showing Unlink from library action.

5.  Select **Unlink from library**.

    **Note:** You can unlink a filter or visualization from the library even if you do not have the right to duplicate it.

6.  Select **Configure**.

7.  Proceed as described in one of the following topics:
