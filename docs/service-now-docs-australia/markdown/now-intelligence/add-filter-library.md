# Create a filter in the Filter Designer

Create a Platform Analytics filter in the Filter Designer and add it to the library for reuse.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Filters that are saved to the filter library are not accessible in the technical editor or other UI Builder pages.

Role required: analytics\_filter\_admin, admin

## Procedure

1.  To add a filter to the filter library, navigate to **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Filters** and select **New**.

    You can also navigate to this library from other Platform Analytics library pages.

    The Filter Designer opens.

2.  Select the type of data to filter.

    Other configuration options vary depending on the data type you select.

    -   [Single select](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-select-filter-workspace.md): A single value from a set of choices. Single select is the default filter type.
    -   [Multiple select](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-select-filter-workspace.md): More than one value from a set of choices, such as both High and Critical Priority
    -   [Date](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-date-filter-workspace.md): A calendar date. You can also set a time. Automatically applies to all indicator data on page or tab.
    -   [True/False](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-boolean-filter-workspace.md): Whether a field value is true or false. Can also be used with indicator breakdowns that are based on a [bucket group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) with only two values.
3.  In the **Filter label** field, type a meaningful name for the filter.

    This name is the name that the user sees.

4.  Choose the **Filter Element**.

    Element options depend on the filter type, but include Pill, Checkboxes, and Typeahead.

5.  Choose the filter source.

    Options include:

    -   **Tables**

        Select the table to filter.

    -   **Indicators**

        Select the breakdown to use as the filter.

    -   **Usage Insights**

        Select the Usage Insights property to filter on. For more information, see [Filter data in Usage Insights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/usage-insights/filter-user-list.md).


## Result

Upon saving, the filter is saved to the library, where any user can add it to their dashboards.
