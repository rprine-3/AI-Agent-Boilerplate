# Perform a partial migration of interactive filters

Migrate a selection of your Core UI interactive filters to Platform Analytics.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You cannot use update sets to move the migrated material from a non-production instance to a production instance. Test the migration on the non-production instance and then use Migration Center functionality to migrate the production instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics Administration** &gt; **Core UI Artifacts** &gt; **Interactive Filters**.

    The `sys_ui_hp_publisher` list opens.

2.  Select the filters you want to migrate to Platform Analytics experience.

3.  From the **Action on selected rows** menu, choose **Migrate filter**.


## Result

The selected filters are migrated to Platform Analytics experience interactive filters.

## What to do next

Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics Administration** &gt; **Next Experience Artifacts** &gt; **Filters** to review the migrated filters.
