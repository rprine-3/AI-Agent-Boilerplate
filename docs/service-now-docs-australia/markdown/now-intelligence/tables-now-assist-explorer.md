The AI Data Explorer application is private. You cannot edit these tables directly. However, if you have the admin role, you can read them. Each table begins with the prefix "paai\_canvas."

PAAI Canvas, PAAI Canvas Component, and PAAI Canvas Conversation records follow this hierarchy: Canvas \(one record per exploration\) &gt; Conversation \(currently one per canvas\) &gt; Component \(one or more per conversation\).
