# Create a target in KPI Details

You can set target values for indicators that apply only to specific breakdown elements and time series aggregations. The target starts to apply at a selected date and continues to apply until you set the next target. You can set a date on which you expect to reach the target, and set a new target then.

## Before you begin

Role required: pa\_target\_admin to create global targets that are visible to all users. Any user who can view an indicator on KPI Details can view targets and create personal targets. Personal targets and thresholds are visible on KPI Details only to the user that created them.

A responsible user can create a global target to replace the target they are responsible for, regardless of role. For more information, see [Responsibility for indicator targets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/responsibiity-targets-kpi-details.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Indicators**.

2.  Locate the indicator and interact with its name to launch KPI Details for that indicator.

3.  To limit the target to a subset of the scores, open the Filter \[Omitted image "kpi-details-filter-icon.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon highlighted on sidebar. and select a breakdown and a breakdown element.

    For a Data snapshots indicator, you can select multiple breakdowns. For a classic indicator, you can select up to two if a breakdown matrix is enabled on the indicator.

    **Note:** To add targets for multiple breakdown elements, see [Add a target to multiple breakdown elements in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/add-multiple-targets.md).

4.  If you want the target to apply to a specific time series aggregation, select the time series.

    For more information about time series aggregations, see [Applying time series aggregations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/applying-time-series-aggregations.md).

5.  Select the target icon \(\[Omitted image "target-icon.png"\] Alt text: Target icon\).

    The Targets panel opens.

6.  Select the Create Target icon \(\[Omitted image "add-target-thresh-icon.png"\] Alt text: Create Target icon\).

7.  Select either **For everyone** or **For me**.

    The **For everyone** option creates a global target. The **For me** option creates a personal target.

    You see all the existing global or personal targets on this indicator that apply to whichever breakdown elements or time series you selected. You can select and deselect breakdown elements or a time series interactively, and the list of targets updates.

    **Note:** Instead of creating a new target, you can edit one of these existing targets. Select the tile for a target to edit that target. You can only change the absolute value of the target and the start and review dates. For more sophisticated target editing, see [Edit multiple targets in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/edit-multiple-targets.md).

8.  In the **Based on** field, select either **New value**, **Average score**, or **Previous target**.

    **New value** is an absolute value for the target that you enter. **Average score** selects the target as an improvement to the average score. You set the amount of the improvement. The average is calculated over the time span shown in the chart. This average is shown as a read-only value in the **Average value** field.

    **Previous target** is available only if a previous target exists. The new target is a calculated value based on a change from the active target. The active target appears in the read-only **Reference value** field.

9.  If you selected **New value**, enter the target value in the **New value** field.

10. If you selected **Average score**, or **Previous target**complete the following options:

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |Direction|Select **Increase** or **Decrease**. **Increase** means the target will be higher than the average score or previous target, while **Decrease** means it will be lower. By default, the value corresponds to the indicator's direction.|
    |Change|Enter the amount by which you want the target to differ from the average score or previous target. This value can be in absolute units or a percentage.|
    |% / Unit|Set whether the change is an absolute unit or a percentage.|

    When you have completed these fields, the calculated target value appears in the read-only **New value** field.

11. Select a start date.

    You can set a date in the future.

12. Select a review date.

    The target applies from the selected start date until the start date of the next target, if any. If you do not define a later target, the target applies indefinitely. Thus, the review date serves as a reminder to consider changing the target. Whether or not you change the target value after review, consider selecting a new, future review date.

    If you select a review date, you display a status icon on the chart indicating whether on that date you are on track to meet the target.

    **Note:** KPI Details does not support overlapping targets. Only one target at a time can be active.

13. Click **Save**.


## Creating a target

It's November 1 and your Number of Open Incidents in the Network category has varied considerably for the last month, with a recent sharp downturn.

As an incident manager, you want the number of open incidents to go down. You are not sure from your scores on a good target to set. You would be happy if it stayed below the average for October. So you start by basing the target on the average score for that month.

\[Omitted image "kpi-details-average-value.png"\] Alt text: Partly through creating a target in KPI Details, showing the calculated average score for October of 217.

You see that the average value is 217, but you are an optimist and think your team might do a little better. So you leave **Decrease** selected, as indeed you want the number of incidents to decrease. Most of the low points on the chart were around 200, so you decide on that as the new target.

\[Omitted image "kpi-details-calculate-target-value.png"\] Alt text: Create target panel with target based on an average score but 17 lower.

Finally, you decide to put your target into effect on the beginning of the next month. You hope to reach the target by the end of the month, so you set the last workday of the month as the review date.

\[Omitted image "kpi-details-target-dates.png"\] Alt text: Create Target dialog showing start and review dates filled in.

When you click **Save**, you create your target. For an example of what such a target looks like in KPI Details, see [Indicator targets and thresholds in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/kpi-details-targets.md).

## What to do next

After you create a global target, make yourself or another user responsible for maintaining the target. See [Responsibility for indicator targets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/responsibiity-targets-kpi-details.md).
