# Usage Insights data options for time series data visualizations

The following Data configuration options are available for all time series type visualizations of Usage Insights data.

**Note:** If you add a Platform Analytics data visualization with Usage Insights data to an inline dashboard, the default drilldown for that data visualization is to open the corresponding UXA analytics page. This feature provides a quick and efficient way to drill down and explore specific user behavior from your Platform Analytics dashboard.

Add alternative group by

</td><td>

This selection opens a dialog in which you select additional items that the data in the visualization may be grouped by. The viewer of the visualization can then select which of these items to group the data by. The viewer toggles the visibility of the selector in the visualization's More actions menu. In the additional items dialog, you can set whether this selector is visible by default by toggling **Selector visible by default**.If you select a value in **Group by**, that is the default group-by value. You do not have to select a **Group by** value to specify alternative group-by values. In this case, no default group-by value is used.

Data snapshots indicators support only reference, boolean, and choice fields for alternative group bys.

For more information about setting alternative group-bys for multiple metrics, see [Options for time series data visualizations with multiple metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/chart-options-multi-metrics.md). For more information about the viewer experience selecting from alternative group-by values, see [Select a group-by value in a data visualization as a viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/select-group-runtime.md).

**Important:**

-   Only up to three metrics on one visualization support alternative group-by.
-   Alternative group-by does not support data binding on the data source
