# Activate AI Data Explorer skills

Enable AI Data Explorer skills under AI skills for Data and Analytics to give users AI-assisted, shared spaces to explore data.

## Before you begin

The correct Workflow Data Fabric entitlement is required.

**Important:** These generative AI skills are turned on by default. The skills will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

The Query Generation skills "analytics query generation" and "analytics insight generation" are required. To support queries on indicator data, the Query Generation skill "analytics query generation for indicators" is required. These skills are active by default. For more information, see [Query Generation skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/enable-query-generation.md).

Role required: now\_assist\_explorer\_admin or higher

## About this task

Assign the now\_assist\_explorer\_user role, and activate the AI Data Explorer skills.

## Procedure

1.  Grant the now\_assist\_explorer\_user role to users who need to explore data with AI Data Explorer.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **AI Skills**.

3.  In the product area pane, select **Data and Analytics** &gt; **Analytics**.

4.  In AI skills for Analytics, search for the analytics exploration skill.

    \[Omitted image "nowass-expl-skills.png"\] Alt text: AI skills tab of AI Admin Hub, showing the skills for AI Data Explorer under Analytics.

5.  To see information about the skill, select **View details**.

    The information includes the following details:

    -   A description of the skill
    -   Key benefits
    -   Dependencies and other recommended skills, if applicable
6.  Select **Activate skill**.

    If the skill is already activated, you can deactivate it through the 3-dot menu on the tile. This menu is available only for activated skills. Deactivating the analytics exploration skill deactivates AI Data Explorer for the instance.

    \[Omitted image "deactivate-skill.png"\] Alt text: Tile for activated skill showing Deactivate option from context menu.

7.  Configure the analytics exploration skill.

    1.  In the **Advanced analysis** page, you can activate record-level analysis or deactivate indicator support.

        For record-level analysis, you can also set which tables it applies to. For more information, see [Configure record level analysis in AI Data Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/record-level-analysis.md) and [Deactivate indicator support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/aide-deactivate-indicator-support.md).

    2.  Select **Save and continue**.

    3.  In the **Define access** page, you can add roles who can create and edit explorations in AI Data Explorer.

        All AI Data Explorer and Query Generation skills should have one role in common. The default role for this skill, now\_assist\_explorer\_user, contains the default Query Generation role, sn\_query\_gen.user. Any changes you make must preserve the rights of the AI Data Explorer user to access Query Generation skills.

    4.  Select **Save and continue**.

    5.  In the **Review and activate** page, review the settings you made and either go back and change them or select **Activate**.

    **Note:** You can come back later and edit the settings for this or any other skill by selecting **Edit configuration** on the tile of the activated skill.

    \[Omitted image "activated-skill.png"\] Alt text: Tile for the activated analytics exploration skill, showing Edit Configuration and Deactivate options.

8.  To enable users to generate recommendations based on the findings in their exploration, turn on the exploration action recommendation skill.

    You can set the roles that can generate recommendations. The default role is now\_assist\_explorer\_user. This role contains sn\_query\_gen.user, granting necessary access to Query Generation.

    Requires Australia Patch 1 and the associated application upgrade.

9.  To enable users to generate summaries of explorations, turn on the exploration summarization skill.

    You can set the roles that can generate summaries. Again, the default role is now\_assist\_explorer\_user. This role contains sn\_query\_gen.user, granting necessary access to Query Generation.

10. To enable users to use AI to help refine text that they write in explorations, activate the refine text in explorations skill.

    A dialog opens asking you where you want to display the refine text option.

    1.  In the **Select display** page, under **Choose where to display**, toggle **Display** on for **In-product desktop**.

    2.  You can set the roles that can use AI to refine texts in their explorations.

        Again, the default role is now\_assist\_explorer\_user. This role contains sn\_query\_gen.user, granting necessary access to Query Generation.

    3.  Select **Save and continue**.

    4.  Browse the review and select **Activate**.
