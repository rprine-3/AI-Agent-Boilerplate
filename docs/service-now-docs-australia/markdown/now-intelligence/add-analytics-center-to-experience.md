# Add Platform Analytics pages to a configurable workspace

Add an Analytics Overview and its related pages to your own workspace/experience through page templates.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

In experiences and workspaces, the Analytics Overview provides a central page with tabs for all the other pages related to Platform Analytics. You do not have to add an Analytics Overview, but this procedure uses that page as example. The same procedure applies to adding the other Platform Analytics pages from templates. Details about those pages are provided at the end of this topic.

## Procedure

1.  Open your experience in the UI Builder.

2.  Scroll to the desired template.

    This procedure shows how to set up the Analytics Center template, but the instructions apply to any template, such as Dashboards.

3.  Hold your cursor over the Analytics Center template and select **Use template**.

    \[Omitted image "analytics-center-template.png"\] Alt text: The Analytics Center template selected.

4.  Specify a name and a path for the page and press **Continue**.

5.  In the URL parameters page, press **Looks good**.

6.  Specify the variant name, audiences, and conditions.

7.  Press **Create**.

    The page editor opens.

8.  Change from the Editor to the Settings view.

    \[Omitted image "workspace-settings.png"\] Alt text: The Settings button on a UI Builder page.

9.  Select the **General** variant.

    \[Omitted image "general-variant.png"\] Alt text: The General choice in the variants.

10. Under URL parameters, add the following optional parameters:

    -   tab
    -   filter
    These parameters ensure that on page refresh, the last open tab of the Analytics Center opens. Also, the last selected filter \(such as **Bookmarked**\) is enabled.

11. Press **Save**.


## Result

You now have a page with a fully configured Analytics Overview, including all components. However, none of the links to other pages work until those pages are added and configured.

## What to do next

Create pages using the following templates. Follow the same process you used to create the Analytics Overview page. Give the pages the following paths and parameters:

**Note:**

-   The default event handlers use the paths in this table. If you specify a different path, you have to customize the event handler as described in [Configure custom redirection from a dashboard component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/config-custom-redirection-from-db.md).
-   Simple List and Dashboard overview are legacy page templates, like Analytics Center. You must specify the parameters manually for these pages. Newer page templates give you the parameters in the course of page creation.
-   Platform Analytics is modular. You can create only some of the pages and get their standalone functions. For example, if you only want dashboard support or KPI Details, create the pages with that functionality and don't create an Analytics Overview.

</table>**Important:** You must use these paths, which are the same paths of the pages in the Platform Analytics experience. The preconfigured event handlers on the pages use these paths. If you do not give your pages these paths, the event handlers will not work.
