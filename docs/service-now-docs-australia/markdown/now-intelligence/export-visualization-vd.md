# Export a data visualization from the Visualization Designer

Export individual data visualizations to various formats and sizes. Download the exports or share them over email.

## Before you begin

Role required: You can export any visualization that you created or that was shared with you. Users with the admin or viz\_admin role can export any data visualizations.

## About this task

Not all visualizations support all output types. Some export options shown in the UI for a visualization may not be valid. Consult the following table.

|Type of Data visualization|Supported Data visualization export formats|
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Calendar reports, Indicator scorecards, Geomap|None|
|Pivot tables|PowerPoint, PDF, PNG, JPEG, Embedded PNG|
|Lists|PDF, Microsoft Excel \(.xls or .xlsx\), CSV|
|Other data visualizations|PowerPoint, PDF, PNG, JPEG, Embedded PNG|
|Non-data visualization dashboard elements, like Headings|Not applicable|

Data visualizations exported to PowerPoint include the title and the description if this information is provided in the source visualization.

**Note:**

If you have any ServiceNow Otto applications installed, you can probably export a dashboard conversationally through the ServiceNow Otto panel. See [Export dashboards and data visualizations from the ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/export-db-dv-now-assist-panel.md).

2.  Select the visualization that you want to export.

3.  From the More actions menu \[Omitted image "icon-paw-more-actions.png"\], select **Export**.

</table>5.  Under **Delivery**, select **Download file** or **Send file via email**.

    -   When you choose to download the file, a **Download** button is available after the export is complete. The file, named `<visualization-name>.<filetype>`, is downloaded to your default local destination.
    -   When you send the file by email, you can select users and groups on your instance or any allowed email address. Security constraints may restrict who you can email. You also must specify a subject, and you can add a message. When you are done, select **Export**.

        **Note:** To send email to persons who are not on your instance, make sure outbound email is configured. See [Outbound Email Configuration](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/xanadu/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_xanadu_automating_application_logic/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_xanadu_notifications/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_xanadu_outbound_email_configuration) in the Developer Site.
