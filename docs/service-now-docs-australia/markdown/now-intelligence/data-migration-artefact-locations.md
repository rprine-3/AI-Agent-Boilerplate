# Migrated artifact locations

After data migration, your artifacts such as dashboards, visualizations, and filters, reside in different tables in your instance.

Users with the admin, pa\_admin, report\_admin, or dashboard\_admin roles have access to the migrated artefact tables.

In addition to these tables, snpar\_sched\_export\_v\_scheduled\_export\_visualization is a virtual table for the scheduled export UI form.
