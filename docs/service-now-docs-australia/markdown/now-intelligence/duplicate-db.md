# Duplicate a Platform Analytics dashboard

Duplicate a dashboard created in the in-line editor so that you can share a modified version with different users.

## Before you begin

Role required: At least one role, as well as access to the dashboard.

**Note:** This task only applies to dashboards created in the in-line editor. To work with dashboards created in UI Builder, see [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder-overview.md).

## About this task

When you duplicate a dashboard, you copy all settings and details of the original. Content that exists locally on the original dashboard is duplicated onto the new dashboard. If the original dashboard contains references to content in a library, such as a shared visualization, the references are duplicated. The role requirements for editing an element in a library apply to the latter.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Select the dashboard that you want to duplicate.

3.  If you are in a different application scope than the dashboard, use the application picker to select the correct scope.

    \[Omitted image "app-scope-picker.png"\] Alt text: Application scope picker

4.  Open the More actions menu \(\[Omitted image "icon-vert-3dot-p.png"\] Alt text: More actions menu icon\) and select **Duplicate**.

    \[Omitted image "db-duplicate.png"\] Alt text: Duplicate context action

5.  Give the duplicate a unique name and select **Duplicate**.


## Result

The dashboard is copied with the new name. The appearance of the dashboard is identical to the original.

**Important:** The new duplicate is automatically saved.

## Duplicate a dashboard tab

Duplicate a dashboard tab created in the in-line editor so that you can add related important content. When you add your first tab to a dashboard, there’s a new part of the layout below the title and above the tabs. Add elements above the tabs that are visible no matter which tab has focus.

### Before you begin

Role required: At least one role, as well as edit rights to the dashboard.

**Note:** This task only applies to dashboards created in the in-line editor. To work with dashboards created in UI Builder, see [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder-overview.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Select the dashboard with a tab that you want to duplicate.

3.  If you are in a different application scope than the dashboard, use the application picker to select the correct scope.

    \[Omitted image "app-scope-picker.png"\] Alt text: Application scope picker

4.  Select the **Edit** button \(\[Omitted image "edit-button.png"\] Alt text: Edit button\) to put the dashboard into edit mode.

    If you don’t see the **Edit** button, either you don’t have permission to edit the dashboard, or it is in edit lock.

5.  Select **Add a tab**.

    This link is next to the dashboard's title.

6.  Open the More actions menu \(\[Omitted image "icon-vert-3dot-p.png"\] Alt text: More actions menu icon\) on the original tab and select **Duplicate**.

    The copy of the tab has the default name **New Tab**. Select the pencil icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-pencil-ac.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon\) to rename the tab.

7.  Give the duplicate a unique name.

8.  Select **Save** to save the dashboard with the new tab.


### Result

The dashboard tab is copied with the new name. All other aspects of the dashboard remain the same.

**Important:** The new duplicate tab is saved automatically.
