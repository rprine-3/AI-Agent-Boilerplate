# Add a dynamic JavaScript filter

Add a dynamic JavaScript statement for evaluation as part of a report visualization's filter criteria.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

## About this task

JavaScript filters can be single-line statements, or longer scripts. For longer JavaScript statements, create a script include that returns the correct format and data type, conforms to the specific data that the report should filter for, and is client callable. For more information, see [Script includes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).

This table lists the operators supported by each field type that supports JavaScript filters. Field types that are not in this table do not support JavaScript filters and the **Value** field in the condition builder for those field types does not have the option to paste your own statements.

</table>## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**.

2.  Open the data visualization that you want to add the dynamic filter to and select **Edit**.

3.  In the **Configuration** panel, select the data source you want to filter.

4.  In the Filters, section, construct your filter condition.

    These combinations of field types and operators allow you to specify a dynamic JavaScript statement.

    **Note:**

    -   The "between" operator provides two fields that can support the same or different JavaScript URLs.
    -   The "is" operator can return an array of data elements of the expected type. In this case the operator is treated as the "is one of" operator.
    -   List fields do not support dynamic JavaScript filters.
5.  Choose a field type and operator and enter a JavaScript statement.

    -   For a one-line JavaScript statement, use the format `javascript:<JavaScript_Statement>;`.
    -   For a JavaScript statement that calls a script include, use the format `javascript:new <Record_Name>().<Function_Name>();` in which `Record_Name` corresponds to the record name of the script include and `Function_Name` is the function in the script include that returns the value compared in the filter.
    **Note:** The Javascript URL can also include one or more parameters passed to the function which performs the calculation and returns a result. For example, a JavaScript function that passes two parameters to the script include record could be written as `javascript:new TextJSFilter().getGroupIDs("Professional Services","Sales");`.


## What to do next

After you add the necessary JavaScript statements and conditions and configure the remainder of the report, test the report to ensure it returns and displays the expected results.
