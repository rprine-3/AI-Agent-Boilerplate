# Indicator data options for dial data visualizations

When you select an indicator data source for a dial visualization, the following Data configuration options are available.

**Note:** Fields that apply to Data snapshots indicators apply only to native Data snapshots indicators, not classic indicators with Data snapshots enabled.

The data source for a native Data snapshots indicator has the indicator type **Automated - Data Snapshots** or **Formula - Data Snapshots**.

The data source for a classic indicator with Data snapshots enabled has the indicator type of either **Automated** or **Formula**.

Data source

</td><td>

You have selected an indicator data source in [Create a dial data visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-dv-dial-ac.md).

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Metric

</td></tr><tr><td>

Label

</td><td>

Label of the metric. By default it is the same as the name of the data source.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Time aggregation

</td><td>

Time aggregation to apply to the metric, such as 7-day running SUM or By-month AVG. Default is the same as the indicator period. For more information, see [Applying time series aggregations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/applying-time-series-aggregations.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select an aggregation \(Data snapshots indicators only\)

</td><td>

The aggregation is based on the Data snapshots indicator's configuration. You cannot change it in the context of creating a data visualization. **Count** counts the number of records. **Count distinct** counts the number of unique values rather than the total number of records. For example, if the name of a user appears more than once in a list, the user is only counted once. Other choices perform the specified aggregate operation, such as summing the values in a field across records.
