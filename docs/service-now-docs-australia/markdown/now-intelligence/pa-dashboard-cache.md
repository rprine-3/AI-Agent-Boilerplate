# Platform Analytics dashboard cache

Changes to the layouts of Platform Analytics dashboards are stored in the par\_dashboard\_cache table. Whenever a dashboard is called, a new entry is made in this table. Delete entries in this table to regenerate the cache for troubleshooting.

**Note:** On upgrade from any instance before Australia, this table is removed.

In the context of troubleshooting a dashboard's layout, navigate to `par_dashboard_cache_list.do` to open the PAR Dashboard Metadata Caches table. Delete a dashboard's record on this table to regenerate the cache.

These access control lists \(ACLs\) apply to the PAR Dashboard Metadata Caches **par\_dashboard\_cache** table:

-   Admin only role: report\_on, report\_view, create, write, delete
-   Any logged-in user: read
