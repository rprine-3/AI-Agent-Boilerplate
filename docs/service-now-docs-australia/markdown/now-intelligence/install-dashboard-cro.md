# Install the Chief Risk Officer Dashboard

The CRO Dashboard provides a single pane glass view of end-to-end Governance, Risk, and Compliance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, platform\_analytics\_admin, sn\_cro\_dashboard.admin

Consider duplicating this executive dashboard before customizing it. For more information, see [Duplicate a Platform Analytics dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/duplicate-db.md).

**Note:** The CRO Dashboard application is free from the ServiceNow Store. However, the contents of the dashboard require professional entitlements to the following applications:

-   GRC
-   GRC: Profiles
-   GRC: Policy and Compliance
-   Audit Management

These professional entitlements include a license for Platform Analytics.

These solutions consist of Platform Analytics indicators and associated data collection jobs, used by the metrics on the CRO Dashboard. If you don’t have the prerequisite licenses, the installation proceeds. However, without the required plugins \(found in the application manager\) and applications \(found in the ServiceNow store\) and the underlying data, the dashboard won’t show any relevant metrics. If you have any questions about your licensing and entitlements, consult your account executive.

Application plugins:

-   sn\_grc
-   sn\_audit
-   sn\_compliance
-   sn\_risk

## Procedure

1.  Log in to `https://store.servicenow.com`.

2.  Search for the CRO Dashboard application.

3.  Select the **Request Install** button to create the app installation request.

    Select **Request** to request the CRO Dashboard application plugin for the specified instance and provide the instance details with your reason for request and validate the instance.

4.  Navigate to **System applications** &gt; **All available applications**.

5.  Search for and install the CRO Dashboard plugin \(sn\_cro\_dashboard\).

6.  Assign roles to configure and view the CRO Dashboard.

    -   **CRO Dashboard admin**

        Assign the role sn\_cro\_dashboard.admin to users or groups who require configuration privileges on the dashboard.

        **Note:** Only users with this role can configure the CRO dashboard.

    -   **CRO Dashboard end users**

        Assign the user role sn\_cro\_dashboard.user to users or groups who must view the dashboard.

    Users must log out and log back in to enable their new roles after the admin assigns them. For more information on user roles, see [Exploring user administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/exploring-user-administration.md).
