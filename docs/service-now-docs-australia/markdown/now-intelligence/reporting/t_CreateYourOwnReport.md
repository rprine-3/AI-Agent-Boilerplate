To create Core UI reports in the Australia release, the system property **com.snc.par.coreui.report\_create.enabled** must be set to true.

## Procedure

1.  Follow one of these paths.

## Create a report with Analytics Q&amp;A

Enter a question on the Report Designer form, and Analytics Q&amp;A generates a report. Analytics Q&amp;A gives you a choice of data sources and picks an appropriate visualization.

### Before you begin

Analytics Q&amp;A requires Natural Language Query \(NLQ\).

NLQ also must be enabled for use with the Report Designer, in [Reporting properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/reporting-properties.md). Check with your administrator.

**Note:** This topic refers to Reporting in the Core UI. For more information, see [Data visualizations in Platform Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center-data-visualizations.md).

Analytics Q&amp;A is not available when using Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on. To create Core UI reports in the Australia release, the system property **com.snc.par.coreui.report\_create.enabled** must be set to true.

### About this task

Analytics Q&amp;A supports the following languages:

-   English
-   French
-   Canadian French
-   Spanish
-   German
-   Japanese

The feature is not available in sessions that use an unsupported language.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **Create data visualization**.

2.  In the modal, select **Core UI**.

3.  Start typing the information you want in the report into the Analytics Q&amp;A field.

    Analytics Q&amp;A uses keywords in your query to determine what kind of information you are looking for. It displays suggestions while you type based on these keywords. To see a full list of keywords and their uses, click **How can I improve my results**.

4.  Select **Ask**.

    Analytics Q&amp;A generates the report, including an appropriate visualization.\[Omitted image "nlq-generates-report.gif"\] Alt text: Animation showing a report being generated with Analytics Q&amp;A


### What to do next

You can modify the report, such as changing the visualization type, in the left-margin menu. If you enter a new query and select **Ask**, you generate a new report. Any custom visualizations you added are cleared, but other settings persist in the new report.

## Report options

When you edit a form, you can also choose to save, share, run, delete, or view more information about the report.

**Note:**

On net new Australia instances and instances migrated to Platform Analytics experience, Reporting functionality is replaced with Data Visualizations. For more information, see [Data visualizations in Platform Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center-data-visualizations.md).

All actions are available from the upper right side of the form, from the **Save** and **Share** lists and the **Info**, **Delete**, and **Run** buttons. Available report options vary depending on the role of the user working with the report.
