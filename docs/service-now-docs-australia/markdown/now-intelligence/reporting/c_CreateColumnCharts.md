# Column reports

Column reports show how the value of one or more items changes over time with columns.

**Note:** On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Exploring the Data Visualizations library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/explore-data-vis-library.md).

Values along the horizontal axis of the column chart represent the time measurement \(years, hours, minutes, milliseconds, and so on\). Values on the vertical axis represent the changes to the items being monitored. Users with the report\_admin role can define the ranges that are used in a column chart report. See [Report ranges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_ReportRanges.md) for information on creating report ranges.

For example, you can create a column chart for incident counts, to show how the number of incidents changes over time. The incident count often increases during the first few months after a product upgrade is deployed. Over time, the number of reported incidents decreases as users become more accustomed to the changes in the product.

The figure shows resolved incidents stacked by category with a legend that indicates which category the colors represent.

A grouped column chart shows the categories as individual bars, rather than stacked colors in a single bar.

## Create a column report

Create a column report to show how the value of one or more data elements changes over time using vertical columns.

### Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

For a column report use case, [Time series data visualization example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/dv-example-line.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **New**.

2.  On the **Data** tab, give the report a name that reflects the information being grouped.

3.  Select the applicable source for the report.

<table id="choicetable_t31_tst_1x"><tbody><tr><td id="d45596e257">

**Data source**

</td><td>

Also called a report source, a data source is a table with filters applied to provide a single source of information for all users. For more information, see [Report sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_ReportSources.md).**Note:** If you select a data source used by existing reports, a notification prompts you to view them.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d45596e276">

**Table**

</td><td>

The raw data from a table with no filters applied. When you select a table, its short description appears below the table name. For trend reporting, you can also select a remote table, which aggregates, in memory, data retrieved from an external source. Then select a **Trend by** field option to aggregate its data. To learn more about remote tables, see [Retrieving external data using remote tables and scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/remote-tables.md)

</td></tr><tr><td id="d45596e295">

**External import**

Group by

</td><td>

Group report data using the values of this field. For example, in an incident report grouped by **Assignment group**, all incidents that belong to Software, Service Desk, and Network are placed in separate groups. To group by fields on extended tables, see [How to report on extended tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_AccessFieldExtendedTable.md). Select the info icon \[Omitted image "icon-info.png"\] for a description of the selected field. Configured function fields appear in this list after you save the report.

 **Note:**

-   It is not possible to group or stack reports by the **Tags** field, or by certain MySQL database field types, such as MEDIUMTEXT. For more information, see [Database field type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_DatabaseFieldTypes.md).
-   Grouping or stacking by Variables or Questions fields is not supported for reports based on [database views](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md).


</td></tr><tr><td>

Additional group by

</td><td>

Extra fields to group the report by. When you select **Additional group by** fields or function fields, the report includes a control at the bottom that allows you to group the report by any one of the additional fields. To group by fields on extended tables as well, see [How to report on extended tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_AccessFieldExtendedTable.md). Select the info icon \[Omitted image "icon-info.png"\] for descriptions of the selected fields Configured function fields appear in this list after you save the report.

**Note:**

-   You can see choices in the **Additional group by** list that do not appear in the main **Group by** list. The report does not support grouping or stacking by the extra fields you see. Unlike the main **Group by** choices, the **Additional group by** fields are not filtered. If you select an unsupported field, it has no effect.
-   The limitations listed for the main **Group by** field also apply to the **Additional group by** field.
 For more information, see [Add an additional group by or stack by](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/add-additional-group-by-stack-by.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Stacked bars / Grouped bars

</td><td>

How to show the relationship of individual items from the selected field to the whole.You can choose to display the stacked field either in a single bar or as a group of bars.

 Select **Stacked bars** to display the parts that contribute to the whole for each column in the chart.

 Select **Grouped bars** to display the parts that contribute to the whole as individual columns. Bars are displayed next to one another according to the **Group by** field \(for example, the state of the incident\), instead of stacked.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Display data table

</td><td>

Select this option to show report data in a list below the report. The list appears on dashboards where the report is added.All report visualizations show the report data when the [glide.ui.section508](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md) system property is set to **true**. The glide.ui.section508 property overrides the **Display data table** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Configure function field

</td><td>

Configure fields based on calculation of multiple inputs including arithmetic functions. For more information, see [Report on function fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/function-fields-reporting.md). Function field results are calculated when the report is run. You can use the results for aggregations and grouping. You have to save the report before you can configure function fields.Configured function fields appear in the **Group by** and **Additional group by** lists after you save the report.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Trend by

</td><td>

Table field whose values you want to show in a time sequence. Select the info icon \[Omitted image "icon-info.png"\] for a description of the selected field. **Note:** If you selected a remote table in the **Table** field, the option you select in this field aggregates the data that was retrieved from an external source and aggregated in memory. To learn more about remote tables, see [Retrieving external data using remote tables and scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/remote-tables.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Calendar

</td><td>

Calendar that is the basis for the time series in the report. Select either the standard calendar or a [customized business calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/business-calendars.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

per

</td><td>

Time period to group data by. The range of available time periods depends on the calendar that you selected. Time periods range from an hour to a year. You can also specify a date.**Note:** If reporting per week: When the report range includes more than one calendar year, inconsistencies result when a week is split between two years. To show data values more accurately according to ISO weeks, add and enable the **glide.db.aggregates.trend.use\_iso\_week** property in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregation

</td><td>

Mathematical calculation to perform on the data. The default is **Count**, which shows the number of records selected.To show only unique records, select **Count Distinct**.

 Select **Average**, **Sum**, or **Count Distinct**, to show a list of fields from the selected **Table**. Select a field to **Aggregate by** from this list.

 If you group the report by a field and select an **Average** aggregate, you get the average of each group. If a Total value is shown, it is the average of these group averages, not of the individual field values.

 Select **Minimum** or **Maximum** to show the maximum or minimum value for each segment of the report.

 For more information on aggregation options, see [Aggregation in reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/aggregation-reporting.md).

 If you choose **Average**,**Sum**, **Count Distinct**, **Minimum**, or **Maximum**, you may be able to aggregate on fields from extended tables. See [How to report on extended tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_AccessFieldExtendedTable.md).

 For information about aggregating on FX currency values, see [FX Currency values in reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/fx-currency-values-reporting.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Percentage calculation

</td><td>

Method of calculating percentages. The percentage appears when you point to a report segment, such as a bar on a bar report. This field appears when **Aggregation** is set to **Average**, **Sum**, or **Count Distinct**.

 -   **Use Aggregation** calculates the percentage using the selection in the **Aggregation** field. Only data that is displayed in the report is used to calculate the percentage.

For example, a report shows assets by department with the **Aggregation** set to **Sum** and the percentage calculated using aggregation. If the total cost of assets is $100,000 and the cost of assets for Customer Support is $10,000, the percentage for Customer Support is 10%.

-   **Use Record Count** calculates the percentage using the total number of records in the data set.

For example, a report shows incidents by priority. Out of 500 incident records, 200 have low priority. The percentage for the low-priority section is 40%.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set Value Formatting

</td><td>

Enables you to configure how to show numerical values in reports, including decimal precision, rounding, minimum and maximum duration units, and abbreviations for duration units. See [Value formatting in reports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/value-formatting-reports.md).

 **Note:** Decimal precision does not work on currency fields.
