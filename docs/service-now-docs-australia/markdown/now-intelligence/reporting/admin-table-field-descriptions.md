# Administer table and field descriptions

Users with the report\_description\_admin role can add and edit table and field descriptions that users see when they create reports.

A user with the admin role must enable the report\_description\_admin role. The user with the report\_description\_admin role can edit field and table descriptions. Report administrators inherit this role by default when it is activated.

In the Report Designer, the user sees the table descriptions on the **Data** tab. When appropriate, the user sees the field descriptions on the **Configure** tab.

## Edit table and field descriptions

Users with the report\_description\_admin role can add and edit table and field descriptions that users see when they create reports.

### Before you begin

Role required: report\_description\_admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Field Descriptions**.

    The **Field Labels** list has four columns:

    -   **Table**

        Lists the table the element is associated with. There is one entry in this column for every field in the table, plus one for the table itself.

    -   **Element**

        The field in the table that the description applies to. If the **Element** value is empty, then the description applies to the table.

    -   **Language**

        Two-letter code of the language the field is localized in. Read-only.

        **Note:** Right-click the code of the language you're adding descriptions in and select **Show Matching**. In this way, you limit the table to only the fields you need for this task.

    -   **Hint**

        Contains the descriptions of the tables and fields that users see in the Report Designer.

2.  Double-click the cell in the **Hint** column and add or edit the description.

    Click the check icon to save the description.\[Omitted image "add-field-description.png"\] Alt text: A description being added to the severity element on the incident table.
