</table>## About this task

You can control who sees reports by making them:

-   Globally visible to all users
-   Visible only to you if you are the report creator.
-   Visible to one or more specific users
-   Visible to one or more specific groups

**Note:** The permissions of a report can constrain the number of users or groups you can share a report with. For more information, see [Restrict report creation with an ACL rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_RestrictRepCreationWAnACLRule.md).

It is not possible to grant edit rights on a report when you share it.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **View / Run** and select the report you want to control.

    On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Differences between Core UI and Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/differences-between-core-ui-ne-dbs.md).

2.  In the upper right side of the report form, select the **Sharing** icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_ShareIcon.png"\] Alt text: Sharing icon\) and select **Share**.

3.  In the Sharing settings dialog box, fill in the fields and select **OK**.

If you modify such a report to be shared with specific Groups and Users, the required roles no longer apply.

    You can share the URL of the published report with any user, role, or group with whom you have shared the report.

    **Danger**

    This functionality is deactivated by default because of the risk of exposing data to unauthorized persons. For more information, see [\(Legacy\) Publish a report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_PublishAReport.md).

    The people with whom you share the report must have rights to view the report data.
