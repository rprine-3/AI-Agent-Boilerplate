# Edit an imported data source

You can edit imported Excel spreadsheets \(`.xlsx` files\) of data maintained outside of your instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **New**.

2.  Select the name of a report that uses to imported data source to open the report in the Report Designer.

3.  On the **Data** tab, select the pencil icon \(\[Omitted image "EditWidgetButton.png"\] Alt text:\) next to the name of the external import.

4.  In the **Edit external import** dialog box you can make these changes:

    -   **Change file**

        Select this option to upload a new `.xlsx` file with the same name and structure.

    -   **Name**

        Provide a new name for the external import. This name appears on the **Data** tab of the Report Designer in the **External Import** list.

    -   **Expire**

        Set a new expiry date for the external import.

        After this date, the imported file is deleted and reports based on it are no longer available.

    -   **Visible to**

        Change the visibility for the uploaded file: Only you, Everyone, or Custom. Select **Custom** to specify users, groups, or roles.

        If you select **Custom**, select **Next** to choose who can use the data in the imported file and select **Submit**.

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

If you changed the file, the data from the new file replaces that of the old in any reports that are based on the imported file. Changed name, expiry date, and visibility apply to the imported file.
