# Aggregate a report on standard deviation

When you create a report, you can aggregate the data on several calculations including the number of records, averages, and standard deviation. The standard deviation aggregation shows variation from average values for a duration or numeric field in a visualization.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

## Standard deviation

Select **Standard deviation** \(SD\) to see variation from average values for a duration or numeric field. For example, apply the Standard deviation aggregation to business duration of incidents. The report shows deviation from the average business duration of incidents in each priority.

Standard deviation is always expressed in the same unit as the data. In the following example, the data is in time units and so is the aggregation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **View / Run**.

2.  Select the report that you want to aggregate.

3.  On the Configure tab, choose **Standard Deviation** from the **Aggregation** list.

4.  Select **Run**.


## Result

The sections of the visualization are grouped by the highest or lowest value for the selected records.
