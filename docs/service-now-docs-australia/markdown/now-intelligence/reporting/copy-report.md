# Copy a report

Users who cannot create their own global reports can modify a global report, and then save a personal version of the report.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. On upgraded instances, other users may have the right to copy a report using these instructions based on access control. To create Core UI reports in the Australia release, the system property **com.snc.par.coreui.report\_create.enabled** must be set to true.

## About this task

If you save a global report as a group or personal report, the platform copies the report. The security state of the report is not changed.

**Note:**

-   If you open a personal report and save it as a group or global report, only the security state is changed. The report itself is not copied.
-   When you select **Insert and Stay** to copy a report, sharing settings are not copied to the new report.

This topic refers to Reporting in the Core UI. If your instance is a new Australia instance or migrated to Platform Analytics experience, see [Duplicate a visualization in the Visualization Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/duplicate-dv-ac.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **sys\_report.list**.

2.  Select the report you want to copy.

3.  On the report's form, select **View Report**.

4.  Select the arrow next to the **Save** button or next to the Share icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-share-db.png"\] Alt text: Share icon\).

    If you have permission to change the report, you see the **Save** button. You only see the arrow if you don't have permission to change the original report.

5.  Select **Insert and Stay**.

    |With the Save button|Without the Save button|
    |--------------------|-----------------------|
    |\[Omitted image "copy-report-with-save-button.png"\] Alt text: Save menu with Insert and Stay selected.|\[Omitted image "copy-report-without-save-button.png"\] Alt text: Arrow menu with Insert and Stay selected.|

    The Insert and Stay action creates a copy of the report that you can modify.

6.  Modify the report.

    See [Report types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/report-types-creation-details-rd.md).

7.  Change the report visibility.

    In the upper right side of the report form, click the **Sharing** icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_ShareIcon.png"\] Alt text:\) and select **Share**.
