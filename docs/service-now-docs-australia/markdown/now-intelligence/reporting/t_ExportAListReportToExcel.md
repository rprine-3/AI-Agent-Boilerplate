# Export a list report

You can export a list report to Excel, PDF, or CSV by scheduling an export of the report.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin.

**Note:** Administrator-created restrictions may prevent users with these roles from seeing the **Schedule** option.

This topic refers to Reporting in the Core UI. If your instance is migrated to Platform Analytics experience, see [Export a data visualization from the Visualization Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/export-visualization-vd.md).

2.  Open the list report that you want to export.

3.  Select the **Sharing** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-share-db.png"\] Alt text: Sharing icon\) and select **Schedule**.

4.  Schedule the export of a saved list report in the desired format.

    Specify **Type** as PDF, PDF-landscape, Excel, or CSV. Excel displays report duration values in milliseconds, rather than the "&lt;x&gt; days &lt;y&gt; hours" format. For more information, see [Schedule emails of Core UI reports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_ScheduleAReport.md).
