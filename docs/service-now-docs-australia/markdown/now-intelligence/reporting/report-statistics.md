# Report statistics

The **Report Stats** list enables you to view how often each of your Core UI reports is run and how long it takes for the reports to run.

To view report statistics, navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Report Statistics**. The admin or report\_admin role is required. By default, the Report Statistics list displays all reports that have been run. To view reports that haven't been run, select the context menu icon \(\[Omitted image "ContextMenuIcon.png"\] Alt text: Context menu icon\) and choose **Add Unused Reports**.

**Note:** Adding unused reports to this list takes some time, especially if your instance has many reports.

The **Report Stats** list has the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Report|The name of the report. Select the hyperlink to view the report properties.|
|Last run|The date and time the report was last run.|
|Runs|The number of times the report has ever been run.|
|Runs on page|The number of times the report has been run on a dashboard.|
|Recent run time|The average execution time of the report in milliseconds based on the 25 most recent runs. Edit the **glide.report.recent\_executions\_number** property to change the number of runs used to calculate this value.|
|Run time|The average execution time in milliseconds of all runs of the report.|
|Recent number executions|The number of time the report was recently loaded from the server. The maximum number of recent executions is determined by the property **glide.report.recent\_executions\_number**.|

-   To view the reports that take the most time to run, sort **Recent run time** from z-a.
-   To view used reports, filter out the value 0 from the **Runs** column.
-   To view the most used reports, sort the **Runs** column from z-a.
