# Set the on-click behavior of a Core UI report

You can configure a URL to open when you select a section of a report.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

## About this task

You can redirect users to a URL rather than to the configured drilldown or the list that underlies the selected section of a report.

See [Define a report drilldown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_DrillingDownWithinReports.md) for the report types that don't support the drilldown feature.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports**.

2.  Select the report that you want to configure.

3.  Select **View Report**.

4.  Select the **Show report structure** icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_ShowReportStructureIcon.png"\] Alt text: Show report structure\).

5.  Select the link icon \(\[Omitted image "link-icon.png"\] Alt text:\).

6.  In the **Set redirect URL** dialog box, enter a relative link within the instance, for example, `/$knowledge.do?sys_id=123`.

    When the user hovers over the report, the tooltip includes the text **Click to open**.

7.  Enter a label for the URL.

    When the user hovers over the report, the tooltip includes the text **Click to open** and the text of the label, for example, Click to open Knowledge Base.

8.  Select **Save**.

## Result

When you select the report, the redirect URL replaces any drilldown functionality.
