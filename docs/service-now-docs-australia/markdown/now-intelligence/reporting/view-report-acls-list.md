# The report\_view ACLs list

View the entire list of report\_view ACLs and their associated roles to have a higher-level view of the access control on your instance.

Each instance has a different number of report\_view ACLs. The number depends on the plugins activated on the instance.

To view the report\_view ACLs list, navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **ACL Assessment for Reports** &gt; **Report View ACLs List**.

## report\_view ACLs list columns

ACLs apply to only one role at a time. There can be multiple instances of an ACL if there are multiple roles that it applies to. For example, the same ACL grants greater report access to an admin than to an itil user.
