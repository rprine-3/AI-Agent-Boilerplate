# Report Administration module

Learn how to administer reports on the ServiceNow platform using the **Reports** &gt; **Administration** module.

This module is not enabled by default, and must be activated. For a list of the reporting roles delivered with the ServiceNow platform, see [Reporting roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/reporting-roles.md).

**Note:** Restricting a report by role restricts who can view a report. Users without the admin role cannot edit global reports. If a non-admin user edits a global report, saving that report creates a personalized version belonging to that user

Use the record list view to filter, view, or modify reports using any of the standard record list controls. Click **New** to create reports or select any of the records to display the report as a form. All the standard ServiceNow form controls apply.

You can select the table and field on which to report and the characteristics of the report format. Create a condition in the **Filter** field to further restrict the data that is presented in the report and select a role that can use the report.

## Report Security

The Report Security enforce access control checks plugin allows administrators to use access control list \(ACL\) rules to restrict report access. This functionality prevents unauthorized users from editing, updating, or deleting reports either through the UI or through a URL construct. See [Access control list rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control-rules.md) for more information.

When you select **Average**, **Sum** or **Count Distinct**, you can select from a list of additional fields whose values you want to use to aggregate the data. Typical values to use as an average or a sum are the time measurements, such as **Business duration** \(expressed in days, hours, and minutes\) and **Resolve time** \(expressed in seconds\). Other fields, such as **Priority**, have numerical values associated with their levels and can be used as aggregators.**Note:** Averages are calculated by dividing the sum of all fields by the number of those fields that contain a value. Fields that are empty or that contain a light gray zero are not included in the field count that is used when dividing the sum.
