# Reporting roles

Reporting is installed with roles that limit report creation. Access control lists \(ACLs\) can also limit report viewing and creation.

**Note:**

-   Users must have the report\_user role to see the **Reports** module on the application navigator \(left navigation pane\).
-   Users with any reporting role or the itil role can access the following report options for all reports that are visible to them: **Insert**, **Insert and Stay**, **Add to Dashboard**, and **Export to PDF**.

To learn more about managing per-user subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md) and contact your account representative.

In the following table, the term manage indicates access to the following report options: **Update**, **Delete**, and **Export settings**.

## Access with no roles

Can view reports that are shared with them.

## Reporting access with ACL

The report\_view access controls on tables and fields limits the ability to read, edit and create reports. Administrators can create other ACL rules. You need a role that gives you access to the data that is the subject of the report. For more information, see [Restrict report creation with an ACL rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_RestrictRepCreationWAnACLRule.md) and [Report\_view access control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/report-view-access-control.md).

**Note:** The Report Publisher \[report\_publisher\] and Report Alias Administrator \[report\_alias\_admin\] roles also exist, but support deactivated functions.
