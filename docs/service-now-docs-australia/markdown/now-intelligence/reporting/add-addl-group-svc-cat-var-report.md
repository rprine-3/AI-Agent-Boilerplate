# Add additional group by variables to a service catalog report

You can create reports grouped by any field with an additional group by variable on a selected service catalog item. In addition, you can create filters on the same variable. For example, if a mobile phone item has a storage variable, you can create a report that only shows those phones with 32 GB of storage.

## Before you begin

Roles required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

## About this task

You can apply these steps to any report type as long as the report source has variables associated with it. If the report source doesn’t have variables, the **Variables** option doesn’t display in the **Additional group by** filter.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **New**.

2.  On the **Data** tab, give the report a name that reflects the information being grouped.

3.  Select a report source that has variables associated with it.

    There are two kinds of report sources.

    |Report source|Description|
    |-------------|-----------|
    |Data source|A table with filters applied to provide a single source of information for all users.|
    |Table|The raw data from a table with no filters applied.|

4.  Select **Next**.

5.  On the **Type** tab, select the report type and select **Next**.

6.  On the **Configure** tab, select a **Group by** filter.

7.  Select **Additional group by**.

8.  Select **Variables \[+\]** and select the structure icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_ShowReportStructureIcon.png"\] Alt text: Report structure icon\) to choose an item.

    \[Omitted image "additional-group-by-variable.png"\] Alt text: Additional group by slushbucket

9.  Select a **Catalog item**.

    The variables associated with the item appear in the **Additional group by** window.\[Omitted image "additional-group-by-selected-variables.png"\] Alt text: Additional group by variables

10. Add the desired variables to the **Selected** column and select **OK**.

11. Continue to configure and style the report according to its report type.
