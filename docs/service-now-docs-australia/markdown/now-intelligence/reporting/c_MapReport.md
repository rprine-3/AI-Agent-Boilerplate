# Map reports

Map reports display data on a map. You can display data as a geographical heatmap \(\[Omitted image "MapReportHeatmapButton.png"\] Alt text: Map report icon\) or view specific data points \(\[Omitted image "MapPinLocationsButton.png"\] Alt text: The pin locations icon for map reports\).

Zoom in on a map to get a more detailed view. In heatmap mode, click any region on the map that contains data to drill down into its map.

**Note:** On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Exploring the Data Visualizations library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/explore-data-vis-library.md).

Save the map report to drill down into it. You cannot drill down into unsaved reports.

The lowest level of a map hierarchy can display only data points. Click data on this lowest level to see the data in list view, or in drill-down view if one has been configured.

## Limitations

-   Maps are not supported on Internet Explorer versions 7 and 8.
-   Map reports cannot be saved as images on Internet Explorer versions 7 to 9, Firefox versions 31 to 37, Safari 5, or all versions of the Edge browser. For best results, use Chrome to work with map reports.
-   Map reports cannot be exported as PDFs, but can be saved as images.
-   This report type cannot be run as a scheduled report.

## Create a map report

Create a map report to plot your data on geographical heatmap or with pin locations for specific data points.

### Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **New**.

2.  On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Differences between Core UI and Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/differences-between-core-ui-ne-dbs.md).

3.  On the **Data** tab, give the report a name that reflects the information being grouped.

4.  Select the applicable source for the report.

<table id="choicetable_t31_tst_1x"><tbody><tr><td id="d215213e267">

**Data source**

</td><td>

Also called a report source, a data source is a table with filters applied to provide a single source of information for all users. For more information, see [Report sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_ReportSources.md).**Note:** If you select a data source used by existing reports, a notification prompts you to view them.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d215213e286">

**Table**

</td><td>

The raw data from a table with no filters applied. When you select a table, its short description appears below the table name. For trend reporting, you can also select a remote table, which aggregates, in memory, data retrieved from an external source. Then select a **Trend by** field option to aggregate its data. To learn more about remote tables, see [Retrieving external data using remote tables and scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/remote-tables.md)

</td></tr><tr><td id="d215213e305">

**External import**

</td><td>

Choose an existing imported report source, or select the Upload icon \(\[Omitted image "upload-icon.png"\] Alt text: Upload icon\) to import a new file. See [Create a Core UI report from an imported Microsoft Excel document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/create-report-with-imported-data-source.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d215213e330">

**MetricBase**

</td><td>

MetricBase enables you to collect, retain, analyze, and visualize custom time series data on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [MetricBase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/metricbase.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select **Next**.

6.  On the **Type** tab, enter **Map** in the filter, select the report type, and click **Next**.

    The application shows a preliminary version of the report. To view the updated report at any time, select **Run**.

7.  On the **Configure** tab, fill in the following fields and select **Next**.

Display data table

</td><td>

Select this option to show report data in a list below the report. The list appears on dashboards where the report is added.All report visualizations show the report data when the [glide.ui.section508](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md) system property is set to **true**. The glide.ui.section508 property overrides the **Display data table** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Configure function field

</td><td>

Configure fields based on calculation of multiple inputs including arithmetic functions. For more information, see [Report on function fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/function-fields-reporting.md). Function field results are calculated when the report is run. You can use the results for aggregations and grouping. You have to save the report before you can configure function fields.Configured function fields appear in the **Group by** and **Additional group by** lists after you save the report.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregation

</td><td>

Mathematical calculation to perform on the data. The default is **Count**, which shows the number of records selected.To show only unique records, select **Count Distinct**.

 Select **Average**, **Sum**, or **Count Distinct**, to show a list of fields from the selected **Table**. Select a field to **Aggregate by** from this list.

 If you group the report by a field and select an **Average** aggregate, you get the average of each group. If a Total value is shown, it is the average of these group averages, not of the individual field values.

 Select **Minimum** or **Maximum** to show the maximum or minimum value for each segment of the report.

 For more information on aggregation options, see [Aggregation in reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/aggregation-reporting.md).

 If you choose **Average**,**Sum**, **Count Distinct**, **Minimum**, or **Maximum**, you may be able to aggregate on fields from extended tables. See [How to report on extended tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_AccessFieldExtendedTable.md).

 For information about aggregating on FX currency values, see [FX Currency values in reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/fx-currency-values-reporting.md).

</table>8.  To limit the information displayed in the report, select the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "List\_FilterIcon.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon\) and specify conditions to filter the report data.

    To learn how to construct conditions, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).

    **Note:** In aggregated and list reports, language-dependent filter conditions may return zero results on localized instances.
