# View the Reports list

View a list of reports and create reports from the Reports list.

Standard platform Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) govern access to reports in the reports list. For information about the ACLs used to control access to reports, see [Access control list rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control-rules.md).

**Note:** On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. For more information, see [Exploring the Data Visualizations library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/explore-data-vis-library.md).

You can sort and filter the search results using the standard report list controls, by selecting tabs, column headings, or the favorites icon \(\[Omitted image "ModuleStarSelect.png"\] Alt text: Module star select\).

Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** to open the Reports list. Select the gear icon \(\[Omitted image "Cogwheel.png"\] Alt text: Gear icon\) next to the **New** button to configure the columns displayed in the Reports list.

\[Omitted image "list-configuration.png"\] Alt text: Report list configuration window

You can filter the Reports list with the following tabs:

|Tab|Description|
|---|-----------|
|My reports|Reports that you created.|
|Group|Reports that have been shared with you and with the groups that you are a member of.|
|Global|Reports that are available to everyone.|
|All|All reports that you have access to \(Global, Group, and My reports\).|

Select the star icon \(\[Omitted image "favorites-icon.png"\] Alt text: Favorites icon.\) to show only your Favorites in the Reports list. Select the X next to **Favorites filtering is on** to show all reports you are allowed to see.

\[Omitted image "view-create-list.png"\] Alt text: The reports list - only favorites shown

If you have the report\_admin or admin roles, you also see these columns on the Reports list.

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Scheduled|Indicates that the report is scheduled to run in the future. You can schedule regular emailing of reports.|
|Published|If the report is published, this column shows a check mark \(\[Omitted image "True.png"\] Alt text: True\).|

## Viewing favorite reports

You can show either all reports or only those reports marked as favorites. Reports can be marked favorite both automatically and manually.

To toggle between showing only favorite reports and showing all reports, click the favorites icon \(\[Omitted image "ModuleStarSelect.png"\] Alt text: Module star select\) in the list header.

**Note:** Favorites filtering is persistent. If you chose to show only favorites the last time you viewed the Reports list, then only favorites are shown the next time. Click the favorites icon or the **Favorites filtering is on** button to show all reports you have the rights to view in the selected category. The **My reports** category is selected by default when you open the Reports list.

\[Omitted image "report-favorites-3.png"\] Alt text: Report favorites

A report is automatically marked as a favorite when you open it. You can manually mark a report as a favorite by clicking the star icon beside the report title.

To turn off the automatic marking of reports as favorites, disable the user preference glide.ui.nav.auto\_favorite. For more information, see [User preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_UserPreferences.md) .

## View report owners

Report owners are not shown by default on the reports list, but you can add a column to show the user who created the report. Usually, the creator is the owner. The owner is also the person responsible for the process - the meaning of the data underlying the visualization.
