2.  From the More actions menu \[Omitted image "icon-paw-more-actions.png"\], select **Export**.

</table>4.  Under **Delivery**, select **Download file** or **Send file via email**.

    -   When you choose to download the file, a **Download** button is available after the export is complete. The file, named `<visualization-name>.<filetype>`, is downloaded to your default local destination.
    -   When you send the file by email, you can select users and groups on your instance or any allowed email address. Security constraints may restrict who you can email. You also must specify a subject, and you can add a message. When you are done, select **Export**.

        **Note:** To send email to persons who are not on your instance, make sure outbound email is configured. See [Outbound Email Configuration](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/xanadu/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_xanadu_automating_application_logic/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_xanadu_notifications/app_store_learnv2_automatingapps_xanadu_outbound_email_configuration) in the Developer Site.


## Result

When the export is complete, you see either a download link or a message that the export will be delivered to the recipient.
