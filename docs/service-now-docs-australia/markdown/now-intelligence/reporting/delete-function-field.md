# Deactivate a function field

The user who created a function field or a user with the admin role can deactivate it. If a table already has 20 function fields, you must deactivate one or more existing fields before creating another.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, function\_field\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Platform Analytics Administration** &gt; **Core UI artifacts** &gt; **Reports.**

2.  Select the report with the function field to deactivate.

3.  Open the **Configure** tab and select **Configure function field**.

4.  Enter text in the **Search functions** box to find the function field you want to deactivate.

5.  Select the function field and choose **Deactivate**.

    If one or more reports or visualizations uses the function field, you see a link to a list of those reports. You can review the list, choose **Deactivate anyway**, or select **Cancel**.

6.  Confirm the deactivation or cancel.


## Result

The deactivated function field is no longer available for use in the reports on the table that it was based on.

**Note:** When you deactivate a field, the user list preference is deleted.
