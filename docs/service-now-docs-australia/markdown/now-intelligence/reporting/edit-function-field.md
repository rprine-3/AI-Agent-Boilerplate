# Edit a function field

The user who created a function field or a user with the admin or function\_field\_admin role can edit the definition of a saved function field. It isn’t possible to edit the label or the return type of a saved function field.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, function\_field\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Platform Analytics Administration** &gt; **Core UI artifacts** &gt; **Reports.**

2.  Select a report based on the table that you want to edit a function field on.

    When you configure a function field, it is available in any report or data visualization on the same table. For example, a function field that calculates how long incidents have been open is available for all reports and visualizations on the incident table.

3.  Open the **Configure** tab and select **Configure function field**.

4.  Enter text in the **Search functions** box to find the function field you want to edit.

    Search functionality searches on the Label of the field, the name of the field, and the function definition.

5.  Select a new operation, new fields the function operates on, or both.

    Validation of the edited function may indicate that it returns an invalid result.

6.  Select **Save**.

    If one or more reports use the function field, you see a link to a list of those reports. You can review the list, select **Save anyway**, or select **Cancel**.


## Result

The results of the edited function field replace the old results in all reports in which the function field is used.
