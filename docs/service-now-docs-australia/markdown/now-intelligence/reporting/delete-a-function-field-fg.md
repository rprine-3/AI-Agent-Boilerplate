# Delete a function field

A user with the admin role can delete a function field from its table. Deleting a function field is useful if you want to create a function field with the same name as one that exists on that table.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, function\_field\_admin

Function fields are stored as columns on the table that you create them on. To delete a function field, you delete the associated column.

**Important:** &gt;No check is made on a where a function field is used when you delete. In addition, deleting a function field is not reversible.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Tables**.

2.  Select the table with the function field that you want to delete.

3.  Select the column to open its form.

4.  Select **Delete Column**.

    You can only delete the column if the **Column name** begins with `u_` or `x_`. If the **Column name** begins with something else, it was created by ServiceNow support. Contact support to delete it.


## Result

The function field is deleted and can no longer be used in data visualizations.
