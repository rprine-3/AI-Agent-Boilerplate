# Aggregate a report on sum

When you create a report, you can aggregate the data on several calculations including the number of records, averages, and standard deviation. The sum aggregation shows the sum of the field you aggregate on.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

## Sum

Select **Sum** to show the sum of the field you aggregate on. For example, select a duration field. The aggregated data is expressed in terms of days, hours, minutes, and seconds. \(You can configure durations to show the level of detail you want.\) Select an integer field, such as **Priority**, and the data is expressed as a whole number.
