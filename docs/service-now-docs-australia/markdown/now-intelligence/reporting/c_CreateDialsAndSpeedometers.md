# Dial and speedometer reports

Dials and speedometers provide a real-time count for an indicator. These charts cannot contain comparison or historical data. You can configure colors to display at a glance that values are within specified ranges.

**Note:** On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Exploring the Data Visualizations library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/explore-data-vis-library.md).

Report creators often use red to indicate unacceptable value ranges. A low value for monthly sales is worse than a high value, but a low value for incident resolution times is better than a high value. You can configure red for low monthly sales values and red for high incident resolution values.

Dials and speedometers also have different appearances:

-   A speedometer shows numbers in the form of a round meter with a defined range.
-   A dial shows where a score falls across ranges on a half-circle dial.

## Create a dial or speedometer report

Create a dial or speedometer to provide a real-time count for an indicator, with colors to indicate value ranges.

### Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **New**.

2.  On the **Data** tab, give the report a name that reflects the information being grouped.

3.  Select the applicable source for the report.

<table id="choicetable_t31_tst_1x"><tbody><tr><td id="d201488e244">

**Data source**

</td><td>

Also called a report source, a data source is a table with filters applied to provide a single source of information for all users. For more information, see [Report sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_ReportSources.md).**Note:** If you select a data source used by existing reports, a notification prompts you to view them.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d201488e263">

**Table**

</td><td>

The raw data from a table with no filters applied. When you select a table, its short description appears below the table name. For trend reporting, you can also select a remote table, which aggregates, in memory, data retrieved from an external source. Then select a **Trend by** field option to aggregate its data. To learn more about remote tables, see [Retrieving external data using remote tables and scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/remote-tables.md)

</td></tr><tr><td id="d201488e282">

**External import**

</td><td>

Choose an existing imported report source, or select the Upload icon \(\[Omitted image "upload-icon.png"\] Alt text: Upload icon\) to import a new file. See [Create a Core UI report from an imported Microsoft Excel document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/create-report-with-imported-data-source.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d201488e307">

**MetricBase**

</td><td>

MetricBase enables you to collect, retain, analyze, and visualize custom time series data on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [MetricBase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/metricbase.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  On the **Type** tab, enter **Speedometer** or **Dial** in the filter, select the report type, and click **Next**.

    The application shows a preliminary version of the report. To view the updated report at any time, select **Run**.

5.  On the **Configure** tab, fill in the following fields and select **Next**.

<table id="table_p4s_mql_x4"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Configure function field

</td><td>

Configure fields based on calculation of multiple inputs including arithmetic functions. For more information, see [Report on function fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/function-fields-reporting.md). Function field results are calculated when the report is run. You can use the results for aggregations and grouping. You have to save the report before you can configure function fields.Configured function fields appear in the **Group by** and **Additional group by** lists after you save the report.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregation

</td><td>

Mathematical calculation to perform on the data. The default is **Count**, which shows the number of records selected.To show only unique records, select **Count Distinct**. For example, if you want a report on the distinct number of users who have one or more of the roles in a given list of roles. Users with more than one role would be counted twice unless you use **Count Distinct**.

 Select **Average**, **Sum**, or **Count Distinct**, to show a list of fields from the selected **Table**. Select a field to **Aggregate by** from this list. For example, if you select an integer field, such as **Priority**, the data is expressed as a decimal value number.

 If you choose **Average**,**Sum**, or **Count Distinct**, you may further be able to aggregate on fields from extended tables. See [How to report on extended tables.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_AccessFieldExtendedTable.md)

 **Note:** For duration values, the unit of measurement displayed in the aggregation axis cannot be customized.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  To limit the information displayed in the report, select the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "List\_FilterIcon.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon\) and specify conditions to filter the report data.

    To learn how to construct conditions, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).

    **Note:** In aggregated and list reports, language-dependent filter conditions may return zero results on localized instances.

7.  On the **Style** tab, fill in the fields as appropriate to configure the appearance of the report.

8.  Select **Save** to continue editing the visualization, or **Save and close** to return to the Analytics Overview main screen.


### What to do next

-   Select the Report info icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_ReferenceLookupIcon.png"\] Alt text: Info icon\) and add a description of the report.
-   Select the sharing icon \(\[Omitted image "ShareIcon.png"\] Alt text: Sharing icon\) to open the **Sharing** menu. On this menu, you can add the report to a dashboard, export the report to PDF, publish the report to the web, and set visibility and schedules.

Choose whether lower or larger numbers are better. Select **Minimize** if lower numbers are better. Select **Maximize** if larger numbers are better. This setting works with **Lower Limit** and **Upper Limit**, which determine the colors for the areas in the dial or speedometer. -   Green indicates that the figures are acceptable.
-   Orange indicates that the figures have changed, but are still within the acceptable range.
-   Red indicates that the figures are not acceptable.

The upper threshold for color change on the dial or speedometer. If it uses only two colors, specify the same number for both lower and upper limits.For example, a dial contains a current score of 50 and **Dial Autoscale** is selected. The **Lower Limit** is set to 50 and **Upper Limit** is set to 100 and the direction is **Minimize**. The dial displays the area 0–50 in green, the area 50–100 in orange, and the area above 100 in red.

 If **Lower Limit** is set to 50, **Upper Limit** is set to 100 and the direction is **Maximize**, the colors are reversed.
