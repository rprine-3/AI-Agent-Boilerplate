# Pareto reports

Pareto charts help you identify the most important dimension in a large set of dimensions. Columns show data in descending order. A line shows cumulative percentage.

Pareto charts contain both bar and line graphs. The bars display the data in descending order from left to right, and the line graph shows the cumulative totals from each category in the same order. The left Y axis is the record count, and the right Y axis is the cumulative percentage of the total number of records evaluated. The blue line at the 80% mark helps determine which data is the most influential in the process. The data to the left of the intersection of the line graph and the 80% mark have the greatest effect on the overall outcome.

**Note:** On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Exploring the Data Visualizations library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/explore-data-vis-library.md).

The figure below shows that five callers account for 80% of the incident calls, while seven account for the other 20%.

## Create a Pareto report

Create a Pareto report to identify the most important factors in a large set of factors. Columns show data in descending order while a curve shows cumulative percentage.

### Before you begin

Role required: itil, report\_user, report\_group, report\_global, report\_admin, or admin. To create a meaningful report, you must have the right to access the data you want to report on.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations** and select **New**.

2.  On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Differences between Core UI and Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/differences-between-core-ui-ne-dbs.md).

3.  On the **Data** tab, give the report a name that reflects the information being grouped.

4.  Select the applicable source for the report.

<table id="choicetable_t31_tst_1x"><tbody><tr><td id="d140667e266">

**Data source**

</td><td>

Also called a report source, a data source is a table with filters applied to provide a single source of information for all users. For more information, see [Report sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_ReportSources.md).**Note:** If you select a data source used by existing reports, a notification prompts you to view them.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d140667e285">

**Table**

</td><td>

The raw data from a table with no filters applied. When you select a table, its short description appears below the table name. For trend reporting, you can also select a remote table, which aggregates, in memory, data retrieved from an external source. Then select a **Trend by** field option to aggregate its data. To learn more about remote tables, see [Retrieving external data using remote tables and scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/remote-tables.md)

</td></tr><tr><td id="d140667e304">

**External import**

</td><td>

Choose an existing imported report source, or select the Upload icon \(\[Omitted image "upload-icon.png"\] Alt text: Upload icon\) to import a new file. See [Create a Core UI report from an imported Microsoft Excel document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/create-report-with-imported-data-source.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d140667e329">

**MetricBase**

</td><td>

MetricBase enables you to collect, retain, analyze, and visualize custom time series data on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [MetricBase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/metricbase.md).

</td></tr></tbody>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Group by

</td><td>

Group report data using the values of this field. For example, in an incident report grouped by **Assignment group**, all incidents that belong to Software, Service Desk, and Network are placed in separate groups. To group by fields on extended tables, see [How to report on extended tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_AccessFieldExtendedTable.md). Select the info icon \[Omitted image "icon-info.png"\] for a description of the selected field. Configured function fields appear in this list after you save the report.

 **Note:**

-   It is not possible to group or stack reports by the **Tags** field, or by certain MySQL database field types, such as MEDIUMTEXT. For more information, see [Database field type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_DatabaseFieldTypes.md).
-   Grouping or stacking by Variables or Questions fields is not supported for reports based on [database views](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md).


</td></tr><tr><td>

Additional group by

</td><td>

Extra fields to group the report by. When you select **Additional group by** fields or function fields, the report includes a control at the bottom that allows you to group the report by any one of the additional fields. To group by fields on extended tables as well, see [How to report on extended tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/t_AccessFieldExtendedTable.md). Select the info icon \[Omitted image "icon-info.png"\] for descriptions of the selected fields Configured function fields appear in this list after you save the report.

**Note:**

-   You can see choices in the **Additional group by** list that do not appear in the main **Group by** list. The report does not support grouping or stacking by the extra fields you see. Unlike the main **Group by** choices, the **Additional group by** fields are not filtered. If you select an unsupported field, it has no effect.
-   The limitations listed for the main **Group by** field also apply to the **Additional group by** field.
 For more information, see [Add an additional group by or stack by](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/add-additional-group-by-stack-by.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Display data table

</td><td>

Select this option to show report data in a list below the report. The list appears on dashboards where the report is added.All report visualizations show the report data when the [glide.ui.section508](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md) system property is set to **true**. The glide.ui.section508 property overrides the **Display data table** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Configure function field

</td><td>

Configure fields based on calculation of multiple inputs including arithmetic functions. For more information, see [Report on function fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/function-fields-reporting.md). Function field results are calculated when the report is run. You can use the results for aggregations and grouping. You have to save the report before you can configure function fields.Configured function fields appear in the **Group by** and **Additional group by** lists after you save the report.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max number of groups

</td><td>

Maximum number of groups that the **Group by** condition returns. The groups with highest values are shown first. Any groups beyond the limit are combined into the single group **Other**.If you select **Show all**, all groups up to a limit of 50 are displayed. The rest of the results are grouped as **Other**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Show Other

</table>8.  Configure the sort order of the applicable fields in the report \(column, row, Group by, Stack by or Trend by depending on the report type\).

    Select the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "List\_FilterIcon.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon for lists\) and choose **Add Sort**.

    1.  In the Sorting Order list, choose the field you want to sort on and then choose **a-z** or **z-a** for alphabetical order or reverse alphabetical order.

        The list contains all possible fields from the report's source and fields on extended, or related, tables. The only effective values, however, are the fields chosen for the current report \(column, row, Group by, Stack by, or Trend by depending on the report type\).

        **Note:** On fields from dot-walked \(extended\) tables, you can only sort on date fields.

    2.  Select the sort plus icon \(\[Omitted image "sort-order-plus-icon.png"\] Alt text: Sort plus icon\) to configure additional sorting order conditions. \(Select the sort minus icon \( \[Omitted image "sort-order-minus-icon.png"\] Alt text: Sort minus icon\) to delete configured sorting order conditions.\)
    3.  Select **Save**.
    For fields of the type Choice list, sort order is not determined alphabetically based on Label, it is sorted based on the **Value** of the choice field. For multi-level pivot table and heatmap reports, sort order is determined by the sequence of the choices in the list.

    \[Omitted image "choice-list-sort-order.png"\] Alt text: Report sorted by priority choice list

9.  To limit the information displayed in the report, select the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "List\_FilterIcon.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon\) and specify conditions to filter the report data.
