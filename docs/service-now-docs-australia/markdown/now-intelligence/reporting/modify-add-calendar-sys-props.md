# Modifying and adding calendar report system properties

Specify system property values to override Task table highlighting in calendar events, limit the number of events in a calendar cell, or change the day the calendar week starts.

## Override Task table field styles for highlighting calendar events

Highlighting for calendar report events is configured with field styles, which are defined for a particular table. You can configure whether calendar reports use field styles from the tables or report sources that they are based on.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

By default, field styles in the Task \[task\] table are applied to calendar reports. If calendar reports are configured to use field styles from their tables or report sources, these field styles override the Task table styles.

**Note:** Calendar highlighting only applies to Core UI reports, not to Platform Analytics experience data visualizations.

### Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator, enter: `sys_properties.list`

2.  Select the **glide.ui.report.extend\_calendar\_choices** property to specify which field styles are used during calendar highlighting.

    -   If `false`, calendar reports will use only styles from the Task table when determining options for calendar highlighting. For example, a calendar report on the Change Request \[change\_request\] table will only use styles from the Task \[task\] table instead of styles from a the combination of the two tables.
    -   If `True`, calendar reports will use field styles from the table that the calendar report is based on.
3.  Click **Update**.

## Limit the number of events displayed on calendar days

In calendar reports, you can configure the maximum number of events that appear in some calendar views.

### Before you begin

Role required: report\_admin, admin.

### About this task

When the maximum number of events is exceeded, a **+ &lt;number&gt;** link appears, which opens a pop-up window with additional events. You can also configure the maximum number of events that appear in this pop-up window. When this maximum is exceeded, a **+ many** link appears, which opens a list of events instead of a pop-up window.

You can configure these settings for the following calendar views:

-   A calendar day when calendar is in month or year view
-   The top 'full day' section of a calendar day when a calendar is in day or week view

### Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Configure the **glide.report.calendar.max\_events\_displayed\_per\_cell** and **glide.report.calendar.max\_more\_events\_per\_day** properties.

3.  Click **Update**.

## Change the day that calendar weeks start on

By default, weeks for calendar reports start on Sunday. You can add a system property to start weeks on Sunday or another day instead.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

The **glide.ui.date\_format.first\_day\_of\_week** system property modifies the generated date/time value used in the query and sets the start day of the week in the rendered calender.

**Note:**

**glide.ui.filter.first\_day\_of\_week** must also be set to the same value as **glide.ui.date\_format.first\_day\_of\_week** for the set day to display properly.

If you change the **glide.ui.filter.first\_day\_of\_week** property after collecting Performance Analytics score data, you won't be able to view the scores for weekly indicators. To access them, you must [collect scores](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/c_ClctData.md) again.

### Procedure

1.  Add the **glide.ui.date\_format.first\_day\_of\_week** system property.

2.  Set one of the following integer values.

<table id="choicetable_mmt_yv3_55"><tbody><tr><td id="d222145e356">

**Start weeks on Sunday**

</td><td>

Set **Value** to `1`

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e371">

**Start weeks on Monday**

</td><td>

Set **Value** to `2`

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e386">

**Start weeks on Tuesday**

</td><td>

Set **Value** to `3`

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e401">

**Start weeks on Wednesday**

</td><td>

Set **Value** to `4`

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e416">

**Start weeks on Thursday**

</td><td>

Set **Value** to `5`

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e432">

**Start weeks on Friday**

</td><td>

Set **Value** to `6`

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e447">

**Start weeks on Saturday**

</td><td>

Set **Value** to `7`

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:** Only Sunday and Monday are explicitly supported.

3.  Click **Submit**.


### What to do next

Configure the system property **glide.db.week\_numbering** to specify how weeks are calculated. For more information, see [Customize calendar weeks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/modify-add-calendar-sys-props.md).

## Customize calendar weeks

Configure a system property to specify how calendar week numbers are determined.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Add the **glide.db.week\_numbering** system property.

    For more information, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).

3.  Set one of the following string values.

<table id="choicetable_mmt_yv3_55"><tbody><tr><td id="d222145e598">

**iso\_week**

</td><td>

Week 1 is the week with January 4, the first business day, or the first Thursday in it. \(These are mutually equivalent.\) There is no Week 00.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e607">

**sunday\_week**

</td><td>

Week 1 is the week with the first Sunday of the year. Days before it are in Week 0.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e616">

**monday\_week**

</td><td>

Week 1 is the week with the first Monday of the year. Days before it are in Week 0.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e625">

**jan1\_week**

</td><td>

Week 1 is Jan 1-7; the next seven days are week 2, and so on.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Select **Submit**.


## Set calendar record limit

By default, calendar reports save up to 10,000 records. Change this limit by setting the **glide.ui.max\_calendar\_records** system property. If the number of records fetched exceeds this limit, you are prompted to filter the data and run the report again.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  Add the **glide.ui.max\_calendar\_records** system property.

2.  Complete the form with the following values.

<table id="choicetable_xm2_5rq_y1b"><tbody><tr><td id="d222145e724">

**Name**

</td><td>

**glide.ui.max\_calendar\_records**

</td></tr><tr><td id="d222145e736">

**Description**

</td><td>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Click **Submit**.
