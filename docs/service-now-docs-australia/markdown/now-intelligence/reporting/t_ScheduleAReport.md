# Schedule emails of Core UI reports

Generate and distribute scheduled reports via email.

## Before you begin

Role required: report\_scheduler, report\_admin, admin

This topic refers to Reporting in the Core UI. For instances migrated to Platform Analytics experience and new Australia instances, see [Schedule the export of data visualizations or dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/schedule-visn-export-vd.md).

## About this task

Scheduled reports can be distributed in PDF, CSV, or XLS format. Graphical reports can be distributed in PNG or PDF format. Multilevel pivot reports can only be scheduled in PDF format.

This topic refers to Reporting in the Core UI. If your instance is migrated to Platform Analytics experience, see [Export a data visualization from the Visualization Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/export-visualization-vd.md).

**Note:**

-   It is not possible to schedule Calendar, Map, or Single Score reports. You can schedule Pivot Table reports only if the plug-in **com.snc.whtp** is enabled.
-   Data may not appear on reports created by an individual whose user account is deactivated. To ensure that the desired data appears, an active user must recreate the scheduled report.
-   On Oracle DB instances, scheduled emails are not generated when the combined filter conditions on the report exceed 4,000 characters.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics experience** &gt; **Schedules** &gt; **Scheduled Reports**.

    On instances with Unified Analytics enabled, and on new Australia instances, both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations are found in the Platform Analytics library. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. For more information, see [Differences between Core UI and Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/differences-between-core-ui-ne-dbs.md).

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields, as appropriate.

<table id="table_a2v_qyg_mp"><thead><tr><th>

Field

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the scheduled report.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Report

</td><td>

Reference to the report you are scheduling. You can use the Search icon \[Omitted image "SearchIcon.png"\] Alt text: Search icon to locate the report.**Note:** Automatic email support is not available for Calendar, Map, and Single Score reports.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Users

</td><td>

Individual users who receive the report at the scheduled date and time. Users must have **Notification** set to **Enabled** on their user records to receive reports.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Groups

</td><td>

Groups that receive the report at the scheduled date and time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Email addresses

</td><td>

Comma-separated list of email addresses of report recipients who are not users on your instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application

</td><td>

Name of the scoped application that contains the report. **Global** appears if the report is in the global scope.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

When active, scheduled reports are delivered.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Run

</td><td>

Time interval to use for running the scheduled job:

-   **Daily**: Runs daily, at a designated time.
-   **Day and Month in Year**: Runs yearly on a specific day and month \(for example, July 14\), at a designated time.
-   **Day in Week in Month in Year**: Runs yearly on a specific day of the week in a specific week of a specific month \(for example, the second Monday in October\), at a designated time.
-   **Week in Month**: Runs monthly during a specific week of the month \(for example, the third week of each month\), on designated days and at a designated time.
-   **Weekly**: Runs on a weekly basis, at a designated time and day of the week.
-   **Monthly**: Runs on a monthly basis, at a designated time and day of the month.
-   **Periodically**: Runs on a designated repeating interval.
-   **Once**: Runs for a single occurrence only.
-   **On Demand**: Runs immediately on demand.
-   **Business Calendar: Entry Start**: Runs on the starting entry dates for the business calendar that you select in the **Business Calendar** field. A scheduled job runs for the starting date of each of the business entries that you defined for the business calendar.

For example, if the business calendar represents a fiscal year, and the starting date of each entry is a fiscal month, the scheduled job runs on the first day of each month.

-   **Business Calendar: Entry End**: Runs for the ending date for the business calendar that you select in the **Business Calendar** field. This selection runs in the same manner as **Business Calendar: Entry Start**, but for the end dates of the associated business calendar entries.

**Note:** When you select **Business Calendar: Entry Start** or **Business Calendar: Entry End**, you can apply an offset factor to schedule the job to run before or after the time span of the selected business calendar. If you select a business calendar and all its business calendar spans are in the past, the job would never run since that is an invalid configuration. To learn more, see the **Offset type** and **Offset** fields.

To learn more about creating and using business calendars and defining business calendar entries, see [Creating business calendars](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/business-calendars.md) and [Define business calendar entries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/define-business-calendar-entries.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Time zone

</td><td>

Time zone to use with the **Time** field entry when you specify the time at which the scheduled job should run. Select a time zone entry:

For example, the scheduled job runs at 04:45 p.m. US/Pacific time if it’s the user's assigned time zone, and you enter `16:45` into the **Time** field.

-   **Use System Time Zone**: Use the default system time zone that is specified for the instance in which it runs.

For example, the scheduled job runs at 10:15 p.m. London time if Europe/London is the default system time zone for the instance, and you enter `22:15` in the **Time** field.

-   Actual time zone.

For example, the scheduled job runs at 1:30 p.m. in the US Eastern time zone if you select **US/Eastern**, and enter `13:30` in the **Time** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</table>## The "Run as" user and scheduled report emails

If you are on a domain-separated instance, scheduled reports are generated using the "Run as" user's permissions.

By default, the user who sets up the scheduled email report is the "Run as" user. This user's domain access and report\_view ACL permissions apply when generating the scheduled reports.

If the data in the scheduled report is different than expected, the user who set up the scheduled report is not an appropriate "Run as" user. An admin or report\_admin can specify a different "Run as" user.

**Warning:** The "Run as" user requires the appropriate report\_view ACL permission to schedule the report. There may also be a security risk in setting this user. Consider consulting Customer Service and Support if setting the "Run as" user.
