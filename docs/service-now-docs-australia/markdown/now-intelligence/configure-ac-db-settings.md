# Configure Platform Analytics dashboard settings

You can set refresh interval details and background colors, enable data caching to speed page refreshes, and choose which Insights cards to show.

## Before you begin

Role required: dashboard\_admin for all dashboards, or any role for dashboards that you own or ones that you have been given the right to edit. See [Platform Analytics dashboard roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/pa-dashboard-roles.md) for more information about viewing and editing rights on dashboards. Additionally, dashboard\_admin is required to schedule automated refreshes even of dashboards that you own.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  In the **Dashboards** library, choose the dashboard you want to configure.

3.  Select **Edit** to enter editing mode.

4.  Select the settings button \(\[Omitted image "icon-cogwheel-ac.png"\] Alt text: Settings icon\) to open the **Settings** panel.

    \[Omitted image "dashboard-settings.png"\] Alt text: Dashboard settings panel.

5.  Change any of the following settings.

    -   Edit the **Refresh** options.

        Users with the dashboard\_admin role or higher can configure automatic refreshes of the dashboard.

        -   **Show refresh information**

            Displays the last time the dashboard was refreshed under the dashboard title. This information updates when the dashboard is automatically refreshed and when a user selects the refresh button \[Omitted image "icon-db-refresh.png"\].

        -   **Scheduled repetition**

            Specify in minutes or hours how often the dashboard is reloaded. Applies only while the dashboard is open. When you navigate away from the dashboard, including opening a new browser or browser tab, the interval is paused until you return to the dashboard. Requires the dashboard\_admin or higher.

            **Note:**

            Do not confuse this setting with the **Refresh after being away for X minutes** option on data visualizations. This latter option takes effect when you navigate away from a dashboard containing the data visualization to another page in the same workspace or experience. If you navigate back to the dashboard after the specified number of minutes, the data visualization automatically refreshes.

        -   **Enable data cache**

            shorten the load time on page refreshes for data visualizations based on table or indicator data. Data caching also applies to indicator scorecards. The dashboard uses the cached data instead of querying the database when the page is refreshed.

            **Note:**

            -   Enabling **Scheduled repetition** turns off data caching and vice versa.
            -   Enabling **Real time update** or **Refresh after being away for X min** on a data visualization overrides caching for that visualization. If this option is subsequently turned off, the currently cached value is shown, if it hasn't expired.
            Data caches have an expiration time. When the page is refreshed and the cached data has expired, fresh data is queried and cached. When data caching is enabled, you can set the length of time for cached data to be valid in **Cached expiration time**. Options are 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 24 hours.

            You can manually refresh the cached data for either the whole dashboard or a data visualization by refreshing either the dashboard or the visualization, respectively.

    -   In the **Presentation** section, set the margins of each element and edit the background color of one or more tabs on the dashboard.

        Select a color from a list of preconfigured colors, or use the color palette to specify a color. If there are multiple tabs, you can choose to customize the backgrounds of each tab.

    -   In the **Dashboard Summary** section, choose whether to enable AI summary generation.

        When you select **AI summary generation**, viewers see a banner with a button to generate a summary of the contents of the dashboard, including the visualizations, filters, and other elements. The summary also includes highlights and what has changed in the dashboard since the last summary generation request. You can also add the ServiceNow Otto context menu as an individual component to dashboard or individual dashboard tabs.

    -   Choose whether and which analytics to show in the **Insights** section.

        When you select **Show insights panel**, an **Insights** button is added to the dashboard. When a viewer presses this button, insights cards corresponding to the selected analytics options are shown.
