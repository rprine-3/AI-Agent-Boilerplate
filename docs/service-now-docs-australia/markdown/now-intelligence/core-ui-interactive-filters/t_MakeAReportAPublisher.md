# Make a report act as an interactive filter

You can configure an existing report widget to filter other report widgets on the same dashboard.

## Before you begin

Role required: report\_admin

Only reports with a **Type** value of pie, donut, semi donut, funnel, or pyramid can act as interactive filters.

**Note:**

-   This documentation refers to Core UI reports and responsive dashboards. For information about making Platform Analytics data visualizations act as filters on dashboards, see [Make a data visualization act as a filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/make-dv-act-as-filter.md).
-   When a report is acting as an interactive filter, it is not possible to drill down into the report's segments.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to a Core UI dashboard.

2.  Put the dashboard into Edit mode.

    Select the sharing icon \(\[Omitted image "SharingIcon.png"\] Alt text:\).

3.  Point to the top of the report widget, and select the Edit widget icon \(\[Omitted image "Pa\_dashboard\_cog.png"\] Alt text:\).

4.  Select **Act as interactive filter**.

    This field is only available on reports that can act as filters. Only reports with a **Type** value of pie, donut, semi-donut, funnel, or pyramid can act as filters.

    **Note:** When responsive canvas functionality is inactive, there’s no delay in filtering when a user clicks segments of a report that acts an interactive filter in quick succession.

5.  Select **Done**.

6.  Refresh the current browser page to apply the change.


## What to do next

Select a subset of data in the report, such as a slice of pie in a pie chart, to filter all subscriber reports for the same table. All reports on the dashboard that are based on the same table show information about that subset of data only.
