# Create a choice list interactive filter

A choice list interactive filter enables users to filter report widgets based on the value of a choice list.

## Before you begin

Role required: hp\_publisher\_admin and report\_admin. The hp\_publisher\_admin role exists only for managing interactive filters in Core UI. By default, it contains the role analytics\_filter\_admin for managing Core UI filters that are migrated to Platform Analytics experience.

Choice lists contain a limited number of specified values to choose from. Status and Priority are two examples of choice lists. User and location are not usually choice list selections. For more information, see [Choice list field type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ChoiceLists.md).

When a user selects `All`, they do not see a report with all filter options applied, they see the unfiltered report.

Choice list filter - single select

</th><th>

Choice list filter - Check boxes

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

</td><td>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:** If the interactive filter has a default value or specifies the last selected value, non-responsive dashboards do not apply this value automatically. This feature is only available on [Responsive dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/c_ResponsiveDashboards.md).

## Procedure

1.  Check the existing interactive filters on the same table.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics Administration** &gt; **Core UI Artifacts** &gt; **Interactive Filters** and select an interactive filter based on the same table you want to filter.

    2.  Under Related Links, select **Other filters on Table**.

    3.  Review the other filters that are available on the same table to see if the filter you want already exists.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics Administration** &gt; **Core UI Artifacts** &gt; **Interactive Filters**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  In the **Filter based on** list, select **Choice list**.

5.  Set the following fields:

    |Name|Description|
    |----|-----------|
    |Name|Enter a name for the filter. This name appears on the dashboard widget for the filter.|
    |Look up name|Enter a lookup name for the filter. This name appears in the **Add content** menu for users adding a filter to a dashboard. Use this name to help organize your filters. If you do not specify a lookup name, the **Name** value is used instead.|
    |Description|Enter a description of the filter.|
    |UI control type|Select how the available filtering options for this filter appear on the dashboard widget. See [Available interactive filter UI control types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/core-ui-interactive-filters/r_HomepagePublisherUIControlTypes.md).|

6.  Select **Apply to all tables in hierarchy** to apply the filter to parent, child, and sibling tables of an extended table.

7.  Select **Apply filter to database views and tables** to apply the filter to widgets based on both [database views](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) and tables.

    **Note:** It is not possible to apply filters to tables that extend the database view’s tables. For more information, see [Interactive filters on database views and table hierarchies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/core-ui-interactive-filters/apply-filter-to-all-tables-in-hierarchy.md).

8.  Exclude specific elements from appearing on the filter using the **Exclusion list**.

    However, data for excluded choices is included when you select **All** on the interactive filter.

9.  In the **Table** list, select the table that contains the choice list to filter on.

10. In the **Field** list, select the field to filter on.

11. Add any list elements you want to exclude from the filter to the **Exclusion list** field.

12. Select a **Default value** for the filter.

    This default is applied automatically for all users. Values that a user selects override the global default for that user. You can specify more than one default value when using a UI control type that enables multiple selections, such as **Select Multiple Input**.

    **Note:** To pass more than 50 default values, or if you see the error `This is exceeding the GET call limitation`, create multiple interactive filters.

13. Select **Submit**.


## What to do next

1.  After you create the filter, add it to a dashboard.
2.  On the dashboard, select the **Edit widget** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-cogwheel-ac.png"\] Alt text: Edit columns icon\) on each visualization on the dashboard that should follow the filter and select **Follow interactive filter**.
