# Delete a Platform Analytics dashboard

You can delete a dashboard that is no longer useful. The Analytics Overview invokes the Workflow Studio to remove the dashboard from your instance.

## Before you begin

Inform any users who can view the dashboard that you’re deleting it. Users who have bookmarked a deleted dashboard see an error when they try to access it.

Role required: You can delete any dashboard that you created. Users with the admin or dashboard\_admin role can delete any dashboard.

**Note:** The steps to delete a Core UI responsive dashboard are different. For more information, see [Manage responsive dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/manage-responsive-dashboards.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Open the dashboard that you want to delete.

3.  From the More actions menu \(\[Omitted image "icon-vert-3dot-p.png"\] Alt text: More actions menu icon\), select **Delete**.

    \[Omitted image "delete-plat-admin-db.png"\] Alt text: Dashboard with More actions menu expanded and the Delete option highlighted

4.  Confirm the deletion.

    You can’t undo this action. If you accidentally delete a dashboard associated with a plugin, a system administrator can restore the original version of the dashboard.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.
    2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.
    3.  Select the More actions menu button \[Omitted image "icon-vert-3dot-p.png"\] Alt text: More actions menu icon and choose **Repair**.
    4.  Select **Repair** in the Activate Plugin window.

Using the Workflow Studio, you can add actions to the dashboard deletion process. Actions may include sending an email to the dashboard's users or generating an approval request.
