The only criteria to run a Process Mining evaluation project is to have access to the table. It is crucial that you have audits enabled on your instance, as Process Mining uses audit logs to analyze your process.

## About this task

You can run an evaluation project from Process Mining Workspace and Platform Analytics.

## Procedure

1.  Run the evaluation project using your preferred method.

    **Process Mining Workspace**

    1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

    2.  From the details button for the evaluation project, select **Run sample mining**.

    **Platform Analytics**

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **KPIs**.

    2.  Select a KPI.

    3.  Select **Run process analysis**.

        If the KPI is related to ITSM, CSM, or HR, then the sample mining starts.

        You will be able to view the records of the last 7 days and a maximum of 3600 records.
