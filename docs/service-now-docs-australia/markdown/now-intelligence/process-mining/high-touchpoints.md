# Configure high touchpoints on nodes

Configure a high touchpoints \(Node\) definition to view a pattern where a group of records in a step gets updated more often compared to another group to progress to any next step.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_analyst, sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

High touchpoints on nodes displays a group of records in a step that has, on an average, more updates than another group. This points to the high-effort steps demonstrated by some records while others required fewer updates.

**Note:** High touchpoints \(Node\) can be configured for a project only if it has been configured for the process table on which the project is based. For information on configuring touchpoints for a table, see [Configure impact metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/impact-metrics.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Improvement opportunity definition page.

    For information about the Improvement opportunity definition page, see [Set improvement opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/improve-opportunities.md).

2.  Select **Create** on the High touchpoints \(Node\) card.

    For a particular type of automated finding, you can create a maximum of two automated findings.

3.  Provide details in the **Define** section.

<table id="table_gyh_kjk_wbc"><thead><tr><th>

    According to the example, records that meet the following conditions are available as improvement opportunities in the Summary and insights page:

    -   The step must have at least 50 occurrences.
    -   The step must have at least 20 occurrences within the high touchpoints group.
    -   The step must have at least 20 occurrences within the regular touchpoints group.
    -   The minimum gap between the topmost touchpoints and the lowest touchpoints must be 5.
    -   A maximum of 5 improvement opportunities will be generated in the Summary and Insights page.
6.  Select **Save and exit**.
