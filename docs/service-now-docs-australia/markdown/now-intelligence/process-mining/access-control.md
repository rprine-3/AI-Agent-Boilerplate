# Access control

When generating or sharing a project, Process Mining honors the access control rules \(ACLs\) for the table.

When generating a project, Process Mining honors the ACLs on the table that a project reports on, and ignores ACLs on the audit table.

When sharing a project:

-   All visible data in Analyst workbench is visible to any user who has access to the project.
-   All mining operations are performed as per the project creator's \[sys\_created\_by\] access. This includes mining performed by roles with higher permission levels, which can result in less data being mined.

Summary and insights page:

-   KPIs are visible to any user who has the required permission to access related KPIs.
-   Insights are visible to any user who has access to the project.
