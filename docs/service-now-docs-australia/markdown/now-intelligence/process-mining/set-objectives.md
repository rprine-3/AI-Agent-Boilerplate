# Set objectives for Process Mining projects

Define the kind of data or process that you want to view and analyze in your graph. You must select a specific table \(parent table\) that has the data that you want to analyze.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_analyst, sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

## Procedure

1.  When you select **Create New Project** on the Projects page, you’re taken to the **Set objectives** tab.

2.  Provide the following details.

    **Note:** If you want to create a project using Agentic AI data, see [Create a project using Agentic AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/project-agentic-ai.md). If you want to create a project using Playbook data, see [Create a project using Playbook data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/playbook-project.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d97463e224">

**Mark as restricted**

</td><td>

Select the check box if you want to limit project access to the owner and the users they explicitly share it with. Administrators and power users don't have access to the mined data unless the project is shared with them. Once a project is marked as restricted, only the owner can clear this field.

When you’re dealing with sensitive data and must restrict access, you can use this option.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d97463e237">

**Auto retire**

</td><td>

This field is available only if you choose the type as **Project**.

 Select the **Auto Retire** check box if you want to retire the project automatically based on inactivity for a specified number of days \(Default: 90 days\).

 You can extend the retirement by moving it back to published or draft state before the versions get cleaned in another 90 Days \(default\).

 If you don’t change the retired status within the specified days, the mined versions are permanently deleted. However, the project definition isn’t deleted. You can opt out of auto retirement by clearing this check box.

 The default value of 90 days can be changed by the administrator in the System Properties. For more information see, [Data cleanup properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/data-cleanup.md).
