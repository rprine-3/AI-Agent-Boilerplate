# Configure extreme repetition

Configure an extreme repetition definition to view a pattern where a transition repeats more than the usual repetition range between the steps.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_analyst, sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

Extreme repetitions finding definition surfaces transitions that are repeated significantly more than the median repetition. This helps uncover potential repetition anomalies.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Improvement opportunity definition page.

    For information about the Improvement opportunity definition page, see [Set improvement opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/improve-opportunities.md).

2.  Select **Create** on the Extreme repetitions card.

    For a particular type of automated finding, you can create a maximum of two automated findings.

3.  Provide details in the **Define** section.

    According to the example, records that meet the following conditions are available as improvement opportunities in the Summary and insights page:

    -   The minimum repetition is calculated as multiplier x median repetition for transition. In this example, records must meet or exceed 20 times the median repetition.
    -   A transition must contain at least 20 records.
    -   The top percentage of records in the extreme high repetition category that can qualify. Prevents too many records from being included and focuses on true outliers. In this case it is 2%.
    -   A maximum of 5 improvement opportunities will be generated in the Summary and insights page.
6.  Select **Save and exit**.
