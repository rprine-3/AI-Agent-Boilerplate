# Opportunity details page

The Opportunity details page displays details about the improvement opportunities for a project. Access the page from a Process Mining project.

From the Improvement Opportunities icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-imp-opp.png"\] Alt text: Improvement opportunities icon\) on the side panel, you can choose which improvement opportunity you want to view in detail.

After selecting an improvement opportunity, all details for that improvement opportunity are provided.

The metrics per finding are provided at the top.

In the process graph widget, the improvement opportunity pattern in the process is highlighted in red.

|Improvement opportunity|Description|Highlight|Example|
|-----------------------|-----------|---------|-------|
|Ping-pong|Highlights both nodes and arcs in between so it’s clear that the pattern applies to only these nodes and arcs.|Nodes: A, B,and arcs in between|A-B-C-**D-E-D-E**-F|
|Rework|Highlights only the designated node.|Nodes A|**A**-B-C-**A**-Z-**A**|
|Extreme duration|A pattern where transitions take significantly longer than the usual duration between the steps. Therefore, both nodes and the transition are highlighted.|Nodes A, B, and arcs in between|A-B-C-**D-E**|
|Extreme repetition|A pattern where a transition repeats significantly more than the usual repetition range between the steps.|Nodes A, B, and arcs in between|A-B-C-**D-E-D-E-D-E**-G|
|Extra step|Identifies an extra step in a variant. Therefore, the designated node and incoming outgoing arcs are highlighted.|Node A and incoming arc and outgoing arc|A-B-C-D-E-**Z**-F|
|Slow transition|Slow transition applies to the handover from one team to another team.|Nodes A, B, and arcs in between|A-B-**C-D**-E-F|
|Repeating pattern|Includes arcs to highlight the pattern clearly.|Nodes B, C, D, and arcs in between|A-B-C-D-**B-C-D**-E-F-G|

When you select **Analyze in analyst workbench**, Analyst workbench opens in the context of the improvement opportunity.

Select the options in the **Investigate** list to view the details of the records, run a cluster analysis, or to run a root cause analysis.

Select any transition from the graph, a details window is displayed. Use the options under **Investigate** section on this window to view the records and run a work notes analysis.

These tasks are run using the scheduled tasks that run in the background. After the task completes, you can view the result.

Choose any of the options on **Take action** to:

-   Set the status of the improvement opportunity.
-   Create a note, CIM, and an automation request for the improvement opportunity.
-   Edit the improvement opportunity by selecting **Edit definition**.

## Further analysis on the improvement opportunity

You can generate the highlights to view the main reasons for inefficiency. To generate highlights, the Process Inefficiency Highlights skill must be activated on the instance. For more details, see [Activate Process Inefficiency Highlights skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/activate-highlight-skills.md).

If the Process Inefficiency Highlights skill isn’t activated on the instance, the highlights option isn’t available. For more information about how to generate highlights, see [Generate highlights for improvement opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/generate-highlights.md).

You can also view the trends, breakdowns, and variants for the selected improvement opportunity.

The **Trends** tab displays a time series graph and a bar chart displaying two metrics for the improvement opportunity. For the improvement opportunity, the same X axis as the project-level metrics is used. This ensures that both metrics are plotted into one widget and the delta between both measures is displayed.

-   Timeseries graph maps the average time to completion of the improvement opportunity records. This is available for rule-based and automated improvement opportunities.
-   Bar chart shows the number of occurrences of the improvement opportunity record over time. This is available only for automated improvement opportunities.

The breakdowns for the improvement opportunity are displayed in the **Breakdowns** tab.

-   Select the type by which you want to view the breakdowns in the **Type** field.
-   Select the Search icon to search the breakdowns.
-   Filter the breakdowns list from the Filter breakdowns icon.
-   Edit the columns list using the Show and hide columns icon.

The variants of the improvement opportunity are displayed in the **Variants** tab.

-   The list is sorted by the top variation values based on records by default. You can sort it by any other column too.
-   Filter the variation list from the Filter variants icon.
-   Edit the columns list using the Show and hide columns icon.
