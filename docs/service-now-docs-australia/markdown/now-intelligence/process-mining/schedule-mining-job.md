# Schedule a Process Mining job

Schedule a Process Mining job to mine one or more projects later.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

**Note:** You can create only one scheduled job for each project. You can, however, associate multiple projects to a job. If there are several projects scheduled for mining within a job, the projects execute sequentially. For example, a job which has Projects 1 and 2 scheduled within it will mine Project 1 first. Then, it begins mining Project 2 after mining of Project 1 completes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Mining** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs** &gt; **Create New**.

2.  On the Scheduled Process Mining Job form, populate the applicable fields for the job you want to create, then select **Submit**.

    See [descriptions of fields on a scheduled job record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ScheduleTheGenerationOfAnEntity.md).

3.  In the Project Definitions section, select **Edit**.

4.  From the **Edit Members** form, select the projects in the **Collection** column that you want to mine and move them to the **Project Definitions List** column.

5.  Select **Save**.

    The scheduled job runs on the frequency that you've configured.


## What to do next

-   View a successfully generated project from Analyst workbench.
-   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Mining** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs** &gt; **All Jobs** to view scheduled process mining jobs.
