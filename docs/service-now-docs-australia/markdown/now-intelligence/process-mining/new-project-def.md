 If you don’t change the retired status within the specified days, the mined versions are permanently deleted. However, the project definition isn’t deleted. You can opt out of auto retirement by clearing this check box.

 The default value of 90 days can be changed by the administrator in the System Properties. For more information see, [Data cleanup properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/data-cleanup.md).
