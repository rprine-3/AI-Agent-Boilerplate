# Run work notes analysis

Generate a work notes analysis on a transition.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_analyst, sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

**Note:** Work notes with more than 5 words and fewer than 100 words are considered for the analysis.

You can use AI for work notes analysis even with 5-50 eligible work notes. If there are less than 25 eligible work notes, the system will not run clustering, but will put all the work notes into one LLM call, otherwise clustering will be performed before calling the LLM.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

2.  From the list of projects, select a project.

3.  Select any transition or node on the Analyst workbench.

    A window is displayed with all the details.

4.  From the **Investigate** section, select **Work notes analysis**.

    A scheduled task starts.

5.  After the scheduled task is complete, select **View result**.

    The result is displayed.
