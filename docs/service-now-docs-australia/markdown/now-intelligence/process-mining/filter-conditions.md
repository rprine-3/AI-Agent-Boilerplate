# Set filter conditions

Set filter conditions to limit the scope of your analysis.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_analyst, sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

## About this task

Setting filters is an optional task for project creation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

    If you continue from the **Set Objectives** page, you're on the **Scope your analysis** page.

2.  Select **Edit** for the project that you want to edit.

3.  Select the edit button for the **Scope your analysis** section.

    The Overview section provides details of the process table including any guardrails set for it.

4.  Select **Filter conditions** from the side panel.

    **Tip:** Select **Advanced view** on the top-right corner if you want to edit the project in the Classic view.

5.  Fill the form with details.

Table

</td><td>

It’s automatically populated based on the table that you have selected in the **Set objectives** tab.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filters

</td><td>

Select any field from the root table that you want to filter the data by.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Related List Condition

</td><td>

Select the number of records that you want to view.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Optionally, select to narrow your process scope

</td><td>

There are the following options in this section:-   **None**: No filter is applied. This is the default value.
-   **Crop**: Crop the process to view a specific area of the process by specifying a start and end condition. All events that occurred before the start condition and after the end condition won’t appear in the process graph.

**Note:** You can specify the crop process on the fields that you have set as your activity definitions. Therefore, set the activity definition for the project, before setting the crop process.

Select the + sign beside Start condition and End condition. Set a process start and process end condition.

Example: If a project is set with the State as the activity definition, you have the following path:

**New -&gt; Open -&gt; Work in Progress -&gt; Resolved -&gt; Work in Progress -&gt; Resolved -&gt; Closed**

If a start condition is specified on the first occurrence of Work in Progress and a stop condition is specified on the last occurrence of resolved, then the model would look like this: **Work in Progress -&gt; Resolved -&gt; Work in Progress -&gt; Resolved**.

-   **Transition**: A transition filter focuses on process paths that contain a specific transition between selected steps. For example, mine records that transitioned from **State: Work in Progress** `At some point followed by` **State: On Hold**.

To provide the transition filter, you must set up the filter condition, with a start condition that is "at some point followed by" or "directly followed by" step 2.

You can provide only 2 steps here.
