# Configure slow duration on nodes

Configure a slow duration definition on a node to view a pattern where a group of records stays longer in a step than the average duration of another group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_analyst, sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

Slow duration on node displays a group of records that, on an average, stay longer in a step than another group. It points to the delayed steps that are shown by some records while others progressed faster.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Improvement opportunity definition page.

    For information about the Improvement opportunity definition page, see [Set improvement opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/improve-opportunities.md).

2.  Select **Create** on the Slow duration \(Node\) card.

    For a particular type of automated finding, you can create a maximum of two automated findings.

3.  Provide details in the **Define** section.

    According to the example, records that meet the following conditions are available as improvement opportunities in the Summary and insights page:

    -   The step must have at least 50 occurrences.
    -   The step must have at least 20 occurrences within the slow duration group.
    -   The step must have at least 20 occurrences within the regular duration group.
    -   The minimum gap between the longest slow duration and the shortest regular duration must be 120 minutes.
    -   A maximum of 5 improvement opportunities will be generated in the Summary and insights page.
6.  Select **Save and exit**.
