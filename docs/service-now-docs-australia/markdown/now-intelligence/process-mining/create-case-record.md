# Create case records for the imported data

Create case records for the imported data as it is important for creating a project and mining it. Without a record table, a project can’t be created.

## Before you begin

-   [Create an audit table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/create-table.md)
-   [Import data into the audit table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/import-data.md)
-   [Verify the imported data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/verify-data.md)

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_admin

## Procedure

1.  After you’ve validated your imported data, create a record table from the Record Data section.

2.  Select an option under **How do you wish to add the record table?**.

    If your audit table has custom fields, then the two options are grayed out. By default, **Generate record data table** is selected.

3.  Select **Create record table**.
