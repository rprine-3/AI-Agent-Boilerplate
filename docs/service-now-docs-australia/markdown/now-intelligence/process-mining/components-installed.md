## Process Mining roles

Process Mining adds these roles.

Roles control access to features and capabilities in applications and modules.

After access has been granted to a role, all the groups or users assigned to the role are granted the access. Roles can contain other roles, and any access granted to a role is granted to any role that contains it.

### Process mining administrator \[sn\_process\_mining\_admin\]

Access all projects and manage all project settings and configurations and schedule background and jobs.

#### Contains Roles

The Process mining administrator \[sn\_process\_mining\_admin\] role contains the sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user role.

#### Groups

List of groups this role is assigned to by default.

None.

#### Special considerations

**Note:** Avoid granting an admin role when more specialized roles are available.

### Process Mining power user \[sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user\]

Perform the following actions when assigned to this role.

-   Can access all projects and manage all project settings and configurations.
-   Can create and share projects.
-   Can view projects created by other users and shared with them.
