# Integration with Continual Improvement Management

Integrating with the ServiceNow® Continual Improvement Management application enables you to create a request once you have identified an improvement opportunity.

Integration with the ServiceNow® Continual Improvement Management \(CIM\) application enables you to request and view process improvement-related initiatives and add tasks to existing initiatives.

The Process Mining plugin \(com.sn\_po\) provides an integration between the Process Mining and Continual Improvement Management applications. Continual Improvement Management integrates with activation of the CIM \(com.sn\_cim\) plugin.

From Process Mining: When you create an improvement initiative from Process Mining, a reference to the project is added to the continual improvement record.

From Continual Improvement Management: Launch the Process Mining Analyst workbench from CIM.

## Roles

Integration with Continual Improvement Management doesn’t add any additional roles to the Process Mining roles. To enable Continual Improvement Management features, you must add the agent\_workspace\_user role to the users who need this capability.

## Example of Continual Improvement Management using Process Mining

Understand how you can create or track an improvement request.

As an improvement manager, you use your Continual Improvement Management Workbench dashboard daily to view operational work and initiatives in progress. You have an open initiative to optimize the incident process and reduce the mean time to resolve \(MTTR\).

From the initiative form, you select **Go to Process Mining**. The action navigates you to a generated project in the Process Mining Analyst workbench showing cases that were closed in the last three months.
