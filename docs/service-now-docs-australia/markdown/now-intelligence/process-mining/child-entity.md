# Add a child entity

Add a child or related table to track an activity from a related process.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_mining\_analyst, sn\_process\_mining\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_mining\_admin

## About this task

Often the start and end of a full workflow occurs outside the life cycle of your business process. When it's helpful to analyze these external events, you can add another table for tracking other events relevant to your process. For example, if Incident table is your parent table, and you define the Incident Task \[incident\_task\] table as child table for the Incident table, then when a record from the Incident Task \[incident\_task\] table is created, it shows as an 'Incident Task created' activity on the process map. Only 'created' or 'closed' events show as activities in the process graph.

**Note:** External events from a defined child table don’t show as condition options in the Transitions or condition filters.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

    If you continue from the **Set Objectives** page, you are on the **Scope your analysis** page.
