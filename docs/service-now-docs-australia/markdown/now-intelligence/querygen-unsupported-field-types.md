# Unsupported field types in Query Generation

Query Generation explicitly does not support some field types.

## Unsupported field types

-   Variables
-   Tags
-   Domain Path

Reference fields are supported, but the referenced table must be included in the semantic layer. For example, a user query on caller\_id.department succeeds only if the Department table is in the semantic layer.
