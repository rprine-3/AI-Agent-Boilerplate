# Add an existing visualization to an exploration

You can add a data visualization or a list to a new or existing AI Data Explorer exploration from a dashboard, the data visualization library, or other areas of your workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: now\_assist\_explorer\_user, access to the dashboard or library

## About this task

Add an existing visualization to highlight an insight, add context to your exploration, or serve as a starting point for further analysis.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Data Explorer** &gt; **AI Data Explorer**.

2.  Expand the explorations list and open the desired exploration.

3.  Hide the explorations list.

    \[Omitted image "nowass-explore-hide-list.png"\] Alt text: The hide list button.

4.  Open a new browser tab and navigate to the workspace page or dashboard that contains the desired data visualization or list, or to the data visualization library.

    **Important:** Do not close the original tab with the exploration.

5.  If the page or dashboard has filters, set the desired filter values.

    These filter values apply to the imported data visualization or list.

6.  Locate, and if necessary open, the data visualization or list and select the Explore with AI icon \[Omitted image "analyze-ai-icon.png"\] Alt text: Explore with AI icon.

    \[Omitted image "explore-icon-dv-tile.png"\] Alt text: Data visualization tile with Explore with AI button highlighted.

    **Note:** If the data visualization shows data from a protected scope that is not supported in Query Generation and AI Data Explorer, there is no Explore with AI icon. For more information, see [Enabling access to protected scope applications for AI Data Explorer and Query Generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/enable-aide-secure-scope-apps.md).

7.  From the Explore options, select **Add to exploration**.

    \[Omitted image "explore-options-add2expl.png"\] Alt text: The Add to exploration option in the Explore dialog.

    If the data visualization shows data from multiple protected scopes, there is no option to add the visualization to an exploration.

    You are asked whether you want to add the data visualization or list to a new exploration or an existing one that is open.

8.  Select **Add to an open exploration**.

9.  Select from the explorations that are open in other tabs and choose **Add**.


## Result

The exploration opens in a dialog in the tab that you are in. The list or data visualization is added to the end of the exploration. You can add more lists or data visualizations. When you select **Add to exploration**, the list or data visualization is automatically added to the open exploration.
