# Add a visualization to a dashboard from the Visualization Designer

Add a visualization from the Visualization Designer to a new dashboard or to an existing dashboard.

## Before you begin

Role required: You must have a role that allows access to the data in the visualization. You must own the visualization, or it must be shared with you. You must have the right to edit the dashboard in which you want to add the visualization.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**.

2.  Create a data visualization, or open a data visualization that you want to add to a dashboard.

3.  Expand **Add to Dashboard** and choose from the following options.

Result

**Add to new dashboard**

</td><td>

A new, untitled dashboard opens in the inline dashboard editor. The data visualization is already on this dashboard. Complete the dashboard, adding any more desired elements and naming it. For more information, see [Create a dashboard with the in-line editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-db-in-ac.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d76112e130">

**Add to existing dashboard**

</td><td>

The Select dashboard dialog box opens. To open a list of dashboards in which you can add the data visualization, click or begin entering in the **Select dashboard** field. Only dashboards that you can edit are available. Technical dashboards are not available.When you have made your choice, select **Add to dashboard**. The dashboard opens in the inline editor for further editing. The visualization is the last element in the dashboard.

**Tip:** If you don't see your data visualization, refresh the browser page.

## Adding a visualization to an existing dashboard

You have just completed creating the data visualization Open incidents - Priority. You want to add it to the dashboard Incidents Overview, which you have the right to edit.

1.  First, you save your last changes to the visualization.
