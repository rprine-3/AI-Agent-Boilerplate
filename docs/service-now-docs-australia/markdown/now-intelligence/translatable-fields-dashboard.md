# Translatable fields in dashboard elements

For fields that show the **Translatable turned on** badge, you can add translations of the field value in the Messages \[sys\_ui\_message\] table.

Translations of ServiceNow AI Platform® User interface \(UI\) elements are stored in one of five tables, as described in [Translation tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_TranslationTables.md). When you see a field in the configuration panel of a dashboard element, and this field has the badge **Translatable turned on**, you can add translations of the field value in the Messages \[sys\_ui\_message\] table.

In the Messages table, records have a key, a language, and a message field. You set the key value equal to the original text. Then you select a language, and enter the translation in that language into the Message field. Only ServiceNow AI Platform admins can create and edit these records. For more information, see [Translate a client script message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_TranslateAClientScriptMessage.md).

**Note:** For more information about how keys are stored for translatable fields, see this [ServiceNow Community blog post](https://www.servicenow.com/community/international-localization/need-to-translate-a-configurable-workspace-check-this/ta-p/2376015?nobounce). This post also includes a prototype Localization Framework artifact that finds all translatable fields in all UI Builder components on an instance, including dashboard components.
