# Examining indicators with KPI Details

The KPI Details feature enables you to delve into the information behind your key performance indicators. Apply forecasts, trends, targets, and thresholds. Filter by breakdown element or apply time series aggregations.

KPI Details has several sections:\[Omitted image "kpi-details-whole.png"\] Alt text: KPI Details page showing the header, visualization, and sidebar sections

## Header

The header contains the name of the indicator, a date selector \(default: last data collection\), and the score on that date. Data snapshots indicators are identified with a badge. The absolute and percentage differences between that score and the previously collected score are shown. If the indicator has Maximize or Minimize set, the color of the score and the score change direction arrow indicates whether the score is improving or getting worse.

The date selector uses whatever calendar the indicator uses.

If real-time scores are enabled for the indicator, select in the header whether to view them, using the clock icon \[Omitted image "kpi-details-real-time-icon-off.png"\] Alt text: Real-time scores icon turned off. This icon is transparent when real-time scores are disabled and solid when they are enabled \[Omitted image "real-time-update-icon.png"\] Alt text: Real time icon when real time is activated. For more information, see [Real-time scores](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/real-time-scores.md).

If a target is set for the selected date, the header shows the target value and the gap between the score on that date and the target, in both absolute and percentage terms. If both target and forecast are shown, as set in [Chart options in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/chart-options.md), a badge shows whether the indicator is on track or off track to meet the target by the review date.

**Warning:** Real-time scores can differ per viewer and differ from collected scores. Real-time scores are taken directly from the relevant facts tables. Therefore, the Access Control Lists \(ACL\) of those facts tables determine the real-time scores that each logged-in user sees.

## Indicator chart

The indicator chart shows:

-   The **Chart options** menu. For more information, see [Chart options in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/chart-options.md).
-   A date picker to choose the date range of the information in the chart. For Industrial Connected Workforce \(ICW\) indicators, this date range can be in shifts or production days.
-   A time series graphic representation of the indicator over time. Click on a point in the graph to see the details for that date.
-   A time series aggregation selector. For more information, see [Select time aggregation in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/select-time-series-aggregation.md). \(Does not apply to Industrial Connected Workforce indicators.\)
-   The **Show records** toggle, which shows you the records associated with the indicator score on the selected date. For more information, see [Show, compare, create, and edit records in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/show-compare-edit-records.md).

**Warning:** In some cases, when you collect second-level breakdowns, the score and the number of records do not agree. When these values do not agree, the score is correct. For more details and an example, see [KB0748969](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0748969).

**Important:** Records are not listed for the "Unmatched" breakdown element when you select it in the filter.

## Sidebar

Use the sidebar controls to:

-   Filter by breakdown and element \[Omitted image "icon-filter.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon.
-   View KPI Signals for the indicator \(\[Omitted image "kpi-details-open-signals.png"\] Alt text: Icon in KPI Details sidebar to open KPI Signals, showing there is a new signal\). See [KPI Signals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-behavior-charts-for-kpis.md).
-   Set an indicator target or threshold\(\[Omitted image "target-icon.png"\] Alt text: Target icon\). See [Indicator targets and thresholds in KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/kpi-details-targets.md).

## Process analysis

Besides these three sections, a **Run process analysis** button lets you launch a Process Mining analysis on the indicator. For more information, see [Process Mining](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/process-mining/process-mining.md).

## More actions menu

You also have a More actions menu \[Omitted image "icon-menu.png"\] Alt text: More actions menu icon that gives you access to the indicator record and scoresheet. For more information, see [Access indicator record or scoresheet from KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/access-indicator-record-scoresheet.md).
