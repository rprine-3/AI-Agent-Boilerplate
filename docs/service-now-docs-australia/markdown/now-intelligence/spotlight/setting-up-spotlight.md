# Setting up Spotlight

Set up Spotlight for each set of table records that you want to evaluate and rank by importance. The records must be associated with an indicator.

Specify the records you want to evaluate by creating a Spotlight group. Create multiple Spotlight criteria and associate them with the group to define how to weight records. In the Spotlight group, you set the sum of the weights of criteria that a record must meet to trigger the creation of a Spotlight.

**Note:** Before you start to work with Spotlight, an administrator must activate a Spotlight plugin.

After creating the Spotlight group and multiple Spotlight criteria, activate the Spotlight group. After the Group is activated, Spotlight scores are collected automatically according to the Spotlight group job schedule. You can also collect Spotlight scores manually at any time for an active group. A Spotlight is automatically created for any records with Spotlight scores that exceed the Spotlight group threshold, allowing you to quickly identify the highest priority work.
