# Ranking records with Spotlight

Use Spotlight to identify and rank records of interest based on multiple weighted criteria.

Spotlight illuminates records that otherwise you might overlook. You can define weighted criteria to identify and rank records that require attention, such as when triaging incidents or performing lead scoring. You can rank records based on multiple dimensions, instead of by a single field value such as priority. While most organizations address high-priority items in a timely manner, lower priority items sometimes are not addressed for an extended period of time. Spotlight helps you focus on items based on business need.

For example, you might want to have incidents brought to your attention if they have been open for a long time, or been reassigned multiple times, even if these incidents are low priority. Among those incidents, you might want one that has been open a long time and been assigned multiple times to be ranked above one that has only been open a long time.

Spotlight uses scheduled jobs that run to evaluate the records. The results of these jobs can be viewed in Spotlight interactive analyses. To share Spotlight results, share the URL of the analysis with any user who has the pa\_spotlight\_viewer role.

The following diagram demonstrates scoring in Spotlight. The large circle represents the set of all open incidents. Each of the smaller circles represents a weighted Spotlight criteria that applies to a subset of the open incidents.
