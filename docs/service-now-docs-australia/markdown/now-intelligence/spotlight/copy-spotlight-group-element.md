# Copy a Spotlight group to breakdown elements

You can copy a Spotlight group across multiple elements of a single breakdown.

## Before you begin

Finish configuring the Spotlight group that you want to copy.

Role required: admin, pa\_spotlight, pa\_spotlight\_copy\_breakdown

## About this task

When you first create a Spotlight group, you can associate it with at most one element of one breakdown. To create identical Spotlight groups for multiple elements of a breakdown, use the copying function. For example, if you want to use the same Spotlight group configuration for multiple elements of the **Countries** breakdown, create a Spotlight group for one country and copy it to the other countries.

## Procedure

1.  Locate and open the Spotlight group record from the **Spotlight Groups** list.

2.  Click **Copy to breakdown element**.

3.  In the Copy Spotlight Group dialog, select a value for **Name Preference**.

For each copy of the Spotlight group, the [breakdown element](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) name is added to the beginning of the Spotlight group name. You can keep the base name from the original Spotlight group or specify a new one.The **New Name** field does not show these prefixes.

**Add element name to new name as suffix**

</td><td>

For each copy of the Spotlight group, the breakdown element name is added to the end of the Spotlight group name. You can keep the base name from the original Spotlight group or specify a new one.The **New Name** field does not show these suffixes.

</table>4.  Fill out the remaining fields of the **Copy Spotlight Group** dialog:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |New Name|Editable field showing the name of the Spotlight group copies you are creating. This field appears if you select any value for **Name Preference** other than **Do not change the name**. All copies have the same name unless you select **Add element name to new name as prefix** or **Add element name to new name as suffix**. The element name prefixes or suffixes do not appear in this field.|
    |Breakdown|If you specified a breakdown when you created the original Spotlight group, the breakdown name appears in this field. Otherwise, select a breakdown. Only the breakdowns that are associated with the main indicator are available.|
    |Element|Select any number of elements for the specified breakdown. A copy of the Spotlight group is made for each selected element.|
