# Create a filter group

Create a set of filters that you can apply simultaneously. When you have multiple filters, applying them all together can be faster than applying them separately.

## Before you begin

Role required: dashboard\_admin, or any role if you are the dashboard owner or have had editing rights shared with you.

## About this task

If you have many filters that apply to many visualizations on a dashboard, it can take a long time to apply all the filters. Each filter whose value you set makes a separate call to the ServiceNow AI Platform. You can speed this process up by organizing filters into groups, where you make a single call to apply multiple filters at once.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Locate and open or create the dashboard to which you want to add a filter group.

    Technical dashboards are not supported. You can only add a filter group to a dashboard in the inline editor. For more information, see [Edit Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/edit-db-in-ac.md).

3.  Select **Add new element** and add a Filter Group element.

4.  In the **UI Element** section, configure the appearance of the filter group

</table>5.  Add filters.

    You can add filters of any type except Domain. The filter configuration is the same as for the Filter component:

    -   [Configure a True/False filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-boolean-filter-workspace.md)
    -   [Configure a Date filter in the inline editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-date-filter-workspace.md)
    When you complete the configuration of each filter, select **Back to group configuration**.

## Filter group in action

The following example shows a group of two filters being applied to a data visualization. A simple use case is used here for clarity and brevity. In practice, you would use a filter group with multiple visualizations and filters.
