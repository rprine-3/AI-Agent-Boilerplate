# Dot-walking from reference fields in a data visualization

Dot-walking provides access to fields on extended, or related, tables, enabling you to create data visualizations on fields from those tables.

You can access references on extended tables from the Metric, Group by/Stack by, column/row, or Trend by fields in the Configuration panel, or when you add custom conditions when you choose the data source. The Sorting option also enables you to configure the sort order of applicable reference fields on extended tables. Tables that reference other tables are denoted with an arrow \(\[Omitted image "icon-dv-expand.png"\] Alt text: Expand icon for data visualizations\) icon.

Dot-walking references a field by building a chain of field names separated by dots \(periods\). For instance, **incident.assigned\_to.company** references the company of the user assigned to an incident. The recommended limit for chain length is three levels.

**Note:** Dot-walking applies only to visualizations of table data sources.
