# Data Visualization roles

There are several roles associated with the Visualization Designer and Visualization Library. Roles limit what users can do with visualizations.

## Roles

-   **Any role**

    Users with any role can create visualizations in dashboards that they have editing rights to. They need access to the data that they wish to display. They can also add visualizations from the library to their dashboards if those visualizations have been shared with them. They can also bookmark or export visualizations that have been shared with them from the Visualization Designer. They can share a visualization with other users and groups if it was shared with them with sharing rights. Specific roles are needed to create or edit visualizations in the Visualization Designer.

-   **viz\_creator, itil, report\_user**

    Creates visualizations in the Visualization Designer that are then available throughout the organization in the Data Visualizations library. Cannot delete visualizations that have been shared with them. Can edit visualizations in the library only if they created them or if the visualization was shared with them with editing rights. Can share visualizations only with groups and users.

-   **viz\_admin, platform\_analytics\_admin**

    Creates visualizations in the Visualization Designer that are then available throughout the organization in the Data Visualizations library. Edits, deletes, shares, exports, and schedules the export of any visualization. Can share visualizations with roles, not only users or groups.
