# Platform Analytics roles

Platform Analytics has both unique roles and roles from other applications that apply to it.

## Users with any role

Users with any role can create visualizations in dashboards that they have editing rights to. They need access to the data that they wish to display. They can add data visualizations that have been shared with them to their dashboards. In the Visualization Designer, they can bookmark or export such visualizations, and if a visualization has been shared with them with sharing rights, they can share it with other groups and users. Specific roles are needed to create or edit visualizations in the Visualization Designer.

Users with any role can create dashboards and share them with groups, users, and roles. If a data visualization has been shared with them, they can add this visualization to their dashboards from the library. These users can share a dashboard that has been shared with them if sharing rights were also granted. They can pass along editing rights if granted.

## User groups

Simplify user administration by creating groups that contain all the roles necessary for specific personas rather than to individual users. You can then assign individual users to those groups. When users transition to new roles, you can then re-assign their group memberships, and avoid scenarios where users retain unexpected roles.

For details on the administration of users, groups, and roles, see [User Administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_UserAdministration.md).

## Role description

The following table provides the following information about each role associated with Platform Analytics.

-   **Role name**

    Name of the role from the **Name** field in the Roles \[sys\_user\_role\] table.

-   **Description**

    Description of the role and its intended use.

-   **Contains Roles**

    List of roles contained within the role.

-   **Contained by roles \(except admin\)**

    Any roles, besides admin, that contain the role. The admin role contains all the roles.


The following attributes are shared by all of the roles:

-   None of the roles are assigned to a group by default.
-   None of the roles require users to be allocated as part of a paid subscription, although a paid subscription is required for most Performance Analytics functionality.
-   None of the roles are elevated, meaning none grant access to High Security Settings.
-   All of the roles are included in the base system, except for analytics\_admin and sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, which are included with Usage Insights and Process Mining, respectively.

**Tip:** Try to assign the least inclusive role that still provides the necessary access. For example, if you want a user to be able to create data visualizations in the library and share them with users, but not schedule their export, grant that user viz\_creator and not viz\_admin.
