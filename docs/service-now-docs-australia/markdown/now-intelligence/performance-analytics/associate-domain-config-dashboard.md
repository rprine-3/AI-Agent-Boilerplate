# Associate a domain configuration with a dashboard

Display a domain picker on a dashboard to enable users of that dashboard to view scores from specific domains.

## Before you begin

Role required: pa\_power\_user or admin

The Performance Analytics - Domain Support plugin \(com.snc.pa.domain\_support\) must be activated.

## About this task

**Important:** This procedure applies only to Core UI dashboards. On a Platform Analytics dashboard, create a domain filter that uses a Performance Analytics domain configuration. For more information, see [Create a domain filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-domain-filter.md).

A user must have visibility into all domains in the domain configuration to view domain-specific scores on a dashboard.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics Administration** &gt; **Core UI Artifacts** &gt; **Dashboards**.

    You cannot use this feature with Platform Analytics dashboards.

2.  Select a dashboard.

3.  In the **Domain Configurations** related list, select **Edit**.

4.  Select the domain configurations you want to associate with this dashboard.

5.  Click **Save**.


## Result

A user who has visibility to all the domains in the domain configuration, such as an admin, can select a domain. The reports and widgets on the dashboard show only scores and values from that domain.

## What to do next

If you open the Analytics Hub from a dashboard with a domain picker, you see only the scores collected for the selected domain. Any target, threshold, or comment you add is automatically associated with the current domain. The **Edit scores** option is not available.
