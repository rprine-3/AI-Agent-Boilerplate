# Create a treemap visualization for a breakdown widget

To display a hierarchy of breakdown elements, use a treemap visualization.

## Before you begin

Role required: pa\_power-user or admin

## About this task

**Note:** This feature is part of the Core UI front end. It is not supported on Platform Analytics dashboards or UI Builder pages, except to a limited extent when migrated in compatibility mode. To build Platform Analytics components, see [Data visualizations in Platform Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center-data-visualizations.md) or [Filters in Platform Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/interactive-filters-workspace.md).

This feature is deprecated, meaning it is in maintenance mode and is no longer being augmented or changed. Only security fixes to this feature will be addressed.

If the elements of a breakdown differ in favorability, or if you want to compare each breakdown element against an indicator target, you can use a treemap. Treemaps use nested rectangles with the size representing the relative proportion of the element and the color representing the favorability.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics** &gt; **Widgets** and click **New**.

2.  In the **Name** field, give the widget a name that reflects the information being displayed.

3.  In the **Type** field, select **Breakdown**.

    If you change the value of **Type** after you fill in other fields, those fields are cleared.

4.  In the **Visualization** field, select **Treemap**.

    You can let the user switch between visualizations. Select **Show visualization selector** in the **Display settings** tab.

5.  In the **Indicator** field, select the main indicator which you want to break down.

6.  Select the breakdown to group the scores.

    You may also set a breakdown and element to filter the scores.

    -   For the widget to show scores grouped by the elements of a breakdown, select a breakdown in the **Breakdown** field. Do not select an element or a second breakdown.
    -   You can have the widget show different elements depending on characteristics of the viewer. To do so, specify an elements filter in the **Element Settings** tab. Do not specify an element in the **Element** field. You can personalize only the first-level breakdown elements. For more information, see [Personalized visuals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/personalized-visuals.md).
    -   For the widget to show scores filtered by an element of one breakdown then grouped by the elements of another breakdown, select the filtering breakdown and element in the **Breakdown** and **Element** fields. Then select the grouping breakdown in the **2nd Breakdown** field. The widget shows scores for each element of the **2nd Breakdown** but only if they match the first **Breakdown** and **Element**.

        **Note:**

        -   Second-level breakdowns must be enabled on the indicator record, in the **Collect breakdown matrix** tab.
        -   To have a second breakdown, **Follow element** must be disabled. Dashboard breakdowns count as one breakdown level of the two that are possible.
    -   The widget can also show scores grouped by one breakdown and filtered by an element that the user selects on a breakdown dashboard. Select the grouping breakdown in the **Breakdown** field. Then select **Follow element** as described in a later step.
    **Important:** If the widget is for a formula indicator, all contributing indicators in the formula must support the breakdown. Otherwise an error message instead of a value appears in the widget on a dashboard.

7.  In the **Coloring method** field, select whether to rank the favorability based on score, change to score, percent of change, or an indicator target.

8.  Select the color that indicates a positive in the **Positive color** field.

9.  Depending on the **Coloring method**, you may need to select a **Negative color**

10. Fill in any of the following fields:

<table id="choicetable_kbb_mhw_1bb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="chrow_time-series"><td>

Time series

</td><td>

Run a function on the scores for a specific time period, such as applying a 7-day sum or average. from being applied to the indicator. For more information, see [Applying time series aggregations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/applying-time-series-aggregations.md).**Note:** Business and fiscal calendars do not support time series aggregations. You cannot set a time series aggregation on a widget for an indicator that uses such a calendar.

</td></tr><tr id="chrow_sort-on"><td>

Sort onSort direction

</td><td>

Sort the data on the **Sort on** attribute. Then select whether to sort in ascending or descending order.**Note:** The system attempts to sort the data based on the scores from the latest collection job. If the latest job did not collect any scores, the **Sort on** setting is ignored.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Color scheme

</td><td>

A spectrum of colors for the scores for all breakdowns. If only one breakdown is shown, only the first color is used. If you do not specify a color scheme, the colors defined in the system property **glide.ui.chart.default.colors** apply.

 You can create your own color scheme instead of using a provided color scheme. For more information, see [Create a color scheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/color-schemes-pa-widgets.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>11. Review the **Settings** tabs and change settings as desired.

    For more information, see [Additional settings for breakdown widgets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/optional-settings-breakdown-widgets.md).

12. Click **Submit**.
