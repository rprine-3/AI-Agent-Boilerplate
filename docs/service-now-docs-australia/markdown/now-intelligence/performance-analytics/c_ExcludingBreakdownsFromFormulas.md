# Prevent a contributing indicator in a formula from following breakdowns

You can select contributing indicators in a formula to not be broken down. When a user applies a breakdown to the formula indicator, the breakdown does not apply to these indicators.

When you apply a breakdown to a [formula indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md), such as on a breakdown dashboard, the breakdown applies to all [contributing indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md). You prevent a contributing indicator from being broken down using the syntax \{\{Indicator\}\}. You can also prevent a contributing indicator from following breakdowns by clearing the **Allow breakdowns** check box in the **Browse for an indicator** dialog. This dialog opens when you create

For example, consider the formula `[[Incidents]] / [[Customers]]`. If you apply a region breakdown to this indicator, and specify EU as the breakdown element, the formula indicator returns scores using the formula `[[Incidents > region = eu]] / [[Customers > region = eu]]`. However, to view the EU incidents divided by the total number of incidents across all regions, you can write the formula as `[[Incidents]] / {{Customers}}`. Using the \{\{Indicator\}\} format causes the Customers indicator to ignore breakdowns. This way, when you apply the region breakdown with the EU breakdown element, this formula indicator is equivalent to the formula `[[Incidents > region = eu]] / [[Customers]]`.

You can still specify a breakdown and element for a contributing indicator that does not follow breakdowns for the whole formula indicator. Consider the formula `[[Incidents]] / {{Customers > importance = high}}`. In this example, the formula denominator is always broken down to include only the high-importance customers. Any breakdown applied to the formula indicator, such as the region breakdown, does not apply to the Customers indicator.
