# Analysis and the KPI tree

In the Analysis tab of KPI Composer, design your KPI tree. Specify your business goals, their associated critical success factors, and the measurement related to those factors. Chart the logical relationship between these factors and the personas who are responsible for them.

A KPI tree contains the following hierarchically related artifacts:

-   **Business goals**

    Typically, you put a business goal at the top of your KPI tree. This goal represents what you want to achieve with the dashboards coming forth from this project. A business goal can be something like "Cost Efficiency" or "Quality Assurance."

-   **Critical Success Factors**

    Put these factors under your business goals to identify what your organization needs to do to achieve the business goal. Critical success factors can be placed under a business goal or under other critical success factors.

-   **Measurements**

    Decide how to measure the performance of a critical success factor. Measurements are the most 'indicator-like' artifact in the KPI tree. They contain the functional description of how to make the measurement. Additionally, you can store who is responsible for the measurement and who to contact in case this measurement is used in different projects.


The KPI tree has a header and a footer with the following drag-and-drop icons:

-   Artifacts, on the left of the footer
-   Breakdown definitions, on the right of the header \(See [Group data by breakdown definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/add-breakdowns-project.md)\)
-   Personas, on the left of the header \(See [Add personas to a project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/add-personas-project.md)\)

## Filtering

The following filter options are available on the Analysis tab:

-   Filter by persona. Select a Persona icon in the header to highlight the artifacts that are linked to the persona. You can select multiple personas. In this case, any artifact that is linked to at least one of the selected personas is highlighted.
-   Filter by breakdown definition. Select a Breakdown definition icon in the header to highlight the artifacts that are linked to the breakdown. You can select multiple breakdowns. In this case, any artifact that is linked to at least one of the selected breakdowns is highlighted.
-   Filter on text. Enter text in the filter field, then leave the field. All artifacts that contain the text are highlighted.

All filter functions can be used with each other.

## Expanding and collapsing tree nodes

When working with large KPI trees, you can close those parts of the tree that you are not currently working with. To collapse part of a tree, click the minus - icon on an artifact that has child artifacts. Collapsed nodes appear as a shadow under the top-level node. To expand collapsed nodes, click the plus + icon.

\[Omitted image "kpi-composer-collapse-nodes.png"\] Alt text: Collapse node icon with two levels of subnodes \[Omitted image "kpi-composer-collapsed-nodes.png"\] Alt text:

When a filter or a search matches a collapsed, hidden artifact, the tree does not expand. Instead, the "shadow" turns white although the top-level element remains grey.

## Add artifacts to a KPI tree

Add artifacts to the KPI tree by using the drag-and-drop tiles at the bottom of the project canvas.

### Before you begin

Think about your business goal and critical success factors before you begin to work on a project.

Role required: sn\_kpi\_composer.user \(own project\), sn\_kpi\_composer.admin \(any project\), admin. No role required for responsible user or user with edit access from project sharing.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **KPI Composer** and open or create a project, then navigate to the Analysis tab.

2.  Locate the KPI tree artifacts at the bottom of the screen.

    \[Omitted image "kpi-comp-tree-elements.png"\] Alt text: Draggable icons for each KPI Composer tree artifact

3.  Drag a Business Goal icon to the top of your project.

    To keep your planning simple, usually you have one business goal for each project, but you can have business goals as children of other business goals.

4.  Set the Business Goal properties as described in "Artifact properties."

    You can edit these properties later by clicking the Edit icon \(\[Omitted image "kpi-comp-edit-item-icon.png"\] Alt text:\) on the artifact tile.

5.  Repeat this process with Critical Success Factors and Measurements.

    Drop an artifact on top of another artifact to have the new artifact displayed as a child of the existing artifact. Critical Success Factors can be children of Business Goals or other Critical Success Factors. A Measurement can be a child of any artifact.

6.  As an alternative to creating and configuring all your artifacts, you can add an existing Library Element.

    1.  Select the bookmark icon to open the **Library Elements** list.

    2.  Drag an appropriate library element into your KPI tree.

        \[Omitted image "kpi-comp-library-elements.png"\] Alt text: Library Elements list.

    For more information, see [Cross-project library elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/cross-project-artifact-libraries.md).


### What to do next

If you change your mind about the relationships in a tree, you can select and drag an existing artifact to a different artifact. You can also change the ordering of artifacts. Drag a child artifact onto its parent to move it into the top position among its siblings.

## Artifact properties

Each artifact in a KPI tree can reference knowledge base articles, personas, or breakdown definitions.
