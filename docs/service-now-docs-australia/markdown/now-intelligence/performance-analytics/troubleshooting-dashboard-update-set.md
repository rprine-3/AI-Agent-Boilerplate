# Solving errors on dashboards moved with update sets

When you move a dashboard with an update set, if errors are shown on the **Update Set Preview Problems** tab of the Retrieved Update Set page, follow the instructions for each error to solve these problems.

## Could not find a record in sys\_grid\_canvas for column canvas\_page referenced in this update

When you move a dashboard with an update set, the following error may occur: 'Could not find a record in sys\_grid\_canvas for column canvas\_page referenced in this update'. To solve this error, move the canvas page from the source instance to the target instance.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### Procedure

1.  In the **Update Set Preview Problems** related list, click the information icon \(\[Omitted image "Form\_ReferenceLookupIcon.png"\] Alt text:\) next to the error.\[Omitted image "update-set-preview-problems.png"\] Alt text: Update Set Preview Problems tab with two errors.

2.  In the pa\_tabs record payload, copy the sys\_id associated with the canvas\_page field.

    \[Omitted image "filter-on-sys-id.png"\] Alt text: Filter grid canvas on Sys ID

3.  In the source instance, navigate to sys\_grid\_canvas.list.

4.  Filter the list on the sys\_id copied in step 2.

5.  Right-click on the returned record and select **Unload Canvas Page** to add this record to the current update set.

6.  Transfer the update set to the target instance using standard update set functionality.

    For more information, see [Retrieve an update set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/t_RetrieveAnUpdateSet.md).

7.  Repeat this task for all update set preview problems that have this error.


### Result

The missing dashboard tab content is moved to the target instance.

## Update set id 'global' is different than update set scope id

When you attempt to move a dashboard in a scoped app, the move fails when you try to retrieve the update set.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin.

### About this task

Dashboards comprise multiple tables. The ServiceNow AI Platform® does not track all of these tables. The untracked tables are always in the global scope. When you are moving a dashboard in the global scope, these tables do not present a problem. However, these tables block the move of dashboards in any other scope, because the scope of all components in an update set must be the same.

### Procedure

1.  Put the global Customer Updates record, sys\_update\_xml, in a global update set.

2.  Commit this update as its own update set, or make it a parent of the original update set and commit both at the same time.

    One update set has all Customer Updates records from the non-global scope, and the other has the sys\_portal Customer Updates records from the Global scope.

3.  Export both, and retrieve them in the target instance at same time.

4.  Preview and commit them in sequence: First commit the update set with non-global customer updates records and then the update set with global customer updates records.
