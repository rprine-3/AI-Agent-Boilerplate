# Limitations and requirements for Data snapshots

Several features of indicators and breakdowns are not supported with Data snapshots and multiple breakdowns.

## Instance-level limitations

|Limitation or unsupported feature|Notes|
|---------------------------------|-----|
|Database requirements|Only instances with the [RaptorDB Professional \(PostgreSQL\) database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/raptordb.md) are supported, not Oracle or MariaDB/MySQL. \(Checked when plugin is activated.\)|
|Domain separation|Domain-separated instances are not supported.|

If you have Australia Patch 3 or later, the Data Snapshots \(com.snc.pa.mlb\) plugin is installed automatically on eligible instances. This includes instances with domain separation, but on such instances the Data snapshots feature is disabled when the first job runs.

## Table-level limitations

|Limitation or unsupported feature|Notes|
|---------------------------------|-----|
|System tables|System tables \(named `sys_*`\) are not supported.|
|Benchmarking indicators|Not supported|

Benchmarking indicators

</td><td>

Not supported

</td></tr><tr><td>

Indicators with no conditions

</td><td>

Not supported

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scripted breakdown mappings/aggregations

</td><td>

Not supported

</td></tr><tr><td>

Breakdowns/aggregations on string and numeric type fields are not supported

</td><td>

The same limitations apply as with classic Performance Analytics breakdowns and indicators: Breakdowns on Choice fields that are strings or integers are supported. Only purely string and numeric fields are not supported. For example, a breakdown on Incident.Category would be supported because Category is a Choice field. A breakdown on Short Description would not be supported, because that is purely a string.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Only some query operators are supported

</td><td>

Unsupported operators for each field type on the source:-   Boolean/ChoiceTable/Reference: ISEMPTYSTRING
-   SysClassName: INSTANCEOF
-   String: MATCH\_PAT and MATCH\_RGX
-   Currency: NOT\_EQUALS, LESS\_THAN, GREATER\_THAN, LESS\_THAN\_OR\_EQUALS, GREATER\_THAN\_OR\_EQUALS, BETWEEN, EQUALS
-   Relative Dates: LESS\_THAN, LESS\_THAN\_EQ, GREATER\_THAN, GREATER\_THAN\_EQ, BETWEEN

</td></tr><tr><td>

Formula indicators

</td><td>

All [contributing indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) must support Data snapshots.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Formula methods

</td><td>

Formula indicators that use methods in their formulas are not supported.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Manual or external indicators or breakdowns

</td><td>

Only [automated indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md), [formula indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md), and [automated breakdowns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) are supported. All contributing indicators in a formula indicator must be supported for the formula indicator to be supported.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Indicators based on [database views](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md)

</td><td>

Only supported when the join conditions do not include fields other than sys\_id.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Database view prefix limitations

</td><td>

If the indicator source is a database view and there is an uppercase character in the database view prefix, the indicator is not supported. Also, if the two tables in the database view have the same prefix, the indicator is not supported.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Indicators with more than 250 breakdown/aggregation fields

</td><td>

Only 250 levels of breakdown are supported.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Indicators whose collection jobs have more than one timezone

</td><td>

Only daily collection and only one timezone are supported.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Historical processing

</td><td>

Only data collected after the enablement date is supported. Attempts to apply more than two levels of breakdown to older data do not return any results.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Breakdown matrices

</td><td>

Not applicable. All breakdown combinations are supported by design.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Collection periods set on data collector

</td><td>

All collections are daily.
