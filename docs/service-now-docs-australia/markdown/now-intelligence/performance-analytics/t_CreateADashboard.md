# Create or configure a responsive dashboard in Core UI

Create a dashboard where you can add Performance Analytics widgets, data visualizations, and other content that you frequently use. You can then share the dashboard with other users.

## Before you begin

If you're new to dashboards, the Visualize and Next Experience Dashboards sections of the ServiceNow University [Platform Analytics \(PA\) Overview training](https://learning.servicenow.com/lxp/en/now-intelligence/platform-analytics-pa-overview?id=learning_course_prev&course_id=fb9decf8932f06905402393d6cba10f6&s=1&ssa=3) provide an overview of these features. \(Registration and enrollment required.\)

**Note:** This topic refers to Dashboards in the Core UI. If your instance is migrated to Platform Analytics experience, see [Create a dashboard with the in-line editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/create-db-in-ac.md).

Owners of Core UI responsive dashboards have the option to migrate these dashboards to Platform Analytics experience. For more information, see [Migrate dashboards that you own](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/data-migration-migrate-dbs-you-own.md).

The dashboard overview in the Platform Analytics library shows both Core UI and Platform Analytics experience dashboards.

Core UI dashboard backgrounds are not themeable with custom colors.

Role required: Any user with an internal role can create dashboards with the inline editor. The system property **com.snc.par.coreui.dashboard\_create.enabled** must be set to true.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Select **Create dashboard**.

3.  In the New dashboard modal, select **Core UI** and then select **Create dashboard**.

    \[Omitted image "image.create-core-ui-db-from-library"\] Alt text: Create new Core UI dashboard on migrated instance

    The form for a new Core UI dashboard opens.

4.  Fill in the following fields:

<table id="choicetable_bfl_jhv_yw"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d68163e229">

Field

</th><th align="left" id="d68163e232">

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="chrow_lxl_nrq_dz"><td id="d68163e238">

**Name**

</td><td>

Name the dashboard.

</td></tr><tr id="chrow_lkc_4rq_dz"><td id="d68163e247">

**Order**

</td><td>

Enter an **Order** number to indicate the order the dashboard appears on the dashboard picker. Dashboards with lower numbers are listed first.

</td></tr><tr id="chrow_hd3_4rq_dz"><td id="d68163e259">

**Active**

</td><td>

Clear this field to mark the dashboard **inactive**. Inactive dashboards are accessible only if they appear on the **Recent** tab \(the nine most recently visited dashboards\) or if the user has a direct link to the dashboard.

 **Note:** When you activate responsive dashboards, the permissions associated with both active and inactive non-responsive dashboard are carried over to the responsive version.

</td></tr><tr id="chrow_gf4_4rq_dz"><td id="d68163e280">

**Owner**

</td><td>

The dashboard owner. Only a user with the administrator role can change this value.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select the **Restrict to roles** edit icon \[Omitted image "edit-icon.png"\] to specify the roles that a user must have to access this dashboard.

    For more information, see [Share a responsive dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/t_ControlAccessToADashboard.md).

6.  Users with admin, pa\_admin, and pa\_power\_user roles can configure these additional fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Group**|Select the magnifier icon to add the dashboard to a **Group**. Groups organize dashboards in the dashboard picker list. Grouped dashboards appear at the top of the list. Ungrouped dashboards appear in the list under **Other**.|
    |**Breakdown Source**|Select one or more breakdown sources in the **Breakdown Source** related list. Breakdowns enable users to filter Performance Analytics data on the dashboard. The **Breakdown Source** related list is available on the Dashboard form after you create the dashboard. For more information, see [Using breakdowns on dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/c_SpecialDashboards.md).|
    |**Act as filter**|You can configure a Performance Analytics breakdown on a dashboard to act as an interactive filter for reports on the dashboard. The dashboard must be configured as a breakdown dashboard. Select the interactive filter that you want this breakdown source to act as.|

7.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The dashboard is created with no content. To add your first content, select a widget type and a widget and select **Add**.

## What to do next

Add more content to your new dashboard. For more information, see [Edit a responsive dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/t_EditADashboard.md).
