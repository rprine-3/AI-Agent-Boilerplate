Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

com.snc.pa.scoresheet.max\_elements

</td><td>

Maximum number of [breakdown elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) of a breakdown that can be shown in a scoresheetDefault: 500

</td></tr><tr><td>

com.snc.pa.breakdown\_element\_cutoff

</td><td>

Maximum number of elements that a breakdown can have where the Analytics Hub and KPI Details show its scoreless elements.

 An element is scoreless when it meets one of these conditions:

-   For real-time scores, the element has never had a score.

-   For a formula indicator, the element has never had a score in one or more of the [contributing indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md).

-   For the collected scores of an automated indicator, the element has never had a score. However, if the number of elements that would still be displayed exceeds the **com.snc.pa.breakdown\_element\_cutoff** value, only the elements that have a score or change value on the selected date are displayed. For more information and examples, see [Collected scores and com.snc.pa.breakdown\_element\_cutoff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/collected-element-display-cutoff.md).


 **Note:** This parameter does not affect whether unmatched elements are shown.
