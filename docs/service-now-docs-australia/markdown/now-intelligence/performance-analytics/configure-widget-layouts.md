# Configure the layout of a responsive dashboard

You can change the appearance of widgets; change widget layouts; change the colors of the widget title, header, and background; and show or hide widget headers.

## Before you begin

Role required: User. dashboard\_admin for all dashboards, or any role for dashboards that you own or ones that you have been given the right to edit. See [Platform Analytics dashboard roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/pa-dashboard-roles.md) for more information about viewing and editing rights on dashboards.

**Note:** Responsive dashboards do not support the Sticky Notes widget.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Dashboards** or **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  From the dashboard picker, select the dashboard that you want to edit.

3.  Click the plus sign \(\[Omitted image "AddWidgetButton.png"\] Alt text: Plus sign button\) to put the dashboard in edit mode.

4.  Perform any of the following actions.

<table id="choicetable_gv3_q3r_g5"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d43625e118">

Action

</th><th align="left" id="d43625e121">

Steps

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d43625e127">

**Show or hide the widget border, header, and title**

</td><td>

1.  Point to the widget, then click the gear icon \(\[Omitted image "Pa\_dashboard\_cog.png"\] Alt text: Edit widget icon\).
2.  In the Edit Widget window, select or clear the boxes to show or hide the border, header, and title.

**Note:** If you hide the header, point to the handlebar at the top of the widget to show the icons.

3.  To align the title, select **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**.
 \[Omitted image "edit-widget-window.png"\] Alt text: Edit Widget window with Show Border, Header, and Title boxes selected. When you hide the widget header, no header icons are visible, including the icon indicating that you have applied an interactive filter to the widget.

 It is not possible to change the title of a widget from within a dashboard. The title is taken from the visualization the widget is based on. Edit the visualization itself to change the title.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d43625e175">

**Change the widget title color and header color**

</td><td>

1.  Point to the widget, then click the gear icon \(\[Omitted image "Pa\_dashboard\_cog.png"\] Alt text: Edit widget icon\).
2.  In the Edit Widget window, click the color picker icon \(\[Omitted image "color-picker.png"\] Alt text: Color picker icon\) for Title color or Header color.
3.  In the color picker, use the slider to choose a hue and select a color to choose it. You can also enter the hexadecimal code for the color in the **Title color** or **Header color** field. Delete the hexadecimal code to return to the default title or header color.
 **Note:** When you select a dark header color, the icons in the header change to white. When you select a light header color, the icons in the header change to black.

</td><td>

2.  Select **Use custom background color** and click on the color to open the color picker. It has five option icons: Color Wheel, Color Sliders, Color Palettes, Spectrum, and Pencils.
3.  From the Sliders option, choose Grayscale, RGB, CMYK, or HSB. RGB enables you to specify hexadecimal codes.
4.  Drag any color to the palette at the bottom of the color picker to use it in other Core UI dashboard backgrounds.
5.  Uncheck **Use custom background color** to return to the default background color.
 **Note:** The selected background color applies to all tabs on the dashboard.
