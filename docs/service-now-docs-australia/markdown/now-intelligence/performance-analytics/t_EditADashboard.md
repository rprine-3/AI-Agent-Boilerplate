# Edit a responsive dashboard

You can edit the contents of a dashboard, including Performance Analytics widgets, reports, and tabs. Because dashboards are shared, any modifications you make are applied globally.

## Before you begin

**Note:** This topic refers to Dashboards in the Core UI. If your instance is migrated to Platform Analytics experience, see [Edit Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/edit-db-in-ac.md).

Owners of Core UI responsive dashboards have the option to migrate these dashboards to Platform Analytics experience. For more information, see [Migrate dashboards that you own](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/data-migration-migrate-dbs-you-own.md).

If Platform Analytics experience is enabled, the dashboard picker shows both Core UI and Platform Analytics experience dashboards.

Core UI dashboard backgrounds are not themeable with custom colors.

Role required: Any user with an internal role can create dashboards with the inline editor. The system property **com.snc.par.coreui.dashboard\_create.enabled** must be set to true.

**Note:** Responsive dashboards do not support the Sticky Notes widget.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Dashboards** or **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  From the dashboard picker, select the dashboard that you want to edit.

3.  Perform any of the following actions.

<table id="choicetable_gv3_q3r_g5"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d235029e200">
