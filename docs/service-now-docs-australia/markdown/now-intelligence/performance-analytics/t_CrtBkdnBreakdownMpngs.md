# Create a breakdown mapping on a breakdown record

Specify which field on the indicator source references the breakdown source. If no appropriate field is available, specify a script to query the indicator source.

## Before you begin

Assign a breakdown source to the breakdown before creating the mapping.

Role required: The same as for creating a breakdown.

## About this task

You can create multiple mappings for the same breakdown, enabling you to use that breakdown for multiple indicators.

**Note:** The procedure on this page uses a related list on the breakdown form. You can instead use a graphical tool that you access from the indicator form. See [Assign and map breakdowns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/create-breakdown-mapping.md).

## Procedure

1.  If you are adding a mapping to an existing breakdown, find that breakdown in the relevant list of breakdowns and open it.

2.  In the **Breakdown Mapping** related list, click **New**.

3.  Select the **Facts table**.

    This table is the indicator source that you want to break down.

4.  Do one of these actions.

<table id="choicetable_vmj_4t3_twb"><tbody><tr><td id="d139258e120">

**Use a field to map values to elements.**

</td><td>

Select the **Field** in the indicator source that maps to records in the breakdown. See the use of the **Category** field in [Example: Field mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/example-field-mapping.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d139258e148">

**Use a script to map values to elements.**

</td><td>

Select **Scripted**, then select the **Script** that defines the association between indicator records and breakdown elements.Use a script when you do not have the simple use case of a field in the indicator source that maps to a breakdown source table. A script can define a wide range of mapping relationships. The most common use case is when the breakdown source is a [bucket group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) and the script returns an integer to assign an indicator score to a bucket. See [Example: Script mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/example-script-mapping.md).

 You cannot show real-time scores for an indicator that uses a scripted breakdown.

 **Tip:** Try to implement scripted breakdown mappings so that \[mapping of level 1 &amp;&amp; mapping of level 2\] is equal to the intersection of \[mapping of level 1\] and \[mapping of level 2\]. Otherwise, the score and the number of records may not agree for second-level breakdowns. If these values disagree, the score is correct.

6.  Repeat steps 2–5 as needed, to define additional mappings.
