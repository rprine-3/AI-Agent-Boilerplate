# Example: Field mapping

The Category breakdown maps the **Category** field on the incident table to the Incident.Category breakdown source, which references the Choices\[sys\_choice\_list\] table.

In the first image, you see the Category breakdown with the Incident.Category breakdown source. This breakdown has a breakdown mapping to the **Category** field on the incident table.

The Incident.Category breakdown source uses records in the Choices\[sys\_choice\_list\] table.

The next image shows the Choice \[sys\_choice\] table records that meet the conditions that are specified in the Incident.Category breakdown source. Note the Label field values.

Finally, you see the Category field of some records on the Incidents table. This field is mapped to the Category breakdown. The field values match the Label fields of the records of the Choices\[sys\_choice\_list\] table that the Incident.Category breakdown source filters for.
