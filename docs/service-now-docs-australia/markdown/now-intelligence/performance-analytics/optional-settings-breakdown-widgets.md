# Additional settings for breakdown widgets

Breakdown widgets have the following optional settings for the date range, the display, the grouping breakdown, and for the column contents. Not all options are available for all visualizations.

**Important:** This topic is not a guide to creating breakdown widgets. It is a guide to extra, optional settings that are common across breakdown widget types. FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON CREATING TIME SERIES WIDGETS, PLEASE SEE THE APPROPRIATE "CREATE" TOPIC:

## Date settings

<table id="table_edt_jbf_kqb"><thead><tr><th>

Setting

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="row_widget_period"><td>

Period

</td><td>

Select the date range to display in the widget. Several options are available.-   Select a specific time range. The default is **3m** \(3 months\).
-   Select **max** to use scores up to the current date.
-   Select **between** and then fill in the **From** and **To** fields to define a time period.

The **Period** field is available only if you select **Line**, **Columns and Total**, or **Stacked Column** as the **Visualization**

</td></tr><tr id="row_widget_show_date_range_selector"><td>

Show date range selector

</td><td>

Display a date range selector on the widget that enables users to change the selected period when viewing the widget on a dashboard.**Note:**

-   Selecting a date range on a widget does not update the trend line.
-   If you combine a time series aggregation such as By month SUM with a date range selector, the user may see one more time period than they expect. The instance interprets a period such as 3m as 0-3 months and may show four months of scores.

Breakdown on Y axis

</td><td>

Pivot Analytics Hub breakdown widgets display [breakdown elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) as the X axis and indicators as the Y axis by default. Select this check box to display breakdown elements as the Y axis and indicators as the X axis.

</table>## Element settings

<table id="table_mp4_bvg_v1b"><thead><tr><th>

Setting

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Elements filter

</td><td>

Specify if only a certain subset of breakdown elements are available for this widget. By default all elements are available.For example, elements of the breakdown **Priority** can be: **Critical**, **High**, **Moderate**, **Low** or **Planning**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Manual elements

</td><td>

Breakdown elements can be selected automatically or manually. Select the **Manual elements** check box to display the **Widget Elements** related list for adding elements. Clear the **Manual elements** check box to automatically use the elements that belong to the breakdown.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Show top x

</td><td>

Show only the elements with the x highest scores, according to the **Sort by** field, to make the chart easier to read.In case of ties, the first element listed in the scoresheet is shown. For example, if you have a widget where **Show top x** is 3 and the third-highest value for the Priority breakdown is tied between High and Moderate, the widget shows High, not Moderate.

 \[Omitted image "bkdown-widget-tied-top-x.png"\] Alt text: Scoresheet with two elements tied for 3rd highest value.

 \[Omitted image "bkdwn-widget-show-top-3.png"\] Alt text: Breakdown widget with Show Top x = 3 and the elements 2 - high and 3 - Moderate tied for third highest, with 2 - High showing.

 The order in which the scoresheet lists elements depends on the table containing the elements. For example, for elements on the Choice \[sys\_choice\] table, this order follows the value in the Sequence field. For elements on the Group \[sys\_group\] table, the order is alphabetical based on the Name field.

 **Note:** The top elements are selected from the most recent scores. If the widget has a line visualization, the top elements are still selected from the most recent scores, even if other elements have a higher average score across the timespan shown.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Percentages

</td><td>

If you select **No percentages**, no score percentages are shown for the instances. If you select **Percentage of elements**, a score percentage is shown for each instance. For example, 6.4% of the total incidents are Critical, 11.8% are High, and so on.
