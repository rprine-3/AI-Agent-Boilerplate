# Dashboard execution statistics

The **Dashboard Stats Executions** list enables you to view how long it takes for your Core UI dashboards to load. The list includes one entry for each launch of a dashboard.

To view dashboard execution statistics, navigate to **All** &gt; **dashboard\_stats\_executions.list**. The admin or dashboard\_admin role is required.

**Note:**

-   Adding unused dashboards to this list takes some time, especially if your instance has many dashboards.
-   The **Dashboard Stats Executions** list supports the value of the property **glide.dashboard.recent\_executions\_number** per dashboard. The default value of this property is 25.

-   The [Dashboard statistics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/dashboard-statistics.md) list enables you to view how often each of your Core UI dashboards is run and how long it takes to run them.
-   The [Dashboard executions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/dashboard-execs.md) list shows how long it takes for your Core UI dashboards to load and the ID of the user who launched it.

By default, the **Dashboard Stats Executions** list has the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Dashboard|The name of the dashboard. Select the hyperlink to view the dashboard properties.|
|Execution duration|The time in milliseconds that it took to run the dashboard.|
|Execution timestamp|The date and time of the launch of the dashboard.|

To view the dashboards that take the most time to run, sort **Execution duration** from z-a.
