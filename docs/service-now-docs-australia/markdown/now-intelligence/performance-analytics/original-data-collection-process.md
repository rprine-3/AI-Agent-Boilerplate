# Log details for classic data collector

Performance Analytics score collection follows the process described here. To aid troubleshooting, a mapping between job steps and log entries is provided.

## Collection overview

The data collection job involves executing an SQL query for each indicator source that uses the data collector. The query repeats for every collection time from the start date to the stop date. Then queries run for the next indicator source. Each step of executing a query is documented in the data collection job log.

## Optimization properties shown in log

The data collector has several optimizations that can be turned on or off in the System Properties. The beginning of the job log includes the state of these properties.

**Note:** Do not confuse these optimization properties with the new, optimized data collector. These properties apply only to the classic data collector. The new data collector is optimized at a more fundamental level.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Nested collection

</td><td>

Replaces flat mapping, to reduce redundant objects. For example, instead of creating identical indicator objects for every breakdown and element on that indicator, only one object is created for the indicator.

</td><td>

**com.snc.pa.dc.nested\_collection** Default: true

</td></tr><tr><td>

Flush snapshots

</td><td>

The ServiceNow AI Platform stores a maximum number of Performance Analytics [snapshots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) in memory before offloading them to the database.

</td><td>

**com.snc.pa.dc.flush\_snapshot\_count** Default: 1000

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use hashcode for count distinct

</td><td>

Stores count distinct aggregations as a hashcode instead of as separate values.

</td><td>

**com.snc.pa.dc.use\_hashcode\_for\_distinct** Default: true

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Starting and completing collection job

Follow the data collection process as revealed in log messages. The log messages in each subprocess have been separated into their own tables.

**Note:** This log is for the original data collector. If your instance uses this data collector, the system parameter **com.snc.pa.dc.hsql** exists and is "false." Otherwise, you are using the optimized data collector as described in [Optimizing data collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/optimized-data-collection.md). For more information about that log, see [Log details for optimized data collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/log-details-optimized-dc.md).

Generate SQL based on the conditions that are specified in the indicator source.**Note:** If the indicator source specifies Today in one of the conditions, Today is considered relative to the period for which the data collection job is executed. For example, the Incidents.New indicator source includes the condition **\[Opened\]\[on\]\[Today\]**. With days defined to start at 07:00:00, when data is collected for 2019-10-28, the job produces the SQL script on the right.
