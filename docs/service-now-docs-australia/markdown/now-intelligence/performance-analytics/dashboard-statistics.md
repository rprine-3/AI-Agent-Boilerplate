# Dashboard statistics

The **Dashboard Stats** list enables you to view how often each of your dashboards is run and how long it takes to run them.

To view dashboard statistics, navigate to **All** &gt; **dashboard\_stats.list**. The admin or dashboard\_admin role is required. By default, the Dashboard Statistics list displays all dashboards that have been viewed. There is one entry in this table for each dashboard on the instance that has been viewed at least once. The entries increment until an entry is deleted or the dashboard itself is deleted.

-   The **Dashboard Stats** list enables you to view how often each of your dashboards is run and how long it takes to run them.
-   The [Dashboard executions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/dashboard-execs.md) list shows how long it takes for your dashboards to load and the ID of the user who launched it.
-   The [Dashboard execution statistics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/dashboard-statistics-exec.md) list how long it takes for your Core UI dashboards to load. The list includes one entry for the most recent launch of each dashboard per user.
