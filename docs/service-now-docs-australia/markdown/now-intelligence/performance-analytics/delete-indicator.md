# Delete an indicator

Delete unwanted or unused indicators from your instance. Deleting indicators is risky, so there are several restrictions.

## Before you begin

Besides roles, check that you meet the following requirements before trying to delete an indicator:

-   Your instance has an active entitlement to the subscription version of Performance Analytics. For more information, see [Activating your Performance Analytics subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/c_PremiumPerformanceAnalytics.md).
-   If your instance is domain-separated, you have visibility into the same domain as the indicator.
-   The indicator that you want to delete is not being used in a formula indicator. If it is so used, see whether you can delete those formula indicators first.
-   The indicator is not a benchmark indicator.

Role required: pa\_data\_collector \(requires that the indicator record is visible to this role; cannot delete external indicators\), pa\_power\_user, pa\_admin, or admin

## About this task

**Warning:** Deleting an indicator deletes all scores for that indicator. Consider the risk of creating a data gap before you delete an indicator.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics Administration** &gt; **Indicators** &gt; **\[type of indicator\]**, and locate the indicator you want to delete.

2.  Open the indicator record.

3.  Make sure you are in the same application scope as the indicator.

4.  Select **Delete**.

    If you don't see a **Delete** button, check that you meet the requirements for deleting the indicator.

5.  Confirm.
