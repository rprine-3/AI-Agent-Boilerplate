# Request an analytics service

Request services associated with dashboards, such as to request a new dashboard or access to an existing dashboard.

3.  Select the **Can We Help You?** category.

## Fulfill an analytics request

Analytics service requests are assigned to the Analytics group who can review and fulfill the requests.

### Before you begin

At least one user must be a member of the Analytics group.

Role required:

-   Fulfiller — itil and pa\_admin. The fulfilling user must be a member of the Analytics group which automatically grants these roles.
-   Approver — itil and approver\_user

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Desk** &gt; **My Groups Work**.

2.  Select a request.

3.  If the request is to grant access to a dashboard, select the **Dashboard** that this request applies to.

4.  Select one or more users as the **Request Approver**.

    This approver should not be a member of the Analytics group.

    **Note:** No approval is required when the request type is **Report an issue**.

5.  The approver can then approve the request.

    1.  Navigate to **Self-Service** &gt; **My Approvals**.

    2.  Select the request approval.

    3.  Click **Approve**.

    If the approver rejects the approval, the request is closed automatically. If the approver selects an option other than approved or rejected, the fulfiller user can close the request by setting the **State** to **Closed Skipped** or **Closed Incomplete**.

    After the request is approved, or if no approval was required, a task is created for the Analytics team. Navigate to the **Tasks** related list on the request record to view the task. An email notification is sent to the Analytics team.

6.  After the approver approves the request, perform the requested changes to fulfill the request.

    Refer to the dashboards documentation for instructions on how to modify dashboards and dashboard permissions.

7.  Update the task **State** to **Closed Complete**.

    The request **State** is updated automatically when the task is closed. An email notification is sent to the requesting user to inform the user that the requested changes are complete.
