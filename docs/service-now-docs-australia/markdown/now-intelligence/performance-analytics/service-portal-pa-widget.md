# Performance Analytics widgets on Service Portal

You can show Performance Analytics indicators and breakdowns using Service Portal.

When you edit a portal, add the **Performance Analytics** widget. Use the widget options to select an existing Performance Analytics widget to show on the portal and whether to show its title.

## Security requirements for viewing widgets

Starting with Quebec, widgets follow indicator and breakdown access control lists \(ACLs\). Outside of ACLs, no roles are required for viewing widgets.

However, if you upgrade an instance from a version earlier than Quebec, by default the rules from before Quebec still apply. Indicator and breakdown ACLs are followed only in these areas:

-   List widgets follow indicator ACLs.
-   When viewing breakdowns, breakdown ACLs apply.

Furthermore, on an upgraded instance, the following widgets may require users to have the pa\_viewer role:

-   List widgets
-   Text widgets
-   The Breakdowns section of Workbench widgets

Upgraded instances cannot automatically follow the rules introduced in Quebec because of the variation in how ACLs are configured.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
