# Dashboard executions

The **Dashboard Executions** list enables you to view how long it takes for your Core UI dashboards to load and the ID of the user who launched it. The list includes one entry for the most recent launch of each dashboard per user.

To view dashboard execution statistics, navigate to **All** &gt; **dashboard\_executions.list**. The admin or dashboard\_admin role is required.

**Note:**

-   Adding unused dashboards to this list takes some time, especially if your instance has many dashboards.
-   The **Dashboard Executions** list supports the most recent 10 runs per user per dashboard. Edit the system property **glide.dashboard.log.max\_user\_executions\_x\_dashboard** to change this value.

-   The [Dashboard statistics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/dashboard-statistics.md) list enables you to view how often each of your Core UI dashboards is run and how long it takes to run them.
