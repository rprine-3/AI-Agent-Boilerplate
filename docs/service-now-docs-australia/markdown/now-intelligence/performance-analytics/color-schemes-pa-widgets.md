# Color schemes

When a data visualization illustrates multiple indicators, breakdowns, or table fields, the colors of the different values can follow a color scheme.

Color schemes can apply to the following visualizations:

-   Time series and breakdown widgets that display multiple indicators or breakdowns
-   Widgets on breakdown dashboards when multiple elements are shown separately
-   Reports that group by or stack by table fields
-   Platform Analytics data visualization components that group by or stack by table fields

You can select a color scheme in the **Color Scheme** field when you create a widget. For an example, see [Create a pie, donut, or semi-donut visualization for a breakdown widget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/create-pie-widget.md). You can also design your own color scheme.

You don’t have to specify a color scheme. In this case, the default color scheme specified in the property **com.snc.pa.chart\_default\_color\_schema** is applied if necessary. In the base system, this color scheme is Default UI14.

All color schemes are on the Chart color scheme \[pa\_chart\_color\_schemes\] table, at **Performance Analytics** &gt; **System** &gt; **Chart Color Schemes**.

The default color schemes use color definitions with the Qualitative themeable colors from the UX Theme Properties \[sys\_ux\_theme\_property\] table. When Next Experience is activated, these colors are used rather than the Core UI color palette.
