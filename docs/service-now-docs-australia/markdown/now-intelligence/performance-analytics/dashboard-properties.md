# Responsive dashboard properties

Use properties to fine-tune dashboard behavior and appearance.

Navigate to **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties** to configure the main responsive dashboard properties. In the Filter navigator, enter `sys_properties.list` to configure other reporting properties.

Enables unified navigation under Platform Analytics and Platform Analytics Administration menu sections and common library pages for both Core UI and Next Experience analytics artifacts. Upon upgrade to Australia, this property is set to true by default.

com.glide.par.unified\_analytics.enabled

</td><td>

-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: true
-   Location: [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md) to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table.

 When enabled, users see both Platform Analytics and Core UI \(responsive\) dashboards in the library. Users can still drill down to KPI details from responsive dashboard indicator visualizations.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

-   Default value: true
-   Location: [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md) to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apply security rules to the list of users, user groups, and roles that are visible when sharing dashboards.

glide.cms.dashboards.sharing\_with\_secure\_search

</td><td>

-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

 When enabled, the list of users, user groups, and roles that are visible in the sharing panel is restricted. The restriction is based on the configuration of the sys\_user, sys\_user\_group, and sys\_user\_role ACLs. For more information, see [Access control list rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control-rules.md).

 There is a performance penalty associated with enabling this property. Performance degradation may be based on the number and complexity of business rules and ACLs on your instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Specify a comma-separated list of roles that can share their own dashboards.

glide.cms.share\_dashboards.role

</td><td>

-   Type: string
-   Default value: Empty

When this property is empty, all users can share their own dashboards.

-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

 **Note:** Properties that restrict dashboard sharing do not apply to users with the admin and dashboard\_admin roles. Users with these two roles can always share any dashboard.

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.canvas.grid.widget\_performance\_threshold

</td><td>

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: none
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of seconds that responsive dashboard widgets are cached in the browser.

glide.canvas.grid.widget\_cache\_ttl

</td><td>

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 2
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of users, groups, and roles returned when searching for a name in the Share panel of a Responsive Dashboard.The value of this property is per category, so the default value of 100 may yield 300 results - 100 users, 100 groups, and 100 roles.

glide.cms.dashboards.sharing.search.maxRecords

</td><td>

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 100
-   Location: [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md) to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table.

 Setting the value too low can cause the expected results not to be found. The minimum value is 5. Setting the value too high can cause performance issues.
