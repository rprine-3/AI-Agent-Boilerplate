# Copy a responsive dashboard URL

It is not possible to copy a dashboard URL from the browser. You can, however, create a URL that opens the current view of the dashboard, including tabs and [breakdown elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md). When the link is followed, the ServiceNow platform frame around the dashboard is not included.

## Before you begin

Role required: You must be able to access the dashboard.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Dashboards** or **All** &gt; **Performance Analytics** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Select the responsive dashboard with the URL that you want to copy.

3.  Select a tab, breakdown, and breakdown element.

4.  From the context menu \[Omitted image "ContextMenu.png"\] Alt text: context menu icon select **Copy Dashboard URL**.


## Result

The dashboard URL is copied to your clipboard. Some browsers prompt you to copy the URL to your clipboard.

## What to do next

Share the URL with other users.

## Dashboard URL format

You can link to a Performance Analytics dashboard from your instance. Several URL parameters enable you to specify aspects of the dashboard when the link is followed.

All dashboard URLs follow this format:

```
https://<instance>.service-now.com/$dashboards.do?
```

.

**Note:** Because dashboards are not limited to users of Performance Analytics,

```
$dashboards.do
```

replaces

```
$pa_dashboard
```

, although both strings work in dashboard URLs.

This base URL is followed by several optional URL query parameters.
