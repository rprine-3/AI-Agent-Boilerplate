# PADomainUtils - setFoundation\(Boolean foundation\)

Use this method to move or copy only foundational records in a hybrid domain configuration.

You can implement a hybrid approach by maintaining some types of record in a parent domain and some types in child domains. Generally, the parent domain contains foundational records and the child domain contains higher-level records, such as widgets. The following types of record are considered foundational records.

-   Bucket groups
-   Buckets
-   Scripts
-   Breakdown sources
-   Indicator sources
-   Filters
-   Breakdowns
-   Managed sources
-   Manual breakdowns
-   Breakdown mappings
-   Breakdown relations

Other Performance Analytics records such as widgets and indicators are not foundational records. Set this method to false to move or copy these additional records as well.
