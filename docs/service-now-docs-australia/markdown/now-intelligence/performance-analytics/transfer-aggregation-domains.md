# Transfer domain configuration with score aggregation

To transfer between instances a Performance Analytics domain configuration that is set to aggregate scores, transfer both the configuration and the aggregation domain.

## Before you begin

Transfer the domain configuration with an update set. For more information about using update sets to transfer configurations between instances, see [System update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Log in as admin to the source instance from which you transferred the domain configuration.

2.  Navigate to **Data Collector** &gt; **Domain Configurations**.

3.  Open the domain configuration record that you transferred in the update set.

4.  Right-click on the header of the form and select **Show XML**.

5.  Copy the sys\_id, which is the value of the `aggregate_domain` element.

    \[Omitted image "aggregate-domain-sysid.png"\] Alt text: The XML of the transferred domain configuration, with the sys\_id highlighted.
