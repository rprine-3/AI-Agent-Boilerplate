# Log details for optimized data collector

Starting with the Tokyo release, a new, optimized data collector is available. The log details for this data collector differ from the log details of the classic data collector.

## Collection overview

The data collection job involves executing an SQL query for each indicator source that uses the data collector. The query repeats for every collection time from the start date to the stop date. Then queries run for the next indicator source. Each step of executing a query is documented in the data collection job log.

## Starting and completing collection job

Follow the data collection process as revealed in log messages. The log messages in each subprocess have been separated into their own tables.

**Note:** This log is for the optimized HSQL data collector as described in [Optimizing data collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/optimized-data-collection.md). If **com.snc.pa.dc.hsql** is "false," you are using the classic data collector. Otherwise, you are using the optimized data collector. For more information about that log, see [Log details for classic data collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/original-data-collection-process.md).

Generate SQL based on the conditions that are specified in the indicator source.**Note:** If the indicator source specifies Today in one of the conditions, Today is considered relative to the period for which the data collection job is executed. For example, the Incidents.New indicator source includes the condition **\[Opened\]\[on\]\[Today\]**. With days defined to start at 07:00:00, when data is collected for 2019-10-28, the job produces the SQL script on the right.

 Log number of times the offload limit was exceeded for each category of object. Each time the offload limit is exceeded in one category, all objects are moved to HSQL temporary database storage. At the end of the map/reduce function, any remaining records are offloaded. The number of remaining records is usually less than the threshold, and this offloading is also logged.

Process each record on the indicator source to calculate scores. Log messages track running total of processed records. Each time the number of resulting scores or snapshots exceeds a limit, all objects are offloaded to the HSQL database. The offloading is logged after the map/reduce function completes.

 Processing for each record involves:

 -   Execute or evaluate any scripts.
-   Validate indicator conditions.
-   Calculate the indicator score.
-   For each breakdown:
    1.  Calculate the breakdown score or execute the breakdown script.
    2.  Retrieve all breakdown unique values.
    3.  Create or update the array for scores or snapshots. The array is: `Indicator, Breakdown 1, Artifact 1, Breakdown 2, Artifact 2, Domain, Value, Array of [sys_id]`
