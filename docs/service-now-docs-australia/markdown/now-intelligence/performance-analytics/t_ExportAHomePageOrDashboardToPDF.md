# Export a responsive dashboard to PDF

Export a dashboard as a PDF so you can archive, print, or distribute it.

## Before you begin

This topic refers to Dashboards in the Core UI. If your instance is migrated to Platform Analytics experience, see [Export a Platform Analytics dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/export-pae-dashboard-ppt.md).

Roles required: No role is required to export dashboards to PDF, however, an admin has to configure the instance for PDF export. See [Enable PDF export of dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/enable-pdf-export.md) for more information.

## About this task

Interactive filters that are applied to the dashboard are also applied to the PDF. However, applied breakdowns are not included in the export.

**Note:** To generate the PDF locally, set the interactive filters, click the user icon, and select **Printer Friendly Version**. The dashboard opens in a new window or tab. Export the dashboard using the print settings of the browser.

Limitations:

-   Custom content may not generate as expected when exported to PDF. For more information, see [Custom content PDF export limitations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/custom-content-pdf-export-limitations.md).
-   Dashboards that are exported to PDF do not include the dashboard layout. Widgets are stacked on top of each other and take up the full page width.
-   Widgets are exported to a fixed height. Large widgets, such as workbench or list widgets, are truncated.
-   Calendar reports exported from a dashboard may be truncated because exporting calendar reports to PDF is not supported.
-   Breakdowns applied to a dashboard are not included in the PDF.
-   Widgets may appear in a different order than on the dashboard.
-   Widget legends may not appear.
-   Exports do not include data tables associated with report visualizations. You can export individual reports separately, including their data tables. To include data tables in scheduled reports, check **Display data table** on the report's Configure tab in Report Designer.
-   Coloring on the delta text for single score report widgets is not preserved.
-   PDFs do not reflect the selected time frame when you select the **Show date range selector** at the widget level.
-   It is not possible to export responsive dashboards as templates.

**Note:** PDFs that are sent as emails may not be generated immediately.
