# Dashboards for analytics admins

Use Platform Analytics dashboards to access, organize, and share data in a visual format. Dashboards contain data visualizations, filters, and other visual elements.

## Dashboard overview for analytics admins

On Australia instances, you can find both Core UI dashboards and Platform Analytics experience dashboards in the Dashboards library.

To find dashboards in Platform Analytics, navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**. For users with admin roles, the dashboards page includes tools that are designed to help administrators efficiently manage the dashboards. Administrators can monitor the usage, perform dashboard-specific tasks, such as deleting or deactivating dashboards, and also identify the key insights with filters.

You can also directly access Dashboards from the left navigation in Platform Analytics library pages.

## Platform analytics library navigation

Library pages like this one include a navigation pane that provides access to the other libraries and the Usage Insights page. Use it to navigate between the libraries without interrupting your workflow.

## Dashboards for analytics admins

The following example shows the Dashboards library that includes all the common and additional elements that are visible to the users with sys\_admin and dashboard\_admin roles only. See [Dashboard elements for users with admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/dashboards-for-admin-users.md) table for descriptions.

For information on role-based access for the left navigation pane and Platform Analytics overview page, see [Roles applicable for Platform Analytics overview page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md).
