# Chart interactions in a data visualization

You can set what occurs when a user interacts with a visualization, such as by selecting a bar column. Possibilities include navigating to a URL, opening another data visualization, and filtering all visualizations on the dashboard by the selected value.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Adding a Drill down to visualization interaction to a data visualization

The configuration panel of a data visualization includes a section labeled Chart interaction. In this section, you set what is called "on-click behavior." This term refers to what happens when a user interacts with a segment of the visualization that represents a value. Examples include selecting a point on a time series or a segment of a pie or donut. You can also disable chart interactions for the visualization.

**Important:** You cannot configure chart interactions for data visualizations on technical dashboards or other UI Builder pages. You can only enable and configure custom on-click events. Turn on-click events on or off with the **Enable drilldowns** toggle, then configure handlers for them. For information about configuring on-click events from data visualizations on a technical dashboard, see [Add a drilldown event to a data visualization on a technical dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/add-custom-drilldown-event.md).

The following actions are available for a chart interaction:

-   **Go to data view**

    Opens a view of the data appropriate to the data type. For information about the views for each data source, see [Data views for different data sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/visualization-drilldown-in-config-ws.md).

    **Note:** Go to data view is the default interaction for all supported data sources.

-   **Go to URL**

    Opens the URL you specify. This URL can be on the instance or external to it. Where relevant, you can specify the name of the page that is opened in a tooltip. Go to URL is the default interaction for Usage Insights data sources.

-   **Apply as filter**

    Filters all applicable data visualizations on the dashboard by the value of the selected segment. Does not apply when the Group by field is a time duration. Available only for Horizontal and Vertical Bar and Pie/Donut visualizations, and only for table and indicator data sources. Not available on UI Builder. For more information, see [Make a data visualization act as a filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/make-dv-act-as-filter.md).

-   **Drill down to chart**

    Opens a different data visualization that is filtered by the selected data. You can add a drill-down visualization for each metric on the parent visualization. You configure this new drill-down visualization seamlessly as part of the process of configuring the chart interaction.

    **Note:** Drill down to chart has the following limitations:

    -   You cannot configure Drill down to chart in the inline dashboard editor, only in the Visualization Designer.
    -   Drill down to chart is available only for table data sources.
    -   You cannot set drill down to chart from the Calendar, Geomap, Indicator scorecard, or List visualizations. However, you can drill down from supported visualizations to any visualization that can display table data.

Different visualization interactions support different data sources and data visualization types. The following table shows the matrix of support.

Select what happens when a viewer interacts with a section of a data visualization that you are editing.

When the chart interaction for a data visualization is set to Go to data, interacting with a data value on the visualization opens different pages depending on the data source.
