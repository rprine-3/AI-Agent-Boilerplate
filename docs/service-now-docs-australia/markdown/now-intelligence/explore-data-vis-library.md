# Exploring the Data Visualizations library

Find any data visualization in the Platform Analytics Data Visualizations library so that you can share information about your data with stakeholders and other users to evaluate the trends with real-time data. With the appropriate role, you can also create a visualization.

## Data Visualizations Library overview

On Australia instances, you can find both Core UI reports and Platform Analytics experience data visualizations in the Data Visualizations library.

When you edit Core UI dashboards and their content, you do so in the Core UI tools including Report Designer. For more information, see [Reporting, dashboards, and Performance Analytics in the Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/classic-vis-overview.md) and [Using reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/c_GenerateReports.md).

To open the data visualizations library, navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**. You can also navigate to this library from other Platform Analytics library pages.

Library pages like this one include a navigation pane that provides access to the other libraries and the Usage Insights page. Use it to navigate between the libraries without interrupting your workflow.

## Data Visualizations library elements

Access to certain elements in the Data Visualizations library is based on whether the user is associated with specific admin roles. For Data Visualizations, the analytics admin roles include report\_admin, pa\_admin, platform\_analytics\_admin, and admin. The lowest required role is viz\_admin. For users with the lowest role, the application navigator provides a direct access only to the [Dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/find-dashboard-library.md), [Data Visualizations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/explore-data-vis-library.md), and [Indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/your-kpis.md) from the Platform Analytics library. For more information on user roles in Data Visualizations, see [Data visualization roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/platform-analytics-roles.md).

The following image shows the Data Visualizations library elements that are accessible for users with analytics admin roles.

The following example shows the Data Visualizations library elements that are accessible for users with lower roles.
