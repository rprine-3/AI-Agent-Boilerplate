# Launch AI Data Explorer

You can launch AI Data Explorer from either unified navigation or a data visualization or list . If you have the right role, you can create an exploration.

## Before you begin

Role required: now\_assist\_explorer\_user to create or edit explorations, any role to view explorations that have been shared with you.

## Procedure

1.  Perform one of the following actions:

    -   To launch AI Data Explorer from Unified Navigation, navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Data Explorer** &gt; **AI Data Explorer**.
    -   To launch AI Data Explorer from a data visualization or list, select the Explore with AI button \[Omitted image "analyze-ai-icon.png"\] Alt text: Explore with AI button.A data visualization can show either table data or an automated indicator. Lists show only table data.

        \[Omitted image "explore-icon-dv-tile.png"\] Alt text: Data visualization tile with Explore with AI button highlighted.

        **Note:** If the data visualization shows data from a protected scope that is not supported in Query Generation and AI Data Explorer, there is no Explore with AI icon. For more information, see [Enabling access to protected scope applications for AI Data Explorer and Query Generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/enable-aide-secure-scope-apps.md).

2.  If you launch AI Data Explorer from a data visualization or list, choose from the following options:

    \[Omitted image "explore-options-dv.png"\] Alt text: Explore options dialog from data visualization.

    -   Ask a specific question about your data.
    -   Select whether to return an extended or a standard analysis. For more information, see [Extended analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/hidden-insights.md).
    -   Choose a suggested question about the data visualization, such as **Analyze trend** or **Breakdown/distribution analysis**.
    -   Add the visualization or list to a new exploration or one that is open in another tab. For more information about adding visualizations to existing explorations, see [Add an existing visualization to an exploration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/import-data-viz-list-exploration.md).
    **Important:**

    -   A data visualization must display table or automated indicatordata. Otherwise, the Explore with AI button does not appear. \(Lists can only display table data.\)
    -   Supported table data sources include database views and Workflow Data Fabric tables.
    -   The table or database view must be included in the Query Generation semantic layer. For more information, see [Add a table to the semantic data layer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/add-table-semantic-layer.md).
    -   If the data is from an application with a protected scope, access to that scope must be configured. Otherwise, the Explore with AI icon does not appear.For more information, see [Enabling access to protected scope applications for AI Data Explorer and Query Generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/enable-aide-secure-scope-apps.md).
    The results are shown in a new exploration. If you have an exploration open in another tab, you have the option to display the results there instead.

    The exploration opens in a floating panel. You can expand the dialog to a full screen or move the exploration to a new tab.
