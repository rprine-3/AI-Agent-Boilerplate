# Create an Indicator Scorecard

The Indicator Scorecard component enables users to visualize and compare data between multiple Performance Analytics indicators. It highlights the information regarding the last score collected, the change from the previous data point, the trend over time, and the value of the target to achieve.​

## Before you begin

Role required: Anyone with access to data can create a visualization of that data on any dashboard that they can edit. Users with the itil, report\_user, admin, or viz\_creator role can create a visualization in the Visualization Designer. When you create a visualization in the Visualization Designer, it is saved to the Library. For more information on access, see [Report\_view access control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/reporting/report-view-access-control.md) and [Platform Analytics roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/platform-analytics-roles.md).

## About this task

For information about the use of an Indicator Scorecard in a dashboard, see [the Developer Site](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/xanadu/shared-components/sn-scorecard-list/usage). This site gives information about Indicator Scorecard components in the UI Builder, and some configuration options may differ from the Visualization Designer.

**Note:** You aren’t able to sort by previous scores in UI Builder.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Data Visualizations**, or open an in-line dashboard and select **Edit**.

2.  Select **Create data visualization**.

3.  Select the Indicator Scorecard \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-scorecard.png"\] Alt text: Indicator Scorecard icon\) visualization type.

4.  Configure the **Header and border**.

    |Header and border fields|Description|
    |------------------------|-----------|
    |Show header|The visualization header, including title and icons.|
    |Show header separator|Option to display a line separating the header from the rest of the component.|
    |Chart title|Title of the visualization.|
    |Use large font size|Renders the header title in a large font|
    |Title alignment|Choose Start to align the title with the start of line, End to align it with the end of the line, or Center for center alignment.|
    |Description|A short overview about the visualization that the end user sees. Descriptions help users find the visualization.|
    |Wrap title|Option to wrap long titles onto a second line. If false, displays an ellipsis to truncate long titles.|
    |Line of truncation|Specify where to truncate long labels with an ellipsis. Options are 1, 2, and 3.|
    |Show border|Option to display a line around the component.|
    |Header background color|Background color for the header. Applies only to this visualization's header. For accessibility, verify contrast between the header background and title text using the color picker's contrast ratio checker. Themes aren't supported with custom colors.|
    |Title background color|Background color for the chart title, aligned with your dashboard theme, branding, or design preferences. The selected color applies only to the title of this visualization. For accessibility, verify sufficient contrast between the header background and title text using the contrast ratio checker in the color picker. Themes are not supported when a custom color is selected.|

5.  Configure the filtering and sorting capabilities of the Indicator Scorecard.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Scorecard Type

</td><td>

List to select from scorecard types. Options include:-   **List**: Shows the list of indicators and metrics as columns.
-   **Pivot**: Shows indicators as rows and breakdown as columns or vice versa.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Show Header

</td><td>

Toggle to show or hide header.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source definition

</td><td>

Select how to set which indicators to show. Options include:-   **Condition based**: Allows you to set a condition to determine which indicators to display.
-   **Manually selected**: Allows you to manually add indicators through the **Add data source** pane.

You can select a breakdown and element to filter the indicator for each indicator you manually select.

If you select only one indicator, you can set **Show only breakdowns** to show the elements of that indicator without the indicator score.

-   **Indicator group**: Sets an indicator group as the source.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter

</td><td>

Encoded query string for filtering which indicators to show. To create a filter statically, use the condition builder that is provided.**Note:** Only available if **Source definition** is Condition based.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Indicator group

</td><td>

Filter the table based on an indicator group from the list.**Note:** Only available if **Source definition** is Indicator group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Breakdown

</td><td>

Select the breakdowns that you want to display. You can drag breakdown tiles to reorder them.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Follow breakdown relation

</td><td>

Turn on to apply [breakdown relations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/performance-analytics-glossary.md) if any are defined for the selected breakdown. This option is available only when only one indicator has been selected for the indicator scorecard.After turning this option on, select the breakdown relation from a list that opens. When you add this indicator scorecard to a dashboard, also add a filter with the breakdown source as its filter source. Set the filter to filter indicators with this breakdown. For more information, see [Navigating breakdown elements with breakdown relations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/breakdown-relations.md).

The latest version of the Data Visualizations application from the ServiceNow® Store is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max number of groups

</td><td>

The maximum number of elements to show for a breakdown. If you do not select the elements to show in **Filter elements**, the elements that are shown depend on the breakdown source and the value of **Sort direction**. For example, consider the Assignment Group breakdown, which uses the Name field from the Group \[sys\_group\] table. With the default value of 5, the **Max number of groups** field shows either the first 5 or last 5 group names alphabetically. The order depends on the sort direction. To control which elements appear, select them in the **Filter elements** field.Default: 5
