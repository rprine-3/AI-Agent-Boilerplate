# Add a drilldown event to a data visualization on a technical dashboard

Technical dashboards do not support preconfigured destinations for drilling down from a data visualization. If you want a viewer to open a more detailed view of the data when they interact with a visualization, configure a custom drilldown event.

## Before you begin

This procedure assumes that you have already created a technical dashboard and populated it with a data visualization component.

**Warning:** This procedure does not apply to Saved Visualization components.

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin, rights to edit a technical dashboard

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Platform Analytics** &gt; **Library** &gt; **Dashboards**.

2.  Locate and open the desired technical dashboard.

3.  Select **Edit in UI Builder**.

4.  In the UI Builder, select the desired data visualization in the dashboard.

5.  In the configuration panel for the data visualization, open the **Events** tab.

6.  If your only option is to add an event mapping, do so.

    \[Omitted image "add-event-mapping.png"\] Alt text: Making a data visualization component interactive.

    1.  Select **Add event mapping**.

    2.  In the list of events, select **Visualization Clicked**.

        \[Omitted image "visualization-clicked.png"\] Alt text: Selecting the Visualization Clicked event.

    3.  Select **Continue**.

7.  If the **Visualization Clicked** event is already listed on the Events tab, select **Add handler** for it.

    \[Omitted image "techdash-add-handler.png"\] Alt text: Adding a handler to the Visualization Clicked event.

8.  Search for and select the **Advanced dashboards - Redirect** event handler and **Continue**.

    \[Omitted image "db-adv-db-redirect.png"\] Alt text: Selecting the Advanced dashboards - Redirect event handler.

9.  Configure the event handler as follows.

    |Field|JSON types|Description|
    |-----|----------|-----------|
    |Context|object, with a string property named path|The path of the experience where the destination page resides.|
    |Route|none|The route name of the destination page.|
    |Route fields|object, with all parameters as strings|Required parameters for the destination page.|
    |Optional parameters| |Optional parameters for the destination page.|

    The required and optional parameters for common targets follows:

    |Target|Route fields \(required parameters\)|Optional parameters|
    |------|------------------------------------|-------------------|
    |List|\{table:@payload.params.table\}|\{query:@payload.params.query\}|
    |Record|\{table: @payload.params.table, sysId: @payload.parms.row.sys\_id.value\}|None|
    |KPI Details|\{uuid:@payload.params.indicatorSysid\}|None|

10. Select **Add**.


## Drilldown for a table data source

You have a vertical data visualization that shows the number of records on the Incident \[incident\] table grouped by Priority. When a viewer interacts with this visualization, you want it to open a list of Incident records in the Platform Analytics experience.

**Note:** This example uses the Context of the Platform Analytics experience and default Route names to components therein.

1.  You follow Steps 1-8 in the general procedure, so you now have the configuration open for the Advanced dashboards - Redirect event handler for your vertical bar visualization.
2.  In the Context field, you select **Edit**.

    \[Omitted image "db-adv-db-ex-edit-context.png"\] Alt text: The Edit control in the Context field.

3.  In the editing dialog, you select the object JSON type.

    \[Omitted image "db-adv-db-ex-json-object.png"\] Alt text: Selecting the object JSON type for the Context.

4.  You select **Add property** and enter `path` as the property name and `now/platform-analytics-workspace` as the property value. These values specify that the viewer drills down to the Platform Analytics experience.

    \[Omitted image "db-adv-db-ex-context-value-table.png"\] Alt text: Setting the value of the Context.

5.  You select **Apply** and move on to the next field.
6.  In the Route field, you enter `simplelist`. This route leads to the simplelist page in the Platform Analytics experience.
7.  For the Route fields, you first choose to bind data. \[Omitted image "bind-data.png"\] Alt text: Selecting to bind data.
8.  Then you add the property `{table: @payload.params.table}` to the field. This property passes the name of the table in your visualization to the simplelist page of the Platform Analytics experience.
    1.  You select the Event payload property `params` and then `table`.

        \[Omitted image "db-tech-adv-redirect-table-param.png"\] Alt text: Selecting the payload.params.table property in the data binding editor.

    2.  You double-click, drag and drop, or select the arrow to add the property to the upper area of the editor.
    3.  Double-click on the property in the upper area of the editor to open it for editing.

        \[Omitted image "db-adv-event-edit-prop.gif"\] Alt text: Double-clicking the property pill to open it for editing.

    4.  You surround the `@payload.params.table` property with curly brackets and add the `table:` property.

        \[Omitted image "db-tech-event-complete-parm.gif"\] Alt text: Completing the table property.

    5.  You select **Apply**.
9.  Similarly, you choose to bind data for the Optional parameters field and set the value `{query:@payload.params.concatenatedQuery}`.

The properties of your Advanced dashboards - Redirect event handler now appear as follows:

|Field|Value|
|-----|-----|
|Context|\{path:now/platform-analytics-workspace\}|
|Route|simplelist|
|Route fields|\{table:@payload.params.table\}|
|Optional parameters|\{query:@payload.params.query\}|

In runtime, a user can interact with the visualization to open a list of Incident records.

\[Omitted image "db-adv-ex-ddown-table.gif"\] Alt text: Opening a list of Incident records by clicking a Single Score visualization on a technical dashboard.

## Drilldown for an indicator data source

You have a Line data visualization for the indicator Number of open incidents. When a viewer interacts with this visualization, you want it to open the KPI Details page for that indicator.

1.  You repeat steps 1-5 from the Table data source example, because in this case too you are drilling down to a page on the Platform Analytics experience.
2.  For the Route, you enter `ac_kpi_details`.
3.  For the Route fields, you first choose to bind data \[Omitted image "bind-data.png"\] Alt text: Selecting to bind data.. Then you enter `{uuid: @payload.params.indicatorSysid}`. This parameter passes the id of the indicator, in this case Number of open incidents, to the Platform Analytics experience KPI Details page.

    **Tip:** First use autocomplete to add the data parameter `@payload.params.indicatorSysid`, then surround that parameter with curly brackets and add `uuid:`.

    The properties of your Advanced dashboards - Redirect event handler now appear as follows:

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Context|\{"path":"now/platform-analytics-workspace"\}|
    |Route|ac\_kpi\_details|
    |Route fields|\{uuid:@payload.params.indicatorSysid\}|

4.  No other parameters are necessary, so you select **Add** and then **Save** the UI Builder page.

In runtime, a viewer can interact with the visualization to open KPI Details for the Number of open incidents indicator.

\[Omitted image "db-adv-ex-ddown-indicator.gif"\] Alt text: Opening KPI Details by clicking a Line visualization on a technical dashboard.
