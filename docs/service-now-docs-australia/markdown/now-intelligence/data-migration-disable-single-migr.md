# Disable migration of single dashboards

Hide the banner on individual dashboards that enables owners to migrate dashboards that they own.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin.

## About this task

Add a system property to prevent users from migrating their own dashboards.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **sys\_properties.list**.

2.  Add the system property **com.glide.par.coreui\_single\_migration.enabled** if it does not already exist.

    For more information, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

3.  Set **com.glide.par.coreui\_single\_migration.enabled** to `false`.
