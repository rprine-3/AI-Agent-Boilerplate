# Usage Insights data sources for data visualizations

You can show metrics related to Usage Insights in a data visualization component. The available metrics depend on the visualization type.

**Note:** Users require the admin, analytics\_admin, or analytics\_viewer role to add Usage Insights data sources to a visualization.

The Usage Insights application, available in the [ServiceNow® Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home), provides several data sources.

-   **Events**

    This data source tracks the events that are triggered on the application. When you select Events as the data source on a visualization, you also must select the application and the event. Apart from this, you can also select the event conditions and specify the event property. For example, you can filter the events based on Country, Manager, Department, Role, etc. In a Bar or Pie/Donut visualization, use the **Group by** field to select an event property. You can then view the number of occurrences and the values distribution of that single event property.

    **Note:** The default maximum number of custom filters you can save for the Usage Insights application is 500. You can modify the number of custom filters in theuxa.query\_builder.max\_num\_of\_user\_filter property.

-   **Pages**

    This data source tracks page views or usage metrics for a specific page on the application. When you select Pages as the data source on a visualization, you must also select the application and the page. Apart from this, you can add custom conditions to filter data for more accurate analysis.

    -   Page Views
    -   Average View Duration
    -   Average Load Time
-   **Sessions**

    This data source tracks the number of sessions triggered on an application.

    When you select this data source on a visualization, you also must select the application and the category. For Single Score visualizations only, you can select a condition as the category. You can add or edit conditions in the condition builder.

    -   All Sessions: Represents the number of all sessions created on the application.
    -   New Sessions: Represents the number of sessions that were created in the most recent time period.
    -   Returning Users: Users who have created more than one session.
    -   Short sessions: Number of sessions shorter than 20 seconds.
    -   Long sessions: Number of sessions longer than 300 seconds.
    -   Custom: You define this category by creating at least one condition.
-   **Users**

    The number of active unique users using the application. When you select this data source on a visualization, you must also select the application and the category of user. For Single Score visualizations only, you can select a condition as the category. You can add or edit conditions in the condition builder.

    -   All Users: Represents the number of all users in the application.
    -   New Users: Represents the number of users who have performed their first session.
    -   Never Returned Users: Users who have created only one session.
    -   Multi Device Users: Users who have created a session with more than one device.
    -   Custom: You define this category by creating at least one condition.

**Important:** You must specify the date range for all Usage Insights data sources on all visualization types.

The following data visualizations do not support Usage Insights data sources:

-   Calendar
-   Geomap
-   Heatmap
-   Pivot table
-   Simple List
-   Indicator Scorecard

Time series and score data visualizations support all Usage Insights data sources.

</table>-   **Funnels**

    Funnels are a visual element that tell a story. Funnels can show conversion rates and trends in aggregate user behavior to uncover the reasons behind success or failure of a specific in-application user goal. Investigating a conversion funnel can help you measure and optimize the conversion rates of relevant processes within your application.

    You can view your funnel directly from Platform Analytics. When you create a new dashboard in Platform Analytics, select **add new element** and then **Usage Insights Funnel**.
