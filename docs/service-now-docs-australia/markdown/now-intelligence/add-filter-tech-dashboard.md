# Create a filter on a technical dashboard in UI Builder

To filter data visualizations and simple lists in a technical dashboard, add a filter component in UI Builder and configure event handlers.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin, admin

## Procedure

1.  Locate the dashboard in the dashboard library and open it for editing, as described in [Edit Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/edit-db-in-ac.md).

    If the dashboard is a technical dashboard, you see an **Edit in UI Builder** button. If it is in the inline editor, you see an **Edit** button. In the latter case, go to [Create or add a filter on an inline dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/select-workspace-filter-type.md).

2.  If you are in a different application scope than the dashboard, use the application picker to select the correct scope.

3.  Select **Edit in UI Builder**.

4.  Add layout elements and a filter component as described in [Add and configure components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/add-components.md).

5.  Configure the filter as described in the [Filter component reference](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/yokohama/now-components/sn-component-filter/overview) on the Developer Site.

    This reference includes a description of each configuration field and general usage information that applies to UI Builder pages in general.

    **Important:** Be certain to configure the event handlers and page scripts to link the filter to the relevant data visualizations or lists.
