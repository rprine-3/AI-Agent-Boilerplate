# Generate insights for Enterprise Architecture Workspace dashboard widgets

You can use the conversational interface provided by AI Data Explorer ServiceNow Otto skill to query and analyze data from Enterprise Architecture Workspace dashboards. Instead of manually reviewing dashboard visualizations, you can use the AI Data Explorer to ask natural language questions to retrieve insights and identify trends.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

AI Data Explorer, Query Generation ServiceNow Otto skills must be activated. Also, AI Search must be configured. For information, see [Configure AI Data Explorer and Query Generation skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/configure-ai-data-explr-qry-genr-skills.md).

Role required:

-   sn\_apm.apm\_user and sn\_apm.apm\_read \(to access EA workspace\)
-   now\_assist\_explorer\_user \(to use the AI Data Explorer feature\)

## About this task

You can ask questions about application portfolios, technology trends, business units, lifecycle stages, and other metrics displayed on the dashboard. You can use the AI Data Explorer to perform the following:

-   Ask specific queries on metrics and dimensions displayed on the widgets
-   Perform relationship analysis
-   Ask follow-up questions to explore deeper into the insights
-   Generate dashboards and graphs

You can ask AI Data Explorer the following types of queries.

-   Trend analysis queries
    -   How have application counts changed over time?
    -   What is the distribution of business applications by lifecycle stage?
    -   How do application scores vary across business units?
-   Comparative queries
    -   Compare application counts across different technology types
    -   Which business unit has the highest number of applications?
    -   What is the difference between Windows and UNIX application counts?
-   Specific metric queries
    -   Which application family is most used?
    -   What percentage of applications are in the retired lifecycle stage?
    -   Show me business applications by user base

The AI Data Explorer also considers the filters applied on the dashboard page while generating insights.

You can use the AI Data Explorer on widgets that are based on the following tables:

-   CI Scores \(apm\_app\_score\)
-   Business Applications \(cmdb\_ci\_business\_app\)
-   Information Objects \(cmdb\_ci\_information\_object\)
-   Indicator Scores \(apm\_app\_indicator\_score\)
-   Total Cost of Ownership \(sn\_apm\_tco\)
-   Capabilities \(cmdb\_ci\_business\_capability\)
-   Digital Interfaces\(sn\_apm\_di\_digital\_interface\)

**Note:**

-   The AI Data Explorer generates insights based on data from one widget at a time. It can't generate insights by combining or correlating data from multiple widgets simultaneously.
-   The insights are displayed based on current data only and does not support time-series comparisons, such as comparing today's metric values against values from a previous period.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture Workspace** &gt; **Dashboard**.

2.  Select the Explore with AI icon \(\[Omitted image "explore-ai.png"\] Alt text: Explore with AI icon.\) on any widget on the dashboard.
