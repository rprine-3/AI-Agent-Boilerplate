Description

Subscriber Business Application

</td><td>

Name of the business application that uses the provided interface to consume, exchange, or ingest data to support a business capability. The subscriber business application is affected by the changes or an outage, causing connection or data loss.**Note:** The provider and subscriber roles define interface ownership, not data flow direction. The provider owns the digital interface; the subscriber consumes it. Data flow direction—whether incoming, outgoing, or bidirectional—is set separately using the **Data Flow Direction** field and reflects which application initiates the connection. For example, the provider can receive data \(incoming\) if the subscriber initiates the connection. For more information, see [Example: Provider and subscriber with data flow directions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/example-prov-n-subsc-roles-with-data-flow.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Subscriber Digital Interface

Provider Business Application

</td><td>

Name of the business application that provides the digital interface that enables other applications to consume or ingest data.

The provider owns the digital interface; the subscriber consumes it. Data flow direction—whether incoming, outgoing, or bidirectional—is set separately using the **Data Flow Direction** field and reflects which application initiates the connection. For example, the provider can receive data \(incoming\) if the subscriber initiates the connection. For more information, see [Example: Provider and subscriber with data flow directions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/example-prov-n-subsc-roles-with-data-flow.md).
