# Register a digital integration conversationally

Use the conversational experience of ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent to register a digital integration from any application that supports Virtual Agent.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

Ensure that the following tasks are completed:

Role required: none

## About this task

In the application that supports Virtual Agent, for example Employee Service Center, start with a prompt to register a business application in the chat. Through a series of questions, Virtual Agent prompts you to provide information for the questions that you configured for a catalog item. ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent understands the context and maps the information that you provide to an appropriate catalog item. In this case, the catalog item is a business application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Employee Center**.

2.  Select **Open chat window**.

3.  Enter an instruction to start the conversation with Virtual Agent.

    You can start with a basic instruction such as **Request a digital integration** or an elaborate instruction that includes the digital integration information. The following examples show how each instruction is handled in the chat.

Virtual Agent starts a conversation to ask more information from you about the business application, through a series of questions:

 -   What is the name of the business application for which you want to subscribe?
-   What is the business application you're requesting for?
-   Is this a new provider digital interface?
-   \[Required\] What is the name of the Provider Digital Interface?
-   Who is the IT Owner for this request?
-   What type of business do you own?
-   What type of subscriber are you?
-   Can you please describe the digital integration you would like to enter?
 The information you provide is used to fill in the fields of the digital integration form. \[Omitted image "register-digital-integration.png"\] Alt text: Screenshot showing ServiceNow OttoVirtual Agent chat window showing a request for the requesting a digital integration.
