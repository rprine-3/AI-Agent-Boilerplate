# Shape connector properties in Enterprise Modeling and Visualization

When you select a connector between two shapes in an enterprise modeling diagram, a toolbar appears above the connector. Use the toolbar to define the relationship type or visual style of the connector.

The toolbar has two forms depending on the notation of the connected shapes. You can also add a label to a connector to clarify the relationship between shapes, annotate the data flow direction, or provide contextual information.

## ArchiMate connectors

When both connected shapes are ArchiMate shapes, the toolbar shows the following controls:

|Control|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|**Relationship type**|Sets the ArchiMate relationship type from a predefined list.|
|**Swap direction**|Reverses the connector orientation, switching the left and right sides.|
|**T+**|Adds a text label to the connector.|

\[Omitted image "connector-line-archimate.png"\] Alt text: ArchiMate connector toolbar showing the relationship type list, Flip control, and T+ button on top of the connector line linking two shapes.

The **Relationship type** drop-down provides the standard ArchiMate 3.2 relationship types, including Access, Aggregation, Assignment, Association, Composition, Flow, Influence, Realization, Serving, Specialization, Triggering, and Used by.

The **Access** relationship type is available in three variants: single-direction, bidirectional, and unspecified \(dotted\). The Association relationship type is available in two variants: directed and undirected.

## Non-ArchiMate and mixed connectors

The toolbar shows the following controls when at least one connected shape is a non-ArchiMate shape \(for example, a CSDM or AWS shape\). The toolbar also shows these controls when connecting shapes from two different notations.

\[Omitted image "connector-line-non-archimate.png"\] Alt text: Non-ArchiMate connector toolbar showing line style, start arrow, Flip, end arrow, icon, and T+ controls above a connector linking two shapes.

|Number|Control|Description|
|------|-------|-----------|
|1|**Line style**|Sets the connector line to solid, dashed, or dotted.|
|2|**Start arrow**|Sets the arrowhead style at the starting end of the connector.|
|3|**Swap direction**|Reverses the connector orientation, switching the left and right sides.|
|4|**End arrow**|Sets the arrowhead style at the ending end of the connector.|
|5|**Icon**|Adds a BPMN message flow decorator icon to the connector.|
|6|**T+**|Adds a text label to the connector.|
