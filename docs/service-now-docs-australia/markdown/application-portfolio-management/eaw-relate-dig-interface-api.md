# Connect a digital interface with the CMDB API in the EA Workspace

Create a relationship between a digital interface and a CMDB API. The relationship shows which digital integration uses which API and which APIs are built from the digital interface design specs. You can also see what environments are deployed and group the deployed APIs.

## Before you begin

Activate the CMDB CI Class Models \[app-cmdb-content\] store app \(version 1.49.0 or later\). For instructions, see [CMDB CI Class Models app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).

## About this task

One digital interface can be connected to one or more APIs. One API can be connected to only one digital interface.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture Workspace**.

2.  In the left navigation, open the Portfolio List view by selecting the Portfolio icon \(\[Omitted image "portfolio-icon.png"\] Alt text: Portfolio icon\).

3.  Select the expand row icon \(\[Omitted image "ExpandIcon.png"\] Alt text: Expand Row icon\) next to **Application Portfolio**.

4.  Select **Digital Interfaces**.

5.  Select an existing digital interface.

6.  Select the **APIs** tab.

7.  Select **New**.

8.  On the Digital Interface to API form, fill in the fields.

    For field descriptions, see [Digital interface to API form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-dig-interface-api-form.md). Information for the fields Environment, Lifecycle Stage, and Lifecycle Stage Status are derived from the API. \[Omitted image "eaw-dig-interface-to-api.png"\] Alt text: Connect digital interface to API

9.  Select **Save**.
