# Viewing insights of your portfolio

You can view the insights for your business portfolio, information portfolio, application portfolio, and technology portfolio.

You can see the details such as the following:

-   Desired and scripted audits
-   Hardware models
-   Software products that are facing high and moderate technology risks
-   Pending certification instances that are open and not 100% complete

The last refreshed time shows when the results were refreshed in your browser. You can manually refresh the results by using the refresh icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-refresh.png"\] Alt text: Refresh icon\). You can navigate to the full list in the Application Rationalization by selecting the **View list** button. You can see the details of a record by selecting it.
