# Exploring Enterprise Modeling and Visualization in the EA Workspace

Enterprise Modeling and Visualization in EA Workspace helps you with diagramming and modeling capabilities and enable you to model the future state of your IT and its relationship to the business landscape.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Enterprise Modeling and Visualization overview

You can use the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization \[com.snc.apm\_modelling\_tool\] functionality in EA Workspace to create diagrams for your applications hierarchy and associate them with architectural artifacts. These diagrams enable decision makers to make informed decisions.

Creating diagrams helps you in the following:

-   Visual representation: Diagrams and models represent complex enterprise structures, processes, and relationships for stakeholders including executives and IT teams.
-   Effective communication: Diagrams provide a shared visual language for technical and non-technical stakeholders, supporting collaboration across teams and departments.
-   Improved decision making: Decision makers can assess the impact of proposed changes, evaluate scenarios, and identify potential risks before implementing strategies or projects.
-   Alignment with business goals: Diagrams and models help align IT initiatives with overall business goals, providing a view of the business and verifying that IT investments are strategically aligned with business goals.
-   Change management: Modeling capabilities illustrate how changes affect the enterprise, supporting planning and execution of transformations with minimal disruption.
-   Regulatory and governance: Modeling provides a structured framework for managing architectural artifacts and documenting adherence to architectural guidelines.
-   Efficiency and cost reduction: Identifying redundancies, optimizing processes, and streamlining operations can help reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.

## Install the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization application

You can install the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization \[com.snc.apm\_modelling\_tool\] from the ServiceNow Store.

## Working with diagrams

-   **Shapes**: Use different shapes to create a diagram. Available shapes are:

    -   General shapes
    -   AWS shapes
    -   CSDM shapes
    -   EA Extended shapes
    -   ArchiMate® shapes \(ArchiMate is a registered trademark of The Open Group\)
    -   BPMN shapes
    \[Omitted image "modeling-shapes-library.png"\] Alt text: Shapes libray

    Use the Toggle Shape Library icon to show or hide the shapes panel on the canvas.

    Use the Switch to List or Grid view icon to switch between list view and grid view of the shapes for all the shape libraries.

    You can add a shape to the canvas by either selecting the shape or by dragging the shape from the **Shapes** palette to the canvas.

    You can also adjust the size of shapes by selecting a shape and then drag any of its edges or corner handles. Dragging outward increases the shape dimensions; dragging inward reduces its size.

    When you hover over a shape icon in the **Shapes** panel, a preview popover appears to the right of the panel. The popover shows a larger view of the shape and its label. Moving to a different shape icon, using either the mouse or the arrow keys, updates the popover to the new shape. The popover closes when you move the mouse away from the icon, press Tab on the keyboard, start dragging a shape, or scroll the panel.

-   **Label connector lines**: Select a connector line between shapes in a diagram and select **T+** in the connector toolbar to add a label. For more information, see [Add labels to connector lines between shapes in a diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-modeling-add-labels-to-connector-lines.md).

    You can perform the following actions for the labels:

    -   Add multiple labels on a single relationship line
    -   Drag and move labels
    -   Delete individual labels without deleting the relationship
    -   Use undo or redo action for a label
    **Note:** In read-only mode or after the diagram is submitted for approval, label actions are unavailable.

-   **Connector line properties**: Select a connector between two shapes to display a toolbar on top of the connector. The toolbar has two forms depending on the notation of the connected shapes:

    -   If both connected shapes are ArchiMate shapes, the toolbar shows the following controls:

        -   **Relationship type**: Sets the ArchiMate relationship type from a predefined list, including Access, Aggregation, Assignment, Association, Composition, Flow, Influence, Realization, Serving, Specialization, Triggering, and Used by.
        -   **Swap direction**: Reverses the connector orientation, switching the left and right sides.
        -   **T+**: Adds a text label to the connector.
        \[Omitted image "connector-line-archimate.png"\] Alt text: ArchiMate connector toolbar showing the relationship type list, Flip control, and T+ button on top of the connector line linking two shapes.

    -   If at least one connected shape is a non-ArchiMate shape \(for example, a CSDM or AWS shape\), or when connecting shapes from two different notations, the toolbar shows the following controls:

        -   **Line style**: Sets the connector line to solid, dashed, or dotted.
        -   **Start arrow**: Sets the arrowhead style at the starting end of the connector.
        -   **Swap direction**: Reverses the connector orientation, switching the left and right sides.
        -   **End arrow**: Sets the arrowhead style at the ending end of the connector.
        -   **Icon**: Adds a BPMN message flow decorator icon to the connector.
        -   **T+**: Adds a text label to the connector.

## Keyboard navigation on the diagram page

Enterprise Modeling and Visualization supports keyboard navigation across the diagram canvas, panels, shapes, and dialogs.

You can use the keyboard to move between shapes, groups, pools, swimlanes, and nested elements on the canvas. Focus indicators clearly show the currently selected item. You can access shape and relationship context menus using the keyboard. Use these menus to open the side panel, view related records, add or edit relationship text, and delete or add relations.

The following table lists the keyboard shortcuts available for navigating:

|Key|Action|
|---|------|
|Tab or Shift + Tab|Move focus forward or backward between canvas elements, panels, and controls.|
|Arrow keys \(↑ ↓ ← →\)|Navigate between shapes, nested elements, libraries, lists, pools, and swimlanes.|
|Enter|Select the focused shape, relationship, or control.|
|Shift + Enter|Move focus to shape or relationship adornments.|
