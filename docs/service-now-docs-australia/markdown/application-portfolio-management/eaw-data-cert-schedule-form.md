Run policy scheduled job as

</td><td>

User account that the scheduled job impersonates when it runs the certification policy. The list displays only users who have been granted the **Run as** privilege for scheduled jobs. If the list is empty, ask your system administrator to assign the required privilege to the appropriate user accounts. **Note:**

-   The base system provides an out-of-box service account named DataManager Job Runner for this purpose. Using a dedicated service account rather than a personal user account helps ensure that certification tasks run consistently even if individual user accounts are deactivated. For more information, see [Components related to CMDB Data Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/components-cmdb-data-manager.md).
-   To run certification policies on tables that are not rooted in the CMDB, the service account in this field must have the **sn\_apm.apm\_analyst** role. Without this role, the scheduled job does not create certification tasks for non-CMDB tables. If you are using the out-of-box DataManager Job Runner account, ask your system administrator to assign the **sn\_apm.apm\_analyst** role to that account.
