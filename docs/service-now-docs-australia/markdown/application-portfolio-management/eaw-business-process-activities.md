# Exploring business process activities

Business process activities represent discrete units of work within workflows. Knowing how they differ from business processes helps you model organizational tasks accurately.

A business process activity represents a specific task, step, or action performed within your organization, such as a manual task, an approval step, or a system-triggered action.

## Business processes vs. business process activities

Business processes and business process activities serve different purposes:

-   Business process — Models the overall workflow your organization uses to achieve a business outcome. Business processes are organized into a hierarchy of levels \(L0, L1, L2, and deeper\) using CI relationships. Each level represents a broader or narrower scope of the same workflow.
-   Business process activity — A standalone record that represents a discrete unit of work, classified by an activity type \(for example, **Manual Task**\). Unlike business process levels, a business process activity is not part of the L0-L2 hierarchy — instead, it is associated with the business actors who perform it.

You can:

-   Create and edit business process activities
-   Classify activities by type
-   Assign owners and managing groups
-   Link activities to business actors who perform them

When you model a business process activity in a diagram, the default relationship between a business process activity and a business actor is Performed by :: Performs.
