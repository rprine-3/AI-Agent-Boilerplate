# Configure ServiceNow Otto for Enterprise Architecture \(EA\)

If you have the admin role, you can configure the ServiceNow Otto for Enterprise Architecture \(EA\) to enable generative AI skills in Enterprise Architecture Workspace \(EA\).

## Before you begin

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use the AI Admin Hub to configure ServiceNow Otto for EA. While all ServiceNow Otto for EA skills are activated by default, you can use this console to activate the plugins in case it’s turned off or configure the generative AI skills. For additional information, see [Overview tab in AI Admin Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configuring-now-assist.md).

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).

The following table lists the features and skills that you can access from the AI Admin Hub.

|EA feature|Skill|
|----------|-----|
|Architectural decision record \(ADR\)|Architectural decision record doc summarization and actions \(Enterprise Architecture Workspace\)|
|Business application|Business application insights \(Enterprise Architecture Workspace\)|
|Enterprise architecture diagrams|Diagram change analysis \(Enterprise Architecture Workspace\)|
|Form fields associated with business applications, business capabilities, business processes, value stream stages, and information objects|Refine text \(Enterprise Architecture Workspace\)|
|Business process map diagrams|Create diagram from image \(Enterprise Architecture Workspace\)|

**Note:** The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection.
