# Edit a published TRM catalog configuration

Edit a published TRM catalog configuration to update catalog name, article publishing rules for software and hardware records, or manage portal and knowledge base mappings.

## Before you begin

When you update and save changes to a published catalog configuration, the catalog status changes from Published to Draft. You must republish the catalog to apply updates to the knowledge base.

2.  Open the Setup page by selecting the Setup icon \[Omitted image "setup-icon.png"\] Alt text: Setup icon.

3.  Select the expand row icon \(\[Omitted image "ExpandIcon.png"\] Alt text: Expand Row icon\) next to **Publishing Center**.

4.  Select **All**.

5.  Select an existing catalog to modify its configuration.

    You can modify the following details:

    -   Update catalog details- In the **Details** tab, modify the catalog name.
    -   Update article publishing rules- In the **Article configurations** tab, select a software or hardware record to open its configuration and update details and its content configuration.
        -   **Details** tab- Define the content structure using AND/OR operators, modify display fields, and select or clear the **Active** check box to make the record active or inactive.
        -   **Content configurations**- Select a related configuration \(for example, Product lifecycles\). Define the content structure using AND/OR operators and modify display fields. Select or clear the **Active** check box to make the record active or inactive.
    -   Manage portal–knowledge base mappings- In the **Portals** tab, create or update a portal mapping for your published catalog, set the order for the knowledge base, and select or clear the **Active** check box to make the record active or inactive.
6.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The publishing configuration is updated based on your changes.
