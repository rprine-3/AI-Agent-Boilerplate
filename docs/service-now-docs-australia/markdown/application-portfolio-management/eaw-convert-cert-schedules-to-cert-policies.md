# Import certification schedules in to Data Manager

Import the certification schedules into Data Manager to convert the existing certification schedules to certification policies.

## Before you begin

Role required: system admin

## About this task

This process converts the certification schedules into draft certification policies and you can then publish these policies to activate them.

**Note:** If you upgraded your EA Workspace from a previous version to the 4.0.0 version, you might see that your certification data is still fetched from the Certification Schedules \(cert\_schedule\) table. Follow these instructions to import your data certification schedules to certification policies.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace**.

2.  Select **Management** in the CMDB Workspace menu bar.

3.  Select the Data Manager link in Management tools, in the Manage section.

    **Note:** If all the certification schedules are already imported, the Import banner doesn’t appear. You can see the imported policies in the Draft policies tab \(refer to step 6\).

5.  In the Confirm import of certification schedule into draft policies, select **Import into draft policies**.
