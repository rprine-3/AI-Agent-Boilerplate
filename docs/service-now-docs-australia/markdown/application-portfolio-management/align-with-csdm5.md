# CSDM shapes support in the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization

ServiceNow CSDM data model defines standardized relationships between service-related objects in the CMDB. It ensures consistency across ITSM, ITOM, and EA practices. In Enterprise Architecture Workspace, CSDM shapes represent these objects visually in diagrams, enabling architects to model business capabilities, applications, services, and technical components in alignment with the Now Platform.

## CSDM domains and shapes

CSDM 5 introduces seven domains, each grouping related entities. Shapes in Enterprise Architecture Workspace diagrams correspond to these domains:

-   Foundation- Shapes in this domain represent core referential data like Company, Location, Groups, Products, and Contracts.
-   Ideation &amp; Strategy- Shapes in this domain capture early-stage planning and strategic objectives.
-   Design &amp; Planning- Shapes in this domain define an architecture blueprint and logical application portfolio.
-   Build &amp; Integration- Shapes in this domain represent development artifacts and integration points.
-   Service Delivery- Shapes in this domain represent an operational view of technology services and offerings.
-   Service Consumption- Shapes in this domain represent services consumed by end users.
