# Exploring value stream stages

Value stream stages are a specific section within the overall value stream, encompassing a specific set of activities.

A value stream is made up of multiple value stream stages. The stages are organized in a sequence, ensuring that each stage add value to the overall value stream.

The following relationships define the value stream stage model in Enterprise Architecture:

-   Value stream to value stream stages: A value stream contains one or more value stream stages. Each stage represents a step in the end-to-end value delivery sequence and is assigned a numeric order that determines its position within the value stream.
-   Value stream stage to business processes \(many-to-many\): A value stream stage can be associated with one or more business processes. A business process can also be associated with multiple value stream stages across different value streams. This association helps you understand which workflows support each step of value delivery.
-   Value stream stage to business capabilities \(many-to-many\): A value stream stage can be associated with one or more business capabilities. A business capability can also support multiple value stream stages. This association helps you understand which organizational capabilities are required to deliver each stage.

In the Hire to Retire value stream, onboarding of new employees is a value stream stage.
