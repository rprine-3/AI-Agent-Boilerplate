# Scheduled jobs for TLM in the EA Workspace

Several types of scheduled jobs are added for Technology Lifecycle Management.

**Important:**

Technology Lifecycle Management \(TLM\) was previously known as Technology Portfolio Management \(TPM\). TPM and TLM refer to the same feature. Table names and scheduled job names continue to use TPM and haven't been renamed.

Whether your instance displays TPM or TLM also depends on your application versions. TLM labels appear only when both the Enterprise Architecture Workspace application \(version 9.2.1 or later\) and the Technology Lifecycle Management plugin, sn\_apm\_tpm \(version 1.11.0 or later\), are installed. If either application is on an earlier version, the interface continues to show TPM.

The following is the list of scheduled jobs for Technology Lifecycle Management \(TLM\) in EA Workspace:

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Populate TPM Technology Lifecycle Risks

</td><td>

Populates the TPM technology life-cycle risks data in the TPM Technology Life-cycle Risks \[sn\_apm\_tpm\_technology\_risk\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Populate TPM Discovered Technologies and Lifecycles

</td><td>

Populates the technology life-cycle data in the TPM Technology Lifecycle \[sn\_apm\_tpm\_technology\_lifecycle\] table. The data includes end of support date, end of extended support date, and end of life date for your software products and hardware models.**Note:** The data for software products is displayed only when the Software Asset Management \(SAM\) Foundation or Software Asset Management \(SAM\) Professional plugin.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Populate TRM technical debts in the EA Workspace

</td><td>

Updates the Technical Debt \[sn\_apm\_trm\_standards\_technical\_debt\] table with the latest technical debt data for your software products that is available in the TPM Discovered Technology \[sn\_apm\_tpm\_discovered\_technology\] table. Existing records persist across runs and move between Active, Resolved, and Archived states instead of being deleted and re-created.**Note:** The Populate TRM technical debts in the EA Workspace scheduled job will be available only the Software Asset Management \(SAM\) Foundation or Software Asset Management \(SAM\) Professional plugin is installed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Delete Archived Tech Debts

</td><td>

Runs automatically on the first day of every month and deletes Archived technical debt records whose **Updated** value is older than the retention period set in the system property **sn\_apm\_tpm.monthsToDeleteArchivedTechDebt**. The default retention period is 12 months. You don't need to run this job manually, though you can if you want to apply a retention period change immediately.
