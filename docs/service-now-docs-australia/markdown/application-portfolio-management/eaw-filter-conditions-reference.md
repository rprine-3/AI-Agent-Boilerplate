# Filter conditions

Filter and sort options define which records appear in a custom list and the order in which they are displayed.

## Condition elements

You can create custom lists from the **My Lists** page to quickly access a filtered and sorted set of portfolio records.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Field|The record field to filter on, such as Business Unit, Company, or Application type.|
|Operator|Defines how the selected field is evaluated against the value.|
|Value|The value that the selected field is compared against.|

## Logical operators

You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators to create more precise filters.

|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|AND|Includes records that meet all specified conditions.|
|OR|Includes records that meet any of the specified conditions.|

## Filter operators

The following operators are available when defining filter conditions.

|Operator|Behavior|
|--------|--------|
|is|Includes records that exactly match the specified value.|
|is not|Excludes records that match the specified value.|
|is not anything|Includes records where the selected field has no value.|

## Sort by options

Sorting controls the order in which records are displayed in a custom list. You can sort records by one or more fields.

**Sort order behavior**

When multiple sort fields are defined, records are sorted using the fields in the order they appear in the **Sort by** section.

|Order|Behavior|
|-----|--------|
|Ascending|Displays records from lowest to highest value, such as A to Z.|
|Descending|Displays records from highest to lowest value, such as Z to A.|
