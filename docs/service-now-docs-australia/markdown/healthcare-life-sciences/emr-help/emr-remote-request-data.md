# Remote request data table

The Remote Request Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_request\_data\] table stores the captured parameter data associated with a task record.

The Remote Request Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_request\_data\] table has the following features:

-   Stores additional data from an EMR system.
-   Extensible and used for creating data tables based on a task type.

Role required to configure the table: sn\_ind\_rmt\_help.admin.

**Note:** Storing data from the EMR system in the Remote Request Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_request\_data\] table or its extended child data table provides a layer of security. As an administrator, you can extend the Remote Request Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_request\_data\] table for a particular task type to store additional information from an EMR system. For example, the EMR Help application provides the EMR Request Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_incident\_data\] table that extends the Remote Request Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_request\_data\] table and associates incidents with service requests.
