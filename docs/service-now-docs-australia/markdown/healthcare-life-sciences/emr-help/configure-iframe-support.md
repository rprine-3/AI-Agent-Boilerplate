# Configure iFrame support for EMR Help in ServiceNow

Configure EMR Help to launch within a frame in Epic Hyperspace and Hyperdrive.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

For any ServiceNow page or portal to be launched within an iframe, an HTTP Response Header must be configured with the correct content security policy. This content security policy dictates which third party websites can load a ServiceNow page or portal inside an iframe.

## Procedure

1.  Set your scope to **Global** and elevate your role to **security\_admin**.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **HTTP Response Headers** \(or type in sys\_response\_header.list\).

3.  Select the **Global** response header.

4.  Add the domain name for your Epic hyperspace instance to the list of values.

    For example, \*.yourdomain.com

5.  Confirm that **Active** is set to true.

6.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

\[Omitted image "configureiframe.png"\] Alt text: Proper domain indication on iFrame configuration for Epic.
