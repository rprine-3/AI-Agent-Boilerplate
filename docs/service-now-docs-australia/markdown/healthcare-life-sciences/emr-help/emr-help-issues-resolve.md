# Viewing and resolving ServiceNow IT service requests submitted from EMR systems

Work on task records that are automatically created when clinicians submit ServiceNow IT service requests from an EMR system.

Ensure that an administrator has added the EMR Incident Data related list to the Incident form. For more information, see [Configuring the form layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configure-form-layout.md).

Incidents are the task type configured by default with the EMR Help application.

You can use the EMR Help module or the Incident module to access incidents submitted from an EMR system.

-   To use the incident module, see [View and resolve an EMR incident from the Incident module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/emr-help/emr-help-issues-resolve.md).
-   To use the EMR Help module, see [View and resolve an EMR incident from the EMR Help module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/emr-help/emr-help-issues-resolve.md).
