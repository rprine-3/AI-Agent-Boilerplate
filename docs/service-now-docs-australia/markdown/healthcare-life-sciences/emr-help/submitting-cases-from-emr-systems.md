# Creating healthcare cases from within your EMR

Use the EMR Help service portal to create healthcare cases from directly within you EMR system.

As a user with the sn\_ind\_rmt\_help.requester role, you can submit healthcare cases from within your EMR system. These cases can then be fulfilled within a ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** The healthcare case request capability can only be fulfilled for custom healthcare case types. In order to fulfill healthcare cases, you must first create your own custom healthcare case type. For more information on this, see [Configure healthcare case types for EMR Help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/emr-help/configure-hcls-case-types-for-emr-help.md).

## Creating a healthcare case

To create a case from within your EMR, select Healthcare Case from the Requests option menu in the upper right. The Healthcare Case form will then appear.
