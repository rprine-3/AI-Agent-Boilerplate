# Encryption options in EMR Help

EMR Help provides encryption support to secure sensitive information.

By default, the EMR Help application encrypts the following fields \(columns\) by using the **sn\_ind\_rmt\_help.emr\_data** encryption module, a Key Management Framework \(KMF\) crypto module that uses the AES-256 algorithm:

-   The **Additional Info** field in the Remote Request Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_request\_data\] table.
-   The **Phone number** and **Email address** fields in the EMR Incident Data \[sn\_ind\_rmt\_help\_incident\_data\] table.

The **emr\_data\_viewer** module access policy grants the sn\_ind\_rmt\_help.viewer role permission to decrypt and view these encrypted fields. Users without the sn\_ind\_rmt\_help.viewer role see the encrypted values.

Field Encryption capabilities are required. For more information, see [Activate Field Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/activate-platform-encryption.md).
