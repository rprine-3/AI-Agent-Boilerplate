# Configuring the Patient Support Services email notifications

Configure the email notifications sent to patients about Patient Support Services programs.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

Patient Support Services includes the following email notifications.
