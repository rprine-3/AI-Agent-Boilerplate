# Configuring playbooks for Pre-Visit Management

Configure a playbook to provide step-by-step guidance for resolving procedure request cases.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

As a user with the admin role, you can create a playbook by using Playbooks, a ServiceNow AI Platform® feature. For more information, see [Process Automation Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md).

The playbooks in the Pre-Visit Management application use the CRM Workspace playbook experience. By default, the Pre-Visit Management application includes a playbook for assisting patient service representatives to resolve procedure request cases.

Configure a playbook by navigating to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Process Automation Designer**. You can either select an existing process definition or create a new process definition for the playbook associated with procedure request cases.

**Note:** When configuring a process definition for the playbook associated with procedure request cases, ensure that the application scope is set to Pre-Visit Management or Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core by using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).
