# Components installed with Pre-Visit Management

Several types of components are installed with installation of the Pre-Visit Management application, including tables, user roles, ServiceNow Store applications, scheduled jobs, and business rules.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

Demo data is available for this feature.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
