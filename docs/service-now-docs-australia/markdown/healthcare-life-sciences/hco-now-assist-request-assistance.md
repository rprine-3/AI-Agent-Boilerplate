# Request care team assistance agentic workflow

Initiate a structured case intake process. Collect all necessary information to create and log a support case for proper tracking and resolution by using the **Request care team assistance** agentic workflow in ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hco.care\_team\_member or sn\_hco.care\_team\_manager

## About this task

When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

This agentic workflow creates support requests of varying case types that are then sent to support departments for fulfillment.

The following Care Team Operations plugins contain the case types for this agentic workflow:

-   Care Team Operations for Biomed
-   Care Team Operations for Environmental Services
-   Care Team Operations for Facilities
-   Care Team Operations for Healthcare IT

## Procedure

1.  In Care Team Portal or Care Team Mobile, select the chat widget button to open **ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent**.

2.  Select **Request care team assistance**.

3.  Describe one or more support requests in detail.

4.  Respond to any questions asked by the Care team operations case intake AI agent to provide more context as needed.

5.  Reply to the AI agent.

    -   If the AI agent displays correct information for all support cases, reply **Yes**.
    -   If information displayed isn’t correct, respond **No** and provide additional information until the correct request information is captured.

## Result

After confirming all request details are correct, the Care team operations case creation AI agent creates one or more cases for supporting service departments as needed. Case information will display in card form and you can select the case number to navigate directly to the case within Care Team Portal.

Cases created are fulfilled by users with the Support Agent role in the Healthcare Operations Workspace.

**Note:** Upon conclusion of conversation, Virtual Agent creates an interaction record, which can be viewed within your instance at any time.
