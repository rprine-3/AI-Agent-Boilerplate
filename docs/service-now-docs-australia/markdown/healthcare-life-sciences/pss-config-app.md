# Configuring Patient Support Services

Set up the Patient Support Services application to complete enrollment activities associated with a patient service program.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

**Note:** The Patient Support Services application is based on the Patient Support Services data model that extends the [Healthcare and Life Sciences data model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/healthcare-and-life-sciences-service-management-core/hcls-serv-mgmt-core.md) and stores all enrollment requests in the Enrollment case \[sn\_patientservice\_enroll\_case\] table.

The following table provides an overview of the configuration tasks required for Patient Support Services.
