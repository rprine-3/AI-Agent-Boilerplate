# Pre-Visit Management properties

There are several advanced Pre-Visit Management properties that you can configure to schedule a pre-visit procedure for a patient.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

These properties are available for Pre-Visit Management.
