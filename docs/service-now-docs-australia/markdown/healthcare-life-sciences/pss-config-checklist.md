# Configure a checklist for Patient Support Services

Configure a checklist for a Patient Support Services program as an informal list of questions or tasks used as a reminder for the completion of an enrollment request.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The checklist feature is available with the Checklist plugin \(com.glide.ui.checklist\). As an administrator, you can create a checklist such as an eligibility checklist for a program or a training completion checklist for a nurse educator and associate them with a Patient Support Services program.

With the Patient Support Services application, the following checklists are available for use:

-   Eligibility Checklist: A sample checklist for determining the eligibility of a patient for a Patient Support Services program.
-   Nurse educator checklist: A sample checklist for conducting a training task. By default, this checklist is assigned to the Nurse Training Support group.

Alternatively, you can create a checklist using the Checklist formatter. For more information, see [Create a checklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/t_CreateAChecklist.md).

## Procedure
