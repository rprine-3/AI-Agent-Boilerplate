# Immunization table

The Immunization \[sn\_hcls\_immunization\] table stores the information about an event of a patient being administered a vaccine or a record of an immunization as reported by a patient, a clinician, or another party.

## Key features

-   Extends the Install base item \[sn\_install\_base\_item\] table to store immunization details.
-   Stores all immunization data associated with a patient, including the vaccine received, administered date, recommended doses, dose number, location where it was administered, practitioner who administered it, and the condition for which the vaccine was given.

Role required to configure the table: sn\_hcls.admin.

For more information, see [Healthcare and Life Sciences data model]().
