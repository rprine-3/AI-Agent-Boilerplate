# Healthcare and Life Sciences data model

The Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application provides a data model that is used in the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management workflows.

## Healthcare and Life Sciences overview

The Healthcare and Life Sciences data model is compatible with the Health Level Seven International \(HL7\) industry standard including the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources \(FHIR\) standard. The data model applies to all Healthcare and Life Sciences industry solutions including providers, life sciences, and payers. The model includes data tables for organizations, patients, practitioners, insurance, revenue cycle, and clinical data.

The data model uses a combination of tables to store data:

-   Tables that are included with the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application.
-   Tables that are from the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.
-   Tables that are from the ServiceNow AI Platform application.
-   Tables that are from the Product Catalog Management Core application.

You can install the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application to use only its data model for a basic configuration.
