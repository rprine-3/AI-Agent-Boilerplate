# Approve restricted caller access privileges for Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management

Approve restricted caller access \(RCA\) privileges for accessing document templates from the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management applications.

RCA privileges define cross-scope access to an application, an event, or an application resource. Application resources include access control roles, business rules, UI actions, and script includes.

The real and requested RCAs required for accessing document templates from a Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management application are included within the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application.

When you install a Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management application, the status of Real RCAs of the Document Templates application are set to **Requested**. For more information, see [Requested restricted caller access \(RCA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/requested-rca.md).

To be able to use document templates in a Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management application, as an administrator, you must set the status of Real RCAs of the Document Templates application to **Allowed**.
