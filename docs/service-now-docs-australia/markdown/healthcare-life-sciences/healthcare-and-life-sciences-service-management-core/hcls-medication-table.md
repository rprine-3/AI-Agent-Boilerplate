# Medication table

The Medication \[sn\_hcls\_medication\] table stores the information about a medication for the purposes of prescribing, dispensing, and administering a medication as well as for making statements about medication use.

## Key features

-   Extends the Install base item \[sn\_install\_base\_item\] table to store medication details associated with a patient.
-   Stores all medications received by a patient, including the medication name, start and end dates, status, the condition for which it was given, and the procedure it may be associated with.

Role required to configure the table: sn\_hcls.admin.
