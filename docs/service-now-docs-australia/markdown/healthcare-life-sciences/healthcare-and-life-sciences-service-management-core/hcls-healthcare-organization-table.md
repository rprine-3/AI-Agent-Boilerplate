# Healthcare organization table

The Healthcare organization \[sn\_hcls\_organization\] table stores the details of a healthcare organization in your ServiceNow instance.

## Key features

-   Models healthcare organizations of different types including providers and payers.
-   Other healthcare organizations can be nested within while also being associated with multiple healthcare locations.
-   When a healthcare organization is created, an associated business location is also created with the same name that references the healthcare organization.
-   Contains the Business location field, which references the CSM business location \[sn\_csm\_business\_location\] table.
-   To associate healthcare organizations with healthcare locations, see [Associate healthcare locations with a healthcare organizations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/healthcare-operations-core/hcls-sm-associate-healthcare-locations-organization.md).

For more information on how healthcare locations and healthcare organizations function, see [Setting up healthcare locations and healthcare organizations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/healthcare-operations-core/understanding-healthcare-locations-and-healthcare-organizations.md).

Role required to configure the table: sn\_hcls.admin.
