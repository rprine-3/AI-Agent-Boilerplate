# Case summarization using Now Assist

Generate a case summary and quickly understand the case context by using the case summarization skill in Now Assist.

The Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application leverages the generative AI capabilities of Now Assist from Customer Service Management to provide case summarization within Workspace.

Case summarization provides you with a concise summary of any type of HCLS case which includes the case issue, actions taken, and resolution details. This skill allows you to do the following:

-   Generate an initial summary of a case so that you can understand the case context.
-   Summarize all the work that has been done on a case.

Access to case summarization can be granted to HCLS users by either of the following roles:

-   sn\_customerservice\_agent
-   sn\_customerservice.consumer\_agent

Now Assist can be configured for any type of HCLS case.

**Note:** UI Builder can be used to configure the placement of the Case Summary panel within the HCLS case form.
