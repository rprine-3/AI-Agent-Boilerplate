# Determining additional user profiles in Pre-Visit Management

You can determine who can act as an agent connector or contributor for procedure request cases in the Pre-Visit Management application.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

As a user with the admin role, you can create contributor and agent connector profiles with the desired level of access to procedure request cases, case tasks, and other case-related information.

The sn\_previsit.contributor and sn\_previsit.agent\_connector roles installed with the Pre-Visit Management application provide the following user profiles:

-   [Agent connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/pre-visit-connector-contributor.md)
-   [Contributor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/pre-visit-connector-contributor.md)

## Agent connector

An agent connector within the Pre-Visit Management application acts as a fulfiller who can create, update, and close procedure request cases and tasks.

As a user with the admin role, you can determine who can act as an agent connector for the procedure request cases by assigning the sn\_previsit.agent\_connector role and other agent-specific roles to a group, and then assigning the group to the user with the agent connector profile. To assign roles to a group, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).

The following table describes the location agent profile within the Pre-Visit Management application scope that you can refer to as an example for combining the sn\_previsit.agent\_connector role with the [industry data model roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-data-model-roles.md) in the CSM application.

Location agent

Creates and fulfills procedure request cases in the agent's business location.

**Note:** To create procedure request cases for a service organization \(business location\), a user with the location agent profile must be a member of the service organization and assigned the **Location Consumer Agent** responsibility type. The mapping of a service organization and its members is included in the Service Organization Member \[sn\_csm\_service\_organization\_member\] table.

</table>## Contributor

A contributor within the Pre-Visit Management application acts as a requester who can create and read procedure request cases.

As a user with the admin role, you can determine who can act as a contributor to the procedure request cases by assigning the sn\_previsit.contributor role and other contributor roles to a group, and then assigning the group to the user with the contributor profile. To assign roles to a group, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).

The following table describes different contributor profiles within the Pre-Visit Management application scope that you can refer to as an example for combining the sn\_previsit.contributor role with the [contributor roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-contributor-user-roles.md) in the CSM application.

**Note:** To create procedure requests for a patient, a user with the relationship contributor profile must have a relationship with the patient included in the Consumer Team Member \[sn\_customer\_rel\_consumer\_to\_user\_list\] table and the **Relationship Manager** responsibility type.
