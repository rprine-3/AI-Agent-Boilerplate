# Components installed with Patient Support Services

Several types of components are installed with installation of the Patient Support Services application, including tables, user roles, ServiceNow Store applications, and business rules.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

**Note:** The Application Files table lists the components that are installed with this application. For instructions on how to access this table, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
