# EMR Provider Directory Sync

The EMR Provider Directory Sync imports HL7 FHIR R4 resources from a FHIR server into the ServiceNow Healthcare Operations data model on a configurable schedule.

The Healthcare Operations \(HCO\) data model depends on accurate organization, location, and practitioner records. This application ingests four FHIR R4 resources from a FHIR server on a configurable schedule and upserts them into the corresponding Healthcare Operations tables. Records are identified across runs by the FHIR resource ID, stored as an external identifier on each target.

The integration is one-way \(FHIR server to ServiceNow\), admin-operated, and scheduled. It builds on the [HL7 FHIR Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/fhir-spoke-landing.md), which provides the read-only FHIR actions, and owns all FHIR-to-HCLS field mapping, upsert keys, and dependency ordering.
