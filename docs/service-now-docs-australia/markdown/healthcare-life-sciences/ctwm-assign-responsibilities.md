# Assign responsibilities for Care Team Work Management

Assign responsibilities to users in Care Team Work Management to dictate which specific records users are authorized to view or modify.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can edit the responsibilities of Care Team Work Management users when adding or removing members from your healthcare organizations, or at any time as needed.

**Note:**

In order to access care team case and task information, all operational leaders should be assigned the **Care Team Agent Manager** responsibility.

|Responsibility|Role|
|--------------|----|
|Care Team Agent|sn\_cto.care\_team\_agent|
|Care Team Agent Manager|sn\_cto.care\_team\_agent\_manager|

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Healthcare Operations** &gt; **Healthcare Organizations** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select the parent organization.

3.  Navigate to the **Members** related list.

4.  Select **Edit members**.

5.  In **Responsibility**, select the intended responsibility for the user.

6.  Use the arrows between the **Available** and **Selected** panels to add the member.

    **Note:**

    If a newly added user isn’t populated in the Available list, search for them manually using the lookup icon.

    On occasion, newly added members don’t appear within the Selected panel due to property configurations. If this occurs, see [Configure global system properties to edit members in Healthcare Operations Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/healthcare-operations-core/hcls-cto-configure-properties-edit-members.md).

7.  Select **Save**.
