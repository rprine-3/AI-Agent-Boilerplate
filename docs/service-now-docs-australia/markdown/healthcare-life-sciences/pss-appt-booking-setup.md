# Configuring an appointment booking setting for Patient Support Services

Enable patients to book an appointment for the training requests conducted by nurse educators.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

In the Patient Support Services application, an appointment is booked for scheduling training requests included within a program service. For completing a program service item, a program task is created in the application.

The Patient Support Services application uses the Appointment Booking plugin \(com.snc.appointment\_booking\) to create an appointment record in the Appointment \[sn\_hcls\_appointment\] table. The appointment record is created for a program task that requires appointment booking. The plugin is automatically activated after your administrator installs the Patient Support Services application. For more information about the Appointment Booking feature, see [Appointment booking components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/appointment-booking-components.md).

As a user with the sn\_patientservice.admin role, you configure the following appointment booking settings:

2.  [Configure an appointment booking service setting in Patient Support Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/pss-appt-booking-setup.md).

    **Note:** The appointment booking feature requires configuration for a program task that offers scheduled appointments. A service configuration includes settings that apply only to that specific service.
