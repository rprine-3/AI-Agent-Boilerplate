# Configuring the Pre-Visit Management email notifications

Configure the Pre-Visit Management email notifications sent to patients about pre-visit activities for procedure requests.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

Pre-Visit Management includes the following email notifications.
