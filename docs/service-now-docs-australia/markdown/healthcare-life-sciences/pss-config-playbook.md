# Configuring playbooks for Patient Support Services

Configure a playbook to provide step-by-step guidance for resolving enrollment cases.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

As a user with the admin role, you can create a playbook by using Playbooks, a ServiceNow AI Platform® feature. For more information, see [Process Automation Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md).

The playbooks in the Patient Support Services application use the CRM Workspace playbook experience. By default, the Patient Support Services application includes a playbook for assisting care coordinators to resolve enrollment cases.

Configure a playbook by navigating to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Process Automation Designer**. You can either select an existing process definition or create a new process definition for the playbook associated with enrollment cases.

**Note:** When configuring a process definition for the playbook associated with enrollment cases, ensure that the application scope is set to Patient Support Services or Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).
