HL7 Message Log

 \[`sn_hl7_v2_message_log`\]

</td><td>

Stores every inbound HL7 v2.x message received by ServiceNow, including the raw payload, ACK response, extracted MSH metadata fields, and processing status. The `raw_payload` field is protected by a column-level ACL.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HL7 Parser Configuration

 \[`sn_hl7_v2_parser_config`\]

</td><td>

Defines parser configurations that map HL7 message types and sending system identities to segment and field extraction rules. Extends `sys_metadata`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HL7 Parser Segment

 \[`sn_hl7_v2_parser_segment`\]

</td><td>

Defines individual HL7 segments \(for example, PV1, PID\) within a parser configuration, including the segment code and human-readable label. Extends `sys_metadata`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HL7 Parser Field Map

 \[`sn_hl7_v2_parser_field_map`\]

</td><td>

Maps an HL7 field position within a parser segment to a dotted output path \(`field_name`\) in the message log's `parsed_data`, with an optional human-readable label. Supports field and component extraction. Extends `sys_metadata`.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## UI actions installed

The application installs two UI actions on the parser configuration form. **Parse Sample Payload** parses the configuration's sample payload and populates the parsed value on each field map. **Clone** deep-copies a configuration and its segments and field maps to a new, inactive configuration.

## Demo parser configurations installed

The following parser configurations are installed only when you select **Load demo data** during installation. They are editable examples, not read-only records.

|Configuration|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|HL7 v2.8 ADT^A01 — Admit|Demo parser configuration for ADT^A01 \(patient admit\) messages. Covers the EVN, PID, and PV1 segments.|
|HL7 v2.8 ADT^A02 — Transfer|Demo parser configuration for ADT^A02 \(patient transfer\) messages. Covers the EVN, PID, and PV1 segments.|
|HL7 v2.8 ADT^A03 — Discharge|Demo parser configuration for ADT^A03 \(patient discharge\) messages. Covers the EVN, PID, and PV1 segments.|
|HL7 v2.8 ADT^A08 — Update|Demo parser configuration for ADT^A08 \(patient information update\) messages. Covers the EVN, PID, and PV1 segments.|
