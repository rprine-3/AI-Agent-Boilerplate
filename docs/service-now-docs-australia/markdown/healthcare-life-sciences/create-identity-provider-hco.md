# Create and Configure an Identity Provider in ServiceNow to Authenticate with Epic

Set up an Identity Provider in your ServiceNow instance to enable OIDC for Healthcare Operations Core.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the com.snc.integration.sso.multi.installer plugin is installed on your instance.

**Note:** For the following process to be successful, the following script includes need to be available in Global scope:

-   **MultiSSO\_OIDC\_CTO**
-   **OAuthUtilEpic**

If these script includes are in HCLS application scope, they must first be cloned into Global scope before proceeding.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-Provider SSO** &gt; **Identity Providers**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Under What kind of SSO are you trying to create, select **OpenID Connect**.

4.  In the Import OpenID Connect Well-Known Configuration window, enter the following fields:

    -   Name – Enter a name for your Identity Provider \(for example, Epic OIDC\)
    -   Client ID – Input the Client ID created from your FHIR app on fhir.epic.com.
    -   Well-Known Configuration IRL – Enter `[https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/.well-known/openid-configuration)`.

        **Note:** Verify this value with Epic as it may be different for your environment.

5.  Select **Import.**

6.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Multi-Provider SSO** &gt; **Identity Providers**.

7.  Select the Identity Provider you wish to configure.

10. Update the following fields:

    1.  User Claim – enter **preferred\_username**.
    2.  User Field – select **User ID**.
    3.  OIDC Metadata URL - Enter to your FHIR server \(Interconnect\) URL endpoint. For example, from [https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/.well-known/openid-configuration) to [https://yourinterconnectendpoint/.well-known/openid-configuration/](https://yourinterconnectendpoint/.well-known/openid-configuration/).
11. Click **Update**.

12. In the Identity Provider, navigate to the Advanced related list.

13. Update the Single Sign-On Script field to **MultiSSO\_OIDC\_CTO**.
