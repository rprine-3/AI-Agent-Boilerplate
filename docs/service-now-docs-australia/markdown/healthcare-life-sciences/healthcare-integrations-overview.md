# Healthcare Integrations

Connect ServiceNow Healthcare and Life Sciences with external clinical systems. Two integration approaches are available: standards-based HL7 FHIR and message-based HL7 v2.x native integration. Choose the approach that matches your source system and data needs.

Healthcare systems exchange patient, practitioner, organizational, and clinical data through established interoperability standards. ServiceNow Healthcare and Life Sciences supports two complementary integration approaches. Both bring external healthcare data onto the platform; they differ in the standard they use, how data is transported, and the source systems they suit.

## HL7 FHIR Integration

The [Healthcare Operations HL7 FHIR Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/hco-fhir-landing.md) reads the following HL7 FHIR R4 provider-directory resources from a FHIR R4-conformant server:

-   Organization
-   Location
-   Practitioner
-   PractitionerRole

It loads them into the Healthcare Operations data model on a schedule.

Use this approach when your source system exposes a FHIR R4 API and you want structured, resource-oriented synchronization built in Workflow Studio.

This integration builds on the HL7 FHIR Spoke, which provides the underlying Integration Hub actions that read FHIR resources.

## HL7 v2.x Native Integration

The [Healthcare Interoperability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/hl7-integration-overview.md) feature provides native HL7 v2.x messaging which connects to an integration engine, parsing inbound messages such as ADT events and tracking them through a message log. Use this approach when your source systems exchange traditional HL7 v2.x messages rather than FHIR resources.
