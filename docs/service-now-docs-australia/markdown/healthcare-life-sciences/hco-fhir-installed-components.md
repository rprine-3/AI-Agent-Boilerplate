# Components installed with the EMR Provider Directory Sync

Several types of components are installed with the EMR Provider Directory Sync. These include a user role, a sync log table, a scheduled job, flows, a business rule, flow actions, and a decision table.

## Roles installed

<table><thead><tr><th>

Role title \[name\]

</th><th>

Description

</th><th>

Contains roles

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

HCO FHIR Integration Admin

 \[`sn_hco_intg_fhir.admin`\]

</td><td>

Operates the FHIR sync: triggers runs, edits the sync schedule and the organization classification decision table, and reads, creates, and updates FHIR Sync Log rows.

</td><td>

Inherited by users with `sn_hco.admin`.

FHIR Sync Log

 \[`sn_hco_intg_fhir_sync_log`\]

</td><td>

Records one row per resource type per sync run, with start and end times, processed and skipped counts, status, correlation ID, and a transport error message. For field details, see [FHIR Sync Log fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/hco-fhir-sync-log-fields.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The application also writes to tables owned by other applications but does not install them. These include the Healthcare Organization, Location, and Practitioner tables, the business location tables, the user table, and the service organization member tables. See [FHIR-to-HCLS field mappings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/hco-fhir-field-mappings.md).

## Scheduled jobs installed

<table><thead><tr><th>

Scheduled job

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

FHIR Sync — Daily

</td><td>

Runs daily \(by default at 03:00 instance time\) and starts the **Import FHIR Resources** orchestration subflow. Admins can also run it on demand with **Execute Now**.

 Installed inactive. Set **Active** to true on the job record before first use.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Flows and subflows installed

|Subflow|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Import FHIR Resources|Orchestration subflow that sets a correlation ID and runs the four per-resource imports in dependency order, stopping if any fails.|
|Import Organizations|Imports FHIR Organizations into Healthcare Organization records and internal or external business locations.|
|Import Locations|Imports FHIR Locations into platform and Healthcare Location records and associates them with a managing organization.|
|Import Practitioners|Imports FHIR Practitioners into user and Healthcare Practitioner records and grants the care-team-member role.|
|Import PractitionerRoles|Imports FHIR PractitionerRoles into service organization member and responsibility records.|
|Start Sync Log Entry / End Sync Log Entry|Shared subflows that open and close a FHIR Sync Log row and provide the delta-sync watermark.|

Each per-resource import decomposes into additional child subflows — a per-record processor and a shared upsert subflow, plus a one-level parent-recovery subflow for Organizations and Locations.

## Business rules installed

|Business rule|Table|Description|
|-------------|-----|-----------|
|Stamp ended on status transition|`sn_hco_intg_fhir_sync_log`|Before update — stamps the `ended` timestamp when a sync log row transitions out of the Running status.|

## Flow actions installed

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Format FHIR Last-Updated Filter|Converts the previous run's timestamp into a FHIR `last updated` search filter for delta syncs.|
|Parse FHIR Reference|Strips the resource-type prefix from a FHIR reference to return the bare logical ID.|

## Decision tables installed

|Decision table|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|`FhirOrgTypeToBusinessLocationClass`|Classifies an imported FHIR Organization as an internal or external business location based on its organization type. Editable by admins. See [Configure the organization classification decision table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/hco-fhir-configure-decision-table.md).|

## Spoke components used

EMR Provider Directory Sync uses read-only actions from the [HL7 FHIR Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/fhir-spoke-landing.md) to fetch provider-directory data. The following FHIR Spoke actions are called by the import subflows:

-   Look up Organization by ID
-   Look up Organizations Stream
-   Look up Location by ID
-   Look up Locations Stream
-   Look up Practitioner by ID
-   Look up Practitioners Stream
-   Look up PractitionerRole by ID
-   Look up PractitionerRoles Stream

All eight actions authenticate through the shared `HL7 FHIR` Connection &amp; Credential Alias defined in the HL7 FHIR Spoke. For setup details, see [HL7 FHIR Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/fhir-spoke-landing.md).

## System properties installed

The application installs no system properties. The sync cadence is controlled by the scheduled job record, and the organization classification is controlled by the decision table.
