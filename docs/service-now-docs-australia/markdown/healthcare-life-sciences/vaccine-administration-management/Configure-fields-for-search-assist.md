# Encrypt search fields to appear in search assist

Encrypt search fields to search from a field other than the first name, last name, and phone fields. By encrypting search fields, you can configure them to appear in search assist.

## Before you begin

Role required: security\_admin

## About this task

You can encrypt fields such as the street, city, state, and zip code based on your organization's requirement. Decrypted fields are kept hidden from the search assist. By default, the first name, last name, and phone fields are visible to users.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Field Encryption** &gt; **Encrypted Field Configurations**.

2.  In the **Search** field, enter `sn_vaccine_sm_personal_info`.

    In the Encrypted Field Configurations table, you can see multiple `sn_vaccine_sm_personal_info` fields.

3.  Select and hold \(or right-click\) the Active column and select **Group By Active**.

4.  In the **Active** field, select **False**.

5.  Click **Update**.

6.  To encrypt or decrypt fields, repeat steps 3 through step 5, as needed.
