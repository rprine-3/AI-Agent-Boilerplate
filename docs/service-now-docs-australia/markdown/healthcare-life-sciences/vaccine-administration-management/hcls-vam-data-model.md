# Vaccine Administration Management data model

The Vaccine Administration Management application provides a data model that is used in the vaccine administration workflows.

The Vaccine Administration Management data model extends the Healthcare and Life Sciences data model.

The Vaccine Administration Management data model uses a combination of tables to store data:

-   Tables that are included within the Vaccine Administration Management application.
-   Tables that are included within the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application.
-   Tables that are from the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application.
-   Tables that are from the ServiceNow AI Platform application.

You can install the Vaccine Administration Management application to use its data model.

The following diagram shows the tables and their relationships that comprise the Vaccine Administration Management data model.

\[Omitted image "hcls-vam-data-model.png"\] Alt text: Infographic displaying the Vaccine Administration Management data model . For the text description, refer to the Vaccine Administration Management application tables section.

The Vaccine Administration Management data model uses the following tables included within the Vaccine Administration Management application to store data.
