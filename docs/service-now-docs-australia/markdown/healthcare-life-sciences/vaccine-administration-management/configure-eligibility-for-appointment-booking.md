# Configure the eligibility criteria for a vaccination program

Configure the eligibility criteria that users must meet to be eligible for a vaccination program.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vaccine\_sm.admin

## About this task

The users register and provide personal information in the portal. The information is compared with the vaccination program's eligibility criteria to determine whether the users are eligible for the program. If the users are eligible, then the user will be able to proceed to the next stage and schedule the vaccinations. If no eligibility criteria are provided, then all registered users are eligible to schedule vaccinations.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Vaccine Administration Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Programs**.

2.  Open the vaccination program record that you want to configure the eligibility criteria for.

3.  In the **Eligibility Criteria** condition builder, add one or more filter conditions to define the criteria that users must meet to be eligible for the vaccination program.

    For example, the following eligibility criteria are defined for users that are above the age of 60 or are a healthcare worker. When users provide their personal information in the portal, the user must meet one of these conditions to be eligible for the vaccination program.

4.  Click **Update**.
