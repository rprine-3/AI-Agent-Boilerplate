# Configure advanced appointment scheduling for a center

Configure advanced appointment scheduling for a center. Advanced appointment scheduling enables you to configure different vaccination schedules, weekly, daily, and more, and the capacity to meet the changing needs of different location centers and programs.

## Before you begin

Navigate to **Vaccine Administration Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**, and make sure that the **Enable Vaccine Administration Management location specific Appointment Configuration** property \(**sn\_vaccine\_sm.enable\_vam\_appointment\_config**\) is selected.

**Warning:** Once you have enabled the property and your advanced appointment scheduling configurations are live, avoid disabling the property to help prevent any data inconsistencies.

Role required: sn\_vaccine\_sm.admin

## About this task

Configure advanced appointment scheduling for a center. You can create appointment configurations for use at a specific location or for reuse across multiple location centers and programs.

For each appointment configuration, you can create one or more vaccination schedules to configure the daily start and end time. You can configure the days that appointments can be booked, the inclusion of a daily break, and more. Appointment configurations apply for both self-scheduled and mass-booked appointments.

**Important:** When you enable this feature, it replaces the default appointment scheduling configuration that is applied across all centers. For further information about the default configuration, see [Configure vaccine appointment scheduling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/vaccine-administration-management/vaccine-appt-booking.md).

Advanced appointment scheduling configuration enables administrators to configure appointment durations, daily schedule, holiday schedule, and so on. The configuration is used to identify the available slots as well as a location’s capacity for a given day. The configuration enables users to select appointment slots based on the parameters that you configure.
