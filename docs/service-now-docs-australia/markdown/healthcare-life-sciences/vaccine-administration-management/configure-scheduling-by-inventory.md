# Configure inventory-based scheduling for a center

Configure scheduling based on available inventory for a center.

## Before you begin

Navigate to **Vaccine Administration Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**, and make sure that the **Enables vaccine inventory management** property \(**sn\_vaccine\_sm.enable\_inventory\_management**\) is selected.

**Warning:** Once you have enabled the property and your inventory-based configurations are live, avoid disabling the property to help prevent any data inconsistencies.

Role required: sn\_vaccine\_sm.admin or sn\_vaccine\_sm.inventory\_manager

## About this task

Configure scheduling based on available inventory for a center. Inventory-based scheduling enables you to limit appointment booking based on the available inventory for that day. For example, say that a center has 200 available doses and 500 available appointment slots for a particular day. Because there are only 200 doses, appointment booking would be capped at 200 appointments for that day.

When you receive a vaccine supply lot at a particular center, you can provide details about the lot for the vaccine type, number of doses, expiration date, and so on. You can add it to your inventory. You can then automate or manually distribute the inventory over a specified date range. You can also manually track wasted doses.

**Important:** This feature is only available for user-scheduled appointments. It isn’t currently supported for mass booking.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Vaccine Administration Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Programs**.

2.  Open a program record.

3.  In the Center related list, open a vaccination center record.

4.  In the Vaccine Supply Lots related list, create a new record for each vaccine supply lot that you receive at that location.

    1.  Click **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    3.  Select and hold \(or right-click\) the form header and click **Save**.

    4.  To confirm that the lot was received and is included in the inventory for that location, click **Make Available**.

5.  To distribute the lot automatically.

    1.  Open the vaccine supply lot record.

    2.  Click **Distribute**.

        The lot is evenly distributed over a specified number of business days based on the location's appointment scheduling configuration. For example, say that the lot is distributed over seven days at a center that is closed on Saturday and Sunday. If the lot distribution begins on Monday, then it’s evenly distributed over the next seven business days \(Monday through Friday of that week, and then the following Monday and Tuesday\).

        **Note:**

        By default, the number is set to seven days. To change the number of days, navigate to **Vaccine Administration Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Properties**, and update the **Number of days to distribute a lot** property \(**sn\_vaccine\_sm.im\_lot\_distribution\_day\_count**\).

        When you distribute the lot automatically, you have the option to manually adjust the allocated doses for an individual day. Open the Vaccine Availability by Lot record for the day that you want to update the doses for, and then update the **Allocated Doses** field.

6.  To distribute the lot manually.

    1.  Open the vaccine supply lot record.

    2.  In the Vaccine Availability related list, click **New**.

    3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
