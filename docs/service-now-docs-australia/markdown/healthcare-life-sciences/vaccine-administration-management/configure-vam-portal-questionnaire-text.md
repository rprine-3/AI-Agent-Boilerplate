# Configure the questionnaire text for the user and clinician portals

Configure the questionnaire text that is displayed in the user and clinician portals for Vaccine Administration Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Definitions** &gt; **Maintain Catalogs**.

2.  Open the Vaccination Catalog record.

3.  From the Catalog Items related list, update the questionnaire text by updating the corresponding variables from the following catalog items.

    **Note:** The questionnaire text is distributed across the following catalog items and variables.

<table id="table_bk2_dzq_bpb"><thead><tr><th>

</table>    For details on how to configure a variable, see [Service Catalog variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_ServiceCatalogVariables.md).

    **Important:**

    -   Updating the questionnaire text updates that text in both the user and clinician portals.
    -   If you deactivate a variable, then the question will be hidden in both the user and clinician portals.
    -   If you're creating a question, the new question isn’t displayed in the clinician portal by default. You must also update the pre-vaccine\_questionnaire widget by navigating to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Widgets**. For details on how to configure a widget, see [Service Portal widgets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/service-portal-widgets.md).
4.  Click **Update**.
