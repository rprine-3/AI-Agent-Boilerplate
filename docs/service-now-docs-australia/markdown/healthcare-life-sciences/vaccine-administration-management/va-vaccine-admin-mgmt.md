# Virtual Agent conversations for Vaccine Administration Management

Virtual Agent conversations enable users to get help with the vaccination process.

If the Virtual Agent plugin \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\) is installed, the Vaccine Administration Management provides Virtual Agent conversation topics. A conversation topic defines the dialog between the Virtual Agent \(chatbot\) and the user to accomplish a goal.
