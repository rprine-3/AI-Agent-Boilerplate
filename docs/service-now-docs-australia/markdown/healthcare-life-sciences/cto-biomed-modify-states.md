# Modify state decision tables in Care Team Operations for Biomed

Use Decision Builder to change the state mappings for cases and work orders in Care Team Operations for Biomed .

\[Omitted image "cto-biomed-case-tstate.png"\] Alt text: Healthcare biomed case state sync map.

The Healthcare Biomed case state sync map displays all current mappings between Healthcare Biomed case and work order states.

To modify these state mappings, see [Modify decision table structure in Workflow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/format-decision-table-in-decision-designer.md)**.**

To learn more about decisions tables, see [Edit decision tables using draft authoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/edit-decision-tables-using-draft-authoring.md) and [Use decision tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/use-decision-tables.md).

The source table aligns with the input state and the destination table aligns with the output state.

These values can be found in the Dictionary Entry for the State field.
