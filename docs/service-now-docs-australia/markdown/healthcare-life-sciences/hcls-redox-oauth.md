# Link your ServiceNow instance with your Redox account

Create an OAuth application endpoint for the external Redox healthcare system to access your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Redox Inbound Integration is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

Ensure that the application scope is set to Redox Inbound Integration by using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: sn\_hcls.admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System OAuth** &gt; **Application Registry**.

2.  In the Application Registries list, click **New**.

3.  On the OAuth application page, select **Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients**.

4.  On the Application Registries form, fill in the Redox healthcare system details including the name, client ID, accessible from, client secret, accessible from, refresh token lifespan, and access token lifespan.
