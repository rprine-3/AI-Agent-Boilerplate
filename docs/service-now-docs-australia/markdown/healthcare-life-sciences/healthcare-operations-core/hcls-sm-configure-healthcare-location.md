## About this task

Healthcare locations are the physical or virtual places where care and operational work occur—campuses, buildings, wings, units, rooms, and other serviceable spaces. .

The Healthcare Location \[sn\_hcls\_location\] table stores details of the location associated with your healthcare organization.
