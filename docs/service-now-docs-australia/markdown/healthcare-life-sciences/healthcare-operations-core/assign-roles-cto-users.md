# Assign roles to Healthcare Operations Core users

Assign specific roles to give Healthcare Operations Core users visibility into healthcare organizations and the hierarchies they manage.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Roles control access to features, capabilities, and data in the Healthcare Operations Core application.

You can assign roles to individual users or groups. When you apply roles to groups, the members of those groups inherit those roles.

**Note:** User roles can be configured during the initial setup process for healthcare organizations, or at any time thereafter as needed.

**Example:** You could create a group called “HCO Team Members” and assign the role sn\_hco.care\_team\_member to the group. Then, when importing users, you would associate the users that are care team members with this group.

**Note:** This group doesn’t give them direct access to care team operations. They must still be associated with a healthcare organization as a member then assigned responsibilities.

For instructions on assigning roles to groups, see [Create a group for all care team members in Healthcare Operations Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/healthcare-operations-core/hco-create-team-members-group.md)
