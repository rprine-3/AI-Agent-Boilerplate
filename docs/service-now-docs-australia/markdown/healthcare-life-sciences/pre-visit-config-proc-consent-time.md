# Configure when to send the procedure consent form to a patient

Configure the Pre-Visit Management application to when to send the procedure consent document for review and signature to a patient before the procedure appointment date.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

Set the application scope to Pre-Visit Management using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: sn\_previsit.admin or admin

## About this task

By default, the **Send procedure consent schedule** scheduled job is configured to automatically send the procedure consent document to a patient. The lead time when to send the document is set in the **sn\_previsit.procedure\_consent\_lead\_time** property. You can configure this property to specify when to send the procedure consent document to a patient.

## Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter, and then open the **sn\_previsit.procedure\_consent\_lead\_time** property.

2.  In the **Value** field, enter a numeric value that indicates the number of days before the procedure appointment date when the procedure consent form is sent to the patient for review or signature.

3.  Click **Update**.
