# Configuring the enrollment request form

You can configure an enrollment request form to enable patients or practitioners to enroll into Patient Support Services programs offered by a healthcare organization.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

As a healthcare provider, you can use an enrollment application form to enable patients or practitioners to submit enrollment requests.

As a user with the admin role, you can configure an enrollment application form and associate the form fields with application tables using the **PatientServicePortalUtils** script include. The script include provides a default implementation and is available within the Patient Support Services application. You can create your own implementation and associate it with the **PatientServicePortalUtils** script include. For more information, see [Script includes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).
