# Configuring Pre-Visit Management

Set up the Pre-Visit Management application to complete pre-visit activities associated with a procedure.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

The following table provides an overview of the configuration tasks required for Pre-Visit Management.

**Note:** The Pre-Visit Management application is based on the [Healthcare and Life Sciences data model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/healthcare-life-sciences/healthcare-and-life-sciences-service-management-core/hcls-serv-mgmt-core.md) and stores all procedure requests in the Procedure request \[sn\_previsit\_procedure\_request\] table.
