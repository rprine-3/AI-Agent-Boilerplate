# Patient Support Services data model

The Patient Support Services application provides a data model for use in the Patient Support Services workflow.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Patient Support Services is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

The Patient Support Services data model extends the Healthcare and Life Sciences data model.

The Patient Support Services data model uses a combination of tables to store data:

-   Tables that are included within the Patient Support Services application.
-   Tables that are included within the Healthcare and Life Sciences Service Management Core application.

You can install the Patient Support Services application to use its data model.
