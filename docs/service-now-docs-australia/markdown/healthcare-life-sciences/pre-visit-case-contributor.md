# Setting up the process to create procedure request cases as a contributor

Set up the process for users with the contributor profile to create procedure request cases on a service portal.

**Important:**

Starting with the Yokohama release, Pre-Visit Management is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

If the CSM Contributor User plugin \(com.snc.csm\_contributor\_user\) is installed in addition to the Pre-Visit Management application, the **Create a procedure request case** record producer is available from the Case menu on the Consumer Service Portal page to create procedure request cases. To enable users with the [contributor roles in CSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/csm-contributor-user-roles.md) for creating procedure request cases, you can use the default record producer or create your own record producer.

As an administrator, you can include the record producer for creating procedure request cases in a service  catalog and display the service  catalog  as a module on the Consumer Service Portal page. Users with the contributor profile can then use the module to create procedure request cases.

For more information, see [Record Producer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_RecordProducer.md) and [Set up a service catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_SetUpAServiceCatalog.md) .
