# RIDAC Risk form

Use the RIDAC Risk form to identify and track potential risks that could impact your strategic planning items, goals, or EAP iterations. Manage risk mitigation strategies and monitor risk exposure.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Number|Unique identifier for the risk. This field is auto-generated when the risk is created.|
|State|Current status of the risk. The available options are **Pending**, **Open**, **Work in Progress**, **Closed Complete**, **Closed Incomplete**, and **Closed Skipped**.|
|Short description|Brief, concise summary of the potential risk. This field is required and appears as the title of the risk record.|
|Description|Detailed information about the risk, including triggers, potential consequences, and any relevant context or background information.|
|Mitigation plan|Detailed plan and timeline for implementing mitigation strategies. Includes specific steps, responsible parties, and completion dates for risk mitigation activities.|
|Probability|Likelihood of the risk occurring. The available options are **Absolute**, **High**, **Moderate**, and **Low**. This helps in risk assessment and prioritization of mitigation strategies.|
|Risk status|Current status of the risk. The available options are **Pending**, **Achieved**, **Not Achieved**, **Avoid**, **Mitigate**, **Transfer**, and **Accept**. This field tracks the lifecycle status of the risk separate from the overall State field.|
|Impact|Potential impact if the risk occurs. The available options are **1 - High**, **2 - Medium**, **3 - Low**. This indicates the severity of the risk on planning objectives.|
|Estimated Cost|Estimated cost in currency \(for example, USD\) to mitigate or resolve the risk. Helps with financial tracking and planning.|
|Risk rank|Calculated numeric ranking of the risk based on probability and impact. This field is auto-calculated and helps with risk prioritization \(higher number indicates higher risk\).|
|Risk owner|Individual or role designated as the risk owner who has overall accountability for risk management and mitigation.|
|Risk value|Overall risk assessment value derived from probability and impact evaluation. This field is auto-calculated to provide a composite risk score.|
|Assigned to|User or team responsible for risk mitigation and monitoring activities.|
|Task|Execution item \(such as a project or demand\) on which this RIDAC item was created. This field is the same as the Parent field and stores a reference to the execution item. When you create a RIDAC item on an execution item, this field is automatically populated. If the RIDAC item is created on a planning item, this field syncs to the related execution item.|
|Due date|Target date by which risk mitigation actions should be completed.|
|Planning Item|The planning item \(project, demand, epic, feature, or custom planning item\) that this risk is associated with. This field is auto-populated when a risk is created from a planning item context.|
|Enterprise agile iteration|The EAP iteration associated with this risk. This field is auto-populated when a risk is created from an EAP iteration context.|
|Goal|The goal \(portfolio plan goal or board goal\) that this risk is associated with. This field is auto-populated when a risk is created from a goal context.|
|Work notes|Internal notes and updates about risk mitigation progress, monitoring activities, and any changes to risk status. Used to track work history and communication.|
