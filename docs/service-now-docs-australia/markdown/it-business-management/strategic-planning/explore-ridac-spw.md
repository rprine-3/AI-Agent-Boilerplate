# Exploring RIDAC in Strategic Planning Workspace

RIDAC \(Risk, Issue, Decision, Action, Change\) in Strategic Planning Workspace provides a holistic, portfolio-wide view of all risks, issues, decisions, actions, and changes across your entire organization—from individual projects to programs and portfolios.

## RIDAC overview

RIDAC \(Risk, Issue, Decision, Action, and Change request\) in Strategic Planning Workspace provides a unified view of all RIDAC records across your portfolio hierarchy. Strategic Planning Workspace delivers a holistic perspective that helps teams identify and manage risks, resolve issues, document decisions, track actions, and monitor changes across all planning items, goals, and EAP \(Enterprise Agile Planning\) iterations—without navigating between multiple records.

## RIDAC users

|User|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Portfolio manager|Portfolio managers use the holistic RIDAC view in Strategic Planning Workspace to understand all risks, issues, decisions, actions, and changes across their entire portfolio. They monitor rolled-up RIDAC records from projects and programs to identify cross-project risks, validate portfolio-level decisions, and ensure alignment between operational activities and strategic objectives.|
|Program manager / PMO leader|Program managers create and manage RIDAC records on their programs and view RIDAC that rolls up from child projects. They assess how project-level risks, issues, and changes impact program delivery and strategic goals. PMO leaders use RIDAC to enforce governance, track decision documentation, and maintain issue resolution workflows across the organization.|
|Project manager / Team lead|Project managers create and manage RIDAC records on their projects. They track risks and issues affecting project delivery, document decisions that shape project direction, maintain action item lists, and register change requests. They can optionally associate RIDAC records with planning items, goals, or EAP iterations to link operational work to strategic priorities.|
|Strategy leader / Executive sponsor|Strategy leaders and executive sponsors use the unified RIDAC view to assess portfolio-wide risks to strategic objectives, review decisions that impact multiple initiatives, and monitor action status across the organization.|

## Supported RIDAC tables

|Table|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Planning item|Demand|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your demand to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Project|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your project to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Epic|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your epic to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Capability|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your capability to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Feature|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your feature to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Custom planning item|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your custom planning item to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Enterprise agile planning item|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your enterprise agile planning item to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Initiative|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your initiative to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Strategic program|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your strategic program to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|Goal|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your goal to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|
|EAP iteration|Can create and track Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes directly within your EAP iteration to manage planning uncertainties and dependencies.|

## RIDAC benefits

|Benefit|Feature|Users|
|-------|-------|-----|
|Unified portfolio visibility of risks, issues, decisions, actions, and changes across all projects and programs|Holistic RIDAC view in Strategic Planning Workspace|Portfolio managers, PMO leaders, strategy leaders|
|Automatic rollup of RIDAC through portfolio hierarchy—see project risks at program and portfolio levels|RIDAC rollup mechanics|Program managers, portfolio managers|
|Connect operational RIDAC to strategic objectives by linking to planning items, goals, or EAP iterations|RIDAC entity associations \(planning items, goals, EAP iterations\)|Project managers, program managers, strategy leaders|
|Track RIDAC across both alignment and execution project systems with automatic cross-system reference population|Execution and alignment integration for RIDAC|Project managers with dual project management systems|

## RIDAC integration with planning and execution Items

When integration is enabled, RIDAC items maintain a bidirectional link between planning items \(demands and projects\) and execution items \(tasks\). This means:

-   **Create a RIDAC on a planning item** - Execution details from any linked execution task automatically populate on the RIDAC record.
-   **Create a RIDAC on an execution item** - Planning item details automatically populate on the RIDAC record.

Because the link is bidirectional, a RIDAC item created from either context—planning or execution—contains both planning and execution information, giving stakeholders a complete view of risks, issues, decisions, actions, and changes across the planning and delivery lifecycle.

Example: If you add a RIDAC item to a project, you can view the same RIDAC item details in the project workspace. This ensures that planning stakeholders and execution teams see the same risk, issue, decision, action, or change data without duplicating work.

## Comparing RIDAC feature between Strategic Planning and Portfolio Planning

Strategic Planning Workspace extends RIDAC capabilities beyond what is available in Portfolio Planning. The following comparison shows the key differences in supported entities and features.

-   Portfolio Planning: Create and manage RIDAC items for projects and demands to track risks, issues, decisions, actions, and changes across your portfolio. For more information, see [Using RIDAC in Strategic Planning Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/strategic-planning/using-ridac-spw.md).
-   Strategic Planning: Create and manage RIDAC items for all planning item types \(projects, demands, epics, capabilities, features, and custom planning items\), goals, and EAP iterations. You also gain access to AI-generated RIDAC capabilities and expanded governance controls.
