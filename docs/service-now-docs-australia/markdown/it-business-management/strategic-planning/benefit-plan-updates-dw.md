# Benefit plan updates and recalculation in demand currency

Updating the entered currency, entered benefit, offset type, or fiscal period of a benefit plan updates all related amount fields in the benefit plan and its breakdowns. The amounts in the related demand fields are recalculated and reflected in demand currency.

## Entered currency, Entered benefit, and Recurring field changes

When you modify these fields in the Benefit Plan form with multicurrency view enabled, the following values are recalculated:

-   **Total planned cost** in demand currency.
-   **Benefit in demand currency** in the Benefit Plan Breakdown.
-   **Financial benefit in demand currency** field in the demand.

## Offset type changes

When you change the offset type \(start date or end date\) and specify the offset period and duration in the Benefit Plan form, the following values are recalculated:

-   **Total planned benefit** and **Benefit in demand currency** of the benefit plan. Benefit Plan Breakdown records can be added or removed.
-   If the **Recurring** check box isn’t selected, the **Benefit in demand currency** value of each Benefit Plan Breakdown record is recalculated.
-   **Financial benefit in demand currency** field in the demand.

## Fiscal period changes

When you change the fiscal period \(start date or end date\) in the Benefit Plan form, the following values are recalculated:

-   **Benefit in demand currency** and **Total planned benefit** of the benefit plan. Benefit Plan Breakdown records can be added or removed.
-   If the **Recurring** check box isn't selected, the **Benefit in demand currency** of each Benefit Plan Breakdown record is recalculated.
-   **Financial benefit in demand currency** field in the demand.

## Benefit plan breakdown changes

When you change the entered benefit in an individual Benefit Plan Breakdown record, the following values are recalculated:

-   **Benefit in demand currency** of the benefit plan.
-   **Financial benefit in demand currency** field in the demand.
