# Demand workflow

The demand workflow defines the stages a demand moves through, from initial intake to assessment, approval, and execution. At each stage, you can evaluate the demand, align it with business objectives, and set up the right processes before resources are assigned.

## Workflow overview

The following table lists the end-to-end life cycle for managing demands. This workflow provides a process for demands so they are progressively refined, validated, and aligned with business and strategic objectives.

**Note:** This workflow describes the traditional demand management process. You can customize the states and activities by defining a custom playbook.
