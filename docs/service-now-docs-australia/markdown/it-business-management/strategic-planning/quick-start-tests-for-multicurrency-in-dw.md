# Quick start tests for multicurrency in Next Experience for Demand Management

Quick tests enable you to validate that the multicurrency feature in Next Experience for Demand Management works correctly after configuration changes such as applying an upgrade or developing an application.

**Danger**

By default, the system property that is used to run automated tests is turned off to prevent you from accidentally running these tests on a production system. To avoid data corruption or an outage, run tests only on development, test, and other non-production instances. See [Enable or disable executing Automated Test Framework tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/atf-enable-tests.md).

To use demand currency quick start tests, the PPM Standard Multicurrency – ATF Tests plugin \(com.snc.ppm\_multicurrency.atf\) must have been activated.

For information about copying and then customizing quick start tests, see [Quick start tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/quick-start-tests.md).
