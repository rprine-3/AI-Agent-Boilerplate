4.  On the Share Dashboard window, fill the details.

        You can also select a role to grant dashboard access to all users assigned that role.

    2.  Select **Allow recipients to add, edit, or delete sharing permissions associated with this dashboard** to enable users to grant access to new users and modify or remove existing permissions.

    3.  Select **Add as viewer** or **Add as editor** as required.

        **Note:** You can select **Add as editor** only if you have the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role assigned to you.

        The selected users, groups, and roles appear under **Manage Access**.

        You can also manage sharing permissions by selecting a user, group, or role and enabling the **Can share** option.

    4.  Select **Confirm**.
