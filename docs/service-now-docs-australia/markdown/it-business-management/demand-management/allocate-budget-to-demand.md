# Allocate budget to a demand

Set the budget of a demand according to the fiscal years.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_portfolio\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **All** and open the demand form.

2.  In the related links, select **Demand Budget**.

    The **Demand Budget** dialog box opens.

3.  Select the fiscal year for which you want to set the budget for the demand.

    **Tip:** You can work on allocating lean budgets at the fiscal period level using the Investment Budget. For more information, see [Enable lean budgeting for demands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/config-investment-budget-demand.md).

4.  Enter the amounts for **Capex Budget** and **Opex Budget**.

    The **Total Budget** is updated with the sum of capex and opex amounts.

5.  Select **OK**.

    **Note:**

    -   If the demand doesn’t have a cost plan, start date, and due date, the demand budget is distributed from the current month. Distribution continues until the end of the demand budget fiscal year.
    -   If the demand doesn’t have a cost plan and a due date but has a start date, then the demand budget is distributed from either:
        -   Start date \(if the start date falls in the given budget fiscal year\) until the end of the demand budget fiscal year.
        -   Start of the demand budget fiscal year until the end of the demand budget fiscal year.
    -   If the demand doesn’t have a cost plan and a start date but has a due date, then the demand budget is distributed from either:
        -   Current month until due date \(if the due date falls in the given budget fiscal year\).
        -   Current month until the end of demand budget fiscal year.
    If the demand has a cost plan associated, then demand budget is distributed by honoring the cost plan fiscal periods.


## Result

The demand budget for the selected year appears in the **Demand Budget** related list. You can select the amounts in the list to revise them.
