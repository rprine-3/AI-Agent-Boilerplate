# Reset a demand to Draft state

A demand can be moved back to the Draft state, if necessary.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_demand\_manager

## About this task

A demand can be reset to Draft from the Completed, Approved, Screening, or Submitted states. This option is unavailable after an artifact such as a project or enhancement is created, or if the demand is in the Qualified state.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the required demand form.

3.  Select **Reset to Draft**.

    A confirmation message appears if there are:

    -   Active assessments pending with stakeholders, or
    -   Resource assignments are created for the demand
4.  Select the check box to replan the allocated resource plans that have no actual hours reported.

5.  Select **OK**.


## Result

-   The demand is moved to the Draft state.
-   All the score values in **Assessment Data** tab are reset to default.
-   All active assessments for the demand are canceled. New assessments are triggered when the demand moves to the Screening state and if the **Assessment Required** field on the demand form is set to true.
