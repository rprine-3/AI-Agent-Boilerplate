**Manage demands using the functional currency**

Select the **Follow functional currency** option to manage your demands using the functional currency of your organization. The project currency is carried over to the Project form when you create a project from the demand in the future. ​You can change the project currency for managing your projects later.For example, if the functional currency of your organization is USD, then USD is set as the currency for both demands and projects.

Select the **Drive project currency** option to manage your demands and projects using the same currency. This currency can be your functional currency or any other currency. For example, to manage your demand and project in GBP, select this option and specify GBP as your demand currency. The **Project Currency** field in the demand form is automatically populated with GBP on saving the form.
