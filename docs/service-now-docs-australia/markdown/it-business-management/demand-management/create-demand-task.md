# Create a demand task

Create tasks for a demand to delegate cost, effort, risk, and benefit assessment activities. Assign a resource or group to the demand task to track the actual time and effort spent on performing the specified activities.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_demand\_manager

## About this task

You create demand tasks to plan the work for demands rather than for the target work entity such as a project, change, defect, or enhancement. For more information, see [Demand tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/demand-task.md).

-   Planned dates, actual dates, and original dates are part of project tasks not demand tasks.
-   The due date indicates the date on which the task is targeted for completion and doesn't affect the demand workflow. Project tasks, however, affect the project completion dates if the planned dates and actual dates are changed.
-   Don't support the creation of nested demand tasks.
-   Don't support task constraints such as the settings Start ASAP and Start on a specific date.
-   Don't support an execution type such as Agile, Waterfall, or Hybrid.
-   You assign resources for a demand task use the **Assigned to** field, **Additional Assignee** list, and **Assignment Group** fields.

Resources assigned to a demand task can submit the time spent on it using a time card.

If the PPM Standard Multicurrency \(com.snc.ppm\_multicurrency\) plugin is activated and the Demand Currency view is enabled, additional fields become available beyond the Default view. For more information about fields available only in the Demand Currency view, see [Multicurrency in Demand Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/multicurrency-demand.md) and [Multicurrency fields in demand-related forms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/multicurrency-fields-demand.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select the demand to which you want to add tasks.

3.  Add or edit a demand task from the **Demand Tasks** related list:

    -   To add a demand task, select **New**.
    -   To update the details of an existing demand task, select the record and then select **Edit**.
4.  On the Demand Task form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field names, see [Demand task form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/demand-task-form.md).

5.  Select **Save**.

    After completing your work on the demand task, select **Update** to return to the demand page.
