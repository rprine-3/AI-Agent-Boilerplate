# Create a non-monetary benefit plan for a demand

Create a non-monetary benefit plan to specify the estimated benefit in a category for a fiscal period. Demand benefit plans capture the potential non-financial benefits accrued by the demand when the demand is executed.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_demand\_manager

## About this task

The non-monetary benefit plan breakdown records are automatically created when you save the benefit plan by selecting **Automatic** or **Manual** in the **Breakdown Type** field. The non-monetary benefit plan breakdown records specify the estimated and actual non-financial benefits at a granular level for specific fiscal periods, such as FY16: M04 and FY16: M05. The Non-monetary Benefit Plan Breakdowns related list shows the aggregated benefits for estimated and actual non-financial benefits for each fiscal period for the demand.

**Note:** Converting a demand to a project or EAP entity transfers the benefit plans from the demand to the target project or EAP entity.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the required demand form.

3.  Select the Non-Monetary Benefit Plans related list.

4.  To create a non-monetary benefit plan, select **New**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field names, see [Non-monetary Benefit Plan form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/non-monetary-benefit-plan-form.md).

    **Note:** When you move the demand dates, the associated benefit plans also change accordingly based on whether the benefit plan is tied to the demand start date, or end date. The [project property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-management/r_InstalledWithProjectManagement.md) **Change Resource Plan, Cost Plan and Benefit Plan Start Date with Demand or Project Start Date Change** controls the behavior for demand date changes.

6.  Select **Submit**.


## What to do next

-   On the Benefit Plan form, view the benefit breakdown by fiscal period in the Non-monetary Benefit Plan Breakdowns related list.
-   [Associate monetary and non-monetary benefit plans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/associate-monetary-and-non-monetary-benefit-plans.md), so that you can capture the potential benefits \(financial and non-financial\) accrued by the demand for the hybrid benefit plans.

-   **[Update a non-monetary benefit plan breakdown for a demand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/update-a-non-monetary-benefit-plan-breakdown-for-a-demand.md)**
