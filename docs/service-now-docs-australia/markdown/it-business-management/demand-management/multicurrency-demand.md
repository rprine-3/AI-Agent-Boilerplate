# Multicurrency in Demand Management

The multicurrency feature tracks demand financials in the corporate currency, regional currency, or the project currency. Corporate policy typically governs this preference.

**Important:**

Demands are available in the Next Experience for Demand Management. For more information, see [Next Experience for Demand Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/demand-workspace-ppw.md).

The workspace provides additional value beyond the legacy experience, including Playbook, Docs, and the ability to define different governance processes using playbooks.

If you have Portfolio Planning Workspace or Strategic Planning Workspace, you can use the Next Experience for Demand Management to create and manage your demands.

-   New customers: Use Next Experience for Demand Management to create and manage your demands.
-   Existing customers: If you already have demands in the classic UI, you can continue using it. However, we recommend moving to the Next Experience for Demand Management, as your existing demands are automatically available there.

In global or multinational organizations, demands are often managed and tracked at one geographic location and executed at a different geographic location. As each location might use a different currency to spend the budget, this difference in geographic location makes it difficult to monitor and track financials for such demands.

The multicurrency feature in Demand Management enables you to manage and track demands from any geographic location in any currency. Monitor financials in one currency while spending the budget in another, such as the functional currency or regional currency. You can also manage demands in one currency and specify a different currency for future projects.

## Activation information

Activate the PPM Standard Multicurrency \(com.snc.ppm\_multicurrency\) plugin to enable the multicurrency features in Demand Management. Activating the plugin enables the demand currency view in demand, cost plans, and benefit plans forms. With the demand currency view, you can manage your simple demand financials, cost plans, benefit plans, and budgets in the demand currency.

**Note:** Activating this plugin automatically activates the PPM Standard \(com.snc.financial\_planning\_pmo\) plugin and therefore you get the option to switch between the default view and the demand currency view.

## Currency Preferences

After activating the multicurrency plugin, specify your currency preference for managing your demand financials. You can select your functional currency, a regional currency, or a local currency. For more information, see [Select demand currency preference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/select-demand-currency.md).

## Demand currency view

In addition to the default view in the Demand form, the Demand Currency view enables you to view the multicurrency fields. You can enable this view from the form context menu.

You can designate a currency other than the functional currency as the processing Demand Currency for a demand. The **Financials** tab of the Demand form has the **Demand currency** field. You can select an active currency from the Currencies \[fx\_currency\] table.

**Note:**

The **Demand currency** field of a demand becomes read only once you create a cost plan, cost plan breakdown, benefit plan, or benefit plan breakdown for the demand.

## Multicurrency in Demand Tasks

Track the expenses incurred while performing the demand tasks in demand currency. After a demand task time card is submitted and processed, the actual cost is calculated. The calculation uses the rate model, the default labor rate, or the rate defined in the system property. View this actual cost in the Demand Task form in the **Demand currency** and **Actual cost in demand currency** fields. For more information, see [Demand tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/demand-task.md).

## Multicurrency in Demand Baseline

Compare the financial baselines of your demands to track the performance of a demand over time. Baseline comparison enables you to identify and review the financial changes made to the demand at various stages of the demand life cycle. With the multicurrency feature, you can view the financial information in the demand currency when you compare the baselines. You can also configure the baseline view to add additional fields and view details in demand currency. For more information, see [Compare financial baselines of a demand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/compare-baselines-of-demand.md).
