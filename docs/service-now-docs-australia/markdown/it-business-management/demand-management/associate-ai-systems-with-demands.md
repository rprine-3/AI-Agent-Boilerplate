# Associate AI systems with demands

Add and manage AI system associations directly from the **AI Associations** tab in Demand Management.

## Before you begin

-   The AI Control Tower plugin must be installed. For more information, see [Activation and installation of AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activation-and-installation-of-ai-control-tower.md).
-   The investment type of the demand is set to artificial intelligence.
-   Role required: it\_demand\_user, it\_demand\_manager

## About this task

Add and manage AI system associations directly from the AI Associations tab in a demand form.

You can select the impacted AI systems for the demand. If the required AI systems aren’t available, you can create AI systems using the **Create AI System** related link directly within the demand workflow. You’re navigated to the AI Control Tower to create the AI system. The created AI system is then available for selection in the **Impacted AI Systems** list on the demand form.

## Procedure

1.  Access the demand form in one of the following ways.

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **Create New**.
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **All** and select a demand.
2.  Navigate to the **AI Associations** section of the demand form and fill in the fields.\[Omitted image "ai-associations-classic-dmn.png"\] Alt text: AI Associations tab in a demand form.

3.  Save the demand by selecting **Save**.

4.  Select the **Create AI System** related link to create an AI system in the AI Control Tower.
