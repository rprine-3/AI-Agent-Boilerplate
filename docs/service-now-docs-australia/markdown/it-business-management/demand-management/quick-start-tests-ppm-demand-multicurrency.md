# Quick start tests for Multicurrency in Demand Management

Validate that the multicurrency in Demand Management still works after you make any configuration change such as applying an upgrade or developing an application. Copy and customize these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

**Danger**

By default, the system property that is used to run automated tests is turned off to prevent you from accidentally running these tests on a production system. To avoid data corruption or an outage, run tests only on development, test, and other non-production instances. See [Enable or disable executing Automated Test Framework tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/atf-enable-tests.md).

Demand currency quick start tests require activating the PPM Standard Multicurrency – ATF Tests plugin \(com.snc.ppm\_multicurrency.atf\).
