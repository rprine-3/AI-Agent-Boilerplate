# Demand workbench bubble chart

The interactive bubble chart on the demand workbench is a dynamically updated graph that plots metrics for multiple demand records.

Demand managers can use bubble charts to visualize, compare, and evaluate the relative standing of demands in three categories: risk, value, and size. The X-axis represents the risk of a demand, the Y-axis represents the value, and the Z-axis represents the size. Demands are plotted as circles, or bubbles, which vary in size according to the size of the demand. All three measurements are based on values between 0 through 10. This scale enables demand managers to see how one demand compares to other demands in the chart.

The bubble chart contains four quadrants, with each quadrant representing the value versus risk tradeoff for the demand. The quadrants are labeled along the edges of the bubble chart to represent this combination of value versus risk. The color of the bubbles displayed in each quadrant also represents the value versus risk tradeoff.

-   The upper left quadrant, labeled **Resource**, contains demands with high value and low risk. Green bubbles represent demands in this quadrant.
-   The lower left and upper right quadrants, labeled **Consider**, contain demands that require further evaluation. The lower left quadrant contains demands with low risk but low value while the upper right quadrant contains demands with high value but high risk. Orange bubbles represent demands in these quadrants.
-   The lower right quadrant, labeled **Re-evaluate**, contains demands with low value and high risk. Red bubbles represent demands in this quadrant.

Each bubble also includes a label with the name of the demand.

From the demand workbench bubble chart, you can perform the following actions:

-   Hover over a bubble to [view a summary of the demand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/t_ViewADemandSummary.md), including the demand name and the risk, value, and size.
-   Select a bubble to open a sizing window and [change the size of the demand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/t_MoveAndResizeADemand.md).
-   Select and drag a bubble to increase or decrease the risk or value of the demand.
-   Right-click a bubble to view the demand, [create an artifact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/t_CrtArtftDmdMnu.md), or [view an artifact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/t_ViewAnArtifactCreatedFromADemand.md) that has been created from a demand.

    **Note:** If Agile Development 2.0 isn’t activated, you won’t find the options to create an enhancement or a defect


Changes made to a demand in the bubble chart are automatically updated in the demand record.
