# Create a demand cost plan

Demand cost plans capture the costs of demands. Create a cost plan to specify the unit cost of a cost type for a fiscal period.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_demand\_manager

## About this task

The application automatically creates cost plan breakdown records when you save the cost plan. The cost plan breakdowns are records that specify the estimated and actual costs and the budget at a granular level for specific fiscal periods, such as FY16: M04 and FY16: M05. The demand cost plans are added to the parent program and portfolio.

Cost plan breakdowns for each fiscal period are recalculated in the project currency. This recalculation applies to estimated and actual costs in the demand cost plan, and to estimated and actual benefit amounts in the demand benefit plans. The project currency amounts roll up to the cost plan, benefit plan, and project records.

If you want to use multiple currencies, create a cost plan for another currency.

If the PPM Standard Multicurrency \(com.snc.ppm\_multicurrency\) plugin is activated and the Demand Currency view is enabled, the **Financials** section fields differ from the Default view. For fields available only in the Demand Currency view, see [Multicurrency fields in demand-related forms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/multicurrency-fields-demand.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **All** and open the required demand form.

2.  In the related links, select **Cost Plans**.

3.  To view the Financials Summary page in a grid, select **Manage**.

4.  Add or edit a cost plan from the Cost Plans related list:

    -   To add a cost plan, select **New**.
    -   To update the details of an existing cost plan, select the record and then select **Manage**.
5.  In the cost plan form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field names, see [Cost plan form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/demand-plan-form.md).

    **Note:** When you change the planned start date of a demand, the associated cost plans and resource assignments also change. The [project property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-management/r_InstalledWithProjectManagement.md) **Change Resource Plan and Cost Plan Start Date with Demand or Project Start Date Change** controls the behavior for demand date change.

6.  Select **Submit**.


## What to do next

-   On the Demand form, view the breakdowns by fiscal period in the **Cost Breakdown** related list.
-   To recalculate the value in the **Forecast** field, use the **Calculate Forecast Amount** related link.
