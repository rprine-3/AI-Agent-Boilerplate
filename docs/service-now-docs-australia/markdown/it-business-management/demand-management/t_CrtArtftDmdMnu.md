# Create an artifact from a demand

Create an artifact, such as a work item, from a demand so that you can track work on the demand.

## Before you begin

A demand must have been created. For more information, see [Create a demand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/t_CreatingDemands.md).

The category and type of a demand and the applications you have installed determine the artifact you can create from it. The available artifact types and the applications you must have installed to be able to create them are listed in the following table.

|Artifact|Required application|
|--------|--------------------|
|Enhancement, change, or defect|[Project Portfolio Suite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/ppm-collaboration/c_ProjectPortfolioSuite.md)|
|Agile Development entities \(story or epic\)|[Agile Development 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/agile-development/agile-landing-page.md)|
|Scaled Agile Framework \(SAFe\)SAFe entities \(story, feature, or epic\)|[Essential SAFe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scaled-agile-framework-safe/essential-overview.md) or [Portfolio SAFe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scaled-agile-framework-safe/portfolio-overview.md)|
|Enterprise Agile Planning \(EAP\) entities \(epic, feature, or capability\)|[Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/strategic-planning/alignment-planner-workspace-landing-page.md)|
|Improvement initiatives|[Continual Improvement Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/cim-landing-page.md)|

Role required: it\_demand\_manager

**Note:**

-   The sn\_apw\_advanced.eap\_user role is required to convert a demand to EAP entities.
-   The safe\_art\_user role is required to create a SAFe story.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Demand** &gt; **Demands** &gt; **All**.

2.  Open the demand for which you want to create an artifact.

3.  Verify that the values in the **Category** and **Type** fields are appropriate for the artifact you want to create.

    The options in the Type list change according to the category that you select. For more information, see [Demand form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/demand-management/demand-form.md).

    **Note:** The **Category** and **Type** fields are set to read only when an artifact is created from a demand. If you delete the created artifact, these fields become editable again.

4.  Select **Update**.

5.  Create the artifact by selecting the appropriate related link.

    Depending on the category and type of the demand, links related to the artifact you can create become available.
