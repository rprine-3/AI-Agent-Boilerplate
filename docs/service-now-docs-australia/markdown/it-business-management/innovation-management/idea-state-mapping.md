# Idea state mapping

Map your idea states to the Universal Request states to provide a better user experience during the idea state transition and to track the progress of the idea.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Mapping the states of the idea to the universal request state ensures that the status of idea is also reflected on the state of universal request. As the idea moves through different stages of the life cycle, the state of the universal request also gets updated to reflect the change.

For example, consider a universal request that has an idea attached to it as a primary ticket. When the state of idea changes from **Submitted** to **Need more information**, the state of the universal ticket state is also updated to **Awaiting Response**.

The following image is an example of a default state mapping. The **Submitted**, **Under Review**, **In Backlog**, **Planned** and **In Development** states of an idea are mapped to **In Progress** state of a Universal Request.

The following table lists the default mapping of different idea states with the universal request states.

|Idea state|Universal Request state|
|----------|-----------------------|
|Submitted|In Progress|
|Under Review|In Progress|
|In Backlog|In Progress|
|Planned|In Progress|
|In Development|In Progress|
|Unlikely to implement|Closed|
|Duplicate|Closed|
|Already exists|Closed|
|Completed|Closed|
