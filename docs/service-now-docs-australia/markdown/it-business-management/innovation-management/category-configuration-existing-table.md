# Configure idea categories

Map an idea category table with an Idea module to specify the category options listed on the Idea Portal and the create an idea form.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: idea\_admin
-   Identify the Idea module and idea category table that you want to use.

Use your existing product or department table to define dynamic idea categories. The dynamic categories are derived from specific columns and fields of the parent table.

**Note:** You can map only one category table with an Idea module.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Ideas** &gt; **Idea Category Config** &gt; **New**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For more information, see [Idea Category Configuration form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/innovation-management/idea-category-configurations-form.md).

3.  Create filter conditions to determine the idea categories to be listed on the Idea Portal.

4.  Select **Submit**.
