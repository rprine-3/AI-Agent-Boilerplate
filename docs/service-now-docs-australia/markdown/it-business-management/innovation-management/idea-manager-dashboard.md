# Analyzing idea metrics using Idea Manager dashboard

Review, analyze, and manage your ideas effectively by using the Idea Dashboard manager.

The Idea Manager dashboard provides summary of idea metrics and trends such as ideas in different states, age of ideas, categories, and ideas converted to different work entities.

**Note:** Starting with version 2.0.0, the Idea Manager dashboard is available in the Next experience UI Framework which can be accessed from Analytics Idea Manager. The Ideas pane in **Analysis** tab is not supported in the Next experience.

## Idea Manager dashboard in Next experience UI

The Idea Manager dashboard provides comprehensive reports to the idea manager and users with read-only roles for ppm \(sn\_ppm\_read\). The dashboard uses Performance Analytics to provide a trend of historical data as well as regular reports. It provides you an overview of ideas, number of ideas converted into work entities, and trends based on categories, idea submitters, and votes. It helps you to review and analyze ideas and enables you to take required actions for managing your ideas effectively.

For example, to view individual records of Open ideas in the Idea Portal, click the **Open ideas** indicator value to open the Analytics Hub. In the Analytics Hub, click **Show Records** to view the list of open ideas, open an idea in the form view, and then click the **Idea Portal** related link to view the idea record in the Idea Portal.
