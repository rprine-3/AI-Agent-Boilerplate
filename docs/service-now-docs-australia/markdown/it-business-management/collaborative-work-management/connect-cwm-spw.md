# Connecting CWM with Strategic Planning or Portfolio Planning

Configure Strategic Planning or Portfolio Planning to include CWM Boards so that you can plan, roadmap, and associate goals to Boards in a portfolio plan.

By adding CWM Boards to a lens configuration, you can access them in the Prioritization, Roadmap, and Goals pages of a portfolio plan as planning items.

**Note:** This functionality requires installing the Strategic Planning or Portfolio Planning application from ServiceNow Store.

To successfully enable planning with CWM Boards in Strategic Planning or Portfolio Planning, complete the following tasks.

## Add CWM Boards to lens configuration

For the lens that you want to use to build portfolio plans, update the configuration to include CWM Board as a planning item in Strategic Planning or Portfolio Planning.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

Ensure that the Application scope of your instance is set to **Portfolio Planning Core**.

### About this task

All default lenses support CWM Board as a planning item. For example, if you are building portfolio plans using Organization lens, then you can add CWM Board as a planning item in the Organization lens configuration.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Strategic Planning** &gt; **Lenses**.

2.  Select a lens.

3.  From the Available list of planning items, move **CWM Board** to the Selected list.

    **Note:** If you don't see CWM Board in the Available list, update the system property **sn\_align\_core.planning\_item\_types\_allow\_list** to allow it.

4.  Select**Update**.

## Configure CWM Board form layout

Add the lens entity field to the CWM Board form. This lets users link Boards and have them appear in the right portfolio plan in Strategic Planning or Portfolio Planning workspaces.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

Ensure that the Application scope of your instance is set to **Collaborative Work Management**.

### About this task

Include the field for your lens entity in the CWM Board form. This allows CWM users to link their Boards to the lens entity so that the Boards appear in the corresponding portfolio plan. For example, using the project Portfolio lens, you could create a portfolio plan for the Technology portfolio. When CWM users associate their Boards with the Technology portfolio, those Boards will automatically show up in the Technology portfolio's portfolio plan.

Similarly, you can associate Boards to goals or portfolios. To ensure that your CWM users can perform this association, configure the Board form to include these fields.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Tables**.

2.  From the list of tables, search for and select **sn\_cwm\_board**.

3.  From the Related Links section, select **Layout Form**.

4.  From the list of fields in the Available section, move your desired field to the Selected section.

    For example, move the **Portfolio** field to the Selected section.

5.  Repeat this step for other fields that you want to add to the CWM Board form.

6.  Select **Save**.


### Result

The CWM Board form now shows the new fields added to its layout.

Your CWM users can add details of their departments, portfolios, or primary goals depending on the portfolio plans they want these Boards to show up in.
