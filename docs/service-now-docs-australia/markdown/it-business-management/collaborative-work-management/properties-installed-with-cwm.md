# Properties installed with Collaborative Work Management

System properties that you can configure to include other ServiceNow AI Platform records in CWM Docs and modify the way non-CWM users request access to the workspace.

These properties are available for Collaborative Work Management.

**Note:** To open the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_cwm.request\_role\_access

</td><td>

Property to show or hide the **Request Access** button for non-CWM users in the workspace.By default, the button is hidden. When this property is set to true, an event **sn\_cwm.REQUEST\_ROLE\_ACCESS** is raised. Admins can configure this event to trigger one of the following workflows, allowing the non-CWM user to request access to the workspace.

-   Raising a Service Catalog request.
-   Sending an email.

-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false
-   Location: System Property \[sys\_properties\] table
-   Role needed: sn\_cwm.cwm\_admin

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_cwm.record\_mention\_config

</td><td>

Property to configure mentioning any ServiceNow AI Platform record within Docs pages of CWM workspace.

 -   Type: string
-   Default value: `[{"sourceTable":"sn_cwm_task","label":"CWM Task","fields":["short_description","number"]}]`

By default, this property is configured to include CWM task records.

-   Location: System Property \[sys\_properties\] table
-   Role needed: sn\_cwm.cwm\_admin

 To include any other ServiceNow AI Platform record, update the property.

 For example, to reference the Incident records in the Docs pages, update the **Value** field of this property to include the Incident table.

 The updated **Value** field would include the configuration for CWM task records and Incident records:

```
[{"sourceTable":"sn_cwm_task","label":"CWM Task","fields":["short_description","number"]},
{"sourceTable":"incident","label":"Incident","fields":["short_description","number"]}]
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_cwm.include\_additional\_assignee

</td><td>

Property to display tasks assigned to the user in My Work, when the user is added to the **Additional assignee** field.By default, My Work displays only tasks where the user is listed in the **Assigned to** field. When this property is set to true, it includes all tasks assigned to the user through either the **Assigned to** field or the **Additional assignee** field.

-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false
-   Location: System Property \[sys\_properties\] table
-   Role needed: sn\_cwm.cwm\_admin

</td><td>

Property to enforce field-level access control on native CWM tables when data is loaded on a Board. The property applies to the `sn_cwm_task`, `rm_story`, and `rm_scrum_task` tables.

 When set to true, per-row field write access is evaluated for each work item on a Board, based on the accessibility configured for the fields for that user.

 When set to false, the cells on the CWM Board still appear editable, but edits to read-only fields are not saved.
