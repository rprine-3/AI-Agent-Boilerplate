# Add custom columns for tasks in a CWM Board

Create custom fields in a Board so that you can organize all details of tasks at a single location. This improves task management and saves time by reducing dependency on system admin.

## Before you begin

[Create a Board in CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/create-boards-in-cwm.md).

Role required: sn\_cwm.cwm\_user

You need to have either Editor or Owner access to the Space to add a custom column.

## About this task

**Note:** This procedure provides general instructions involved in creating custom column types for CWM Boards. To learn how to create a Formula type column, see [Add a formula column in CWM Boards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/add-formula-column-cwm-boards.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Collaborative Work Management**.

2.  From a Space, select a Board that you want to add tasks to.

3.  In the List view of the Board, select **Add column** from the column header and select a data type.

4.  In the **Field name** field, enter the name for this new column and other details, if asked.

    -   If you select the type as **Label** or **Dropdown**, you're prompted to enter the options for this field.
    -   If you select **People**, you're prompted to select the type of users available for this field. Also, choose to allow input of single or multiple users in this field.
    -   If you select **Reference**, you're prompted to select a table that you want to add as reference to the tasks.
5.  Select **Add column**.


## Result

The new column is added to the task and you can start entering the values for this column.

**Note:** Custom columns added for a task are local to the Board that they're created in and are not applicable to other Boards and Spaces in the workspace.

If you have the Owner access for this Space, you can delete any custom columns based on your changing requirements.
