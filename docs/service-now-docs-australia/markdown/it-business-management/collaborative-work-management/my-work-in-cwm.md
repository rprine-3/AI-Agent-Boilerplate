# My Work in CWM

Manage your work from all ServiceNow applications from a centralized view in the Collaborative Work Management workspace.

My Work provides a centralized view of all your assigned tasks, including project tasks, problems, and incidents. It also offers visualizations that group items by state, priority, and status, such as open or overdue.

Work items from all ServiceNow applications assigned to you’re displayed in My Work. If you receive a work item on the CWM Board via Connected Work, those items appear here as well. This ensures you have a single source for all assigned work without the need to switch between applications.

Project tasks from Project Workspace also appear in My Work when they are assigned to you directly or through a group. For details on the assignment paths that surface project tasks, see [View project tasks assigned to you in CWM My Work](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/view-project-tasks-in-cwm-my-work.md).

**Note:**

-   Any task record created in a table that doesn’t extend the Task \[task\] table, such as VTask, won't show up in My Work.
-   If you’re added as **Additional assignee** to a task, work with your admin to enable the display of such tasks in My Work. See [Properties installed with CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/properties-installed-with-cwm.md).

The following are the filters available on My Work:

-   Task type filter displays a list of all task types that are assigned to you currently.
-   Date filter lets you select predefined or custom date ranges.
-   You can choose to include open items that don't have start or end dates.

My Work page has two views, Overview and List.

-   Overview tab shows multiple widgets that provide information related to the progress of your work. It also enables you to apply filters on the type of tasks that you want to view.
-   List tab shows all open work items assigned to you in a list or grid format, where you can apply the group by and filter options on the columns.

    List view also provides a link back to the source of the work item. For example, if your work item is a Risk, the Source column in the List view provides a navigation to the RIDAC page of the Project Workspace application.
