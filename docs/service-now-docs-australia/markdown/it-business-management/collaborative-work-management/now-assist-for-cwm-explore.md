## Skills

-   **[Generate scrum tasks for stories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/generate-scrum-tasks-for-stories-cwm.md)**

    Accelerate your sprint planning by using ServiceNow Otto to generate scrum tasks based on user story descriptions and acceptance criteria. Instead of manually creating each task, you receive a relevant set of scrum tasks as a starting point for further refinement.

    Generate scrum tasks from the story form or create them inline from the List or Sprint planning views. ServiceNow Otto analyzes the user story description and acceptance criteria to propose tasks that align with the required work. For stories that already have scrum tasks, ServiceNow Otto considers existing tasks when generating new ones to avoid duplication and maintain continuity.

    You can review and edit AI-generated tasks before adding them to your story. There is no limit on the number of tasks generated, giving you flexibility to capture all necessary work breakdown items. This capability reduces the time spent on repetitive task creation and helps teams establish a consistent starting point for sprint execution.

-   **[Create child tasks from CWM task types in List view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/generate-subtasks-for-cwm-tasks.md)**

    Break down a large and complex CWM task into smaller units of clear and assignable child tasks using AI. The parent task's short description and description are analyzed by AI to generate child tasks.

    Generate child tasks inline from the List view by hovering over the short description of a task to display the Generate Subtasks icon. Child tasks are added as a hierarchy under the parent task in the List view.

    \[Omitted image "generate-subtasks-cwm.png"\] Alt text: The Generate Subtasks option is available on hovering over the short description of a task.

-   **[Create CWM tasks or stories from files or open prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/generate-tasks-cwm-boards.md)**

    Turn an open prompt or an uploaded file into a batch of tasks for your Board, instead of creating each task individually. Describe the context for task generation, or attach a file such as meeting notes, brainstorming planning docs, or epic PRDs. The input is analyzed by AI and a list of tasks is proposed.

    \[Omitted image "cwm-generate-contextual-tasks.png"\] Alt text: Generate tasks using context or uploaded reference files.

    Review the proposed tasks, select the ones you want, and add them to your Board in one action.

    \[Omitted image "cwm-generate-contextual-tasks-review.png"\] Alt text: Review the generated tasks and select the ones you want to add to your board.

-   **[Generate formulas from natural language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/generate-formula-cwm-board-now-assist.md)**

    Create formula columns faster by describing your calculation in natural language and letting ServiceNow Otto generate the formula for you.

    Instead of manually building complex formulas, type what you want to calculate in the Formula Builder panel. For example, enter descriptions like `days between start date and end date` or `total estimated hours for all subtasks`. ServiceNow Otto analyzes your description and generates a valid formula using the available columns in your List view.

    Review the generated formula to verify that it matches your intent. Insert the formula into the editor with a single click, then make any adjustments if needed. This capability removes the need to memorize formula syntax, making calculated columns accessible to team members of all technical skill levels.

-   **[Generate acceptance criteria for stories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/generate-acceptance-criteria-for-stories-in-cwm.md)**

    As a product manager, generate clear, comprehensive, and testable acceptance criteria for your user stories, instead of spending hours writing and refining them manually.

    You can review and refine the suggested options to ensure they meet your story requirements without slowing down planning. By helping you streamline generating acceptance criteria as a process, this skill helps save time, improve quality, and speed up delivery with cleaner backlogs and better collaboration.

-   **[CWM Doc generation and insights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/generate-summarize-and-refine-content-of-docs-with-now-assist.md)**

    Generate content with ServiceNow Otto for CWM directly in your Docs using custom prompts. In addition, summarize existing sections, elaborate where needed, and refine drafts to help improve your productivity.

    You can interact with ServiceNow Otto directly in your Doc to create content, add context, or improve existing sections. This helps you draft faster, refine ideas, and keep your work relevant without leaving the page.

    -   **Work with content of the whole page**

        Some examples are:

        -   For Marketing teams: `Create a compelling product launch announcement highlighting the key benefits and emotional appeal for our target audience.`
        -   For Legal teams: `Write a plain-language summary of the privacy policy in this doc, that customers can easily understand.`
        -   For product teams: `Analyze the customer feedback comments in this Doc, group into top 5 themes, and suggest top 3 enhancements for highest impact.`
        ServiceNow Otto uses the context from your Doc page to generate a response.

    -   **Refine, elaborate, or improve the existing content within the page**

        Some examples are:

        -   If you have a list of stakeholders, you can ask `Elaborate on the scope of these roles.`
        -   `Rewrite this in a casual tone.`
        \[Omitted image "na-inline-open-text.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow Otto inline context menu over selected text with prompt 'Elaborate on the scope of these teams.'

    -   **Take assistance on a blank page**

        Some examples are:

        1.  `Generate 5 icebreaker questions for a virtual team-building session.`
        2.  `Write a 3-paragraph blog post explaining why [industry trend] is changing how businesses operate.`
        3.  `Generate an outline for the Instagram campaign tasks for a Hackathon initiative.`

            \[Omitted image "na-blank-page-nacm.png"\] Alt text: Blank CWM Doc page with the ServiceNow Otto prompt open in the toolbar. The example prompt reads 'Generate an outline for the Instagram campaign tasks for a Hackathon initiative.'

    -   **Answer questions in the context of this Doc**

        Whether the content in the Doc is added manually or generated using ServiceNow Otto, you can ask questions to find anything in the page's context.

        For example, if you have a project charter document, you can try asking `What is the total budget of this project and which part is the most expensive?`

        \[Omitted image "cwm-nacm-ask-questions.png"\] Alt text: Ask questions in the context of the document. Here, user asks questions on project budget, in the context of a Project Charter document.

-   **[Doc summarization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/summarize-doc-now-assist-cwm.md)**

    Gain insights into the contents of the page by summarizing it in CWM Docs. Whether you're reviewing long documents or preparing for meetings, Doc summarization skill helps you stay informed and efficient.

    With the Doc summarization skill, you can also elaborate and shorten content, resulting in improved content quality in the CWM Doc pages. Quickly shorten lengthy paragraphs, paraphrase bullet points, or expand on key points ensuring that your content is tailored to specific needs.

    \[Omitted image "cwm-na-doc-summarization.png"\] Alt text: CWM Doc page titled 'Phases and milestones' with the ServiceNow Otto panel showing an AI-generated summary of the document's key milestones.

-   **[Generate CWM Tasks from Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/generate-tasks-cwm-docs-now-assist.md)**

    Creating tasks with detailed descriptions for your CWM Board requires significant time and manual effort. If the tasks aren’t detailed enough, it can lead to confusion and misalignment within the team, affecting their understanding of the expected outcomes. To avoid this manual effort and improve time to value, ServiceNow Otto can generate tasks for your Board using the information in your Docs. This way, you can ensure clear and comprehensive task descriptions, allowing you to focus more on execution and less on the administrative work.

    Based on the recommendations, you can ask ServiceNow Otto to perform one of the following:

    -   Generate task according to its original recommendations.
    -   Split a task recommendation into multiple tasks.
    -   Combine multiple task recommendations into one task.
    -   Remove any task recommendation.

    Thus, by using the Task generation skill within CWM, you can:

    -   Remove initial roadblocks to create tasks for a CWM Board.
    -   Save time and increase productivity by automating the task creation process.
