# Dashboard, List, Gantt, and Kanban views in CWM

Switch between Dashboard, List, Gantt, and Kanban views to manage and visualize work on a CWM Board in the way that best fits your team's workflow.

Each CWM Board supports four views: Dashboard, List, Gantt, and Kanban. You can switch between views at any time without losing data. The Dashboard view displays widgets that summarize Board data. List, Gantt, and Kanban views can each be personalized to show the columns and attributes most relevant to your team. For more information, see [Personalize List, Gantt and Kanban display for CWM Boards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/personalize-cwm-board-views.md).

## Dashboard view

The Dashboard view displays widgets that give teams an at-a-glance summary of task progress, priorities, and assignments for the Board. The Dashboard tab is enabled by default for new and existing Boards.

Each Board can have multiple dashboards. Use the dashboard selector in the dashboard header to switch between them. The selector shows the name of the currently selected dashboard and lists the shared dashboards available on the Board.

-   **Relationship between dashboards and Board views**
    -   The only Dashboard-related setting saved to a Board view is whether the Dashboard tab is shown or hidden. For more information, see [Personalize List, Gantt and Kanban display for CWM Boards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/personalize-cwm-board-views.md).
    -   Changes you make within a dashboard, such as adding widgets, are saved to the dashboard, not to the Board view.
    -   All Board views, shared and private, display the same dashboard data, unless a specific view has the Dashboard tab turned off.

For more information about working with dashboards and widgets, see [Monitor and track work using dashboards in CWM Boards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/cwm-board-dashboards.md).

## List view

The List view displays all work items on a Board in a grid format. Use this view to review the status of work items at a glance, update fields inline, or assign items to team members quickly. The List view displays up to 1,000 work items by default.

## Gantt view

The Gantt view displays work items in a grid alongside a calendar timeline, making it easy to visualize schedules and reschedule items based on changing priorities. The Gantt view displays up to 1,000 work items by default.

## Kanban view

The Kanban view organizes work items into columns and rows based on attributes you choose, such as **State** and **Assigned to**. Vertical lanes represent one attribute and horizontal swimlanes represent another, giving teams a visual overview of work distribution and status. Each axis supports up to 50 lanes by default.

-   **Quick filters**

    Use quick filters to focus the Kanban board on a specific sprint, state, or other column attribute. Multiple filters can be active at the same time, and a counter at the top of the board shows the number of active filters. For example, use quick filters for sprint-specific information during daily standups or sprint reviews.

    You can save these filters to a Board view of your choice and when you save this Board as a template, these filters get saved in the template.

-   **Work item indicators on Kanban cards**

    Kanban cards display indicators that give teams at-a-glance visibility into scrum tasks and relationships associated with a work item, without opening the item.

    -   **Scrum task indicator:** Appears on a story card when the story has one or more scrum tasks. Selecting the indicator opens the right side panel showing the scrum tasks for that story. For more information, see [Scrum tasks for stories in CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/managing-scrum-tasks-for-stories-cwm.md).
    -   **Relationship indicator:** Appears on a work item card when the item has one or more linked relationships, such as a prerequisite, dependent, or related-to item. Selecting the indicator opens the right side panel showing the related work items and their relationship types. For more information, see [Task dependencies and relationships in CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/managing-task-dependencies-relationships-cwm.md).
-   **Formula column lanes**

    Use a Formula column as your vertical or horizontal lane to group tasks by the column's output values. Formula columns with conditional, string, or numeric outputs are supported.

    For example, consider a formula column named **Overdue?** that outputs Yes or No based on whether a task's due date has passed. Set this column as the vertical lane and Priority as the horizontal lane. The board then groups tasks by overdue status and priority, giving you a quick view of which critical tasks need attention.

-   **Kanban card layout options**

    Personalize Kanban cards to surface the information most relevant to your team using card layout settings. Select up to five fields to display on each card. Use the Compact layout to show only the work item name for a focused view. Use the Full layout to show all selected fields for more context directly on the card.

-   **Kanban view with Connected work**

    If the Board includes Connected work items, you can use vertical and horizontal lane combinations to group and filter them. For example:

    -   Set the vertical lane to **State** and the horizontal lane to **Task type** to view all epics grouped by state, then filter to show only epics.
    -   Set the vertical lane to **Sprint** and the horizontal lane to **Task type** to view connected stories grouped by sprint.

Show, hide, or rearrange columns and apply sorting or filters to personalize the way data is displayed in Collaborative Work Management Boards based on your workflow.
