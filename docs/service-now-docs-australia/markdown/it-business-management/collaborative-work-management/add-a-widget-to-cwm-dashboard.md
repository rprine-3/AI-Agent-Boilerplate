# Add widgets to a dashboard in Collaborative Work Management

Add predefined or custom widgets to an empty state or existing dashboard on a CWM Board to visualize task and sprint data.

## Before you begin

A dashboard is created. For more information, see [Create a dashboard for a CWM Board in Collaborative Work Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/creating-dashboards-in-cwm.md).

Role required: sn\_cwm.cwm\_user

## About this task

Space owners and editors can add or create widgets.

The Add widgets panel on an empty state dashboard changes to Manage widgets after at least one widget is added to it. For existing dashboards, the panel appears as Manage widgets and displays the **Included in this dashboard** section listing the widgets already on the dashboard. For information about dashboard panels, see [Monitor and track work using dashboards in CWM Boards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/cwm-board-dashboards.md).

For custom widgets, the columns common to CWM task types and other work item types show only the column name, for example **Assigned to**. Columns specific to a connected work type show the column name followed by the work item type in parentheses, for example **Caller \(Incident\)**. All custom columns are also available for widget configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Collaborative Work Management**.

2.  From a Space, select the Board where your dashboard is.

3.  Select the **Dashboard** tab.

4.  Select the dashboard from the Shared dashboards list.

5.  Select **Add widgets** for a new dashboard or **Manage widgets** for an existing dashboard.
