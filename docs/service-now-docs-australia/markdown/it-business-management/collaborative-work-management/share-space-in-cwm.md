# Share a Space in CWM and manage sharing permissions

Invite cross-team members to Collaborative Work Management Spaces to collaborate on tasks or projects. You can also manage permissions for users with existing access to your Space.

## Before you begin

[Create a Space in CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/create-spaces-in-cwm.md).

Role required: sn\_cwm.cwm\_user

## About this task

Sharing a Space with a user results in them gaining access to all Boards, Docs, and folders within that Space. Use the Share permissions modal from the Space or Board header to manage sharing permissions and access levels to your Space for your team.

**Note:** You can share a Space only with users within your organization. For more information about the two kinds of Spaces and organization-wide sharing, see [Collaborating with Spaces in CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/cwm-spaces.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Collaborative Work Management**.

2.  From the left side panel, select a Space.

    \[Omitted image "cwm-spaces-navigation.png"\] Alt text: Spaces menu in CWM.

3.  From the header of the Space, select **Share**.

    **My Space** is personal to you cannot be shared.

4.  Add new users to the Space.

    1.  In the **Members or Groups** field, enter the names of individual users or groups.

        You can search for users and groups by email along with their name so that you choose the right collaborator.

</table>    3.  Select **Share**.

5.  From the **People with Access** tab, manage permissions for existing users by changing their access level or removing a user from the Space.

    As the Owner or Editor of a Space, you can remove access for existing users of the Space or yourself at anytime. As a viewer, you can only remove access for yourself.

    \[Omitted image "cwm-remove-from-space.png"\] Alt text: Remove a user from a Space.

6.  From the **Pending Access** tab, you can review the list of users who have requested access to your Space and choose to grant or deny them the access.

    Before granting access to a user, you can modify their access level to Editor or View as necessary.

## Result

An email invite is sent to the users that you shared this Space with.
