# Install Retail Strategic Portfolio Management Suite

Install Retail Strategic Portfolio Management Suite from the ServiceNow to add retail workforce management capabilities to your instance. You need the admin role to complete this task.

## Before you begin

-   Install Project Workspace app \(sn\_pw\) from the ServiceNow® Store.
-   Install Business Location app \(app-business-location\) from the ServiceNow® Store.
-   Install Customer Service app \(app-csm-ppm\) from the ServiceNow® Store.
-   Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Retail Strategic Portfolio Management Suite application using the filter criteria and search bar.

    Alternatively, you can:

    -   Use the link to download the application, [https://store.servicenow.com/sn\_appstore\_store.do\#!/store/application/edaa84c493faf2107f0914cbe9373cfe/2.0.0](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/edaa84c493faf2107f0914cbe9373cfe/2.0.0)
    -   Search for the application by its name or ID \(sn\_spm\_retail\). If you can't find an application, you may have to request it from ServiceNow store.
3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    If your application requires other applications, install them first if they aren't already installed. Installing your application also automatically installs the dependent applications or plugins if they aren't installed already.

4.  If you want to install demo data, select **Load demo data**.

    Demo data includes sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.
