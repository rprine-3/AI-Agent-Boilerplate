# Define criteria of a rate model

Set the criteria of a rate model by adding attributes from a set of predefined entities to derive resource hourly rates based on the criteria.

## Before you begin

Role required: pps\_admin or it\_rate\_model\_admin

## About this task

A rate model consists of one or more rate lines. Each line contains a unique combination of criteria values and the hourly rate of a resource. Starting with March 2026 update, you can define the criteria to match with your resource assignment's primary attribute mapping. You define the criteria by adding up to 10 attributes from the following entities:

-   Demand
-   Group
-   Project
-   Project task
-   Resource
-   Resource Assignment
-   Resource plan
-   Role

You can select attributes of type String, Reference, Number, Boolean, and Choice.

## Procedure

1.  Open a rate model by performing one of the following actions:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Project Administration** &gt; **Rate Model** &gt; **All**.
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Time Sheets** &gt; **Rate Model** &gt; **All**.
2.  In the **Rate Model Attributes** related list, click **New**.
