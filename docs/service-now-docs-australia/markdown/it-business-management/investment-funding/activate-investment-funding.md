## Procedure

2.  Find the Investment Funding application using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID \(sn\_invst\_pln\_v2\). If you cannot find an application, you may have to request it from ServiceNow store. Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release note information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  Click **Install**.

4.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    If your application requires other applications, install them first if they are not already installed.

    Installing your application also automatically installs the dependent applications or plugins if they are not installed already.

5.  Click **Install**.
