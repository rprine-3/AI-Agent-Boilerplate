To add existing project to the program, click **Edit**.If you want to create parent-child relationships between projects to establish project hierarchies select the parent project in the **Parent** field.

**Tip:**

Use project hierarchies when large initiatives require multiple work streams. Parent project = program-level view; subprojects = tactical execution.
