# Create a program status report

Create a program status report periodically to view a status rollup of the projects in the program. When you create a status report, the status for different aspects of the program is rolled up from the project status reports of all projects.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the **Show on Program Status Report** option in the Project form for all the projects that you want to include in the status report is selected.

Role required: it\_program\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Project** &gt; **Programs** &gt; **All**.

2.  In the program list, open a program record.

3.  In the **Program Status Reports** related list, click **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:**

    Changing the status for any aspect in the Program Status Report form also updates the corresponding fields in the Program form.

5.  Select a different status color to override the rolled-up color for various aspects of the program or select **None** if you do not want the status of an aspect to appear in the program status report.

    Selecting **None** displays a grey X icon \(\[Omitted image "none\_icon.png"\] Alt text: None icon\) for that program aspect on the program status report.

    The override color that you set is not retained from one report to next. When the next program status report is generated, it takes the color from the associated projects.

6.  Select **Submit**.
