# Create a test for a story

Create a test from the Sprint Tracking view to automatically link it to a story and track whether the story meets its acceptance criteria.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: scrum\_user or scrum\_admin
-   You can create a test from the List view only when Agile Development 2.0 is installed along with Test Management 2.0.
-   You must be a member of an agile group.

## About this task

Create a test, add steps to the test, and create and maintain different versions of the test. A test is a collection of conditions or steps used to determine whether a story is working correctly. A test can also include an expected result, which determines whether the test passes or fails. When you create a test from the **Sprint Tracking** view, the test is automatically linked to the story displayed in that row. To confirm the link after creation, open the story record and locate the **Tests** related list.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agile Development** &gt; **Agile Board**.

2.  Click the **Sprint Tracking** tab, and select the **List** view.

3.  From the **Show** list at the top right corner, select **Tests**.

4.  Click **Add Test**.

5.  To link an existing test rather than creating one, open the story record from the sprint list and locate the **Tests** related list to add the test.

    To create a standalone test to link later, see [Create a test in Test Management 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/create-test2.md).

6.  In the form, fill in the fields:
