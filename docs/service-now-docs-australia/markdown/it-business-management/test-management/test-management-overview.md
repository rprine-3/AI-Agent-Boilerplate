# Test Management applications

The ServiceNow® Test Management application streamlines the management of testing processes to help you deliver software products more efficiently and with fewer errors.

Test Management is available in two versions.

-   Test Management 2.0 offers many enhancements, including integration with Agile Development 2.0 and Scaled Agile Framework \(SAFe\)
-   Test Management 1.0 may have specific capabilities that are useful for your organization.

Use the following comparison to make an informed decision for your organization.

## Differences between Test Management 1.0 and Test Management 2.0

Test Management 1.0 covers user acceptance testing. It does not include some key data model structures like test versions, test runs, or test results. In addition, you cannot structure test plans in Test Management 1.0.

Test Management 2.0 includes data model structures that match industry standards. It provides you with an intuitive user interface called the [Test Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/test-board.md) from which you can structure test plans and plan the phases of your testing effort.

**Tip:**

If you need Agile Development integration, test versioning, or detailed test run traceability, use Test Management 2.0. If your organization requires only basic user acceptance testing without Agile integration, Test Management 1.0 may be sufficient.
