# Sprint testing

You can use Test Management 2.0 with Agile Development 2.0 to test the work of a scrum team sprint-by-sprint.

Sprint testing lets you verify user stories sprint by sprint. The process involves the following steps:

1.  Create tests for the stories in the current sprint. For more information, see [Create a test in Test Management 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/create-test2.md).
2.  Run the assigned tests and capture results. For more information, see [Run your test assignments in Test Management 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/run-your-test-assignments.md).
3.  Review test results and close stories when all tests pass. For information about monitoring progress, see [Test Board in Test Management 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/test-board.md).

## Test Management 2.0 integration with Agile Development 2.0

With the integration of Test Management 2.0 and Agile Development 2.0, you can perform sprint testing from **Agile Development 2.0** &gt; **Agile Board** &gt; **Sprint Tracking**.

-   Find what tests are to be run for the sprint.
-   Create tests for the stories in sprints.
-   Maintain multiple versions of a test.
-   Run a single version of a test at one time.
-   View which version of test has been run.
-   Review the history of test results.
-   Close stories.

When you create a test through the **Sprint Tracking** view, the test is automatically associated with the story displayed in that row. You can verify this link by opening the story record and reviewing the **Tests** related list. To view all tests linked to stories in a sprint, use the [Test Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/test-board.md).

## Viewing sprint test results

After testers run their assignments, you can review results at two levels:

-   In the **Sprint Tracking** view, each story row displays the test status for that story's tests.
-   In [Test Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/test-board.md), the test plan card displays the percentage of tests that have passed, failed, and been blocked.

When all tests for a story pass, the story is ready to be closed. To close a story from the Sprint Tracking view, select the story and update its state to **Complete**.

-   **[Create a test for a story](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/create-test-plan-for-story-agile2.md)**  
Create a test from the Sprint Tracking view to automatically link it to a story and track whether the story meets its acceptance criteria.
-   **[Run your tests from the List view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/test-management/run-test-plan-within-agile2.md)**  
View the test scenario, execute all the steps of the test, and review the test result.
