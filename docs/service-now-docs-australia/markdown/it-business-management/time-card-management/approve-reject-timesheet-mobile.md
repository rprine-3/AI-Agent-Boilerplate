# Approve or reject a time sheet or time card from your mobile device

As a user manager, you can approve or reject from your mobile device all time cards for a user in a given week. Do this in a single step by approving or rejecting a time sheet.

## Before you begin

Role required: timecard\_approver or timecard\_admin

## About this task

A user manager is the one who has either of the required roles. The manager who can accept or reject the time sheet is selected in the **Manager** field on the User form of the time card user.

A manager can [delegate another user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/time-card-management/delegate-time-sheet-approvals.md) with the required roles as the time sheet approver. For the specified time period, the delegated user also receives all the time sheets submitted by time card users to process.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your instance using the Now Mobile application.

2.  In the Time Sheets list, open the time sheet you want to approve or reject.

3.  Approve or reject the time sheet or time card.

    -   To approve time sheet of your team, from the Team approval requests section, tap the approve \(\[Omitted image "approve\_icon.png"\] Alt text: Approve icon\) icon.
    -   To reject time sheet of your team, from the Team approval requests section, tap the reject \(\[Omitted image "reject\_icon.png"\] Alt text: Reject icon\) icon.
    -   To approve the time sheet, tap the action icon, and select **Approve time sheet** or tap the **Approve time sheet** button at the bottom of the screen.
    -   To reject the entire time sheet, tap the action icon, and select **Reject time sheet** or tap the **Reject time sheet** button at the bottom of the screen.
    -   To approve a specific time card, tap the action menu and tap **Approve time card**.
    -   To reject a specific time card, tap the action menu and tap **Reject time card**.

## Result

-   The time sheet moves to the Approved or Rejected state.
-   All time cards associated with the time sheet are also approved or rejected automatically.
-   Time cards that are of non-task type are in moved to the processed state.
-   If any time cards in the time sheet are pending approval by one of the approvers, the sheet remains in the Submitted state.
-   If a time card in a time sheet is in the Rejected state, the time sheet also moves to the Rejected state. This occurs regardless of the state of any other time cards in the time sheet.
