# Analytics User manager

The Analytics user manager provides the user managers with reports of time sheet exceptions, and category wise time reported by the users.

**Important:** Starting with Xanadu release, **User Manager Dashboard** is renamed to **Analytics User manager** for new customers.

The dashboard can be activated using the Performance Analytics - Content Pack - Project Portfolio Suite Dashboards plugin \(com.snc.pps\_dashboards\). You require Performance Analytics license to use this dashboard.

The dashboard displays time sheet reports only for those time card users who have the **Manager** field on [User form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateAUser.md) set to the current user.

The reports in the dashboard are filtered based on **Date** range, and **User** selected.

The Analytics user manager consists of these components:

## Time sheet exception count

It displays the total count of entries in **Time sheet exceptions** report.

## Time sheet exceptions report

The Time sheet exceptions report lists the users who did not submit/create their time sheets, and the time sheets which are not yet approved for the selected user, and time range. The report displays the following data:

-   **User**: The time card user whose manager in User profile is the current user. If there are more than one time sheets for a user in a given date range which are not submitted or require approval, then multiple entries are listed for the user.
-   **Week starts on**: Starting date of the time sheet week in the selected time range.
-   **State**: State of the time card. Time sheet entries with state as **Not Submitted** are also listed if a time sheet is not created for the week.

The report is generated from the time\_sheet\_exception table. It requires the schedule job **Time Sheet Exceptions** to be running to get the up-to date information.

## Total approved hours

It displays the total approved hours in all categories displayed in **Time by category** report.

## Time by category report

The bar chart report displays the time approved against each category for the selected users whose manager in User profile is the current user.
