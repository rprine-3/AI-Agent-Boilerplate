# Map a time card category with operational work types

Map custom time card categories with operational work types so you can select only the operational resource plans that are associated with the user for a specific time card period and category while posting time.

## Before you begin

Role required: pps\_admin

## About this task

By default, all base system time card categories are mapped with the base system operational work types. If mapping is not done for custom categories, the **Resource Plan** field displays all the operational resource plans associated with the user for that time period when you create a time card.

During time card creation, after you select a time card category and task or during time sheet submission for other category time cards, operational resource plans are populated for that category and task as described in the following table.

<table id="table_kjg_t3j_ylb"><thead><tr><th>
