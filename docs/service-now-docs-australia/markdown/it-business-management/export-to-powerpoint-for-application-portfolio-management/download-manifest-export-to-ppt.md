# Download the manifest file

Configure the user roles and download the add-in manifest file to use the Export to PowerPoint add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ServiceNow Add-Ins for Office** &gt; **Office Add-In Manifests**.

2.  Click **Templates for ServiceNow**.

    **Note:** Check the **Templates for ServiceNow** description to match with **PowerPoint plugin for ServiceNow** to ensure that the correct manifest file is selected.

3.  Click **Download Manifest** to download the add-in file.

    The manifest file you download is specific to your instance. It contains the instance URL and configuration details that apply only to your environment. Using a manifest from one instance on another instance does not work and may cause errors.

    If you work with more than one ServiceNow instance, for example, a development instance and a production instance — you have two options:

    -   Install a separate manifest for each instance. Download and install the manifest individually from each instance you need to connect to.
    -   Use the sideload option. If installing multiple manifests is not practical, use the sideload option to temporarily load the manifest for a different instance without installing it permanently.

## What to do next

-   Share the `manifest.xml` file with Microsoft Office 365 account manager to [upload the manifest file for Microsoft Office 365 users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/upload-the-manifest-file-office365.md) to enable the Export to PowerPoint add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint.

    Alternatively, you can sideload the add-in for testing purposes using one of the following processes.
