# Configure the Export to PowerPoint add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint

Configure the Export to PowerPoint add-in in your Microsoft PowerPoint to interact with your instance and fetch the data required to generate and download your project status reports.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: sn\_ppt\_export.ppt\_admin or sn\_ppt\_export.ppt\_user.
-   The Export to PowerPoint add-in must be deployed to your Microsoft PowerPoint. If the add-in icon does not appear on the Home tab, verify the following.
    1.  [Download the add-in manifest file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/download-manifest-export-to-ppt.md) from your ServiceNow instance.
    2.  Contact your Microsoft Office 365 administrator to deploy the manifest using the Microsoft 365 admin center \(**Settings** &gt; **Integrated apps** &gt; **Upload custom apps**\).
    3.  After deployment, restart Microsoft PowerPoint and verify the ServiceNow add-in icon appears on the Home tab.
-   For the Export to PowerPoint plugin configuration on your instance, see [Configure the Export to PowerPoint add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/install-ppt-addin.md).

**Tip:**

If you do not see the add-in icon after deployment, check **Insert** &gt; **My Add-ins** in Microsoft PowerPoint to verify the add-in is installed. You may need to select it manually to add it to your ribbon.

## Procedure

1.  Open your Microsoft PowerPoint application and select the ServiceNow add-in icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-servicenow-addin.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow Export to PowerPoint add-in.\) on the **Home** tab.

    A panel appears with a login option to access your ServiceNow instance.

2.  Select **Log in**.

3.  Enter your ServiceNow instance credentials and select **Log in**.

    A prompt requesting access to your instance with details such as the instance name is displayed.

4.  Check your instance details and select **Allow**.


## Result

The landing page of the add-in appears as the right panel.
