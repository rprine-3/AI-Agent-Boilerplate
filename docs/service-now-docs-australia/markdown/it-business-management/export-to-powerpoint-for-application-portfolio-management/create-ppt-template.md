# Create a Microsoft PowerPoint template

Configure the Export to PowerPoint add-in in your Microsoft PowerPoint to interact with your instance and fetch the data required to generate and download your status reports. Create your own custom template with the required data to generate a report, based on the reporting needs of your organization.

## Before you begin

-   Let us connect your instance to the Microsoft PowerPoint using the add-in login and create a template Portfolio Planning to generate a report for epic details.
-   Role required: sn\_ppt\_export.ppt\_user

## Procedure

1.  Open your Microsoft PowerPoint application and select the ServiceNow add-in icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-servicenow-addin.png"\] Alt text: ServiceNow Export to PowerPoint add-in.\) on the **Home** tab.

    A side panel appears with a login option to access your ServiceNow instance.

2.  Select **Log in**.

3.  Enter your ServiceNow instance credentials and select **Log in**.

    A prompt with your instance details is displayed.

4.  Check your instance details and select **Allow**.

    The landing page of the add-in appears on the side panel.

5.  Select **Personal portfolio report** from the Type list.

    Select the data type you want to populate.

    -   Text – Text entries from the parent table. Example: Portfolio name, owner name, and so on.
    -   Table – Table entries mapped using [related tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/manage-components-export-ppt.md).
    -   Repeater – To populate additional details for each of the selected records.
    -   Line and Bar chart – Graph entries mapped using [scripted elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/manage-components-export-ppt.md).
    **Note:** While creating a template, you can:

    -   Change the font size and color for the token values to reflect the same in your status report.
    -   Move around the token to place them in a required format.
    -   Add your custom or organization logos on the slides.
    -   Resize the chart tokens according to the requirement.
    You can customize data retrieval for template tokens by appending link attributes. The following attributes are available:

    |Attribute|Description|Example|
    |---------|-----------|-------|
    |orderByColumnName|Sorts the data by the specified column name in ascending or descending order.|`orderByColumnName=priority^orderByDirection=asc`|
    |filterQuery|Applies an encoded query to filter the data populated in the template token.|`filterQuery=state=2^priority=1`|
    |maxRows|Limits the maximum number of rows returned for a table or repeater token.|`maxRows=10`|

    Apply these attributes by appending them to the token URL in the template field properties. For details on configuring related tables and scripted elements, see [Manage components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/manage-components-export-ppt.md).
