The Agile 2.0 Sprint Dashboard provides the following insights:

-   Displays details of the sprint such as percentage of work that is complete, time elapsed, and total number of stories that are missing estimates.
-   Displays the number of stories of the sprint in their current state and their progress.
-   Indicates the scope changes, if any, and trends of those scope changes.
-   Indicates the way the team needs to progress on stories to achieve the sprint goal.
-   Forecasts data showing the likelihood of completing the sprint as planned.

</table>## Indicators

-   **Scrum: Sum of story points of all stories in the current sprint**

    Generates the scope series in the Sprint Burndown and Burnup reports. The scope series indicates the amount of work \(in story points\) that is the planned for the sprint.

-   **Scrum: Sum of story points of active stories in the current sprint**

    Generates the completed series in the Sprint Burndown and Burnup reports. The completed series indicates the amount of work \(in story points\) completed in the sprint.

-   **Scrum: Time elapsed in sprint**

    Calculates the time to be displayed in the Time Elapsed widget.

-   **Scrum: Count of all stories in the current sprint**

    Generates the area series in the Sprint Cumulative Flow Diagram report. It indicates the number of stories in the current sprint.

-   **Scrum: Percent Completed by Points**

    Calculates the amount of work \(in percentage\) completed for the sprint. The value is the result of the following formula:

    ```
    ([[Scrum: Sum of story points of completed stories in current sprint]]/[[Scrum: Sum of story points of all stories in the current sprint]]*100)
    ```


## Breakdowns

## Widgets

-   **Scope**

    Indicates the amount of work in story points that is planned for the sprint. This widget lets you see at a glance how much work must be completed to achieve the sprint goal. It also lets you drill down to detail on the stories planned into the sprint.

-   **Percent Completed**

    Indicates the percentage of work that has been completed in the sprint using story points. This widget lets you see at a glance how much work has been completed in the sprint. Together with the adjacent Time Elapsed widget, these widgets let you see whether you are completing work at a rate consistent with achieving the sprint goal on schedule.

-   **Time Elapsed**

    Indicates the percentage of time that has elapsed between the start date and planned end date of the sprint. Together with the adjacent Percent Completed widget, these widgets let you see whether you are completing work at a rate consistent with achieving the sprint goal on schedule.

-   **Committed Points**

    Indicates the committed scope \(in number of story points\) of the sprint. Together with the adjacent Scope widget, these widgets show the difference between the sprint's committed and current scope.

    **Note:** This widget is not visible by default. You can add it from Reports to your dashboard. For more information, see [Edit a responsive dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/t_EditADashboard.md).

-   **Missing Estimates**

    Indicates the total number of stories in the sprint that are missing estimates. It is required that you use estimates for the other indicators, widgets, and reports on this dashboard to be meaningful.

    **Tip:** If you do not estimate stories, enter a "1" in the **Story Points** field. The other indicators, widgets, and reports will then effectively function by count.

-   **Blocked Work**

    Indicates the amount of work \(in story points\) in the sprint that is blocked.


## Data visualizations

If you are upgrading from version 1.0.2 or earlier of Performance Analytics Content Pack for Agile 2.0, then install this dashboard from Solution Library to upgrade its layout and access the following visualizations:

-   Sprint Burnup
-   Sprint Cumulative Flow Diagram

For more information, see [Upgrading the layout of Agile 2.0 dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/agile-development/using-solution-library-for-agile-2.0-dashboards.md).

**Note:** For all reports shown in the Sprint dashboard, the planned end date of the Sprints is used as a filter. Completed Sprints appear in the chart only if their Planned end date is less than or equal to the current date.

Sprint Burndown

</td><td>

Line chart\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-line.png"\] Alt text:

</td><td>

Indicates the scope changes, if any, and trends of those scope changes. Indicates the ideal pace of work, how much work is remaining, and if the scope is likely to be completed before the end of the sprint.

 The Sprint Burndown report comprises the following series that can be hidden or displayed based on your preference:

-   **Scope**: Indicates the amount of work that is planned for the sprint.
-   **Scope Forecast**: Predicts the possibility of scope change for the future dates, which is based on historical data.
-   **Ideal Burndown**: Indicates how the team needs to progress on stories to complete the sprint on time.
-   **Remaining**: Indicates the amount of work left for completion in the sprint. If the actual burndown is above the ideal burndown, it implies that there is more work left than originally estimated. The team is running behind the schedule of the sprint. If the actual burndown is below the ideal burndown, it implies that there is less work left than originally estimated. The team is running ahead of the schedule of the sprint.
-   **Remaining Forecast**: Predicts the burndown for the future dates. It indicates whether you can complete the sprint on time. The prediction is based on historical data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sprint Burnup

</td><td>

Line chart\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-line.png"\] Alt text:

</td><td>

Shows the sprint burnup trend indicating scope changes. Forecasts future changes in scope and the trend of work completion.

 The Sprint Burnup report comprises the following series that can be hidden or displayed based on your preference:

-   **Scope**: Indicates the amount of work that is planned for the sprint.
-   **Scope Forecast**: Predicts the possibility of scope change for the future dates, which is based on historical data.
-   **Completed**: Indicates the amount of work completed in the sprint.
-   **Completed Forecast**: Predicts the burnup for the future dates. It indicates whether you can complete the sprint on time. The prediction is based on historical data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sprint Cumulative Flow Diagram

</td><td>

Area chart\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-area.png"\] Alt text:

</td><td>

Monitor the progress of all the stories of your sprint between its actual start and end dates.

 View the number of stories in each state by their arrival to a state, time in this state, and its departure from this state.

 The Sprint Cumulative Flow Diagram report comprises the following areas that can be hidden or displayed based on your preference:

-   **Ready**: Indicates the number of stories in the sprint that are ready to start work on.
-   **Work in Progress**: Indicates the number of stories in the sprint that are in development.
-   **Ready for Testing**: Indicates the number stories in the sprint that are ready to be tested.
-   **Testing**: Indicates the number of stories in the sprint that are currently being tested.
-   **Complete**: Indicates the number of stories in the sprint that are complete.

 **Note:** Stories in Ready and Cancelled states are not included in this report.
