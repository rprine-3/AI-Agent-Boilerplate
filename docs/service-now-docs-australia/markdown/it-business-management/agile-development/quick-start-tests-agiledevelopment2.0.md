# Quick start tests for Agile Development 2.0

Validate that Agile Development 2.0 still works after you make any configuration change such as apply an upgrade or develop an application. Copy and customize these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

**Danger**

By default, the system property that is used to run automated tests is disabled to prevent you from accidentally running these tests on a production system. To avoid data corruption or an outage, run tests only on development, test, and other non-production instances. See [Enable or disable executing Automated Test Framework tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/atf-enable-tests.md).

Agile Development 2.0 quick start tests require activating the Agile Development 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0\) and the Agile Development 2.0 - ATF Tests plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0.atf \).

Verify that updating the team/group capacity overrides the capacity on all the future sprints

</td><td>

Verify that any update to the **Group capacity** field of the assignment group results in the following changes to the **Group capacity** field of the various sprints associated with this assignment group:

-   For the sprints that are in the Draft and Planning state:
    -   The group capacity is updated to the new value.
    -   The **Group capacity** field is editable.
-   For the sprints in the Current, Complete, or Cancelled state:
    -   The group capacity remains the old value.
    -   The **Group capacity** field is read-only.

 For the sprints in the Draft or Planning state, you can individually edit the group capacity of the sprint anytime later. This would not change the group capacity of the assignment group associated with this sprint.
