# Business stakeholder role for Agile Development 2.0

Use the business stakeholder role to read and retrieve data from any table of the Agile Development 2.0 and Scrum Programs applications to generate reports.

When you activate the Business Stakeholder plugin \(com.snc.business\_stakeholder\) in your ServiceNow instance, the Read only roles for Agile 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.agile\_read\_roles\) is also activated. This plugin provides a business stakeholder role \(sn\_agile\_read\) with which you can access all the tables of Agile Development 2.0 and Scrum Programs applications. You can assign this role to any user in your organization who is a business stakeholder.

## Plugin availability

If you are a new customer, the Read only roles for the Agile 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.agile\_read\_roles\) is activated on zBoot. However, the business stakeholder role \(sn\_agile\_read\) is available only when you activate the Agile Development 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0\).

If you are an upgrade customer, you must manually activate the read-only roles for Agile 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.agile\_read\_roles\).

## Agile Development 2.0 tables accessible by users with the business stakeholder role

When both the Read only roles for Agile 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.agile\_read\_roles\) and the Agile Development 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0\) are active in your ServiceNow instance, the user with the business stakeholder role \(sn\_agile\_read\) has read access to the following tables.
