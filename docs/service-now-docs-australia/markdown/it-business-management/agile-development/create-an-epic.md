# Create an epic in Agile Development 2.0

Define the high-level requirements of the features that you want to develop by creating epics in Agile Development 2.0.

## Before you begin

Role required: scrum\_story\_creator, scrum\_admin

## About this task

Create epics in Agile Development 2.0 and organize them in a hierarchy of parent and children. You can associate an epic to a product, theme, or configuration item \(an item or service that is affected\).

## Procedure

2.  Select **New**.

    Alternatively, you can open the new epic form using the Agile board, from a theme record, or from a product record.

    You can also convert an existing active story into an epic. For details, see [Related links and lists for a Story in Agile Development 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/agile-development/agile-2-0-story-related-lists-related-links.md).

## What to do next

-   Add child epics or stories to the epic:
    -   Create a child epic for this epic by selecting **New** from the Child Epics related list.
    -   Add stories to this epic by selecting **New** from the Stories related list. For more information, see [Create a story in Agile Development 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/agile-development/create-a-story.md).

        An epic can have one or more stories, but a story can belong to only one epic at a time.

-   You can also associate epics to a project in Project Portfolio Management from the Epics related list.

    This related list appears only when the value for the **Execution Type** field is selected as **Agile** and the Agile Development 2.0 plugin is installed.
