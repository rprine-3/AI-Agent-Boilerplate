# Manage your product backlog in Agile Development 2.0

Manage your product backlog from a centralized location called the Agile board in Agile Development 2.0. Add stories to a personalized backlog and prioritize them as needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: scrum\_product\_owner

## About this task

Prioritize stories in your backlog. You can add stories, assign stories to a release or a product, add triaged records, and so on.

-   Steps 1 and 2 take you to where you can manage your scrum backlogs.
-   Steps 3 through 12 provide guidance on the different actions that you can perform on your backlog. Choose the actions based on your requirement.
-   All actions that involve a triage board are accessible only when the Agile Development — Unified Backlog plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.multi\_task\) is active.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agile Development** &gt; **Agile Board** &gt; **Backlog**.

    If you have already created a personalized backlog, it automatically appears in this tab. If you have not created a personalized backlog, then a welcome page appears that provides a link to create a backlog.

2.  From the list at the top-left corner, select the required backlog or create a backlog by using the Create Backlog icon \(\[Omitted image "createbacklog.png"\] Alt text: Create Backlog icon.\).

3.  Update the existing filter criteria of your selected backlog by using the Edit Backlog icon \(\[Omitted image "edit-icon.png"\] Alt text: Edit Backlog icon.\).

4.  Personalize columns in a list by selecting the personalize icon\[Omitted image "personalisecolumns.png"\] Alt text: Update Personalized list icon..

5.  Add a story to the backlog.

    1.  Click **Create Story**.

    2.  Specify the required details in the Story form.

    3.  Click **Submit**.

        The story is listed at the bottom of the backlog on the last page.

    If you want to add a story at a particular position in the backlog, select a story just above this position, and then click **Create Story**. The new story is listed below the story that you selected.

6.  Update a story from the backlog.

    1.  Click the story number of the story that you want to update.

    2.  Edit the story details and click **Update**.

        If you have read-only access, you can open the Story form but cannot edit the story details.

7.  Create an epic or a theme directly from the **Backlog** tab.

    1.  Select the options icon \(\[Omitted image "create-story-arrow.png"\] Alt text: options icon.\) next to the **Create Story** option.

        \[Omitted image "create-story-epic-theme-dropdown.png"\] Alt text: Drop down option to create story, epic, or theme on Agile board

    2.  Select **Create Epic** or **Create Theme** from the list.

    3.  On the form, fill in the fields and submit it.

    The new epic is listed in the epics filter only if its stories meet the filter criteria of the selected backlog.

8.  Arrange stories within a Backlog page using one of the following options.

    -   Use the mouse device to select and hold a story, drag it to the required position, and drop it.
    -   Use the keyboard. For more information, see [Arrange Agile Development 2.0 stories in Agile Board using the keyboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/agile-development/arrange-stories.md)
    Rearranging stories in the backlog adjusts the ranking of stories in the global\_rank column in the Story \[rm\_story\] table. When you move a story within a backlog, its rank changes relative to the stories within the same backlog. So, the story at the top of the backlog list has a lower rank value and assumes higher priority. In contrast, the story at the bottom of the backlog list has a higher rank value and assumes lower priority.

9.  Perform any of the following actions on a single story or a set of stories by selecting the required stories and clicking the Options icon \(\[Omitted image "ellipsis.png"\] Alt text: Options icon.\).

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Move to top**|Moves the stories to the top of the Backlog list.|
    |**Move to next page**|Moves the stories to the top of the Backlog list on the next page.|

10. Use the **Triage Board** option to view and edit the records in your triage boards.

    You can do the following actions using the **Triage Board** option:

    -   View and edit the total number of records \(such as problems or defects\) in the triage boards of all task types
    -   Open the list of a specific task type
    -   Edit an existing triage filter definition
11. Add a triaged record, such as a defect, to the bottom of your backlog.

    1.  Click **Triage Board**.

    2.  Select your triage filter definition.

        For example, a definition for all defects.

    3.  Select the records that you want to add to your backlog.

    4.  Click **Add to Backlog**.

12. Move a triaged record from your backlog back to the triage board.

    1.  Open the triaged record by clicking its number.

    2.  Click the **Move back to triage board** related link.

    You need a specific role that provides access to a triaged record in the backlog. For example, to view a problem in the backlog, you must have the itil role. If you do not have access to any record, an error message appears.
