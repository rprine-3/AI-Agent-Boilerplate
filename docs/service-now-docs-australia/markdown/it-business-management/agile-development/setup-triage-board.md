# Set up a triage board in Agile Development 2.0

Set up your own triage board to view and manage records that are important to your product. These records include problems, incident tasks, defects, or change requests, viewable at one place easily.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you own a backlog. See [Create a personalized backlog in Agile Development 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/agile-development/create-a-backlog.md).

Role required: scrum\_product\_owner

## About this task

Define filters to create a triage board, so that you can access and manage the records that you want easily.

You can create as many triage boards as you want. For example, you can create one triage board for defects and incidents and another for enhancements.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agile Development** &gt; **Agile Board** &gt; **Backlog**.

2.  Set up a new triage board.

    -   If this is your first triage board, select **Triage Board** &gt; **Set up Triage Board**.
    -   If you already have a triage board, select **Triage Board** &gt; **New Triage Definition**
3.  On the form, fill in these fields.

<table id="table_om3_5kh_35b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name for the triage board.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table from which you want to filter records for the triage board.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter

</td><td>

Filter criteria to be applied on the selected table to populate the triage board.**Important:** Do not to remove the default conditions: **Active is true** and **Agile story is empty**.

 -   **Active is true** ensures that your triage board only shows the tasks that are active and not completed or cancelled.
-   **Agile story is empty** ensures that the task doesn't already have a story associated to it and is not already present in some other backlog.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Backlog definition

</td><td>

Backlog that any stories created from this triage board would be added to.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

A triage board is created and can be accessed from the Backlog section of the Agile board.
