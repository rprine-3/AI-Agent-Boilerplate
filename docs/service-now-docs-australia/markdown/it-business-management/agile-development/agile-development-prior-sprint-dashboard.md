Indicates the scope changes, if any, and trends of those scope changes. Indicates the ideal pace of work, how much work is remaining, and if the scope is likely to be completed before the end of the sprint.

 The Sprint Burndown report comprises the following series that can be hidden or displayed based on your preference:

-   **Scope**: Indicates the amount of work that is planned for the sprint.
-   **Ideal Burndown**: Indicates how the team needs to progress on stories to complete the sprint on time.
-   **Remaining**: Indicates the amount of work left for completion in the sprint.

If Remaining is above the Ideal Burndown, it implies that there is more work left than originally estimated. The team is running behind the schedule of the sprint.

If Remaining is below Ideal Burndown, it implies that there is less work left than originally estimated. The team is running ahead of the schedule of the sprint.


 Analyze the burndown trends and accordingly plan the workload for an upcoming sprint.
