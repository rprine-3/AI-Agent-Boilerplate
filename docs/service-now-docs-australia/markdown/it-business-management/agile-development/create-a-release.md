# Create a release in Agile Development 2.0

Create a release to start associating the stories and scrum tasks of your product development to the release in Agile Development 2.0.

## Before you begin

Role required: scrum\_release\_planner, scrum\_admin

## About this task

Use the Releases module to create a release record to start planning for your upcoming release.

A release has a start and end date during which several development iterations are completed. Releases are created by a product owner and contain user stories, sometimes from multiple products, and can also involve multiple teams. The stories associated to a release form its release backlog.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agile Development** &gt; **Releases**.

2.  Select **New** in the record list.

    Alternatively, if you already created Product records in Agile Development 2.0, you can use the Releases related list to open the new release form.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_release_form"><thead><tr><th>
