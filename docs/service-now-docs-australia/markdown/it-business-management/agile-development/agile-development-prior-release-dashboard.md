-   **Ideal Burndown**: Indicates how the team had to progress on stories to deliver the release on time.
-   **Remaining**: Indicates the amount of work that is completed.

If the actual burndown \(Remaining\) is above the ideal burndown, it implies that the team was running behind the schedule of the release. If the actual burndown \(Remaining\) is below the ideal burndown, it implies that the team was running ahead of the schedule of the release.
