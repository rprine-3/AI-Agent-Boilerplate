# Convert one RIDAC record to another for a project in Project Workspace

Convert one RIDAC \(Risk, Issue, Decision, Action, and Request Change\) record to another for a project in the Project Workspace. Keep a record of risks or issues and their outcome for analysis at project closure and planning. Track the risks and issues throughout the project life cycle.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## About this task

When you convert a RIDAC record to another record, the values for the **Short description**, **Requester**, and **Assigned to** fields are carried forward from the parent record.

You can also specify to close the parent record on creation of the new record instead of manually closing the parent record.

## Procedure

1.  Select the project for which you want to convert one RIDAC entry to another.

    For information on how to navigate to a Project in the Project Workspace, see [Access the Project Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-workspace/access-new-project-workspace.md).

2.  Open the RIDAC page of the project by selecting **RIDAC** from the list.

3.  On the Project form, select **Row context menu** for an individual risk, issue, decision, action, or request change record.

4.  Select **Convert to RIDAC**.

5.  On the Convert dialog box, from the Select task type list, select the RIDAC record to which you want to convert the selected record.

    For example, if you wanted to convert an issue to decision, you would select **Decision**.

6.  Modify the text in the **Short description** field, which is copied from the parent record.

7.  Change the default assignment copied from the parent record in the **Assigned to** field by selecting the search for record icon \(\[Omitted image "lookup\_icon.png"\] Alt text: search for record icon.\) and selecting a different user.

8.  If you want to close the parent RIDAC record on creation of a new record, select the close parent record option.

    The label of the close parent record option changes depending on the parent record type. For example, if the parent record is an issue and you’re converting it to decision record, then the close record option would appear as **Close Issue**.

9.  Select **OK**.
