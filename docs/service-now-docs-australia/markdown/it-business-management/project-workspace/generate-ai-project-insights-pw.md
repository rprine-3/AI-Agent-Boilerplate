# Generate and track project details from AI insights page

Generate and monitor project insights directly from AI insights page in Project Workspace.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the Project insights generation skill is active.

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Open a project from the home page of Project Workspace.

    For information, see [Access the Project Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-workspace/access-new-project-workspace.md).

2.  Open AI insights page by selecting **AI insights** from the list.

3.  Select **Generate insights** to generate AI insights of your project.

    \[Omitted image "ai-insights-page-project-workspace.png"\] Alt text: AI insights page in Project Workspace.

    Project insights are generated using the same Project insights generation skill used for email insights. Insights are displayed directly in the in‑app AI insights experience.

4.  Review the generation project insights.

    -   Project insights
    -   Executive summary
    -   Overall project health
    -   RAG status \(These appear as widgets on the AI insights page\).
    -   Work notes summary
    AI computes project health across all configured dimensions based on administrator‑defined rules. The generated status report presents detailed health indicators along with supporting rationale to help you understand the current state of the project. You can review schedule variance information to identify delays and the sub‑indicators affecting progress, and view project status explanations that highlight recent achievements and issues requiring immediate attention. Additional sections can be expanded for deeper analysis. The report also includes schedule health to assess progress against planned timelines and thresholds, as well as budget and cost status to verify that financials remain within limits. AI also reviews recent work notes across the project's tasks and RIDAC records to further inform the health rationale and executive summary.
