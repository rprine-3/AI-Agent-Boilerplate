# Extend a resource assignment

Extend the date of an allocated resource assignment and allocate resources for the extended period.

## Before you begin

Role required: resource\_manager

## About this task

Assume that work on a project has started, but there’s a need to extend the date of an allocated resource assignment because the project has been extended. In this scenario, you can extend the date of the allocated resource assignment. The new date by which the resource assignment is extended doesn’t have any impact on the existing allocated hours. While extending the resource assignment, you can specify the new end date and the request type. Based on the request type selected, the required allocated hours are auto-filled.

For example, assume that you allocated 100 hours for 2 months, 50 hours for each month. Now, you want to extend the resource assignment by one month. For the extended month, allocation records are created based on the request type selected.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Project Workspace** and open a project.

2.  Extend the resource assignment using one of the following options.

**Note:** You can’t set the assignment's extended end date later than the task end date.

3.  From the Extend Assignment window, modify the **New end date** and effort and select **Ok**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>
## Result

-   The assignment end date is updated and allocation is created based on resource's availability.
-   The extended FTE or person days is divided equally for the extended resource period. For the **Hours** effort type, the extended effort is distributed in whole hours across the child resource assignments, and any remaining hours are distributed one hour at a time.
