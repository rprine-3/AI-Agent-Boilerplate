    New topics in project insights framework to support reuse across portfolio insights, project insights, and status report contextual data:

    -   Project delays: Identifies delay patterns across your project timeline and reports them in project insights.
    -   Task dependency: Evaluates task relationships to highlight dependency risks and impacts.
    -   Budget fluctuations: Monitors budget changes and highlights significant variances for review.
    -   Scope creep: Detects insights of unplanned growth in a project by comparing the current project state against its first baseline. The insight flags deviations in task count, budget, and the existence of open change requests to help project managers identify potential scope expansion early.

## Result

The skill is active on the instance.
