# Project analytics widgets and reports

Widgets and reports that provide information for the project summary in the **Analytics** tab of the project workspace for Agile, Waterfall, and Hybrid projects.

**Important:**

Classic Project Workspace is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer available for installation but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base. Use new Project Workspace with enhanced UI to help you efficiently manage your projects.

## Project widgets and reports

Widgets and reports provide information that enables you to view and track the progress of your Agile, Waterfall, and Hybrid project.

**Note:** You must have the Agile Development 2.0 plugin installed to view the widgets and reports for your Agile and Hybrid projects.

Your system administrator can configure the widgets and reports in the dashboard to display project information on the **Analytics** tab. The following dashboards are available:

</table>The project execution type determines the dashboard displayed on the **Analytics** tab.

You can also embed a custom dashboard in the **Analytics** tab. Your system admin can modify the PMViewDataUtils script include and configure the variable value for the dashboards\_tabs in the getDashboardUrl method. As a result, you can view the custom dashboard in Project Analytics. For example:

```
var dashboards_tabs =

      {
             waterfall: {
                         dashboard_sysId: '5d4959dd878003008b9b3a0548cb0bd0',
                         tab_sysId: '1d99d5dd878003008b9b3a0548cb0bbd'
                             },
             hybrid: {
                         dashboard_sysId: '96dc46c78700330047d84c2c59cb0bf1',
                         tab_sysId: '520d4ac78700330047d84c2c59cb0bab'
                              },
             agile: {
                         dashboard_sysId: 'f3dd4ec78700330047d84c2c59cb0b93&tab',
                         tab_sysId: '52fd8ec78700330047d84c2c59cb0bae'
                              },
             any_other_executionType: {
                         dashboard_sysId: 'custom_dashboard_sys_id',
                         tab_sysId: 'custom_dashboard_tab_sys_id'
                              },
         };
