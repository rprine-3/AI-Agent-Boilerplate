# Playbooks configuration

Configure playbooks to organize project workflows, maintain consistency, and keep projects on track.

Define a trigger condition in Workflow Studio to use a Playbook, either by selecting an existing one or creating a Playbook.

In Project Workspace, Playbooks are triggered by record creation, record update, or both. For example, a Playbook created for projects is associated with project records, and the Playbook tab appears when a project meets the trigger condition. For more information on how to configure a playbook, see [Configuring Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/setting-up-process-automation-designer.md).

There are two pre-defined project management playbooks available in the Workflow studio:

-   Project default
-   Stage-gate default

To configure playbooks, perform these tasks:

1.  Navigate to **Workflow Studio** and select **Playbooks**.
2.  Create and configure playbooks as per your requirement. For more information, see [Create and configure playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/setting-up-process-automation-designer.md).
3.  Activate one of the two pre-defined playbooks for the Project Workspace and define an appropriate trigger condition. For more information, see [Activate Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/activate-process-automation-designer.md) and [Triggers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer-triggers.md).

Multiple playbooks can be enabled at a time, and the trigger should be defined in such a way that each project is mapped to only one type of playbook. To activate a playbook, see [Activate Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/activate-process-automation-designer.md).

**Note:**

When a project template is applied or project is created from a demand, the project information is automatically copied into the project record and reflected in the Playbook.
