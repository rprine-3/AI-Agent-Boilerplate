# Copy a resource assignment from Project Workspace

Copy a resource assignment record directly from the resource pane in Project Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## About this task

Make sure the resource assignment is visible in the bottom resource pane of the project.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Project Workspace** and open a project.

2.  View the resource assignment pane by enabling the **Resource assignments** toggle button.

    **Note:** If the **sn\_pw.enable\_resource\_planning** property is set to true, then the **Resource assignment** toggle button and resource assignment pane are displayed in Project Workspace. The default value is false. You must have the pps\_admin role to enable this property.

3.  From the Planning pane, double-click the **Resource assignees** field for a project task.

    You can assign the resources from both planning and resource assignment pane.

4.  From the resource assignment pane, create a resource assignment for a project or task by selecting **Add resource**.

    You can create a resource assignment for a project from the resource assignment pane only.

5.  From the resource assignment pane, select the row context menu \(\[Omitted image "icon-row-context-menu.png"\] Alt text: Row context menu.\) of resource assignment record and then select **Copy resource assignment**.

    A duplicate resource assignment record opens in the side panel with pre-populated fields.

6.  Update the resource assignment and select **Submit**.
