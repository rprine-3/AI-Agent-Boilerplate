# Create an attribute-based resource assignment

Create an attribute-based resource assignment in Project Workspace. You can pre-define attributes based on your requirement.

## Before you begin

Role required: pps\_admin or it\_project\_manager

## Procedure

1.  [Create a planning attribute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-management/configure-planning-attributes.md).

    **Note:** If the assignment is attribute-based, then the assignment is created in the Unassigned state. You should have the pps\_admin role to configure the planning attributes.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Profile** &gt; **Employee Profiles**.

3.  Create an employee profile.

    For more information, see [Activate employee profile](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/activate-employee-profile.html).

4.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Project Workspace** and open a project.

5.  From the Planning pane, double-click the **Resource assignees** field for a project task.

    You can assign the resources from both planning and resource assignment pane.

6.  From the resource assignee list, select a user or group and press **Enter**.

    You can create custom attributes, such as location, in addition to group, skill, and role, and can also use these custom attributes to create resource assignments.


## Result

A resource assignment record for an attribute is created and auto-saved.

**Note:** The **Primary group**, **Primary skill**, and **Primary role** attributes can be enabled for the Resource Management. You can create more attributes based on your requirement.
