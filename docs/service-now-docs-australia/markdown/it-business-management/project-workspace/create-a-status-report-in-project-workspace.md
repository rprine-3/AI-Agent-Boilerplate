# Create a status report in Project Workspace

Create a status report in Project Workspace for your projects. Your team can view the report and be updated on project health, metrics, risks, issues, and milestones.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_pps\_admin, it\_project\_manager

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Open a project from the home page of Project Workspace.

    For information, see [Access the Project Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-workspace/access-new-project-workspace.md).

2.  Open the Status reports page of the project by selecting **Status Reports** from the list.

3.  From the Pages section, select **Create status report**.

4.  To create a status report from a template:

    1.  From the Pages section, select **Create new from template** from the drop-down.
    2.  From the "Welcome to your Template Center!" screen, select **Use** for the template that you want to use.
5.  On the Create status report form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Create status report form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-workspace/create-status-report-form.md).

6.  Select **Submit**.

    \[Omitted image "status-report-ACME.png"\] Alt text: Sample status report.

    **Note:** The status report appears with the data and information that you entered populated in the default status report template. You can replace the existing default template with your desired template and set it as default by updating the sys id in value field of system property \(sn\_pw.project\_status\_report\_default\_templateId\).

7.  Select the **More actions** icon and then perform these steps.

    1.  Select **Export as PDF** to share and archive a PDF version of the report.

    2.  Select **Keyboard shortcuts** to view keyboard shortcuts on status report.

    3.  Select **Hide Live Presence** to hide the live presence.

    4.  Select **Edit status report** to open and edit the status report.

    5.  Select **Duplicate status report** to create a copy of status report.

        You can’t edit the status report. To edit the status report, you can disable the status report read-only system property \(sn\_pw.status\_report\_doc\_read\_only\). By default, it is set to true, and the status report is read only.

8.  Make changes to the report by editing the data, formatting, organizing the content, and entering additional data.

    The changes you make to the status report here are saved to the underlying status report record, which you access from the status report related list in Projects form.

9.  Observe and monitor the report.

    If you don’t have old status reports, you can't see the import option.
