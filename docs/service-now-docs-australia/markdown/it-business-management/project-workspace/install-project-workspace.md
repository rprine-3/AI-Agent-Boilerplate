# Install Project Workspace

You can install the Project Workspace application \(sn\_pw\) if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Review the [Project Workspace](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/47e2b69f533f201016f6ddeeff7b12fa) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   Starting with Australia release, installing the PPM Standard plugin also installs the Project Workspace application.
-   Ensure you have activated the PPM Standard plugin \(com.snc.financial\_planning\_pmo\).

Role required: admin
