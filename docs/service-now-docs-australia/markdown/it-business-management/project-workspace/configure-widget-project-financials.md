# Configure a widget for project financial metrics

Configure a widget to view and track the financial metrics of a project on the **Financials** tab of the Project Workspace page.

**Important:**

Classic Project Workspace is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer available for installation but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base. Use new Project Workspace with enhanced UI to help you efficiently manage your projects.
