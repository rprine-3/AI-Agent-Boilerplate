# PMO dashboard

The PMO dashboard provides comprehensive reports to the portfolio and program managers. The dashboard uses Platform Analytics to provide a trend of historical data as well as regular reports. It gives an overview of your investments, provides a pipeline view of upcoming intake and a calendar view of upcoming dates.

**Important:**

Starting with the Australia release, the PMO dashboard is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer available for installation but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base. Use Execution dashboard in Portfolio Planning to gain real-time visibility into delivery progress across work items.
