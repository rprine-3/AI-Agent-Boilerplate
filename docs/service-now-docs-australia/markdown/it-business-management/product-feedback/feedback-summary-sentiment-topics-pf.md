# Summarize the feedback by using ServiceNow Otto for Strategic Portfolio Management

Generate a summary from the name and description of feedback records. This helps you analyze a large volume of feedback quickly without reading each record manually.

\[Omitted video\] Description: Multi feedback summarization video.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This AI skill is now turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. This change simply activates the skill and does not touch the roles that are needed to use the skill. The new default behavior works as follows:

-   **New customers**

    When you install a Otto product, designated skills will turn on automatically.

-   **Existing customers who are upgrading**

    Any previously unconfigured skill will turn on automatically \(the skill was never turned on, then off again\).

    There is no change to Otto skills that are currently enabled and customized.

    Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, will remain inactive.


If you have users with custom roles that need access to this skill, you must update ACLs for those roles and also add those custom roles to the In product role.

The Feedback or Multi feedback summarization skill is activated by default. For more information on how to activate the skill if it isn't automatically activated or if you want to change the skill configuration, see [Configure AI Admin Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-workspace/configuring-na-spm.md).

## About this task

With the feedback or multi feedback summarization skill, you can get enough details about the feedback that you received on your product. Use these details to improve the product features, usability, and performance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** and select **Feedback**.

2.  From the Feedback page, select any feedback filter card.

3.  From the feedback list, select one or multiple feedback records.

    View a loader for the side panel while the summary content loads for a more engaging loading experience.

    If you want to generate a summary for one feedback record, you can either generate it from the list level or at the record level. At the record level, the feedback summary is displayed in the Now Assist component. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary.

4.  Select **Summarize**.

    View an animation for the Otto icon when you hover over it.

    You can generate a summary of a single feedback record by using the feedback summarization skill. This image shows the AI-generated summary for a single feedback record.

    You can use the multi feedback summarization skill to generate summaries of one or multiple feedback records. For example, you can analyze the high-priority feedback, filter them, summarize the records, and gain insights into the requirements.

    **Note:** Because the information in these fields is automatically generated, it's a good idea to review the text and make sure it's accurate.

    The feedback or multi feedback summarization skill uses the name and description information of the feedback record to generate a paragraph or bullet-point summary from the feedback.

    View the hover animation for the Otto icon on the Summarize button in the feedback list and Docs.

5.  When you're finished summarizing the feedback, you can expand or collapse the summary, provide feedback, copy it, or view information about it.

If you think that the summary wasn’t helpful, select the not helpful icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-nt-helpful.png"\] Alt text: Not helpful icon.\).This feedback improves the generative AI model and can help to improve the future versions of this skill. The system gathers the feedback on each generated summary and stores it in the generative AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).

</table>    **Note:** The feedback summarization or multi summarization skill checks the feedback records to determine if enough information is available to generate a summary. If there isn't enough feedback content to summarize, you can add more content and retry.

    On the side panel, you can select the preview record icon \(\[Omitted image "preview-record-icon.png"\] Alt text: preview record icon.\) to view the additional details or select preview generated summary icon \(\[Omitted image "preview-generated-summary-icon.png"\] Alt text: Preview generated summary icon.\) to view the summarization output.

6.  Select **Copy and create epic** to copy the generated summary and create a planning item.

    Save time and streamline your workflow by linking the feedback with planning items, which eliminates the need to copy summaries. You can quickly create work items in Feedback and view them in the roadmap.
