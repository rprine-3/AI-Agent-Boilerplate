# Configuring Portfolio Planning

Learn about the process required to set up Portfolio Planning to enable your product and portfolio managers start aligning their work business objectives.

## Configuration workflow

Use the following steps as guidelines to set up Portfolio Planning. Some of these steps require the admin role and some require the sn\_align\_core.apw\_admin role.

1.  [Install Portfolio Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/install-portfolio-planning.md).
2.  Assign user roles.

    See the Roles installed table in [Components installed with Portfolio Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/installed-with-portfolio-planning.md).

    **Note:** If you are upgrading from an older version to Portfolio Planning v6.1.1 or higher, a fix script is run to remove the milestone\_editor role from the roadmap\_editor role because the roadmap\_editor role is no longer used. In this case, you may experience a longer time for the upgrade to complete if your ServiceNow instance has a large number of users with the roadmap\_editor role. For more information, see [KB1443618](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1443618).

3.  Configure lenses to enable portfolio plans.

    See [Configuring lens in Portfolio Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/configuring-lens-in-portfolio-planning.md).

4.  Integrate ServiceNow® Portfolio Planning with Project Portfolio Management \(PPM\).

    See [Portfolio Planning with Project Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/portfolio-planning-integration-with-execution-applications.md).

5.  Configure Capacity Planning and generate resource capacity.

    See [Capacity configuration in Portfolio Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/config-cp-pp.md).

6.  Enable financial planning for epics and customise the Financials screen view.

    See [Configure financials for Portfolio Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/config-fin-pp.md).


## Guided Setup to configure Portfolio Planning

Guided Setup provides a sequence of tasks to help you with the required configuration on your ServiceNow instances. After installing Portfolio Planning, navigate to **All** &gt; **** &gt; **Portfolio Planning** &gt; **Guided Setup**.

When you’re configuring a task from the Guided Setup, you can launch the in-app help for additional guidance by clicking the Show Help icon \(\[Omitted image "Banner\_HelpIcon.png"\] Alt text: Show Help.\).
