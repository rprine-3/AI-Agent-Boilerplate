# Share a portfolio plan with stakeholders

Share your portfolio plan with stakeholders and other planning managers so that they have visibility into the plan's progress and start collaborating.

## Before you begin

-   [Create a portfolio plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/create-portfolio-plan-in-portfolio-planning-workspace.md).
-   Users or groups that you want to share the portfolio plan with must have the sn\_align\_core.ap\_read\_only or sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role to get the read or edit access to the portfolio plan respectively.

Role required: sn\_align\_core.apw\_user or business\_stakeholder

## About this task

Select individual users or groups to share the portfolio with.

When you share a portfolio plan with an individual user or a group, they can access the entire portfolio plan, which includes Prioritization and Roadmap. Also, they can access the Capacity tab in the Planning page if the user has the sn\_align\_ws.spw\_capacity\_user or sn\_align\_ws.spw\_capacity\_read role.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Portfolio Planning Workspace** &gt; **Portfolio Planning**.

2.  From the list of portfolio plans, select one.

3.  From the portfolio plan header in the Planning page, select the **Share portfolio plan** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-share-pp.png"\] Alt text: Share portfolio plan with users and groups\).

    **Note:** Alternatively, you can select Share actions icon \(\[Omitted image "share-actions-pp.png"\] Alt text: Share actions of a portfolio plan.\) and then select **Copy link** to copy a direct link to the portfolio plan that you can share with other users. The link provides access only to users who already have the required permissions.

    \[Omitted image "copy-link-portfolio-plan.png"\] Alt text: Copy link to share a portfolio plan.

4.  On the Share portfolio plan form, select users to share the portfolio plan with and set their access appropriately.

    1.  In the **Members or Groups** field, enter the names of individual users or groups.

    2.  From the **Access** field, select the access level as **Viewer** or **Editor** for the selected names.

        -   An editor can view and change the portfolio plan's settings and data.
        -   A viewer can comment and add attachments to the portfolio plan, but cannot modify the portfolio plan's settings or data.

            **Note:** Even if a user has the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role, they cannot edit planning item data from the portfolio plan grid view when granted view-only access. However, users with the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role can edit planning items and related tables from the record page.

5.  Select **Send invite**.


## Result

The selected individual and group users are notified of the portfolio plan sharing through an email.
