# Portfolio Planning diagnostics

Run diagnostic scans to identify and fix errors in the configuration and other common settings for Portfolio Planning before your planning managers prioritize and roadmap their projects and demands.

Portfolio Planning diagnostic scans help you find discrepancies by validating the configuration for the following:

-   Lens and lens structure
-   Form views, list views, related list views, and workspace view rules for planning items
-   Global ranking for planning items
-   Portfolio plans

The following are the default diagnostic scans available for Portfolio Planning.
