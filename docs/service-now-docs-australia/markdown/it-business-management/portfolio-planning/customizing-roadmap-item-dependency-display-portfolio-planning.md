# Customizing roadmap item dependency display

Improve the efficiency of identifying the relationships between your planning items by choosing how the dependencies are displayed on the roadmap view.

The Personalize \(\[Omitted image "personalize-icon.png"\] Alt text: Personalize icon.\) side panel on the roadmap provides different toggles to personalize the display of dependencies on your roadmap.

-   For portfolio plan roadmaps, these toggles are always available.
-   For free-form roadmaps, these toggles are available only if the roadmap's source table is the Planning Item table \[sn\_align\_core\_planning\_item\] or one of its extensions.

**View dependencies**

 Indicates dependencies in the form of circles on either side of the planning item bars.

 These circles either contain a number inside them \(\[Omitted image "icon-dependency-circle.png"\] Alt text: Dependency circle.\), indicating the number of dependencies that item shares, or is colored red \(\[Omitted image "icon-dependency-error.png"\] Alt text: Dependency error icon.\) indicating a conflicting dependency.

 **Note:** This toggle must be enabled to use the other two toggles in the Dependencies section.
