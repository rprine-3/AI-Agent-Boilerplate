# Enable planning attributes for capacity in Portfolio Planning

Enable the planning attributes Group, Skill, and Role so that your planning managers can view the resource capacity details.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** This activation is a one-time task to enable planning attributes to plan and work on resource capacity.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Portfolio Planning** &gt; **Planning Attributes**.

2.  Filter the Attribute name to locate and open the **Group** attribute.

3.  Select the **Enable for capacity planning** option.

4.  Select **Update**.

    **Note:** If an attribute is enabled for capacity planning, it is enabled for resource management by default.

    You can create custom attributes and map them to resources. For more information, see [Create or edit planning attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-management/configure-planning-attributes.md).

6.  Set the value of the Enable for capacity planning column for Group, Role, and Skill field to **true**.


## What to do next

1.  Configure attribute values: Navigate to **All** &gt; **Strategic Planning** &gt; **Planning Attributes** to view and manage attribute values. You can add, edit, or import attribute entries for Group, Skill, and Role.
2.  Map attributes to resources: Assign the enabled planning attributes to your resources so they appear in capacity views. For custom attributes, see [Create or edit planning attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-management/configure-planning-attributes.md).
3.  Start capacity planning: Navigate to the Capacity tab in your Strategic Planning Workspace to view resource capacity based on the enabled attributes.
