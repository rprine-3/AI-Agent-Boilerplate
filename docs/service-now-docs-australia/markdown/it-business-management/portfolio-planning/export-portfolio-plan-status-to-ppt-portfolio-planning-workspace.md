# Export the portfolio plan status or roadmap to Microsoft PowerPoint

Export the status of work items, roadmap, and key metrics of your portfolio plan and free-form roadmap into a Microsoft PowerPoint file so that you can keep your business stakeholders updated on the progress. Save time by avoiding copying data into reports and drive shared outcomes by enabling collaboration even with stakeholders who cannot access your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

[Install Export to PowerPoint for Strategic Portfolio Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/install-export-to-ppt.md).

**Important:** Export to PowerPoint is available only in the GCC, NSC, SPP-AU, SPP-SG, and Australia IRAP-Protected data center environments.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following two PowerPoint templates are provided by default to generate a status report for your portfolio plan:

-   Portfolio plan status: Contains individual detailed slides for the top five items prioritized by rank.
-   Roadmap Template - default: Contains slides for Roadmap for this portfolio. You can export roadmap data for a maximum period of a year at a time.

You can customize the type of the data to be shown in the generated report by updating a predefined template or by creating your own branded template. See [Create a Microsoft PowerPoint template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/export-to-powerpoint-for-application-portfolio-management/create-ppt-template.md).
