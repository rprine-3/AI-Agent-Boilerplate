# Create a table map

Create a table map to define the mapping between tables in Portfolio Planning with the tables in Project Portfolio Management \(PPM\).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_align\_core.apw\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Portfolio Planning** &gt; **Integrations**.

2.  Select **ServiceNow Internal**.

3.  Create a new table map by selecting **New** in the **Table maps** tab.

4.  In the [Table map form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/table-map-form-ppw.md), fill in the fields.

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

A new table map is created with your alignment and execution table configurations.

**Note:** To create or update a table map for a planning item type other than demand or project, the SPM Pro license is required. Contact your administrator for more details.

## What to do next

Create a business rule to support export of this new table map configuration to PPM.
