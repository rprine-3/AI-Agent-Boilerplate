# Create a business rule for a custom table map configuration

Create a business rule to enable import for your new custom table map configuration from and Project Portfolio Management \(PPM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_align\_core\_apw.admin

## About this task

After you create a custom table map in Portfolio Planning integrations, create a business rule similar to 'Sync Data from Execution to Alignment' business rule in the rm\_epic or dmn\_demand tables.

**Note:** Ensure that the business rule is created in the execution application, PPM.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Business Rules**.

2.  From the list of available business rules, locate and open the Sync Data from Execution to Alignment rule.

3.  From the context menu \(\[Omitted image "context-menu-icon.png"\] Alt text: Context menu icon.\), perform an Insert and Stay operation on this business rule.

    If you have not enabled the **Insert and Stay** action in your ServiceNow instance, see [Allow insert options on records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/advanced-form-administration.md).

4.  On the business rule form, edit the following fields.

<table id="table_hpg_yjj_hmb"><thead><tr><th>
