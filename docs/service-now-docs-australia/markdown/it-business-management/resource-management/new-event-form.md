</td><td>

Enter a descriptive name for the event.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Select a type from list.-   **Time off:** Personal time off.
-   **Appointment:** A type of administrative task.
-   **Meeting:** A work-related meeting.
-   **Phone call:** A work-related phone call.

Task

</td><td>

Select the reference lookup icon and select the task that needs to be done.

 This field appears only if you selected Task as the type of activity.

 **Note:** This action does not add you to the **Assigned to** field on the task form.

</td></tr><tr><td>

When

</td><td>

Choose the start and end date and time, or select the All day option.

 **Important:**

When you select All day for a **Time off** event, the system allocates 24 hours for that day, not the standard 8-hour work schedule. To book time off for only your working hours \(for example, 8 hours\), specify the exact start and end times instead of selecting All day.

 The allocated hours for an event are calculated based on the duration between the start and end times you specify. To align time off with your work schedule, see [Resource schedules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/resource-management/c_UsingResourceSchedules.md).

 Do not use this field to set repeatable events.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Repeats

</td><td>

Select the frequency that the activity repeats, such as **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or select **Does not repeat**if this event is a non-repeating event.

 For example, if you have a task that you want to work on Monday and Friday, set a weekly repeatable event for Monday and Friday. See [Create repeatable events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/resource-management/t_CreateRepeatableEvents.md).
