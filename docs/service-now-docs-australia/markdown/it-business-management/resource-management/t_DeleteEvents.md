# Delete events

You can delete events you created at any time.

## Before you begin

Role required: resource\_user

## About this task

You can’t delete any events added to your calendar by a resource manager.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **My Calendar**.

2.  Find the event to delete.

    Use the icons above the calendar to locate the appropriate day, week, or month.

3.  Double-click the event.

4.  Select **Delete**.

5.  Select **OK**.


## Result

When you delete a calender event, the resource aggregate daily, weekly, and monthly tables are updated accordingly. The resource aggregate daily table isn’t enabled by default. To generate daily aggregates and store them in this table, create the **com.snc.resource\_management.generate\_daily\_aggregates** property and set the value to true.
