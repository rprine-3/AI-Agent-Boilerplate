# Update resource assignment from Project Workspace

Update a resource assignment that is associated with a project or project task.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_project\_manager

In resource assignments, any changes made to the status of group resource assignment roll down to all associated child resource assignments status. Similarly, any changes made to the status of child resource assignments automatically roll up to the corresponding group resource assignment status.

## About this task

Before updating a resource assignment, verify the following for accurate and effective resource allocation:

-   Resource availability: Check that the resource has available capacity during the assignment period. Overallocated resources are indicated with a warning icon.
-   Primary attributes: Verify the resource has the required primary attributes such as, skills or roles matching the project task requirements.
-   Existing allocations: Review the resource's current assignments across all projects to avoid conflicts or overutilization.
-   Group vs. individual: If updating a group resource assignment, note that status changes roll down to all child \(individual\) resource assignments. Similarly, individual status changes roll up to the group assignment.
-   Effort changes: If you change the effort on a group resource assignment, the effort is redistributed across all child resource assignments. For the **Hours** effort type, effort is distributed in whole hours. Any remaining hours are distributed one hour at a time, so some members can receive one hour more than others.
-   Assignment status: Verify the assignment is in the correct state \(Requested, Assigned, or Approved\) before making changes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Project Workspace** and open a project.

2.  View the resource assignment pane by enabling the **Resource assignments** toggle button.

3.  On the resource assignment pane, double-click any cell to edit the entire row.

4.  Edit the desired field, and select anywhere on the data grid to save the details.

    The resource assignment is updated in the resource assignment pane.

    When a resource is added on an empty resource assignment, which has more than one Full-time equivalent \(FTE\) effort, then an additional row is created automatically. The resource assignment is auto-updated in both the rows.

    Extend, edit, or delete the resource assignments using the row context menu in resource assignment pane.
