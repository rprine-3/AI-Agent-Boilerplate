# Atlassian Jira Integration for Agile Development

Enable bidirectional synchronization of records between Atlassian Jira and ServiceNow® Agile Development by integrating the two applications.

If the source of your work is in the ServiceNow platform while the progress of the work is tracked in Jira, you can integrate Agile Development 2.0 with Jira. This integration provides tracking of your product development efforts across both platforms.

For example, if you update a record in Jira, you can find that update in Agile Development 2.0. Similarly, if you update a record in Agile Development 2.0, you can find the same update in Jira.

When you synchronize Jira with Agile Development 2.0, you can:

-   View available Jira projects and boards in Agile Development 2.0.
-   Perform a bulk import of records from Jira to Agile Development 2.0.
-   Perform single record updates between Jira and Agile Development 2.0.
-   Avoid duplicating record update entries in Jira and Agile Development 2.0.
-   Plan, track, and update your tasks from a single application.

Starting with version 1.1.1, Atlassian Jira Integration for Agile Development 2.0 supports map configuration at the project level and not at the instance level. Also, the application supports the following project types associated with Jira Cloud and Jira Server:

-   Classic
    -   Scrum
    -   Kanban
    -   Bug tracking
-   Next-gen
    -   Scrum
    -   Kanban

**Note:** Integration with Jira Data Center, Jira Align and other Atlassian products is not available.

## Importing issues from Kanban projects in Jira

Before importing Jira projects that are of the Kanban type, consider the following notes:

-   Issues such as epics and stories are imported to Agile Development 2.0
-   If your Kanban project has one or more Jira Boards, not all those Boards would be mapped to distinct Agile groups. The Jira project is mapped to a single group in Agile Development 2.0. All issues of this project are assigned to one Agile group, regardless of their board association.
