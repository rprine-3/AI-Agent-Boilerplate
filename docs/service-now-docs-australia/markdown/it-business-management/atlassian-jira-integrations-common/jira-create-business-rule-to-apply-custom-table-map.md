# Apply custom table map configuration for Agile Development 2.0 and Jira

Create a business rule to enable export from your new custom Agile Development 2.0 table map configuration to your Jira projects.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sn\_jira\_int.admin

## About this task

After you create a custom table map for a single or multiple Jira projects, create a business rule similar to Synch Story with Jira. This rule supports export of information from this new table map from Agile Development 2.0 to Jira.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Business Rules**.

2.  From the list of available business rules, locate and open the Synch Story with Jira rule.

3.  From the context menu \(\[Omitted image "context-menu-icon.png"\] Alt text: context menu icon\), perform an Insert and Stay operation on this business rule.

    If you have not enabled the **Insert and Stay** action in your ServiceNow instance, see [Allow insert options on records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/advanced-form-administration.md).

4.  On the business rule form, edit the following fields.

<table id="table_hpg_yjj_hmb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

</td><td>

Unique name for the business rule. For example, if your new table map is to map defects, name this rule as Sync Defect with Jira.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

Select the Agile Development 2.0 table for which you've created the custom map.For example, Defect \[rm\_defect\].

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Click **Update**.
