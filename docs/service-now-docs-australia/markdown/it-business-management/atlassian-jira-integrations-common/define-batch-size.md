# Define batch size for Jira project metadata

Define a batch size value that is used to fetch the metadata from the Jira projects.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_jira\_int.admin \(with edit access\) or sn\_jira\_int.user \(with read access\).

## About this task

2.  Modify the **Define the batch size for fetching Jira project metadata** field value to a value less than 50.

    The suggested value range is 5–50.

3.  Click **Save**.
