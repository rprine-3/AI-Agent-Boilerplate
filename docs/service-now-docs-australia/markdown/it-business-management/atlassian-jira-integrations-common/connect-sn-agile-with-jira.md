# Connecting Agile Development 2.0 to Jira

Establish a connection between Agile Development 2.0 and Jira using a Jira connection alias and a Jira instance.

When you connect Agile Development 2.0 to Jira, a webhook is registered in Jira which receives the following event updates between Jira and Agile Development 2.0.

-   Creating or updating projects.
-   Creating, updating, or deleting information of epic, story, sprint, and any custom table maps and their fields.

## Create a Jira connection alias for integration with Agile Development 2.0

-   sn\_jira\_int.admin or sn\_jira\_int.user to create basic authorization credentials and HTTP\(s\) connection

### Procedure

1.  [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connection-alias.md)

    -   You can use the connection alias \(sn\_jira\_int.Jira\) that is available by default.
    -   You must create a connection alias for every Jira instance that you use.
    -   For Jira server \(on-prem\) users, ensure that the **server\_type** and **server\_version** connection attributes are present.
2.  Create [Basic authorization credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_BasicAuthCredentialsForm.md).

    Ensure that the user for whom the basic authorization credentials are created has access to all Jira projects.

3.  [Create an HTTP\(s\) connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-https-connection.md).


## Create a Jira Instance for integration with Agile Development 2.0

Create a Jira instance record using the connection alias that you created to enable the setup of Jira integration with Agile Development 2.0.
