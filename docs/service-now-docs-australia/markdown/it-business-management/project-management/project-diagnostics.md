# Use Project Diagnostics to detect corrupt project data

Project Diagnostics uses the Application Diagnostics Tool to detect corrupt data in a project, such as tasks with invalid parents, tasks without top tasks, and invalid or cyclic relations in a project.

## Before you begin

## About this task

Project Diagnostics can also detect whether date calculations in a project appear to be incorrect, the planning console does not open for a project, or a few tasks or relationships do not appear in the planning console.

## Procedure

1.  Determine whether you want to run a diagnostic scan on a single project or multiple projects.
