# Apply template to an existing project

Apply one or multiple project templates to an existing project from the project form or Planning Console.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## About this task

A project created from the off-schedule project template honors the off-schedule tasks and adjusts the dates according to the given start date.

When applying a template to a project, the project state is set to the default state. Activate the default project state \(pm\_project.state = -5\), and use it as the default value as it is Out Of The Box. You can update the label for the **State** field to meet your requirements if **Pending** doesn't fit well.

**Important:** Application of template on a project having project tasks does not apply header information and only appends project tasks after the last project task of the project.

## Procedure

1.  Apply project template to an existing project from any of the following locations.
