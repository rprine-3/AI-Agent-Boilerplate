# Updates in cost plan and recalculation of cost in project currency

If the unit cost, quantity, or fiscal period of a cost plan are updated, then all the related amount fields in the cost plan, its breakdowns, and the project to which it is rolling up are recalculated in project currency.

-   **Changes in Unit cost, Quantity, and Recurring check box of a cost plan**

    When you modify the **Unit cost** field, **Quantity** field, or **Recurring** check box of the Cost Plan form, the Total planned cost is recalculated in project currency. Similarly, the **Cost in project currency** in the Cost Plan Breakdown is also recalculated. Therefore, the values in the **Planned capital in project currency**, **Planned operating in project currency**, and the **Total planned cost in project currency** fields of the project are also recalculated.

-   **Changes in the fiscal period of a cost plan**

    When you change the fiscal period, either the start or end dates in the Cost Plan form, the **Total planned cost** and the **Cost in project currency** of the cost plan are recalculated. Therefore, the Cost Plan Breakdown records may be added or removed. If the **Recurring** check box is not selected, then the **Cost in project currency** of each Cost Plan Breakdown record is recalculated. In line with this, the values in the **Planned capital in project currency**, **Planned operating in project currency**, and the **Total planned cost in project currency** fields of the project are also recalculated.

-   **Changes in the entered cost of a cost plan**

    If you change the **Entered cost** in an individual Cost Plan Breakdown record, then the **Total planned cost** of the cost plan is recalculated in project currency. Therefore, the values in the **Planned capital in project currency**, **Planned operating in project currency**, and the **Total planned cost in project currency** fields of the project are also recalculated.

-   **Addition of breakdowns to a cost plan**

    If you manually add cost plan breakdowns to a cost plan, then the **Total planned cost** of the cost plan is recalculated in project currency. Therefore, the values in the **Planned capital in project currency**, **Planned operating in project currency**, and the **Total planned cost in project currency** fields of the project are also recalculated.
