Order

Aggregate type

</td><td>

Type of aggregation applied for the investment widget calculation: **Sum**, **Average**, **Minimum**, **Maximum**, and **Count**.For example, you are aggregating the actual cost of three projects, A, B, and C, surfaced by a filter. Actual costs are 1000 for project A, 2000 for project B, and 3000 for project C.

 If sum is selected as the aggregate type, then the actual cost metric value would be 6000. If average is selected as the aggregate type, then the actual cost metric value would be 2000. If minimum is selected as the aggregate type, then the actual cost metric value would be 1000. If maximum is selected as the aggregate type, then the actual cost metric value would be 3000. If count is selected as the aggregate type, then the actual cost metric value would be 3.

{ 
        var projectGa = new GlideAggregate(projectClass);
        projectGa.addEncodedQuery(projectFilter);
        projectGa.setGroup(false);
        projectGa.addAggregate('SUM', 'cost');

        projectGa.query();

        if(projectGa.next()) 
{
            if(projectGa.getAggregate('SUM', 'cost'))
            totalCost += parseFloat(projectGa.getAggregate('SUM', 'cost'));
