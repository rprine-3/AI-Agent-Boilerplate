# Pre-date a project task

Move the planned start date of a task prior to the planned start date of a project. Adding a pre-dated task allows you to accommodate tasks which need to start before the planned start date of a project.

## Before you begin

You should have created or added project tasks to your project.

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## About this task

Before pre-dating a project task, note the following conditions:

-   The property project.rollup\_project\_start\_date should be set to true.
-   Pre-dating a task's planned start date also moves the project's planned start date.
-   The start date of a child task cannot be moved prior to the parent task's start date. For example, if a parent task with Start no earlier than constraint starts on 20th and the child task starts on 30th, the start date of the child task can only be moved up to 20th.
