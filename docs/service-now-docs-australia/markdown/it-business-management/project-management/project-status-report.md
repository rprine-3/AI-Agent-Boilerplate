# View project status reports

Project status reports provide the most recent, at-a-glance progress of a project displayed in several categories.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## About this task

The project status report acts as a snapshot, meaning the report preserves the status of various parameters for the date and time when the status report is generated and does not display the status of various parameters dynamically. For example, the project status report created last week retains the same status as it was for that week and does not update the status dynamically.

You can use the project status reports to compare the progress of your project. Generate a new project status report for your recent changes to reflect on the report.

The project status report shows snapshot status of RIDAC \(Risk, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Request Changes\) records, key milestones, and charts only.
