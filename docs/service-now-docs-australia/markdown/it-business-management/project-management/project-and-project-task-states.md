# Project and project task states

In the base system, the states in project and project task inherit the states in Task table.

The states are grouped into different categories as shown below:

|State|Label|Category|
|-----|-----|--------|
|-5|Pending|Pending|
|1|Open|Open|
|2|Work in Progress|Work in Progress|
|3|Closed Complete|Closed|
|4|Closed Incomplete|Closed|
|7|Closed Skipped|Closed|

The category information for the states is declared in [dictionary override](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DictionaryOverrides.md) of State column in Planned task \(`planned_task`\) table in **Attributes** field. Planned task is the parent table for project and project task tables.

The start and end dates are displayed based on the project or task status:

-   Pending/Open: Planned start date is displayed.
-   Open/Work in Progress: Actual start date is displayed.
-   Closed: Actual end date is displayed.
