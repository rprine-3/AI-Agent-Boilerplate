# Activate teamspaces

You can activate one or all teamspace plugins to use the teamspaces feature.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You must activate a teamspace plugin to use the teamspace feature. Following teamspace plugins are available:

-   **Project Management TeamSpace 1** \(`com.snc.ppm_teamspace_1`\)
-   **Project Management TeamSpace 2** \(`com.snc.ppm_teamspace_2`\)
-   **Project Management TeamSpace 3** \(`com.snc.ppm_teamspace_3`\)
-   **Project Management TeamSpace 4** \(`com.snc.ppm_teamspace_4`\)
-   **Project Management TeamSpace 5** \(`com.snc.ppm_teamspace_5`\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).
