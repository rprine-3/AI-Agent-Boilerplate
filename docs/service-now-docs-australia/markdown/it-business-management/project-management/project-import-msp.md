# Project import from Microsoft Project

Import Microsoft project files into the ServiceNow Project Management application.

Users with the project manager role can import a project using:

-   Import module
-   Project form
-   Planning Console

When you import a project as a new project or into an existing project, the projects are updated as follows:

-   New project: A new record is created in the Project \[pm\_project\] table. The tasks associated with the project are added to the Project Task \[pm\_project\_task\] table.

    Only the common or [mapped fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-management/r_ProjectFieldMapping.md) are imported. Imported projects are brought into the instance with both Priority and Risk set to Low.

-   Existing project: The instance checks the Text10 field in the top-level Microsoft Project task. If the Text10 field contains a recognizable sys\_id, it means that the project was previously exported from a ServiceNow instance. In this case, the values from the project overwrite the values for the existing project.

You can also specify the schedule calculation type as **Automatic** or **Manual** for the imported tasks. When you import a project into the instance, project constraints are converted as follows:

-   The time constraint for all imported tasks, when you select calculation type as **Manual**, is set to **Start on specific date** irrespective of their constraint type in Microsoft Project.
-   The following constraint types are supported when you select calculation type as **Automatic**:

    -   **Start on specific date**
    -   **As soon as possible**
    -   **Start no later than**
    -   **Start no earlier than**
    Tasks with other constraint types are converted to **Start on specific date**.


**Note:** The resource name in Microsoft Project should map to the name of the user in the instance.
