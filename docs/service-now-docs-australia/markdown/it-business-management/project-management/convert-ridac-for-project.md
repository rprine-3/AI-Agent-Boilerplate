# Convert RIDAC records for a project

Convert one RIDAC record \(risk, issue, action, decision, and request changes\) to another, in that order, to retain the record information instead of having to create a new record manually and to more easily track the issue.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## About this task

When you convert a RIDAC record to another record, the values for the **Short description**, **Requester**, and **Assigned to** fields are carried forward.

You can also specify to close the parent record on creation of the new record instead of manually closing the parent record.

You can also view the consolidated list of all converted RIDAC records using the **View RIDAC** related link on the Project form and **View RIDAC** in the application navigator of the Project module.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Project** &gt; **Projects** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select the project for which you want to convert a risk, issue, decision, action, or request change record to another RIDAC record.

3.  From the Project form related list, select the risks, issues, decisions, actions, or request changes record to open the form view.

4.  Select the **Convert to RIDAC** related link on the form.

5.  On the Convert dialog box, from the Select task type list, select the RIDAC record to which you want to convert the selected record.

    For example, if you wanted to convert a risk to an issue, you would select **Issue**.

6.  Modify the text in the **Short description** field, which is copied from the parent record.

7.  Change the default assignment copied from the parent record in the **Assigned to** field by selecting the lookup icon \(\[Omitted image "lookup\_icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup icon\) and selecting a different user.

8.  If you want to close the parent RIDAC record on creation of the new record, select the close parent record option.

    The label of the close parent record option changes depending on the parent record type. For example, if the parent record is Risk and you are converting it to an issue record, the close record option would appear as **Close Risk**.

9.  Select **OK**.
