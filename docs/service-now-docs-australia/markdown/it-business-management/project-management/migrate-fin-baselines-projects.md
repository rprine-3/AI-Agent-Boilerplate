# Migrate financial baselines of projects to Next Experience

Migrate the financial baselines of your project to Next Experience to manage the financial using Project Workspace.

## About this task

Next Experience uses new data model that has two new tables Investment Baselines `(sn_invst_pln_invst_investment_baseline)` and Investment Baseline Header `(sn_invst_pln_invst_investment_baseline_header)` which are used to capture financial baselines. The financial baselines created for demands in classic experience aren’t visible in Next Experience. You can migrate the existing baselines from classic to Next Experience as an on-demand activity for the required projects, or as bulk by activating and running a scheduled job.

Baselines view in the Next Experience provides better insights to view and analyze the financial performance of your projects.

Unlike the financial baselines created using Next Experience, the financial baselines created in the Classic UI don’t capture the actual expenses along with planned costs as a default behavior. To have relevant information for baselines comparison, the actual costs are captured as part of the baseline migration using the processed expense lines as of the baseline creation date of the financial baseline.

For detailed information and use cases on using financials in Next Experience, see [Managing financials for planning items in Portfolio Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-planning/using-financials-pp.md).

**Note:** Starting March 2026 release, for customers using multicurrency, migration of financial baselines updates the baseline data in project currency to investment currency.

1.  Existing projects that have only project baselines but no investment baselines. With the migration, project baseline will be migrated to investment baseline and you can view the migrated baseline from the `sn_invst_pln_invst_investment_baseline` table list view.
2.  Existing projects that have both project and investment baselines, you need to run the scheduled job to populate the fields for investment currency in the baselines with the values from project currency. For more information, see [Activate scheduled job to populate to multicurrency fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/multi-currency-scheduled-job-spw.md).

## Before you begin

The data in project currency fields will be migrated to investment currency fields on migrating baselines for customers using multicurrency.
