# Compare schedule baselines of a project

Compare baselines to review variance between tasks and identify which task has variance from the current planned end date and the baseline end date. The baseline variance column displays the amount of variance between the two date comparisons.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_project\_manager

## About this task

[Create schedule baselines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-management/t_CreateAProjectBaseline.md) at various stages of a project, for example, at the end of each phase or after every calendar month or quarter. Each baseline captures the schedule information of project tasks at a particular moment. This snapshot provides a basis for comparison and helps you to identify and review the changes made to the project. Having multiple baselines and comparing them helps you track the performance of your projects.

## Procedure

1.  To compare the schedule baselines of a project, use one of the following options.

<table id="choicetable_wgp_h4y_tfb"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d230977e64">

Steps

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d230977e73">

**From the Planning Console**

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Project** &gt; **Projects** &gt; **All**.
2.  Open the project for which you want to compare baselines.
3.  On the Project form, select the **Planning Console** related link.
4.  On the Planning Console, select the more actions icon \(\[Omitted image "gannt\_chart\_icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\) and then from the Baselines list, select a baseline.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d230977e121">

**From the Baseline form**

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Project** &gt; **Projects** &gt; **All**.
2.  Open the project for which you want to compare baselines.
3.  On the Project form, select the Baselines related list.
4.  Open a baseline.
5.  On the Baseline form, select the **View Baseline on Planning Console** related link.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    The Planning Console displays the selected schedule baseline.

2.  On the Planning Console, select different baselines to view schedule variance information of project tasks.

    The following columns display the baseline information:

    -   **Baseline start date**: The planned start date for the task.
    -   **Baseline end date**: The planned end date for the task.
    -   **Baseline variance**: The difference between the baseline end date and planned end date. The value of this field column if there are any changes made to the project tasks or project. If the planned end date for a task is prior to the baseline date, the variance is shown as a negative value. For example, for a task with the planned end date of April 24 and the baseline created on April 17 means it is past due or late. The Baseline variance column in this case displays a value of -5 days.
    **Note:** Use the show or hide columns in gantt icon \(\[Omitted image "gear\_icon.png"\] Alt text: Show or hide coloumns in gantt icon\) to add these columns to the Planning Console.
