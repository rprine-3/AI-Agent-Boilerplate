</table>All the flows, except the subflows, are inactive by default. Enable the collaboration between PPM and Slack or Microsoft Teams for a specific action by activating these flows. You can view all these flows by navigating to **Flow Designer** &gt; **Designer** and filtering the flows by the PPM collaboration application. For more information, see [Activate a flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flow-activate.md).

If you want to update the configuration for any of these flows, you can edit them. For example, if you want to update the time of daily status update from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, you can edit the Daily Project Status Slack \[daily\_project\_status\] or Daily Project Status Teams \[daily\_project\_status\_teams\] flow. For more information, see [Edit a flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flow-edit.md).
