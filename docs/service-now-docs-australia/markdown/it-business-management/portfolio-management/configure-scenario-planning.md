## Before you begin

**Important:** Modifying the planning type and scope deletes all your existing scenarios and confirmed plans.

    **Note:** This option is available only when the Investment Funding for PPM \(com.snc.investment\_planning\_pmo\) plugin is active and planning type is selected as **Annual Financial and Resource Capacity Based Planning**.

    -   If the planning scope is **Single Selected Portfolio**, the target amount of that portfolio is retrieved from the **New Fund** column for the selected portfolio investment. For more information, see [Allocate funds to an investment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/investment-funding/allocate-funds-to-investment.md).
    -   If the planning scope is **All Portfolios**, specify a source to retrieve the target amount.
        1.  Select a funding entity from the Funding Entity list from which your demands and projects will be funded.
        2.  Select the transaction table for the selected funding entity from the Funding Record list.
6.  Click **Update**.


## Result

The scenario planning configuration is updated and all scenario plans and confirmed plans are deleted. The configuration changes also updates the Portfolio Planning Workbench to enable you to do scenario planning based on the updated planning type and scope.
