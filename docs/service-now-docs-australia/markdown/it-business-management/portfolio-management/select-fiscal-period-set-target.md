# Set target budget for a fiscal year

When planning for a portfolio or all portfolios, start by selecting the fiscal period for the demands and projects that you want to work with. You then set the target amounts for both operating and capital expenses of portfolios when Scenario Planning is not integrated with Investment Funding.

## Before you begin

Role required: it\_portfolio\_manager or it\_pps\_admin

## About this task

Internal groups typically provide the target amount for a fiscal year. The target for the planned fiscal year can be 110% of the amount spent in the last year based on actual expenditure. The target is the starting point for planning projects for the next fiscal year.

**Note:** The PPS admin can set the portfolio target by navigating to **Project Administration** &gt; **Enter Portfolio Target**.

If Scenario Planning is integrated with Investment Funding, the target amount is retrieved from the top investment fund allocated for a single portfolio or all portfolios.

For information on how to configure the investment funding settings for a single portfolio or all portfolios, see [Configure the scenario planning type and scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/portfolio-management/configure-scenario-planning.md).

For information on creating a top level investment and allocating funds, see the [Create a top-level investment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/investment-funding/create-top-level-investment.md) topic.
