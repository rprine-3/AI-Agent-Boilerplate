# Connecting EAP with Collaborative Work Management

Enhance visibility and streamline planning for your Agile teams by connecting Enterprise Agile Planning \(EAP\) with Collaborative Work Management \(CWM\).

## Overview of EAP-CWM connection

The EAP-CWM integration enables organizations to connect strategic program planning with team-level execution in a single system, eliminating silos and improving delivery predictability.

Using EAP, program managers and release train engineers can define Program Increment \(PI\) objectives, align Epics, Features, and Stories, create sprints for teams, and manage cross-team dependencies. After completing a PI, they can conduct PI retrospectives and update roadmaps for the next cycle. These capabilities ensure that enterprise priorities are clearly structured and traceable across all levels.

By linking EAP to CWM. Product owners and team members can plan and execute sprints. They can also manage agile stories alongside operational tasks such as incidents, track progress, and hold team-level retrospectives, all within the same workspace.

This connection between the applications reduces context switching and ensures that both planned and unplanned work is accounted for, without losing alignment to strategic goals. The result is end-to-end transparency where leadership can track progress against PI goals through EAP, while teams maintain flexibility to adapt to changing priorities.

## Workflow of EAP-CWM integration

1.  EAP admin connects an EAP team to CWM. See [Connect an EAP team with CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/connect-an-eap-team-with-cwm.md).
2.  A new Space and Board are created for this EAP team in the CWM workspace.
3.  Existing work items assigned to this EAP team are brought over to the newly created CWM Board through Connected Work filters.
4.  Sprint planning view is enabled for this CWM Board where the existing work items and sprints are automatically shown.
5.  Check team's access to CWM and provide the CWM user \[sn\_cwm.cwm\_user\] to all team members.
6.  EAP team can start creating more work, manage current work, and update progress directly from the CWM Board. See [Sprint planning in CWM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/collaborative-work-management/agile-sprint-planning-in-cwm.md).
7.  The team's progress and work status is reflected back on the Team dashboard in the EAP workspace. See [EAP Agile Team dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/eap-agile-team-dashboard.md)

## Creating or managing sprints for EAP teams in CWM

For EAP teams integrated with CWM, existing sprints and their scheduled work automatically sync to CWM. These details are displayed in the Sprint Planning view on the CWM Board.

As the team progresses through assigned work, they can update the work status directly in the Sprints section. The sprint can be marked **Complete** from this view and any incomplete work items can be moved either to the backlog or the next sprint, if it exists.

New sprints for the team must be created in EAP. After creating new sprints in EAP, they will sync to CWM, allowing the team to schedule work into these sprints from CWM.

When you change the start date or the end date of an iteration in EAP, the linked sprint in CWM is updated with the new dates. Sprints that don't follow a planning calendar entry sync by using the dates on the iteration record itself. A team on a configuration with a single level of iterations can connect to CWM and keep its own cadence. For more information, see [Creating iterations for teams in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/simplified-iteration-creation-in-eap.md).

**Note:** Sprints for EAP teams are not created directly at the Agile team level. Sprints are created automatically when a Planning Interval \(PI\) is defined for the parent Agile Release Train \(ART\) in EAP and sync to CWM automatically. On a configuration that has a single level of iterations, an Agile Team creates its Sprints directly and those Sprints sync in the same way.

## Backlog and Hierarchy tabs for connected teams

The Backlog and Hierarchy tabs in EAP remain available for teams connected to CWM, so you can continue to view and manage the team's work items in EAP.

Because sprints are started and completed from the CWM Board, the **Start Sprint** and **Complete Sprint** options are hidden in the EAP Backlog for these teams. For more information, see [Start or complete iterations in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/start-or-complete-iteration-in-eap.md).
