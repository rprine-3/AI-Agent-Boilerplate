# Breakdown work from parent work item into child items in EAP

Streamline breaking down work by creating child work items directly from the parent record page in Enterprise Agile Planning workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apw\_advanced.eap\_user

## About this task

\[Omitted video\] Description: Breakdown work into child work items.

From the full details page of a work item, you can create all types of associated child work items. For example, based on the EAP configuration, the full details page of an Epic shows separate tabs for its child work items \(Capabilities, Features, or Stories\). Similarly, the full details page of a Capability shows separate tabs for Features and Stories.

Use the **New** button in each of these related tabs to breakdown work from the parent work item record.

**Note:** Views for all default EAP configurations include child item-specific related lists to enable work breakdown. For any new or custom configuration, work with your EAP admin to include these related lists in the EAP views for your configuration.

This task provides guidance to create child items directly from the parent work item record page. For example, it explains how to create a Capability record as the child item for an Epic.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Enterprise Agile Planning**.

2.  From the Agile structure section of the left navigation panel, choose your EAP team.

3.  From the Backlog or Planning board, open the work item that you want to create the child items for and select **Full details**.

4.  Select the related tab in which you want to create a child item.

    Any child items that are already associated are shown in the tabs. The Digital Onboarding Epic already has 6 Capabilities, 1 Feature, and 2 Stories associated to it.

5.  Select **New** to create a child item.

    For example, to add a new Capability to the Digital Onboarding Epic, select **New** from the Capabilities tab.

    An empty form to fill out the details of the child item opens. The Parent work item field is automatically set to the parent record, which is in this case **Digital Onboarding**.

6.  Fill in the details for the child work item and select **Save**.

    The full details page of the newly created child work item is opened.

7.  Navigate back to the parent work item record page using the breadcrumb navigation.
