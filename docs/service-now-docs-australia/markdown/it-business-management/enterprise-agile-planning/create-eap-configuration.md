# Create or update a configuration in EAP

Define your own Agile configuration or update an existing configuration in Enterprise Agile Planning \(EAP\).

## Before you begin

[Install Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/install-alignment-planner-workspace.md).

Set the Application Scope of your ServiceNow instance to Strategic Planning.

Role required: sn\_apw\_advanced.eap\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace**.

2.  From the **Settings** menu, select **Enterprise Agile Planning** &gt; **Configuration**.

3.  Choose to create a configuration or update an existing one.

    -   To create, select **New configuration**.
    -   To update, select **Edit** from one of the available configurations.

4.  On the form, fill in or update the fields.

<table id="table_ihv_5bq_d1c"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Configuration name

</td><td>

Name to identify the configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

State of the configuration. The default value for this field is **Inactive**.Change it to **Active** to make it available to use for your Agile teams in Enterprise Agile Planning.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sync with Agile Development

</td><td>

Select this option to sync iterations such as Planning Intervals and Sprints with Agile Development 2.0. For more information, see [Integration between EAP and Agile Development 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/sync-eap-and-agile-2.md).If your team is of the Kanban type, you can leave this option unselected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow unique cadence for each team

</td><td>

Option to let each team set its own iteration dates.If the configuration has planning calendars at more than one team level, each top-level team receives its own calendar. If the configuration has a single level of iterations, such as Sprints only, the iterations carry their own dates instead of following a calendar.

Teams that you add after you select this option receive a unique calendar. Teams that already exist continue to use the default calendar of the configuration. Selecting this option doesn't change the iterations that already exist.

For more information, see [Creating iterations for teams in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/simplified-iteration-creation-in-eap.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select the work item types to be available within this configuration.

    Only the work item types that you enable here are available for your Agile teams in the Backlog and Planning board.

    \[Omitted image "eap-work-item-types-enable.png"\] Alt text: Select work item types for EAP configuration.

6.  Select the team levels that you want to have in your configuration.

    Based on the team levels that you enable here, you can add only those entities to your Agile structure. For example, if you didn’t enable **Solution Train** team level in the configuration, you can’t add any solution trains to your Agile structure. You also can’t plan work for any solution trains from the Backlog or Planning board.

7.  Select the default work item type to be available at each team level and its planning calendar.

    -   **Scrum teams with a regular cadence**

        Planning calendars can be set only for Agile Release Trains \(ARTs\) and Agile Teams and the planning calendar types available by default are **Planning Interval**, **Sprint**, and **Scrum Sprint**. If you want a different calendar, create one. See [Create a planning calendar in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/create-planning-calendar-type-in-eap.md).

        A configuration holds one planning calendar for each team level. A team level that has no planning calendar, such as Portfolio or Solution Train, doesn't have iterations of its own. In the default configurations, only the ART and Agile Team levels have a planning calendar, which gives you two levels of iterations: Planning Intervals on ARTs and Sprints on Agile Teams.

    -   **Kanban teams**

        If your team operates in a Kanban style, which is a continuous workflow structure without any regular planning interval schedule, you can set the **Planning calendar** fields to **None**.

8.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

-   If you have updated the planning calendar selection for any active configuration that has teams associated with it, update the relevant dashboard configuration too. This action ensures that the metrics displayed for those teams are accurate. See [Updating dashboards for planning calendar changes in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/updating-dashboards-for-planning-calendar-changes-in-eap.md).
