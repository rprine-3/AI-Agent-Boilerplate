## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Enterprise Agile Planning**.

2.  From the Agile structure section of the navigation panel, choose your EAP team that has an epic or feature as its work item type.

3.  From the Backlog or Planning board pages, select an epic or a feature for which you want to create stories.

    The work item details are displayed in the side panel.

4.  From the side panel, select **Full details**.

5.  From the work item header, select **Create stories** to open the ServiceNow Otto panel and trigger the Create stories agentic workflow.

    The AI agent generates story recommendations based on the context available within the epic or feature.

6.  Go through the story recommendations and choose to confirm, combine, split, remove any of the stories, suggest modifications, or create more stories.

    **Tip:** While ServiceNow Otto is working on the story recommendations for the current work item, you can start a new chat to create stories for another epic or feature. Select **New chat** \(\[Omitted image "icon-na-new-chat.png"\] Alt text:\) from the ServiceNow Otto panel header. You can switch between chats by selecting **All chats** \(\[Omitted image "icon-na-all-chats.png"\] Alt text:\).

7.  You can iterate on any of these actions and when you’re satisfied with the recommendations, enter **Save**.

    ServiceNow Otto creates stories with the confirmed recommendations. The newly created stories are displayed in the Stories tab of the epic or feature details page.
