The height of the bubble from the x-axis shows the time \(in days\) to move from an in-progress state to completion. The size of the story bubbles is relative to each other based on their story points.

Pointing your cursor to a bubble on that chart shows story data such as story points, duration in days to complete, and name.

You can compare the cycle times of stories with different story points and analyze the trend in the time taken by the team to complete them.

**Note:** The cycle time chart currently doesn't support selecting the story bubble to drill down into the stories.
