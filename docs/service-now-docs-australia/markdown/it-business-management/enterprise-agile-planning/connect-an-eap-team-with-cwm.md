# Connect an EAP team with CWM

Establish a connection to CWM by setting your EAP team's Agile tool to Collaborative Work Management.

## Before you begin

Ensure that **Application Scope** of your ServiceNow instance is set to **Strategic Planning**.

Role required: sn\_apw\_advanced.eap\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace**.

2.  From the **Settings** menu, select **Enterprise Agile Planning** &gt; **Agile structure**.

3.  Select an EAP team that you want to connect with CWM.

4.  Set the **Team agile tool** field to **Collaborative Work Management**.
