# Assess the status of an epic using ServiceNow Otto

Use the Epic status assessment skill to evaluate epic health across six risk dimensions in Enterprise Agile Planning \(EAP\). ServiceNow Otto returns a red, yellow, or green health status with plain-English reasoning, giving portfolio managers a consolidated view of epic risks.

Role required: sn\_apw\_advanced.eap\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Enterprise Agile Planning**.

2.  From the Agile structure section of the navigation panel, choose your EAP team that has an epic as its work item type.

3.  From the Backlog, Hierarchy, or Planning board tabs, open your epic in its full details page.

4.  From the Details tab, select **Epic status**.

    ServiceNow Otto evaluates the epic and displays a status assessment card at the top of the page. The card shows a red, yellow, or green health status with reasoning based on the following dimensions:

    -   Story health: stories with zero story points or no sprint assigned.
    -   Blocked stories: stories that are actively blocked.
    -   Dependencies: stories waiting on incomplete prerequisite work.
    -   Progress: percent complete compared to expected progress.
    -   Timeline: overdue dates, upcoming end dates, or missing date fields.
    -   Ownership: no epic owner assigned or stories with no assignee.
