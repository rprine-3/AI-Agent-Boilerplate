# Start or complete iterations in EAP

Start an iteration of a Sprint or PI so that your team can start working and tracking progress of work. After your team finishes the assigned work, mark this iteration as complete, directly from the Backlog in Enterprise Agile Planning.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cwm.cwm\_user

This task doesn't apply to teams connected to CWM. For these teams, start or complete sprints from the CWM Board instead. For more information, see [Connecting EAP with Collaborative Work Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/integrate-eap-with-collaborative-work-management.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Enterprise Agile Planning**.

2.  From the Agile structure section of the left navigation panel, choose your EAP team.

3.  Complete an iteration.

    1.  From the Backlog page, locate the iteration that you want to complete and select **Complete &lt;iteration&gt;**.

        -   For a Sprint, the option is displayed as **Complete Sprint**.
        -   For a PI, the option is displayed as **Complete Planning Interval**.
        **Note:** Before marking a Planning Interval as Complete, all its associated child Sprints must be complete.

        \[Omitted image "eap-complete-sprint.png"\] Alt text: Complete Sprint in EAP.

    2.  Depending on the amount of work that's left incomplete for the current iteration, confirm its completion.

        -   If there are incomplete work items in the current iteration, you're asked to move the incomplete items to the Backlog or any future iteration.

            \[Omitted image "eap-complete-sprint-1.png"\] Alt text: Move incomplete items and confirm Sprint's completion.

        -   If all assigned work is complete, then the iteration is automatically marked complete without any confirmation from you.
        **Note:** When you complete any iteration, it is no longer displayed in the Backlog page, and all the work items which are completed in that iteration are no longer available to view from the Backlog page either.

    The **Spillover** and **New scope** fields on the iteration are calculated from its stories.

    -   **Spillover**

        Sum of the story points of the committed stories that are no longer in the iteration when it completes.

    -   **New scope**

        Sum of the story points of the stories that were added to the iteration after it started.

    Both fields are read-only. Select a value to open the stories that it counts. Cancelled stories aren't counted, and the values are calculated only for iterations that you complete after you upgrade to this release.

4.  Start an iteration.

    1.  From the Backlog page, locate the iteration that you want to start and select **Start &lt;iteration&gt;**.

        -   For a Sprint, the option is displayed as **Start Sprint**.
        -   For a PI, the option is displayed as **Start Planning Interval**.
        \[Omitted image "eap-start-sprint.png"\] Alt text: Start next sprint in EAP.

    The stories that are in the iteration when it starts are recorded as its committed stories. This set is what the **Spillover** and **New scope** fields are measured against when you complete the iteration.
