## About this task

This task details the procedure of creating stories for work items such as Epic, Capability, and Feature and uses the example of creating stories for an Epic. To create other child work items, see [Breakdown work from parent work item into child items in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/breakdown-work-eap-epics-capabilities-child-work.md).

2.  From the Agile structure section of the navigation panel, choose your EAP team.

3.  From the Backlog or Planning board pages, select a work item for which you want to create stories.

    In this example, an epic is selected and its details are displayed in the side panel.

4.  From the side panel, select **Full details**.

5.  From the work item details page, create stories manually or with Now Assist.

See [Create stories agentic workflow using ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/generate-agile-story-planning-items.md).

 For epics and features, you can use the generative AI skills of Now Assist to automatically generate stories, saving time and reducing manual effort. See [Generate multiple stories at once in EAP using ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/generate-stories-from-epics-now-assist-eap.md).

**Note:** This feature requires activating the Agile story generation skill of ServiceNow Otto for SPM.
