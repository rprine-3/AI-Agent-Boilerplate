# Manage team backlog in EAP

Using the Backlog page of Enterprise Agile Planning, create, update, and prioritize work items. Additionally, schedule work items into iterations such as Planning Intervals \(PI\) or Sprints.

\[Omitted image "eap-backlog.png"\] Alt text: EAP Backlog.

The following sections provide a brief overview of EAP Backlog and the actions that you can perform in it.

## Layout and default grouping

The layout of Backlog across different team levels such as Agile Team, Agile Release Train \(ART\), Solution Train, or Portfolio, remains the same. The change is in the way that the work items are grouped. As you go bottom to top in an Agile structure, the work assigned to the teams is grouped as follows:

**Important:** The team hierarchy and the iterations within teams are based on your EAP configuration. The following information applies to the default Full Configuration.

-   Agile Team: Grouped by Sprints.
-   ART: Grouped by Planning Intervals.
-   Solution Train: Grouped by child ARTs.
-   Portfolio: Grouped by child Solution Trains.

Any work item that doesn't fall into any of these groups is displayed in the Backlog section.

By default, the number of iterations that the Backlog page displays is set to 6. You can work with your admin to modify this number using a system property. For more information, see [Configure the display limit of iterations in EAP Backlog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/configure-the-display-limit-of-iterations-in-eap-backlog.md).

## Layout and default grouping for Kanban teams

The Backlog for teams using the Kanban configuration is grouped as follows:

-   Portfolio: Assigned work items are grouped by child teams. Any work item that is not assigned to the child teams is displayed in the Backlog section.

    \[Omitted image "eap-kanban-portfolio-backlog.png"\] Alt text: Backlog view of EAP Kanban portfolio.

-   Team: Assigned work is displayed in a list.

## Default work items

The work items shown in Backlog are of the Type that is mapped for this team in the configuration. As you move up in your Agile structure, the level of the work assigned also increases. At an Agile Team level, you see information of stories. As you move up through ARTs and Portfolios, you see information of Features, Capabilities, and Epics. However, at any level, you can change the type of the work items displayed.

\[Omitted image "eap-backlog-item-type.png"\] Alt text: Work item mapping for an EAP team.

For example, in the screenshot, **Capability** is the default item type mapped to **Compliance and onboarding tech** Solution Train based on its configuration. You can change this selection to see work of other types assigned to this team. When this selection is changed to **Feature**, you can see all the features assigned to this ART. Similarly, you can choose to create and assign a different type of work item for this Solution Train, even though its default item type is **Capability**.

View the details of any work item in the side panel by selecting its primary column. To access all the fields and related lists of the work item, select **Full details** from the side panel.

**Note:** The Backlog page for an EAP team shows only those work items that are enabled in its default configuration. For example, for an ART with Full Configuration, the Backlog might show only Features by default. If you want to view other work item types such as Capabilities, Epics, or Stories, work with your admin to update the required EAP configuration details. For more information, see [Configure display of other work item types in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/configure-other-work-item-types-for-eap-teams-in-backlog-and-planning-board.md).

## Completed and cancelled items in Backlog

The Backlog section hides completed and cancelled work items by default, so the list shows only items that are active and ready to plan or schedule. Sprint and Planning Interval \(PI\) sections continue to show all work items, giving you visibility into both ongoing and finished work for each iteration.

You can work with your admin to change either default per section using two system properties: `sn_apw_advanced.show_inactive_items_in_backlog_list` for the Backlog section and `sn_apw_advanced.show_inactive_items_in_iteration` for iteration sections. For more information about both properties, see [Properties installed with Enterprise Agile Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/properties-installed-with-enterprise-agile-planning.md).

## Column-level filtering of data

Quickly find the work items that you need by using column-level filters for the data on your EAP Backlog. Using the Column filtering option \(\[Omitted image "eap-icon-backlog-column-filter.png"\] Alt text:\), you can filter data on any column displayed on the **Backlog** tab, which is of the type choice, string, or reference.

\[Omitted image "eap-backlog-column-level-filters.png"\] Alt text: Column level filtering for EAP Backlog.

## Actions within the Backlog

Within the Backlog, you can perform the following actions:

-   Create iterations such as PIs or Sprints for your teams.
-   Add work to the team's Backlog.
-   Schedule work from Backlog into different iterations.
-   Make in-line edits to update information of work such as Status, Assigned to, or Story points.
-   Reorder planning items \(in a section\) to prioritize them.

    However, reordering is not possible when the planning items are grouped. For example you grouped the items in the Backlog section by State, you won't be able to reorder the items unless the grouping is removed.

-   Start and complete those iterations.
-   Move incomplete work to the Backlog.
-   Filter the data that's displayed.
-   Choose the columns to be displayed.
-   Open a work item in a new tab.

Use the following tasks to start creating and scheduling work for teams in EAP.
