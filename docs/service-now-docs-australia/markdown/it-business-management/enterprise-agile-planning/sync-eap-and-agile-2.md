# Integration between EAP and Agile Development 2.0

While setting up a configuration in Enterprise Agile Planning, you can establish an integration with Agile Development 2.0. Learn more about the tables connected and the way you access the information.

\[Omitted image "eap-new-config-form.png"\] Alt text: Option to enable sync with Agile Development 2.0 in EAP Configuration.

In the EAP configuration form, when you enable the **Sync with Agile Development** option, information of the following tables is synced between the two apps.

<table id="table_p3h_2qz_21c"><thead><tr><th>

EAP tables

</th><th>

Agile Development 2.0 tables

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Enterprise agile iteration \[sn\_apw\_advanced\_eap\_iteration\]

</td><td>

Sprint \[rm\_sprint\]

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>When this sync is established for a configuration, the following are the functionality changes:

-   **Sprint creation and updates**
    -   Creating a Sprint is suggested to be done from EAP.
    -   Creating a Sprint in EAP creates a related Sprint in Agile Development 2.0.

        If the dates of the Sprint in EAP overlap with a record in the rm\_sprint table, then a new Sprint isn’t created for Agile Development 2.0. You can either choose to create sprints for non-overlapping dates or delete the existing sprint from the rm\_sprint table.

    -   Fields of planned start and end dates for Sprints in Agile Development 2.0 become read-only, and are derived from the business calendar spans mapped to the iterations in EAP.

        If an iteration doesn't follow a calendar entry, the dates are derived from the start date and the end date on the iteration itself.

    -   Sprints that an Agile Team creates on a configuration with a single level of iterations sync to Agile Development 2.0 even though they don't follow a planning calendar entry. For more information, see [Creating iterations for teams in EAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/simplified-iteration-creation-in-eap.md).
    -   Updating Sprint details in EAP updates the corresponding Sprint details in Agile Development 2.0.

        Changing the start date or the end date of an iteration updates the dates on the corresponding Sprint.

    -   Deleting Sprints from EAP deletes the corresponding record from the Sprint \[rm\_sprint\] table.
    -   On the Sprint \[rm\_sprint\] table, reference fields are created for parent of the EAP iteration and the EAP team this iteration belongs to.
-   **Story creation and updates**
    -   All Stories scheduled for any Sprints in this configuration can be accessed in Sprints of Agile Development 2.0.

        You can track the progress of this Sprint from the Agile board.

    -   Any changes made to the story details or its progress are visible in both the applications.
    -   On the Story \[rm\_story\] table, reference fields are created for EAP team, iteration, configuration, and parent work item in the EAP fields related list.
    -   If a story is rescheduled to a different sprint or moved to the Backlog on the Agile board, it's updated in EAP and vice versa.

**Note:** The Story records for EAP are by default saved in the Story \[rm\_story\] table, which is installed with the Agile Development 2.0 plugin.
