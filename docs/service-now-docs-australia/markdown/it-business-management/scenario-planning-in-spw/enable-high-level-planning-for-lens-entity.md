# Enable high-level planning for a lens entity

To enable high-level planning on for an entity in Strategic Planning Workspace, update the lens entity configuration.

## Before you begin

[Create portfolio plan configuration for high-level planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/create-portfolio-plan-configuration-for-high-level-planning.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

For the table that you want to enable high-level planning, set the **Planning enabled** field to **Yes** in the Lens form. Completing this task would enable your planning managers to create portfolio plans using this table as a planning item, in Strategic Planning Workspace.

For this task, consider the example of Strategic Investments as the lens and the Strategic Priority \[sn\_gf\_strategy\] table as the high-level planning entity.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Strategic Planning** &gt; **Lenses**.

2.  Select and open the lens that you want to use for high-level planning.

    For example, select **Strategic Investments**.

3.  In the Lens structures related list of the Lens form, set the **Planning enabled** field of your high-level entity to **true**.

    For example, set the Planning enabled field of Strategic Priority entity to **true**.

    If your high-level entity is not a part of your lens structure, you can add it. See [Add or modify lens structure in Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/define-lens-structure-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md).

    \[Omitted image "planning-enabled-field.png"\] Alt text: Planning enabled field for a lens entity in the Lens structures related list of a Lens form.

4.  Save the Lens form.


## Result

Your planning managers can now create portfolio plans on the Strategic Investment lens and use Strategic Priority as their planning item.

**Important:** Once a portfolio plan is creating based on this entity, you can neither disable high-level planning for it nor delete the entity record from the lens structure.
