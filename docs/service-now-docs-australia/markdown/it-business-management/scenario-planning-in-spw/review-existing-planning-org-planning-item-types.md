# Review existing planning item types in Strategic Planning

Before you create a portfolio plan using lenses, start with verifying that the default planning item types in Strategic Planning suit your company's planning needs.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have the details of your company's planning needs.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Tables**.

2.  Filter the list of tables by using **sn\_align\_core** in the Name column.

3.  Review the tables that have **Planning Item** in the Extends table column.

    Confirm if those are all the tables that you would require to set up lens required for portfolio plans.


## What to do next

If you need a planning item type other than those available, use one of the five pre-defined custom planning item tables or you can create your own.
