# Update the actual value of a target breakdown

Update the actual value of a target breakdown when its status is changed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apw\_advanced.spw\_goal\_user and \(sn\_align\_core.apw\_user or sn\_gf.goal\_admin\)

## About this task

Updating the actual value of a target breakdown automatically updates the actual value of its target. After the **Actual to date** field of the target is updated, the progress value for the target and its goal are auto-updated.

**Note:** Only the owner or contributors of the goal can update the target breakdowns.

## Procedure

1.  Open the target record of the goal using one of the following options.

<table id="choicetable_whk_swd_tw"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d93662e68">

Option

</th><th align="left" id="d93662e71">

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Portfolio Planning**.
2.  Select **Portfolio Plans**.
3.  From the list of portfolio plans, select the required portfolio plan that the goal belongs to.
4.  In the Goals view, select the **Goals and targets** tab.
5.  From the goals and targets list, select the target record that you want to update the actual value for and select the add remarks icon \(\[Omitted image "add-remarks-icon.png"\] Alt text: Add remarks icon.\) in the **Actual** column of the target breakdown.
