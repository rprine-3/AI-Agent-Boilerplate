## About this task

Lists menu in the Workspace homepage helps planning managers quickly find a record that they need. By default, this view shows the list of entities of all the planning items and lens available for this ServiceNow instance. If your planning managers need more categories or lists, you can add them.

For more information of configuring lists in a workspace, see [Lists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/migration-lists.md).

1.  Navigate to **sys\_ux\_list\_menu\_config.list**.

2.  From the UX List Menu Configurations list, select **APW List Menu Configuration**.

3.  Select a new category or a new list.

    |Option|Action|
    |------|------|
    |**New category**|From the UX List Categories related list, select **New**.|
    |**New list**|From the UX Lists related list, select **New**.|

    **Tip:** Create a category first and then create a list.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    -   [UX List Category form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/ux-list-category-form.md).
