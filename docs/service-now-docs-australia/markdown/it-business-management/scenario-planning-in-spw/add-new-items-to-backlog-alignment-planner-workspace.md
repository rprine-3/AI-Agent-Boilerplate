# Add planning items to Prioritization

Add new planning items to your portfolio plan's work backlog in Strategic Planning Workspace and ensure that the work pipeline is current.

## Before you begin

[Create a portfolio plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/create-portfolio-plans-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md)

Role required: sn\_align\_core.apw\_user

## About this task

Use the Prioritization tab of your portfolio plan to add new planning items or import them from other ServiceNow execution system such as PPM, Agile Development 2.0, or SAFe.

You can use the Prioritization, Kanban, or the Hierarchy tabs while you perform this task.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Strategic Planning** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Portfolio Planning**.

2.  From the list of portfolio plans, select one and then select **Planning**.

3.  From the Prioritization tab, add a new planning item for your portfolio plan.

    Use the More options drop-down to select the planning item that you want to create.

4.  On the form, fill in the short description and approved dates.

    For full information, see [Planning item form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/planning-item-form.md).

    You can refine planning item descriptions—for item types such as Demand, Epic, Project, Capability, Feature, and Story—using the Write planning item skill, if the ServiceNow Otto for SPM application is installed.

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  If you're using PPM, Agile Development 2.0, or SAFe to execute the planned work, you can also import your work items from these applications.

    For more information, see [Executing Strategic Planning work in PPM, Agile 2.0, and SAFe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/using-apw-with-agile-safe-and-ppm.md).


## Result

The new item is created with its **Planning state** field is set to **New** and the position of the item is based on the view that you are in.

-   Prioritization tab: Added to the bottom of the list.
-   Kanban tab: Added to the **4-Low priority** horizontal lane.
-   Hierarchy tab: Added to the appropriate grouping.

    For example, your selected lens is Organization. Then, the new item is added to the grouping of its department.
