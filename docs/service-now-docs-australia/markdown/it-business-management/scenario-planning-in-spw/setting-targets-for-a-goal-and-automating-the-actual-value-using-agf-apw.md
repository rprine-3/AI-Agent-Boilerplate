# Configuring target source for target automation

Configure target sources for target automation so that the goal user can define a target source when setting a target for the goal. Defining a target source for a target updates the actual value of the target automatically.

Use the following steps as guidelines for configuring target sources.

1.  Create a target source for a target to configure it as a source to update the actual value of the target. For more information, see [Create a target source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/create-target-source-for-automating-the-actual-value-of-the-targets-apw.md).

    The context variable is required for target source types Assessment/Survey and PA Indicator. The mandatory context variables are automatically created while creating a target source with the type selected as Assessment/Surveys or PA Indicator. For more information on when the mandatory context variables are created, see [Context variable in target source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/context-variable-in-target-source-apw.md).

2.  If required, create context variables for the target source so that the required data is fetched from the context variables to update the actual value of the target. For more information, see [Create context variables for a target source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/create-context-variable-for-a-target-source-apw.md).

The context variable is an additional configuration for the target source that can be used on the Target form to fetch the required data and auto-update the **Actual value** field on the Target form. A context variable is required for target source types Assessment/Survey and PA Indicator.

Create a target source so that the goal user can configure it for the targets to automate the Actual value of the targets.

Create a context variable manually if you want to configure more context variables for a target source.

Create a context variable manually for the target source type PA Indicator if the breakdown is of Choice list type.
