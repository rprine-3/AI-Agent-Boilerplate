# Apply a custom theme to roadmap

Apply your custom theme to ensure roadmap bar colors align with your organization’s style.

## Before you begin

-   You have created and published a custom theme to apply to the roadmap.
-   Ensure the application scope in your instance is set to **Portfolio Planning**.

Role required: admin

## About this task

To update the color theme for your roadmap bars, you must copy the sys\_id of your custom theme, and then create a system property and set its value to the copied sys\_id.

The colors configured in the custom theme will be applied to the roadmap bars. However, these colors won’t affect the colors of roadmap milestones or planning item milestones.

## Procedure

    1.  Navigate to **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Theme Management** &gt; **Themes**.

    2.  Search for the custom theme that you want to apply to the roadmap.

    3.  Right-click the name of your custom theme and select **Copy sys\_id**.

    The sys\_id of your custom theme is copied.

2.  Create a system property and enter the copied sys\_id in the form.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System properties** &gt; **All properties**.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
