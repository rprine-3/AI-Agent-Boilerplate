# Hierarchy tab display configuration in Strategic Planning

Show or hide parent records of planning items shown in the Hierarchy tab for high-level and regular portfolio plans by configuring system properties.

-   **Display empty parent entities in the Hierarchy tab**

    In the Hierarchy tab, the parent records are displayed only if they have any associated planning items.

    For example, a portfolio plan built from the Organization lens \(Company &gt; Business Unit &gt; Department\) is used to manage and track plans for Demands and Projects. So, when you switch to the Hierarchy tab, only those departments that have at least one Demand or Project associated with it are shown in the view.

    If you want to see other departments that are included in this portfolio plan but have no planning items associated to them, work with your administrator to create the system property **sn\_align\_ws.gantt\_hide\_empty\_entities** and set it to **false**.

-   **Display complete hierarchy for high-level portfolio plans**

    For high-level portfolio plans, the Hierarchy tab by default shows only the hierarchy up to the parent level.

    For example, a portfolio plan built from the Strategic Investment lens \(Company &gt; Strategic priority &gt; Initiative &gt; Strategic program\) is used to manage and track plans for strategic programs. So, when you switch to the Hierarchy tab, only Strategic Priority &gt; Initiative levels are shown by default.

    If you want to see the whole hierarchy of Strategic priority &gt; Initiative &gt; Strategic program &gt; planning items, work with your administrator to create the system property **true**.
