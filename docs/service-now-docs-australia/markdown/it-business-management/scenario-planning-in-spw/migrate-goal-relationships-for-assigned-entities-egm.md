# Migrate goal relationships for assigned entities

Migrate the existing goal relationship data from the Goal Relationship \[sn\_gf\_goal\_m2m\_relationship\] table by running the scheduled job.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

-   If you’ve upgraded from Alignment Planner Workspace v4.1.1 or v5.0.1 to Strategic Planning v2.0.1 and have created m2m relationship with lens entities other than **Company**, **Business Unit**, **Department**, and **Portfolio**, you can migrate those lens entities from the Goal Relationship \[sn\_gf\_goal\_m2m\_relationship\] table to the Goals table to access and manage the goals for those lens entities in the respective portfolio plans.
-   Migrating goal relationships data for assigned entities is a one-time job, and not meant to be on a schedule.
-   Running the job populates the **Assigned entity type** and **Assigned entity** fields on the [Goal form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/goal-form-egm.md) based on the data in the Goal Relationship \[sn\_gf\_goal\_m2m\_relationship\] table if you have any customized lenses other than the lens entity types, **Company**, **Business Unit**, **Department**, and **Portfolio**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Search for and click the **Migrate goal relationships for assigned entities** scheduled job.

3.  On the Scheduled Script Execution form:

    1.  Ensure that the frequency is selected as **On Demand** in the **Run** field.

    2.  In the **Run this script** field, list the entities configured in the Goal Assigned Entity Configuration \[sn\_gf\_assigned\_entity\_config\] table that you want to migrate the goal relationship data for.

        For parameters information, see [Scheduled Script Execution form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/scheduled-script-execution-form-egm.md).

4.  Click **Execute Now**.
