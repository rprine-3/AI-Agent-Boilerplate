# Configuring goals in Strategic Planning

To define and manage goals in Strategic Planning, you must perform some initial administrative tasks for the workspace to be fully functional. The data displayed in the goals view in Strategic Planning is stored in the Goal Framework tables.

-   With the admin role, you can migrate the existing goals data to the Goal Framework tables.
-   With the sn\_gf.goal\_admin role, you can set the goal preferences.

Post migration of your existing goals \(if any\) and configuring the goal preferences, use the Goals view in Strategic Planning to define your goals. For more information, see [Managing portfolio plan goals in Strategic Planning Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/managing-goals-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md).

If your organization uses the legacy goal and strategy tables \(Goal, Enterprise Strategy, Business Unit Strategy, and Strategic Objective\), you can migrate the existing data to the Goal Framework tables by running the scheduled job.
-   **[Configure goal preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/configure-goal-preferences-apw.md)**  
Configure goal preferences to manage goals such as the calendar type used for goal setting, weighted average calculation for goal progress, and deletion of goals and targets.

Customize the label for Goal \[sn\_gf\_goal\] and Target \[sn\_gf\_goal\_target\] tables according to your organization’s requirement.
-   **[Configure a table for an assigned entity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/configure-assigned-entity-egm.md)**  
Configure a table for an assigned entity type, so that the goal user can associate goals with the required assigned entity.
-   **[Create goals demo data with target breakdowns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/create-goals-demo-data-with-target-breakdowns.md)**  
Run the **Create Goals Demo Data with Target Breakdowns** schedule job to create goals demo data with target breakdowns, so that you can view the target breakdowns section on the Goals page.
-   **[Update scheduled job to automate target actual values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/schedule-a-job-to-automate-actual-value-of-the-targets-apw.md)**  
Use the Goal Framework for SPM application to modify the run time for the scheduled job according to your preference to auto-update the actual value of the targets for which a target source has been configured.
-   **[Set display limit for goals and targets in Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/set-display-limits-for-goals-and-targets-spw.md)**  
Update system property value to set the display limit for goals on the Goals page in Strategic Planning.
-   **[Migrate target breakdowns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/migrate-target-breakdowns-spw.md)**  
After upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.3.2 or later, run the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job to migrate the existing values from the **Review frequency** field to the **Check-in frequency** field in the target records.

Configure target sources for target automation so that the goal user can define a target source when setting a target for the goal. Defining a target source for a target updates the actual value of the target automatically.
