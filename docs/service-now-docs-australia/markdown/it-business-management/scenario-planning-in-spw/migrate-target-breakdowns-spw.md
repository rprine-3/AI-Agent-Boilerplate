# Migrate target breakdowns

After upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.3.2 or later, run the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job to migrate the existing values from the **Review frequency** field to the **Check-in frequency** field in the target records.

## About this task

After running the job, the value in the **Check-in frequency** field for a target is populated based on the existing value in the **Review frequency** field of the target. If the existing value in the **Review frequency** field was set to any option other than **None**, then target breakdowns will be created for such targets based on the value in the existing check-in frequency of the target. For more information on how these values are migrated for targets with different values, see [Target breakdowns migration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/target-breakdowns-migration-spw.md).

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Search for and select the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job.
