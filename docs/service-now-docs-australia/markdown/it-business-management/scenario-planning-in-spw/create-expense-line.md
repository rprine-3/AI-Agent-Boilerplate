# Add or edit expense lines

Create or edit expense lines to capture the actual costs. You can associate the expense lines with a cost plan or create standalone expense lines to record unplanned expenses.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_align\_ws.spw\_financial\_user

## About this task

An expense line is part of the project cost plans that can be associated with a specific source. You can create multiple expense lines for a cost plan. Only the expense lines that are in the processed state are considered for roll ups on the work item.

For unplanned expense lines not associated to any cost plan, the system creates a cost plan or associates an existing one of the same expense type.
