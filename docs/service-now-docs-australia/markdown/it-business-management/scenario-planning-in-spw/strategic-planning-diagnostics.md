# Strategic Planning diagnostics

Run diagnostic scans to identify and fix errors in the configuration and other common settings for Strategic Planning before your planning managers prioritize and roadmap work for their portfolio plans.

Strategic Planning diagnostic scans help you find discrepancies by validating the configuration for the following:

-   Lens and lens structure
-   Form views, list views, related list views, and workspace view rules for planning items
-   Global ranking for planning items
-   Portfolio plans
-   Goals data
-   high-level planning entities

The following are the default diagnostic scans available for Strategic Planning.
