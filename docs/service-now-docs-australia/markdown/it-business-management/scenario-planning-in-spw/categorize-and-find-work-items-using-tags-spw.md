# Categorize work items using tags

Categorize your planning items based on your requirement by adding tags.

## Before you begin

[Create a portfolio plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/create-portfolio-plans-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md)

Role required: sn\_align\_core.apw\_user

## About this task

Tags enable you to categorize planning items. You create the tag name, which should name the reason for the tag. You can make the tags visible to everyone, some people, or just yourself. The visibility setting specifies who can use the tags to search for planning items.

Any tagging additions or removals made to a planning item are automatically synced across all views in the Planning page and in the Scoring page. After tagging planning items, you can use the tags to search for planning items using the **Filter** option \(\[Omitted image "prioritization-filter-button.png"\] Alt text: Filter planning items using tags.\) in the List view of Prioritization and in the Scoring page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Portfolio Planning**.

2.  From the list of portfolio plans, select one and then select **Planning**.

3.  From the Prioritization or Scoring, add a tag for a planning item using one of the following options.

</table>    **Note:** The tag visibility setting defaults to private, which means the tag is only visible to the user who created the tag. So, only the user who created the tag can use the tag to search for planning items labeled with that tag.

4.  To change the visibility setting of the tag, on the Details page of the planning item, select the tag and change the **Viewable by** setting.

Tag is visible to specific groups or users. You can specify the groups and users who can view this tag.
