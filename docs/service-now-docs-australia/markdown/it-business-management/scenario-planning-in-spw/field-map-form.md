</table>You can also create custom fields and map them to the required source fields as needed. For example, if you want to display the execution project number, you can create a custom field called 'Project number' in the Project planning item \[sn\_align\_core\_project\] table within the Portfolio Planning Core application scope. Then, map this field to the 'Number' field of the Project table \(pm\_project\) using the project field map.
