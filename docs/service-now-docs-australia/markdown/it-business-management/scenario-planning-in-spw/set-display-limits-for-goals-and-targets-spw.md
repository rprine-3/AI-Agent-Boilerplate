# Set display limit for goals and targets in Strategic Planning

Update system property value to set the display limit for goals on the Goals page in Strategic Planning.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_gf.goal\_admin

## About this task

The default display limit for goals on the Goals page is 250.

**Important:** If the value of a system property exceeds its default value, the UI performance can degrade.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.

    A list of all the properties in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table appears.

2.  Search for the **sn\_align\_ws.goal\_hierarchy.max\_records** system property and open it.

3.  In the **Value** field, enter the desired number of goals to display in the Goals view.

4.  Select **Update**.
