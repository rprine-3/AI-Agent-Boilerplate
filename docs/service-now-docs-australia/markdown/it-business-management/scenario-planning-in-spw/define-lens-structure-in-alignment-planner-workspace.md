# Add or modify lens structure in Strategic Planning

Add entities to your lens and build its structure so that your planning managers can start creating their portfolio plans in Strategic Planning.

## Before you begin

Ensure that your application scope is set to **Portfolio Planning Core**.

Role required: admin

## About this task

For a lens, add entities to build a new lens structure or to modify the existing structure. You can add up to six entities in a lens structure. For more information on lens and its structure, see [Lens configuration in Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/configuring-lens-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Strategic Planning** &gt; **Lenses**.

2.  From the Lenses list, select a lens for which you want to add or update the lens structure.

3.  Add an entity to the lens structure.

    1.  From the Lens structure related list, select **New.**

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        For field information, see [Lens structure form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/lens-structure-form-alignment-planner-workspace.md).

    3.  Select **Submit.**

4.  Repeat step 3 to complete adding all your lens entities.

    -   Add the entities in a top-down manner:

        Add the top-level entity first, followed by the second-level entity, followed by the third, and so on.

    -   Ensure that every entity, except the top-level, has a parent entity reference.

        For example, the second-level entity must refer to the top-level entity as its parent.

## What to do next

1.  Verify that the Planning item table \[sn\_align\_core\_planning\_item\] has a field that references the bottom entity of this lens.
2.  Ensure that the following form views for all the planning item types that are associated in your lens contains a field for the bottom entity of your lens structure.
    -   APW Preview
    -   APW New
    -   APW Default
3.  Update the roadmap configuration for the tables all planning item types that you associate with this lens:

    Add the bottom entity of this lens structure and its parent to **Group by fields** and **Color by fields**. These fields are used as the default group by and color by settings for the portfolio roadmap. See [Customize planning item display preferences for roadmaps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/configure-source-table-preferences-for-roadmap.md).

4.  Validate your lens configuration and activate it. See [Activate a lens in Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/activate-lens-alignment-planner-workspace.md).
