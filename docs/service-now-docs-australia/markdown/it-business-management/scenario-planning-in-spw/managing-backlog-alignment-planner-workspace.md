# Prioritizing portfolio plan work in Strategic Planning Workspace

Review the work pipeline for your portfolio in Strategic Planning Workspace. Add, update, and rank planning items so that you can prioritize the right work for the right time.

## Views for prioritizing planning items

The Prioritization tab on the Planning page in Strategic Planning represents your backlog, displaying the items in your work pipeline. The Kanban and Hierarchy tabs also represent your backlog, each providing a different view of the same items. For an overview of these views, see [Prioritization in Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/backlog-management-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md).

**Note:** The Prioritization feature is available only for portfolio plans.

## Planning items in the Prioritization tab

By default, portfolio plans show only the records that are created within the Planning Item \[sn\_align\_core\_planning\_item\] table and its child tables. Any records stored in other ServiceNow AI Platform tables aren't shown unless an integration is established.

Consider that you want to manage projects through a portfolio plan. Project records that are only stored in the Planning Item Project \[sn\_align\_project\] table are displayed in the Prioritization, Kanban, and Hierarchy tabs. But any projects created using the PPM Standard aren't shown by default because these project records are stored in the PPM Project \[pm\_project\] table. To enable their display in Strategic Planning Workspace, set up integration with PPM so that the tables of Strategic Planning are mapped to the tables of PPM.

The same is the case with Epics created using Agile Development 2.0 and SAFe applications. See [Configuring Strategic Planning with PPM, Agile 2.0, and SAFe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/configuring-apw-with-agile-safe-and-ppm.md).

## Prioritization features

In the Prioritization and Hierarchy tabs, you can perform the following actions:

MoSCoW values

Categorize planning items using the Must have, Could have, Should have, or Won't have \(MoSCoW\) values in the List and Hierarchy views. This categorization creates a baseline of priority that you can later use when you're grooming and prioritizing work for your portfolio.

Open the planning item in the Execution app

</td><td>

If you're using ServiceNow PPM, Agile Development 2.0, or SAFe applications to execute the planned work, you can open the planning items in their own application.

 For example, if your planning item is an epic, you can navigate to the epic form directly from the Prioritization page.

</td><td>

Change the way that the Prioritization page is displayed so that you can view the information in the format that you need.

 All settings, such as row and column personalization, grouping, and sorting, are saved as the portfolio plan preferences. So, these settings are applied to all the users or user groups that the portfolio plan is shared with.
