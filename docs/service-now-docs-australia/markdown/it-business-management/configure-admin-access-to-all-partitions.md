# Configure administrator access to all partitions

Enable or disable the system property to control whether system administrators can access all partitioned data across your enterprise deployment, or only their assigned partitions.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sn\_spm\_ewd.ewd\_admin

## About this task

The **sn\_spm\_ewd.allow\_admin\_access\_to\_all\_partitions** system property controls whether administrators with the appropriate role can access all partitions across the deployment, or only the partitions they are explicitly assigned to.

-   **Default behavior \(false\):** Administrators can only access partitions they are assigned to. This provides data isolation and governance.
-   **Enterprise access \(true\):** Administrators can view and manage all partitions across the entire deployment. This is useful for enterprise-wide system administration tasks.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **System Definition**.

2.  Search and open the **sn\_spm\_ewd.allow\_admin\_access\_to\_all\_partitions** system property.

3.  In the **Value** field, input as `true` or `false` as needed.

    The default value is **false**.

4.  Select **Update** to save the changes.

    The new setting takes effect immediately for new administrator sessions.


## Result

The partition access control is configured according to your organization's needs. Administrators will either have enterprise-wide access to all partitions \(if set to **true**\) or will be restricted to their assigned partitions \(if set to **false**\) on their next session.
