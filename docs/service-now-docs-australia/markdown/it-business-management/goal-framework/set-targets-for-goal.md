# Create targets for a goal using Goal Framework or Goal Framework for SPM

Create SMART targets for goals to track and measure the progress of the goals.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_gf.goal\_user or sn\_gf.goal\_admin

## About this task

A SMART target can be defined as S = Specific, M = Measurable, A = Attainable, R = Relevant, and T = Time-bound.

-   Only the owner or contributors of the goal can create targets for the goal.
-   You can also restrict the access for a target record to the specific users by enabling the **Confidential** field on the target form if the Operational Sustainability Management application is installed.

## Procedure

1.  Create a target for a goal using one of the following options.

<table id="choicetable_whk_swd_tw"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d104618e85">

Option

</th><th align="left" id="d104618e88">

Steps

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d104618e94">

**From the Targets related list**

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **Enterprise Goal Management** &gt; **Goals**.
2.  Open the required goal that you want to set a target for.
3.  In the Quantitative Targets or Qualitative Targets related list, click **New**.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d104618e127">

**From the Targets module**

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **Enterprise Goal Management** &gt; **Targets**.
2.  Click **New**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For field information, see [Target form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/goal-framework/target-form.md).

3.  Click **Submit**.


## Result

The target progress records are automatically created when you save the target post populating the **Actuals to date** field. The target progress records specify the progress of each target for the goal.

**Note:** When you delete a goal, its associated targets \(if any\) and their progress records are also deleted even though the **Allow the deletion of targets** property is set to **No**.

## What to do next

Update the progress of the targets.
