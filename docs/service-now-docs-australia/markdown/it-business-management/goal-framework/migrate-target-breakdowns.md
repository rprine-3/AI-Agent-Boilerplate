# Migrate target breakdowns

After upgrading to Goal Framework for SPM v2.3.0 or later, run the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job to migrate the existing values from the **Review frequency** field to the **Check-in frequency** field in the target records.

## About this task

After running the job, the value in the **Check-in frequency** field for a target is populated based on the existing value in the **Review frequency** field of the target. If the existing value in the **Review frequency** field was set to any option other than **None**, then target breakdowns will be created for such targets based on the value in the existing check-in frequency of the target. For more information on how these values are migrated for targets with different values, see [Target breakdowns migration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/goal-framework/target-breakdowns-migration.md).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Search for and select the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job.

3.  On the Scheduled Script Execution form, ensure that the frequency is selected as **On Demand** in the **Run** field.

4.  Select **Execute Now**.
