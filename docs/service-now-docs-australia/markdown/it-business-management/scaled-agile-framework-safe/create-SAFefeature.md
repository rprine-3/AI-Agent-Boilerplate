<table id="table_jpv_hwh_mcb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

System-generated number for the feature.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enabler

</td><td>

Option that identifies a feature as an enabler. An enabler does not bring any business value but helps in laying the foundation for future work. For example, you can use an enabler to investigate the architecture that is used to build stories.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Color

</td><td>

Color that you attribute to the feature. Feature colors help you visually identify and group stories by their feature on the team's backlog page of the SAFe board.This color also appears as a filled circle on the SAFe story cards on the SAFe PI planning board so that you can identify its feature.

</td></tr><tr><td>

WSJF score

</td><td>

Weighted Shortest Job First \(WSJF\) score that you use to prioritize and sequence jobs to produce an optimum business value. A job with the highest WSJF score receives the highest priority for implementation. A job can be an epic, feature, or any business capability.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

State of the feature. Select one of the following:-   **Funnel**: In this state, you can create features from approved ideas.
-   **Analysis**: In this state, the product management team reviews the features and considers the acceptance criteria, benefit hypothesis, technical feasibility, and scope estimates.
-   **Backlog**: In this state, you can prioritize approved features and assign them to an ART.
-   **Implementation**: In this state, you can break down a feature into stories that you can later assign to a team.
-   **Validation on staging**: In this state, you can integrate the feature in the system and present it to the product management team for approval and feedback.
-   **Deployment**: In this state, the deployment testing of feature is complete.
-   **Released**: In this state, you are ready to release the feature to the end users and assess the benefit hypotheses.
-   **Cancelled**: In this state, a feature has been canceled.

## What to do next

Use the SAFe stories related list to view and add stories to the feature.

-   **[Split a SAFe feature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/scaled-agile-framework-safe/split-a-safe-feature.md)**  
Split a SAFe feature into two separate features so that you can track complete and incomplete stories. Move the feature with the incomplete stories to your backlog or to a future program increment \(PI\). This maintains accurate metrics of the previous sprints and PIs.
