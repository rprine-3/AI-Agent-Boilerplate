# Create a non-monetary benefit plan for an epic

Epic benefit plans capture the potential non-financial benefits accrued by the epic when the epic is executed. Create a non-monetary benefit plan to specify the estimated benefit in a category spanning one or more fiscal periods.

## Before you begin

Role required: safe\_product\_owner, safe\_scrum\_master, or safe\_admin

## About this task

The non-monetary benefit plan breakdown records are automatically created when you save the benefit plan by selecting **Automatic** or **Manual** in the **Breakdown Type** field. The non-monetary benefit plan breakdown records specify the estimated and actual non-financial benefits at a granular level for specific fiscal periods, such as FY16: April and FY16: May. The Non-monetary Benefit Plan Breakdowns related list shows the aggregated benefits for estimated and actual non-financial benefits for each fiscal period for the epic.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agile Development** &gt; **Epics**.

2.  Open the required epic.

3.  Click the hamburger icon \(\[Omitted image "hamburger-icon.png"\] Alt text: Hamburger icon\) and navigate to **View** &gt; **Benefit**.

4.  On the form, fill in the required fields in the Planning section.

    This section is available when the Benefit view is selected.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Planned start date|Projected start date for the epic. The planned start date can be the current date or a future date.|
    |Planned end date|Projected end date for the epic. The planned end date must be after the planned start date.|
    |Planned benefit|Benefit value that is rolled up from the benefit breakdown.|
    |Actual start date|Actual start date for the epic. The actual start date can be on or before the planned start date.|
    |Actual end date|Actual end date for the epic. The actual end date can be before the planned start date but not before the actual start date.|
    |Actual benefit|Actual benefit value that is rolled up from the actual benefit in the benefit breakdown.|

5.  Save the record.

6.  Click the Non-monetary Benefit Plans related list.

7.  To create a non-monetary benefit plan, click **New**.

8.  On the form, fill in the fields.

-   **Milestone**: After completion of a milestone.
-   **Start Date**: At the start of the epic.
-   **End Date**: After the epic ends.
 If the value in the **Offset type** field changes, the benefit plan start date shifts accordingly. For example, if the **Offset type** field is set to **End Date** and the end date of the epic changes, the start date of the benefit plan shifts to align with the new end date of the epic.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Milestone
