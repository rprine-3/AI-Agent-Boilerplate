</td></tr><tr><td>

Enabler

</td><td>

Check box identifying the epic as an enabler. Enablers do not add direct business value but help lay a foundation for future work. For example, an enabler epic might be an investigation into the architecture used to build features.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

State of the epic:-   **Funnel**: Created from **Scaled Agile Framework \(SAFe\)** &gt; **Epic**.
-   **Review**: Under review considering parameters like WSJF score and WIP limited.
-   **Analysis**: Approved or rejected based on parameters like WSJF score refinement, cost estimation, alternatives, and WIP limited.
-   **Backlog**: Approved and assigned to an ART. In this state, the ART level user segments the epic into features.
-   **Implementation**: Epic is being implemented.
-   **Done**: Implementation is complete.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Color

</td><td>

Color that you attribute to the epic. Epic colours help you visually identify and group features by their epic on the ART's backlog page of the SAFe board.

</td></tr><tr><td>

WSJF Score

</td><td>

Weighted Shortest Job First \(WSJF\) score is used to prioritize and sequence jobs to produce optimum business value. A job with the highest WSJF score receives the highest priority for implementation. A job can refer to an epic, feature, or any business capability.
