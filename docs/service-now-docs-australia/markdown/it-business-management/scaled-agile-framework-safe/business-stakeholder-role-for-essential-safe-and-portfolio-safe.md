# Business stakeholder role for Essential SAFe and Portfolio SAFe

Use the business stakeholder role to read and retrieve data from any table of the Essential SAFe and Portfolio SAFe applications to generate reports.

**Important:**

Starting with the Xanadu release, the plugins Portfolio SAFe, Essential SAFe, Performance Analytics Content Pack for Essential SAFe, Work Progress Status for SAFe, Agile - Scaled Agile Framework - Unified Backlog, and Read only roles for SAFe are being prepared for future deprecation. These plugins will be hidden and can no longer be activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. [Enterprise Agile Planning in Strategic Planning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/enterprise-agile-planning/eap-landing.md) provides the latest experience for this functionality.

For more information on the deprecation process and its impact, see the [Application/Plugin Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

When you activate the Business Stakeholder plugin \(com.snc.business\_stakeholder\) in your ServiceNow instance, the Read only roles for SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.safe\_read\_roles\) is also activated. This plugin provides a business stakeholder role \(sn\_safe\_read\) with which you can access all the tables of Essential SAFe and Portfolio SAFe applications. You can assign this role to any user in your organization who is a business stakeholder.

## Plugin availability

If you are a new customer, the Read only roles for SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.safe\_read\_roles\) is activated on zBoot. However, the business stakeholder role \(sn\_safe\_read\) is available only when you activate the Agile - Scaled Agile Framework - Essential SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.safe\) or Agile - Scaled Agile Framework - Portfolio SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.portfolio\_safe\).

If you are an upgrade customer, you must manually activate the Read only roles for Essential SAFe and Portfolio SAFe plugins \(com.snc.sdlc.safe\_read\_roles\).

## SAFe tables accessible by users with the business stakeholder role

When the read-only roles for SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.safe\_read\_roles\) is active in your ServiceNow instance along with either the Essential SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.safe\) or Portfolio SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.portfolio\_safe\), users with the business stakeholder role \(sn\_safe\_read\) can access the following tables. The role provides read access to these tables.
