# Quick start tests for Essential SAFe

Validate that Essential SAFe still works after you make any configuration change such as apply an upgrade or develop an application. Copy and customize these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

Essential SAFe quick start tests require activating the Agile - Scaled Agile Framework - Essential SAFe plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.safe\) and the Agile - Scaled Agile Framework - Essential SAFe - ATF Tests plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.safe.atf\).

-   For the sprints that are in the **Draft** or **Planning** states:
    -   The group capacity is updated to the new value.
    -   The **Group capacity** field is editable.
-   For the sprints in the **Current**, **Complete**, or **Cancelled** states:
