4.  Click the **Sprint Tracking** tab, and select the **List** view.

5.  From the list, select **Tests**.

6.  Verify a story by clicking the **Run** button.

    This action runs all tests of the story at once.

</td><td>

Blocked. In this state, options to add comments and attachments are available. Option to delete attachments is also available. **Note:** If a test step is blocked, you will not be able to proceed and verify the remaining steps of the test.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    -   To select an icon, you can also press **Tab** and then press **Enter**.
    -   To pause and work on the test at a later point in time, click **Pause**.

## Result

The test result is saved to the Test Result form. The latest test result of each test is displayed in the List view.

The overall status of the test is defined by statuses of the test steps:

-   If all the test steps are passed, the status of the test is **Passed**.
-   If at least one step of the test is not run, the status of the test is **Not finished**.
-   If at least one step of the test fails, the status of the test is **Failed**. This rule takes precedence over the previous rule.
-   If at least one step of the test is blocked, the status of the test is **Blocked**. This rule takes precedence over the previous two rules.
