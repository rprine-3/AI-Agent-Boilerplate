## Perform sprint planning

Perform sprint planning by evaluating stories in the backlog, selecting stories for the sprint, and estimating work effort for the stories.

### Before you begin

Role required: scrum\_master

The tab displays only the sprints of the current program increment.

### About this task

In SAFe, the main portion of sprint planning occurs during the Big Room Planning process. The team backlog and the sprint planning portion of it is designed for refinement sessions. The overall plan of each sprint of a program increment already exists. However, the team still has sprint planning sessions every two weeks to add any missing stories and adjust the initial plan.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Scaled Agile Framework \(SAFe\)** &gt; **SAFe Board**.

2.  From the choice list at the top left corner, select the level as **Team**.

3.  Select the **Backlog** tab.

4.  To add a story to the sprint and simultaneously decide its order of implementation, perform these steps:

    1.  Point to a story in the sprint.

    2.  Click **Create Story**.

    3.  Specify the required details in the story form and click **Submit**.

        The story is created beneath the story that was selected in the backlog or a sprint.

5.  To personalize columns in a list, click the Personalize icon.

6.  To start a sprint, click **Start** that appears at right corner of the first or top sprint.

7.  To complete a sprint, click **Complete Sprint** that appears at right corner of the first or top sprint.

    A dialog box appears indicating the number of completed and incomplete stories in the sprint. Move incomplete stories, if any, to the backlog or a future sprint. Click **Complete**.
