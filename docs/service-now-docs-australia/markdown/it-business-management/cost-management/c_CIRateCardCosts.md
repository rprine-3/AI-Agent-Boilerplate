# CI rate card costs

CI rate card costs generate expense lines for configuration items on the associated rate card

Costs associated with rate cards are stored in the Rate Card Cost \(`fm_ci_rate_card_cost`\) table. Each cost is applied to every configuration item associated with the rate card when the costs are processed.

Expense Line is active by default.

### Before you begin

### About this task

Expense lines are the snapshot of a given interval's costs, so changing the cost does not affect already generated expense lines. When costs change, either modify the cost amount or disable the current cost and create a new cost to represent the cost going forward. The changes are processed in the next generated expense line. To keep historical records of costs, create new costs rather than modifying existing ones and set the end date of the disabled cost to show that the cost agreement expired.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Cost** &gt; **Costs** &gt; **CI Rate Cards**.

2.  Select a rate card.

3.  Click a rate card cost **Number**.

4.  Modify the fields, as necessary.
