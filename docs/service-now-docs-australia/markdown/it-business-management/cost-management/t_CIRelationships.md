# CI relationships

To get reports that represent the total costs for a business service, there must be some association between the service and the CIs that make up the service. This is done with CI relationships.

## Before you begin

Role required: financial\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Use the demo data of the Cost Management plugin to understand how to check all expense lines related to a business service.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Cost** &gt; **Config** &gt; **Business Services**.

2.  Select **Retail**.

3.  View the business service map by selecting the dependency views icon \(\[Omitted image "dependency-views.png"\] Alt text: Dependency views.\).

    This view shows that the dbaix901nyc server is a dependency of the Retail Adding Points, Retail POS, and Retail business services. So whenever the dbaix901nyc server incurs a cost, it would be represented at each of the business services.

    The dbaix901nyc server is a member of the Sun E20K Servers NY CI rate card, so the expenses can be verified from this CI rate card.

    To view them:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Cost** &gt; **Costs** &gt; **CI Rate Cards**.
    2.  Select **Sun E20K Servers NY**.
    3.  Select the Expense Line related list.

        If this related list is not available, configure your form layout to display the Expense Line → Rate Card related list.

    4.  Filter the related list for **short description contains dbaix901nyc**.
    The server's expenses are now visible:

    \[Omitted image "CostDemoServerexp.png"\] Alt text: Cost Demo Server Expense

    This example contains one direct expense \(**inherited = false**\), and three inherited expenses that have been generated from other direct expenses. These inherited expenses are based on CI relationships, which allow for reporting at any business service level.
