# Components installed with Cost Management

Several components are installed with the Cost Management application.

Demo data is available with Cost Management. The demo data provides sample budgets, distribution costs, expense allocations, contract rate cards, and rate card costs.

## Tables

Cost Management adds the following tables.

|Table|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Allocation Unit `[allocation_unit]`|Tracks capacity and usage for a business service. Stores reference to business service, total, allocated, and remaining units of capacity.|
|Budget `[fm_budget]`|Tracks planned and total expense allocation amounts for a collection of cost centers.|
|Budget Cost Center `[fm_budget_cost_center]`|Associates one or more cost centers to a budget.|
|CI Cost Center Relationship `[fm_cmdb_rel_cc]`|Associates a cost center to a business service that it consumes and the number of units it uses. This is used to calculate the number of allocated units to update the allocation unit record.|
|CI Rate Card `[fm_ci_rate_card]`|Links configuration items and costs. A classification can also be defined to allow for multiple rate cards for a group of CIs.|
|CI Rate Cards `[fm_ci_rate_card_cmdb_ci_m2m]`|Associates configuration items to a rate card.|
|Contract Rate Card `[fm_contract_rate_card]`|Provides detailed price information for a contract and enables you to generate recurring expenses automatically.|
|Distribution Cost `[fm_distribution_cost]`|Represents costs which can be divided among a group of records. For example, the cost of power at a datacenter which can be divided among the CIs in the datacenter.|
|Distribution Cost Rule `[fm_distribution_cost_rule]`|Determines how the costs are distributed to CIs.|
|Distribution Units `[fm_distribution_units]`|Stores the number of units to associate to configuration items linked to the current rate card.|
|Expense Allocation `[fm_expense_allocation]`|Associates the value of an expense to a target reference. The value is generated from an expense line by processing allocation rules. The target is the record that is responsible for that expense amount. Common targets are cost centers, departments, companies, groups, and users.|
|Expense Allocation Rule`[fm_expense_allocation_rule]`|Determines how to process an expense line into an expense allocation. The logic starts by defining a table and condition to run against. Expenses linked to the selected table will be evaluated by this rule. If the condition is met, an allocation of a defined percentage is created for the reference defined by the allocation field value. Advanced scripts can also be used to define custom allocation generation.|
|Financial Management Log `[fm_log]`|Logs financial management information for tracking and to asset with debugging. Extends the system log table.|
|Labor Rate Card `[fm_labor_rate_card]`|Defines hourly labor rates for expense line generation based on functional roles.|
|Rate Card `[fm_rate_card]`|Associates configuration items to a rate card.|
|Rate Card `[fm_recurring_rate_card]`|Represents a collection of recurring costs.|
|Rate Card Cost `[fm_ci_rate_card_cost]`|Associates a recurring CI cost to a rate card so that it is applied to all CIs associated with the rate card.|
|Rate Card Users `[clm_m2m_rate_card_user]`|Associates users to a rate card.|
|Relationship Path `[fm_relationship_path]`|Defines the relationship between configuration items, such as parent records and child records.|
|Task Rate Card `[fm_task_rate_card]`|Stores records that define task costs.|

## User Roles

Cost Management adds the following user roles. A user with the user\_admin or admin role can assign these roles.

Financial User \(financial\_mgmt\_user\)

</td><td>

Financial users participate in financial processes and have limited access to functionality.

 Can read allocation units and expense allocations. Can create, read, and write rate cards and expense lines. Can create, read, write, and delete fixed assets, depreciation, distribution costs.

</table>## Properties

Cost Management adds the following properties.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|**com.snc.time\_card.default\_rate**|Sets a default hourly rate to use if no labor rate cards apply to the user.|
|**glide.cost\_mgmt.calc\_actual\_cost**|Sums all task expense lines and adds the total to the **Work cost** field on the task record when an expense line is created for any task with a **Type** of **Planned task**.|
|**glide.cost\_mgmt.debug**|Enables debugging of cost management processing. All logging events are recorded in the Financial Management Log `[fm_log]` table. This should only be enabled during initial testing or when troubleshooting because it can generate a large number of log records.|
|**glide.cost\_mgmt.process\_task\_cis**|Creates expense lines to affected configuration items when creating a task expense line. The default value is **false**.|
|**glide.cost\_mgmt.service\_allocation.method**|Defines if business service to cost center allocation costs should be calculated based on total units or allocated units.|
