2.  Select a record to edit or select **New**.

    |Configuration Item|Select the Business Service to define allocation units for.|
    |Total Units|The total number of units of expense available to allocate. A unit is a generic measurement which can represent anything. Should match the cost center relationship unit.

Using the Allocated unit option always results in 100% expense allocations.|

    |Available Units|How many of the total units are unallocated. Populated by script.|
    |Updated|When the units were last updated.|
