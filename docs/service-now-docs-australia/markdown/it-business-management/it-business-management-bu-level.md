# Organizational plugins for Strategic Portfolio Management

Strategic Portfolio Management offerings help you better manage demand, balance resources, manage agile and waterfall projects, perform budget planning, and map costs to technical and business services.

## Plugins at the organization level

-   **Organization Extension \(com.snc.organization\_extension\) plugin**

    Organization Extension \(com.snc.organization\_extension\) plugin activates Goals, Business unit, Enterprise strategy, and Business unit strategy entities. It is available on zBoot to all customers with demo data.

    Business Units, Goals, Enterprise Strategy, and Business Unit Strategy modules are available in the Organization application menu.

    Business Applications and Business Capabilities modules are also available within the Organization application menu, however, their related tables are moved to Configuration Management \(CMDB\) \(com.snc.cmdb\) plugin, which is available on zBoot but without demo data.

-   **Business Stakeholder \(com.snc.business\_stakeholder\) plugin**

    Business Stakeholder \(com.snc.business\_stakeholder\) plugin is activated at the SPM business unit level and contains business stakeholder read-only role \(child\) plugins at SPM product levels. Activating the child plugins at the product level enables the read-only access role at the respective product level. Users with this role can view and approve reports at their product level. Following are the child plugins activated at the product levels:
