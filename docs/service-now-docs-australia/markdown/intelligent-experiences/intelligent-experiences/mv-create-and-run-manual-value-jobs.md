# Create and run manual value jobs

Set up manual value jobs for AI systems that you onboard manually, so that the AI Control Tower calculates their value on a monthly or quarterly cadence.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward.

## About this task

Some AI systems don't have discovery integration but still need to be managed in the AI Control Tower. For these AI systems, you onboard them manually, create manual indicators, and the value job runs according to the cadence you set.

## Procedure

1.  Onboard the AI system manually through the inventory intake form.

    Complete the intake form details, follow the asset onboarding lifecycle, and map a value template. For more information, see [Creating AI assets manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/creating-ai-assets-newexperience.md).

2.  Create the manual indicators with a monthly or quarterly cadence.

    The AI Control Tower derives the run cadence from the indicator type. A monthly indicator runs as a monthly job, and a quarterly indicator runs as a quarterly job to capture productivity gains. For more information, see [Manual indicators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/t_CreateAManualIndicator.md).

3.  Rerun a scheduled value job.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Control Tower** &gt; **Home**.

    2.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Rules and Templates** &gt; **Templates** &gt; **Scheduled value jobs**.

    3.  Select the job that you want to rerun, and then select **Re-run**.

        The **Re-run** option is not available for jobs with a daily cadence.


## Result

The AI Control Tower calculates value for the AI system on the monthly or quarterly cadence set by its indicators.
