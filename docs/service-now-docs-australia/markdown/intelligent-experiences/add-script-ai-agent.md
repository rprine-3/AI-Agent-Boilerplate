# Add a script to an AI agent

Create a script to add it to an AI agent in AI Agent Studio. With scripts, you can use the scriptable APIs and back-end integration to support the AI agent.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_aia.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage** &gt; **AI agents**.

2.  Open the AI agent that you want to add a script to and navigate to the Add tools and information section.

3.  In the **Add tool** drop-down list, select **Script**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Name that you want to specify for your script.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Description of the script and what it's going to do to assist your AI agent.**Note:** This description is sent to the large language model \(LLM\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Script inputs

</td><td>

Input name and description to use in the script. The LLM uses the name and description to determine what value should be used at runtime. Example: Input name is **task\_record\_sys\_id** and description is **sys\_id of the Task Record, this is mandatory**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Script

</td><td>

JavaScript code that includes an object class or a function for your script. **Note:** For improved security, use GlideRecordSecure instead of GlideRecord and addUserEncodedQuery\(\) instead of addEncodedQuery\(\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execution mode

</td><td>

Mode of execution for your script:-   **Supervised**: Inputs from your human agent are required during the execution of this tool while the AI agent runs.
-   **Autonomous**: Doesn't require any input from your live agent during the execution of this tool while the AI agent runs.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Display output

</td><td>

Permission to display the output of the tool execution in the ServiceNow Otto panel or in Virtual Agent:-   **Yes**
-   **No**
If you want the AI agent to work in Off Glide architecture with Premium Chat experience, you must turn-on the **Display output** toggle. When the toggle is turned-on, you can add widgets that can be used in assistants built with Premium Chat experiences. The widget configuration includes:

-   **Widget**: Defines the display output to render the content in a better user experience. You can select the widget from the drop-down.
-   **Require widget transformation**: An additional LLM call is required to transform the raw tool. If you choose to skip this transformation step, the tool output will be directly mapped to the widget.
    -   **Yes**
    -   **No**
-   **Display refined widget message**: Refines the widget message when configured.
    -   **Yes**
    -   **No**
**Note:** The display output as a toggle is exclusively available for the Premium Chat experience when the Off Glide Conversation Server plugin \(com.glide.cs.offglide\) is installed. If the plugin is not installed, you will continue to access the standard display output options.
