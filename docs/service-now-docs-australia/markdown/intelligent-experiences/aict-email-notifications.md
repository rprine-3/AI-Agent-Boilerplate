# AI Control Tower email notifications

Identify the email notifications that AI Control Tower sends automatically, the events that trigger each notification, and the recipients. These notifications keep AI Stewards, asset owners, and assignees informed so that they can take action promptly on AI asset approvals and lifecycle events.

The notifications listed in this topic are part of the base system and are sent automatically when the trigger condition is met. To customize notification content or recipients, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

## AI asset approval request notifications

The following notifications are sent for events related to AI asset approval requests and their associated approval tasks. AI asset approval requests are stored in the `sn_ai_governance_assessment_request` table; approval tasks are stored in the `sn_ai_governance_assessment_task` table.
