# Usage and adoption

The Usage and adoption dashboard page contains key usage and performance indicators that help you evaluate AI adoption in your organization.

The Usage and adoption dashboard page is the landing page for the dashboard. The Usage and adoption dashboard page contains two tabs that provide insights on usage summary and adoption.

The Usage summary page includes indicators on total and daily AI actions, skill distribution and engagement trend, and daily unique users who have used AI skills. The Adoption page tracks the departments with the highest AI usage, comparison of actions by department, and feedback and error details. Use the date range, channel, and product filters to view usage and adoption indicators for the selected period, channel, and product, respectively. The default date range is 30 days.
