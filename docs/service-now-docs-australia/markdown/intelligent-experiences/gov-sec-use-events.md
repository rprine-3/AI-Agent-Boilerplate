# Monitor AI asset security events and recommendations

Triage and resolve AI recommendations and AI asset security events to optimize AI asset security.

## Before you begin

Role required: AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\]

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **AI Control Tower** &gt; **Govern** &gt; **Security**.

2.  On the **Overview** tab, go to Your top recommendations.

    **Note:** In a domain-separated instance, Your top recommendations isn't shown. Go to Security events detected instead to review AI asset security events.

3.  In Your top recommendations, review the AI recommendations and security tasks assigned to you.

    Always confirm that these recommendations align with your specific needs before taking action.

4.  On any AI recommendation, select **Open** to view all associated AI asset security events.

    For more information, see [Activity Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aict-activity-center.md).

5.  On any AI asset security event, select **View map** to see the AI asset in the agent map, or **View asset** to view AI asset details.

    If your AI agent has malicious activity detected and you have enabled AI agent containment using kill switch protocol, a banner appears.

    \[Omitted image "gov-sec-malicious-activity-banner.png"\] Alt text: Banner indicating that malicious activity was detected for the AI agent.

6.  In the malicious activity banner, select **View details** to address the AI agent issue.

    For more information, see [Contain AI agents manually using kill switch protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/gov-sec-manage-ai-agents-using-kill-switch-protocol.md).
