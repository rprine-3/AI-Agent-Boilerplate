# Report a GRC issue AI agent

This AI agent enriches the given issue description with additional information by looking at historical data and using GRC context. It analyzes, extracts key information \(such as issue type, date of occurrence, and so on\), and creates a GRC issue.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to report a GRC issue.

1.  Receive the user's request and gather key information.
2.  Review the isIssue field from the tool response and respond to the user.
3.  Ask the user for additional or missing issue details according to a template.
4.  Interact conversationally to refine the issue.
5.  Create an issue when the user is satisfied and selects **Submit**.
