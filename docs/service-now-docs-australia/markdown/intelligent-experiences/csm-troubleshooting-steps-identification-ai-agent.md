# Troubleshooting steps identification AI agent

An AI agent responsible for gathering required context, identifying troubleshooting steps by comparing with KBs, similar cases and standard operating manuals, and proposing additional troubleshooting steps.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to troubleshooting steps identification.

1.  Retrieve case details and identify troubleshooting actions already attempted by the user to avoid duplication.
2.  Search for relevant troubleshooting guidance from similar cases and knowledge articles using the case description. If no relevant results are found, exit with the predefined message.
3.  Analyze retrieved cases and knowledge articles to extract actionable troubleshooting steps with correct source attribution.
4.  Identify and process any related documents linked to the search results, applying deterministic document selection logic and extracting troubleshooting steps when documents exist.
5.  Combine troubleshooting steps from cases, knowledge articles, and documents, then remove steps already attempted by the user or semantically equivalent duplicates.
6.  Present only unique, value-added troubleshooting recommendations in a structured format, clearly separating top recommendations, additional suggestions, and a fully hyperlinked sources section.
7.  Ask for confirmation before updating work notes, update them only upon approval, display the exact confirmation message when successful, and then exit the workflow.
