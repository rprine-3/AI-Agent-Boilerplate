Name

</td><td>

Name of the demand.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Category of the demand:-   Strategic: For demands for plans, such as projects or stories.
-   Operational: For demands for operational work, such as changes or defects.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

The **Category** field selection determines the selections available in the **Type** field.-   The following demand types are available if the demand category is Strategic:
    -   Enhancement
    -   Project
    -   Epic
    -   Story

    -   No Conversion

If the Agile Development 2.0 application is active, the Story, Epic, Enhancement, and Defect options are available.

If the Strategic Planning application is active, the EAP Epic, EAP Feature, and EAP Capability options are available.

The No Conversion option lets you fund a large project that includes one or more projects, epics, or programs.

The selections in the **Category** and **Type** field also determine the fields that are displayed in the Assessment Data section.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approved start date

</td><td>

The formal date approved by stakeholders for starting the demand. This date is set after prioritization and stakeholder approval and represents the committed and authorized timeline for execution. It's used for governance and traceability.For example, the approved date to start the database upgrade is 2026-01-10.

This field is carried forward to the **Approved start date** field of the Project form when the demand is converted to a project. The value remains unchanged even if the project starts later. This field is highlighted in red if the date is different than the value in the **Start date** field.

**Note:** If this field is empty while creating a demand, the date from the **Start date** field is inserted.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approved end date

</td><td>

The formal date approved by stakeholders for completing the demand. This date is set after prioritization and stakeholder approval and defines the approved execution window and supports historical tracking. For example, the approved end date to complete the demand is 2026-02-15.

This field is carried forward to the **Approved end date** field of the Project form when the demand is converted to a project. The value remains unchanged even if the project ends later.This field is highlighted in red if the date in this field is different than the value in the **Due date** field.

**Note:** If this field is empty while creating a demand, the date from the **Due date** field is inserted.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Start date

</td><td>

The preliminary or estimated date when the work is initially planned to begin. This date helps outline the intended timing for early demand planning and prioritization. You can set this date during initial demand creation or anytime in the planning phase when a rough idea forms. This date can be updated until the demand is officially approved. For example, you're planning for a database upgrade to start on 2025-11-01.

This date is changed to **Planned start date** when the demand is converted to a project.**Note:**

-   When you change the planned start date of a demand or project, the associated cost plans and resource assignments also change. The **Change Resource Plan and Cost Plan Start Date with Demand or Project Start Date Change** property controls the behavior for a demand date change. This property isn't enabled by default.
-   The **Start date** column label is changed to **Planned start date**. This change is applicable only for new customers who begin using the Australia version. If you're upgrading to the Australia release from an earlier release, you will continue to see the prior labels.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Due date

</td><td>

The preliminary or estimated date when the planned work is expected to be completed. This date provides an expected completion window for planning and stakeholder communication. You can set this date anytime in the planning phase when a rough idea forms and can be updated until the demand is officially approved.For example, you're planning to complete the database upgrade by 2025-12-31.

**Note:**

-   The **Due date** column label is changed to **Planned end date**. This change is applicable only for new customers who begin using the Australia version. If you're upgrading to the Australia release from an earlier release, you will continue to see the prior labels.
-   This date is changed to **Planned end date** when the demand is converted to a project.

This value is useful when evaluating the overall investment performance. For example, at a 12% discount rate, $1.00 today is worth $0.80 in two years. Therefore, receiving $1.00 in two years is the same as receiving $0.80 today.

 Net present value \(NPV\) is calculated from total costs according to year, financial benefit per year, and the discount rate for the demand.
