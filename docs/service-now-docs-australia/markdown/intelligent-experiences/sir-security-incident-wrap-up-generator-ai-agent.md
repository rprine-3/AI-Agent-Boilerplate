# Security incident wrap up generator AI agent

This Operational Technology Security Incident Response agent can close a security incident by performing all pre-closure validations. It can also generate close notes, generate post incident analysis, post work note, and update the state of the security incident to close it.

## Workflow

1.  If the user explicitly requests closing as a false positive, follow the short path. Otherwise, follow the full closure path.
2.  Retrieve the incident details. If already closed or cancelled, inform the user and end.
3.  If the user explicitly requests closing as a false positive, close the incident immediately and end.
4.  If the user doesn't explicitly requests closing as a false positive, warn the user if open response tasks or mandatory assessments will be affected. Get approval before continuing.
5.  Produce a post-incident analysis, close notes, and a suggested close code. The user reviews and approves or revises each before proceeding.
6.  Write the approved content to the record and confirm closure.
