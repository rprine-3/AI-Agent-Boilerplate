# Access Observer configuration manager AI agent

This ServiceNow Vault agent helps users complete tasks related to Access Observer configuration manager.

## Workflow

1.  Check the user has the security\_admin role.
2.  Identify which operation the user wants to perform, or present the five supported options:
    -   **Create**

        Collect a table and column. Validate that both exist and aren't blocked, collect start/end dates, then run through a series of checks before creating the Access Observer configuration. On success, direct the user to the **Summarize Access Observer logs** skill.

    -   **Delete**

        Collect table and column and show matching configurations. Prompt the user select one, and delete it.

    -   **Deactivate**

        Collect table and column and show matching configurations. Prompt the user select one, and deactivate it.

    -   **Get/Fetch**

        Collect table and column. Retrieve and display all configurations for that specific combination.

    -   **List all**

        Retrieve and display all Access Observer configurations.
