# Hardware Asset Management sourcing AI agent

This AI agent helps to source a requested hardware item through consume, transfer, and purchase.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to hardware asset management sourcing.

1.  Prompt the user for an item number, if not already provided.
2.  Use the Fetch the details of the requested item tool to retrieve information for the requested item number.
3.  If there's no error, inform the user of the required quantity.
4.  Execute workflow A, which sources the item. If auto\_consume, auto\_transfer, and auto\_purchase are true, and there are no problems, validate the sourcing for the user. If successful, continue to the next step.
5.  Execute workflow B, which generates a guided source plan for the requested hardware. The user must approve this plan. If successful, continue to the next step.
6.  Execute workflow C, which generates the input plan for the requested hardware. The user must approve this plan.
7.  End workflow when C completes.
