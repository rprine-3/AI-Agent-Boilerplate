# Create change requests for AI assets

Create a change request to modify the relationships between a deployed AI asset and its related assets.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\)
-   AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\)

## About this task

To modify the relationships between related AI assets, a user with the AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\) role can initiate the change process by creating and submitting a change request. After the request is submitted, a user with the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\) role can review and approve the request. This approval triggers the AI Control Tower application to create a new AI asset record for the asset that the change request was created for. The asset then automatically enters the onboarding stage of the asset life cycle.

You can create change requests for the following AI asset types:

-   AI systems \(classic, generative, and agentic\)
-   AI models
-   Datasets

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **AI Control Tower**.

2.  If you have the AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\) role, create a change request.

    1.  Initiate the request by using one of the following navigation options.

    4.  In the Submit change request dialog box, select **Submit request**.

        After the dialog box closes, you are automatically redirected to the new change request record.

3.  If you have the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\) role, approve or reject the request.

</table>        The change request record opens.

    2.  On the **Details** tab, set the **Assigned to** field to the user who you want to assign the change request to.

        You can assign the request to yourself or to any other user with the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\) role.

    3.  If you are the assigned user, approve or reject the request.

        -   To approve the request, select **Approve**.
        -   To reject the request, select **Reject**.
    -   If you approved the request, the Status changes to Approved and the State changes to In progress.

        The AI Control Tower application then generates a change task for each asset that is impacted by the request. These change tasks appear on the **Change tasks** tab and specify the actions that must be taken on the impacted assets. Each change task is assigned to a user with the AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\) role. If you have any concerns or need further clarification on the request, you can create additional change tasks manually. After the assigned users complete all change tasks, the AI Control Tower application automatically creates a new AI asset record for the asset that the change request was created for. The State of the request then changes to Completed.

        **Note:** The **Change tasks** tab is not available if the change request was created for a dataset.

    -   If you rejected the request, the Status changes to Rejected and the State changes to Completed.
