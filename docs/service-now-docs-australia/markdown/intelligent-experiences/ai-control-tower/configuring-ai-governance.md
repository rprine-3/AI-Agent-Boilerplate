# Configure AI Control Tower

Configuring the AI Control Tower for Now Assist from the **Configurations** page.

## Before you begin

Role required: AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\]

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Workspaces &gt;** **AI Control Tower &gt;** **Configuration** view in the AI Control Tower.

2.  Expand **Data** and select **Opt in** under **Data sharing**.

    To view the **Data** section, confirm that the generative AI Controller plugin is installed.

    The **Opt in** option is enabled by default.

    **Note:** Opting out of data sharing can only be reversed by your Account Executive or the Now Support team.

    For more information about Data sharing, see the FAQs \(common questions\) section on the Data Sharing page.

3.  Select **Controls** and activate the **Automatically trigger playbooks** option.

    The **Automatically trigger playbooks** option is inactive by default.

    Enabling the **Automatically trigger playbooks** and adding an AI asset to this environment automatically triggers approval requests.

    **Note:** When the Automatically trigger playbooks isn't enabled, the approval requests aren't generated automatically, however, the asset manager can initiate them manually.

    Verify to have the **Automatically trigger playbooks** option enabled in your production environment.


## Result

The AI Control Tower is configured.
