# Target tables for Azure and Copilot

Target tables for storing Service Graph Connectors for Azure and Copilot data.

Both Azure Foundry and Copilot data sources use the following main target tables:

## Digital Asset Tables

-   alm\_ai\_system\_digital\_asset- AI System digital assets
-   alm\_ai\_prompt\_digital\_asset- AI Prompt digital assets

## Entity Tables

-   sn\_ent\_ai\_tool- AI Tools
-   sn\_ent\_ai\_system\_subcomponent\_m2m- AI System Subcomponent many-to-many relationships.

## Usage Table

sn\_ai\_disc\_ai\_usage- AI Usage/Execution data.

## Additional information

-   Staging tables are import set tables where data is initially loaded from external sources.
-   Target tables are the destination where transformed data is stored.
-   Data flows from Data Source → Staging Table → Transform Map → Target Table.
-   For the tools attached to AI Agents which are discovered, the tool names are suffixed to ensure uniqueness. This is the format for tool name- tool-name:tenantid:resource-name:project-name.
