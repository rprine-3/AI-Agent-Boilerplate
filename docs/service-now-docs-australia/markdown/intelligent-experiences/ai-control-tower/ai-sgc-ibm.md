## ServiceNow prerequisites

Complete the following setup steps when configuring the connector for the first time.

**Note:** Updating data source access and clearing cache are prerequisites that must be completed only once, when setting up a new instance for the first time.

Update data source access

The connector requires write permissions to the Data Source table to create data sources.

To enable data source creation:

1.  Select **Global** from the application picker.
2.  Navigate to **Application Access**.
3.  Select the **Can create**, **Can update**, and **Can delete** check boxes.
4.  Select **Update**.
5.  Switch to the connector application scope.

Clear cache

Clear the cached data for the Data Source and Tables.

To clear the cache:

1.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Background Scripts**.
2.  Enter the following script in the **Run Script** text box:

    ```
    GlideTableManager.invalidateTable('sys_data_source');
    GlideCacheManager.flushTable('sys_data_source');
    GlideTableManager.invalidateTable('sys_db_object');
    GlideCacheManager.flushTable('sys_db_object');
    
    ```

3.  Select **Run Script**.

    **Note:** The script might take several minutes to complete. After completion, switch to the connector application scope.


## IBM prerequisites

Generate an IBM Cloud API Key and configure access for the connector before creating a connection. For setup instructions and API details, see the [AI Service Graph Connector for IBM — Setup Instructions \[KB2901071\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2901071) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

After completing the IBM setup requirements, register the connector in your ServiceNow instance.
