# AI Service Graph Connector for Microsoft

The AI Service Graph Connector for Microsoft enables you to discover and import AI assets from Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio environments into ServiceNow AI Control Tower.

Key capabilities:

-   Discovery of Azure AI Foundry agents across ML Services, AI Services, and New Foundry variants.
-   Discovery of Microsoft Copilot agents across single or multiple Power Platform environments.
-   AI asset lineage and dependency tracking through sub-component relationships.
-   Usage and execution of metrics aggregated by agent, date, and session.
-   Support for tenant-wide discovery or filtered discovery by resource and region \(Azure Foundry\).
-   Multi-environment discovery using a single Copilot connection.

</table>## ServiceNow Prerequisites

Complete the following setup steps once when configuring the connector for the first time.

**Note:** Updating data source access and clear cache is a prerequisite that needs to be completed only once, when setting up a new instance for the first time.

Update Data Source Access:

The connector requires write permissions to the Data Source table to create data sources.

To enable data source creation:

1.  Select **Global** from the application picker.
2.  Navigate to **Application Access**.
3.  Select the **Can create**, **Can update**, and **Can delete** check boxes.
4.  Select **Update**.
5.  Switch to the connector application scope.

Clear the cached data for the Data Source and Tables.

To clear the cache:

1.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Background Scripts**.
2.  Enter the following script in the **Run Script** text box:

    ```
    GlideTableManager.invalidateTable('sys_data_source');
    GlideCacheManager.flushTable('sys_data_source');
    GlideTableManager.invalidateTable('sys_db_object');
    GlideCacheManager.flushTable('sys_db_object');
    
    ```

3.  Select **Run Script**.

    **Note:** The script might take several minutes to complete. After completion, switch to the connector application scope.


-   Enter multiple environment IDs as comma-separated values in the Environment ID field \(eg: env-id-1, env-id-2, env-id-3\).
-   The same OAuth credentials \(Client ID and Client Secret\) are used for all environments.
-   Verify the application user is configured in each environment with the required security roles.
-   Each environment will be tested and discovered separately during the import process.
