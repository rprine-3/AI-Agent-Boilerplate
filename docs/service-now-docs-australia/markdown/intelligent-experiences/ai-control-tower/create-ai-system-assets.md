# Create AI system assets

Create AI assets to track and manage the life cycles of your AI systems.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward or sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner

## About this task

An AI system is a software artifact that provides AI and machine learning \(ML\) capabilities to generate outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, and decisions, with varying levels of autonomy. Each AI system can be associated with one or more AI models, which may also be associated with one or more prompts and datasets. These AI models, prompts, and datasets enable the AI system to process data and solve complex problems with little to no human intervention.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **AI Control Tower**.

2.  From the AI Control Tower, open the AI assets view.

3.  From the navigation menu of the AI assets view, navigate to either **AI asset inventory - Managed** &gt; **AI Systems** or **AI asset inventory - Unmanaged** &gt; **AI Systems**.

4.  Select **Add AI system**.

5.  In the Details section of the Add AI system form, fill in the fields.

7.  In the Related assets section of the Add AI system form, associate the AI system with other AI assets that are related to it.

    1.  Depending on the type of related AI asset that you want associate the AI system with, select one of the following options from the asset type menu:

        -   To associate the AI system with any of its supported components or subsystems, select **Sub AI systems**.

            **Note:** This option is available only if you set the **Asset type** field to either **Agentic AI** or **Generative AI** in the Details section of the Add AI system form.

        -   To associate the AI system with any of its integrated AI models, select **AI models**.
        -   To associate the AI system with a dataset that is used to test an integrated AI model, select **Evaluation datasets**.
        -   To associate the AI system with a prompt that you are providing to an integrated AI model, select **Prompts**.
        -   To associate the AI system with any of its integrated AI tools, select **Tools**.

            **Note:** This option is available only if you set the **Asset type** field to **Agentic AI** in the Details section of the Add AI system form.

        The corresponding asset list opens.

    2.  Associate the AI system with the related AI asset.

        Depending on if the related AI asset is currently available in your asset inventory, proceed with one of the following options:

        -   To associate the AI system with a related AI asset that is currently available, use the following steps:

            1.  Select the Add from inventory drop-down menu on the header of the corresponding asset list.
            2.  Select **Add from inventory**.
            3.  In the Add from inventory dialog box, select the check box for the related AI asset that you want to associate the AI system with.

                **Note:** If you want to associate the AI system with multiple related AI assets, select the check box for each asset.

            4.  Select **Add**.
            The dialog box closes and the selected AI asset appears in the corresponding asset list.

        -   To associate the AI system with a related AI asset that is not currently available, use the following steps:

            **Note:** This option is not available for AI tools.

            1.  Select the Add from inventory drop-down menu on the header of the corresponding asset list.
            2.  Select **Create**.
            3.  Create the AI asset.
                -   If you are creating an AI system asset, return to [step 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-system-assets.md).
                -   If you are creating an AI model asset, follow the proceeding steps in [Create AI model assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-model-assets.md).
                -   If you are creating a prompt asset, follow the proceeding steps in [Create prompt assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-prompt-assets.md).
                -   If you are creating a dataset asset, follow the proceeding steps in [Create dataset assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-dataset-assets.md).
            The new AI asset appears in the corresponding asset list.

## Result

The AI system is added to your AI asset inventory. It automatically enters the onboard stage of the AI asset life cycle and is updated with a Lifecycle status of AI steward review.

## What to do next

Users who are assigned the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\) role can start the review process to begin tracking and managing the life cycle of the AI system.
