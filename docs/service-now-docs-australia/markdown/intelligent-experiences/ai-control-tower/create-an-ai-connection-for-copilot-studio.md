# Create an AI connection for Copilot Studio \(v3.1.7\)

Create an AI connection for Copilot Studio in AI Control Tower using the  AI Service Graph Connector for Microsoft \(version 3.1.7\).

## Copilot Studio prerequisites

Complete the following steps in your Power Platform environment before creating a Copilot Studio connection.

Register an Application in Microsoft Entra ID

Register an application to obtain OAuth credentials for the connector.

To register the application:

-   Follow the [Microsoft Entra app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) quick start guide to create an application.
-   Record the Client ID and Client Secret from the registration.

Grant application access to your Copilot Studio environment

Configure the application as a user in your Copilot Studio environment.

To configure application access:

1.  Open the [Power Platform admin Center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/home).
2.  Navigate to Environments and select your Copilot Studio environment.
3.  Go to Settings &gt; Users + Permissions &gt; Application users.
4.  Select New App User and add your application using the Client ID from step 1.
5.  Assign the following security roles to the application user:
    -   Basic User
    -   System administrator

If you don't want to create a System administrator role, you can create a Copilot Studio dataverse custom role. For custom role creation, see [Create a Copilot Studio Dataverse custom role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-a-copilot-studio-dataverse-custom-role.md).

**Note:** You can obtain the Environment ID from Settings &gt; Session details &gt; Environment ID in your environment.

Multi-environment Support

You can discover agents from multiple Copilot Studio environments using a single connection.

To configure multi-environment discovery:

-   Enter multiple environment IDs as comma-separated values in the Environment ID field \(examples: env-id-1, env-id-2, env-id-3\).
-   The same OAuth credentials \(Client ID and Client Secret\) are used for all environments.
-   Verify that the application user is configured in each environment with the required security roles.
-   Each environment will be tested and discovered separately during the import process.
