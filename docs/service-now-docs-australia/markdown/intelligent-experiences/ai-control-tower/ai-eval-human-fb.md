The Evaluations section shows all the chats that were auto-evaluated by the large language model \(LLM\). You have the option to manually evaluate conversations to compare the AI evaluations against your own interpretation of how the agent conversation was.

## Manually evaluate a chat

You can manually evaluate each chat to compare it with the AI evaluation.

1.  Select the evaluation that you want to score manually.
2.  Toggle the **View Auto Eval Scores** switch on to see the AI evaluation for each category.
3.  For each category, select your answer for how accurately you feel that the agent responded.

4.  Toggle the **Other Metrics** switch on for a more detailed evaluation.
5.  After completing, select **Submit**.

The **Human user Satisfaction Score** value gets calculated based on your response to the questions. You can see your responses for each evaluation by selecting it and then selecting **View Human Scores**. The **Export** option enables you to export the data in your preferred format.

You can also randomly label evaluations by selecting **Label random scores**. When selected, a list of 10 random, unevaluated conversations from the past 10 days are loaded for manual labeling.
