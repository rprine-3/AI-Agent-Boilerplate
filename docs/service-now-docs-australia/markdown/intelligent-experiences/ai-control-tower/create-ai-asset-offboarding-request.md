# Create offboarding requests for AI assets

Create an offboarding request to retire AI assets that are no longer needed.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\)
-   AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\)

## About this task

To retire a deployed AI asset, a user with the AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\) role can initiate the offboarding process by creating and submitting an offboarding request. After the request is submitted, a user with the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\) role can review and approves the request. This approval triggers the offboarding workflow that assigns tasks to impacted asset owners and updates the Status of the AI asset record to Retired upon completion.

**Note:** We have automated the ServiceNow AI model to initiate the offboarding workflows when a deprecation date is present.

You can create offboarding requests for the following AI asset types:

-   AI systems \(classic, generative, and agentic\)
-   AI models
-   Datasets
-   MCP servers

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **AI Control Tower**.

2.  If you have the AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\) role, create an offboarding request.

    1.  Initiate the request by using one of the following navigation options.
