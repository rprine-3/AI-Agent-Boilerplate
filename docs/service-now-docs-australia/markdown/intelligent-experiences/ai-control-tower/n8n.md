## ServiceNow Prerequisites

Complete the following setup steps once when configuring the connector for the first time.

**Note:** Updating data source access and clear cache is a prerequisite that needs to be completed only once, when setting up a new instance for the first time.

Update Data Source Access:

The connector requires write permissions to the Data Source table to create data sources.

To enable data source creation:

1.  Select **Global** from the application picker.
2.  Navigate to **Application Access**.
3.  Select the **Can create**, **Can update**, and **Can delete** check boxes.
4.  Select **Update**.
5.  Switch to the connector application scope.

Clear the cached data for the Data Source and Tables.

To clear the cache:

1.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Background Scripts**.
2.  Enter the following script in the **Run Script** text box:

    ```
    GlideTableManager.invalidateTable('sys_data_source');
    GlideCacheManager.flushTable('sys_data_source');
    GlideTableManager.invalidateTable('sys_db_object');
    GlideCacheManager.flushTable('sys_db_object');
    
    ```

3.  Select **Run Script**.

    **Note:** The script might take several minutes to complete. After completion, switch to the connector application scope.


## n8n Prerequisites
