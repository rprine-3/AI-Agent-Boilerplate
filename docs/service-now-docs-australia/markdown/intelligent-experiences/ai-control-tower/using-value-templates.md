# Using value templates

Use value templates to define, calculate, and track the value delivered by your AI systems and models.

Value templates introduces a unified and structured framework for defining, calculating, and tracking the value delivered by your AI assets. You can define value based on personas and formulas using customizable templates.

Value templates offer the following benefits.

-   Transparency: Provides visibility into how value is determined for an AI asset.
-   Customization: Supports various persona-driven and formula-based definitions.

Currently, value templates are supported for skills and agents. A value template is assigned to an asset when a skill or agent is activated and deployed as an asset in the system. The following table lists the default value templates.

<table id="table_fbp_pvw_xfc"><thead><tr><th>

AI asset

Default value template

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

ServiceNow skill

</td><td>

Daily skill executions \(Usage\) x average time per execution \(Time\) x 50% \(Acceptance rate\) For example, for Incident Summarization skill, if the daily executions are 1500, average time per execution is 0.2 minutes, acceptance rate is 90%, the value as per the default value template is 1500x0.2x90/100, which is 270 minutes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ServiceNow AI agent

</td><td>

Daily AI agent executions \(Usage\) x average time per execution \(Time\) x 50% \(Acceptance rate\)For example, for Problem investigator agent, if the daily executions are 1000, average time per execution is 1.5 minutes, acceptance rate is 50%, the value as per the default value template is 1000x1.5x50/100, which is 750 minutes.

AWS and Microsoft AI agents

Daily AI agent invocations \(Usage\) x 15 mins \(Time\) x 50% \(Acceptance rate\)
