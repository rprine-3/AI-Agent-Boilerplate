2.  AI Asset Management — Collects information, tracks changes, and manages the lifecycle of AI artifacts such as AI systems, models, datasets, and prompts.
3.  AI Risk and Compliance Management — Supports end-to-end lifecycle management of AI risks, including risk classification of AI assets, mapping to regulatory authority documents, continuous monitoring, and policy compliance.
