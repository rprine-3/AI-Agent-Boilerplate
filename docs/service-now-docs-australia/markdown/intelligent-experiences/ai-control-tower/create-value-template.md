4.  On the Add value template form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Add value template form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/add-value-template-form.md).

5.  Select **Save as draft**.

6.  Validate and test the formula against the available dataset by selecting **Validate and calculate output**.

    You can change the values and validate the formula until you’re satisfied with the output.

7.  If you’re satisfied with the output, publish the template by selecting **Publish**.

    When a value template is published, it’s modified across all instances and subsequent calculations are based on the new template.
