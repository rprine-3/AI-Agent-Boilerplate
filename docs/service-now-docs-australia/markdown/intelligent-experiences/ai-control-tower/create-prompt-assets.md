# Create prompt assets

Create AI assets to track and manage the life cycles of your prompts.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward or sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner

## About this task

A prompt is the instructive input that you provide to AI models to elicit specific responses or outputs. The more detailed and descriptive a prompt is, the higher the quality of the response or output. Examples of prompts include instructions, questions, and commands.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **AI Control Tower**.

2.  From the AI Control Tower, open the AI assets view.

3.  From the navigation menu of the AI assets view, navigate to either **AI asset inventory - Managed** &gt; **Prompts** or **AI asset inventory - Unmanaged** &gt; **Prompts**.

4.  Select **Add prompt**.

5.  In the Details section of the Add prompt form, fill in the fields.

This field is automatically set to the user who creates the prompt asset.**Note:** This field is editable only if you have the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\) role. If you have the AI asset owner \(sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\) role, this field is read-only.

</table>6.  Select **Submit for review**.

    **Note:** If you aren’t ready to submit the prompt for review, select **Save** instead. You can then edit it and submit it for review later by navigating to **AI assets** &gt; **Lifecycle** &gt; **Onboard** and then selecting the prompt from the list. When the AI asset record opens, continue editing the prompt details.


## Result

The prompt is added to your AI asset inventory. It automatically enters the onboard stage of the AI asset life cycle and is updated with a Lifecycle status of AI steward review.

## What to do next

Users who are assigned the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\) role can start the review process to begin tracking and managing the life cycle of the prompt.
