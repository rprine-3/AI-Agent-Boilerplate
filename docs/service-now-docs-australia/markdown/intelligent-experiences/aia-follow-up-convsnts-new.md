# Follow-up conversations

AI agents continue with follow-up conversations after the AI agent execution is complete.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_aia\_admin

## About this task

When the \[sn\_aia.enable\_follow\_up\] system property is set to **true** and if there is no record for the agentic workflow created in the Agent properties \[sn\_aia\_property\] table, then the AI agents continue with the `How else can I help you?` follow-up message after the agentic workflow execution.

The AI agent conversation doesn't get closed after the execution is complete by default. If you would like to override the follow-up behavior for your AI agents for a specific agentic workflow, you must create a record in the Agent Properties \[sn\_aia\_property\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definitions** &gt; **Tables** and open the Agent Properties \[sn\_aia\_property\] table.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
