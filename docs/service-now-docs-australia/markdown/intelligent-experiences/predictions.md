# Predictions in Information Extraction skill

A prediction is the value that the Information Extraction skill infers for each field, table, or question in a use case. Predictions drive automation decisions and can be applied automatically or reviewed by a person, depending on the use case configuration.

## How predictions are generated

A prediction is the value that the Information Extraction skill infers for a field, table, or question in a specific use case. When you submit a document for processing, the skill processes its content and generates a prediction for each field, table cell, and question set in that use case.

A prediction shows what the skill identifies as the correct value based on the content in the document. Whether a prediction is applied without review or reviewed by a person depends on the automation setting for the use case. To understand how automation settings control whether predictions are applied automatically or sent for review, see [Automation modes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/automation-modes.md).

## Prediction sources
