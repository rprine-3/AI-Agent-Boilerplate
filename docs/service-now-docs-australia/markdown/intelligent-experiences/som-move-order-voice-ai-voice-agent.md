# Move order voice AI agent

This Sales Customer Relationship Management voice agent helps users relocate a telecom service to a new address by validating the consumer, verifying serviceability at the target location, and creating a move order.

## Workflow

1.  Confirm the user wants to move a telecom service to a new address, and extract any details already mentioned \(current location, product offering, new address\).
2.  Verify the current user is a valid consumer in the system.
3.  Fetch the consumer's services at their current location for the specified product offering.
4.  Confirm the existing service location is valid.
5.  Check if the target address already exists for the consumer. Create it if it doesn't exist.
6.  Verify the product offering is available at the new location.
7.  Build the product offering list from the consumer's active services and create the move order with the current location, new location, and consumer details.
8.  Inform the user of the move order number on success, or that creation failed, and ask if they need further help.
