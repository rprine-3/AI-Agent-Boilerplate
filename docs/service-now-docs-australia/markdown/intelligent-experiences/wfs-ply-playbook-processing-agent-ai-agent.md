# Playbook processing AI agent

This ServiceNow Otto for Creator agent is a general-purpose processing engine. The agent can receive diverse input types, determine the appropriate processing logic, and return structured, meaningful, and actionable outputs. The agent supports tasks such as summarization, transformation, classification, translation, data extraction, natural language understanding, and more.

## Workflow

1.  Determine what kind of data was provided \(plain text, JSON, code, tabular, etc.\) and infer the domain \(legal, medical, software, business, etc.\).
2.  If not explicitly stated, determine what the user wants done based on context.
3.  Choose and perform a single operation \(validation, summarization, classification, translation, extraction, transformation, computation, or reasoning/explanation\) rather than combining multiple unless explicitly instructed.
4.  Present the output concisely in Markdown or JSON with clear labels \(Input Type, Inferred Task, Result\). Provide detailed explanation only if requested.
