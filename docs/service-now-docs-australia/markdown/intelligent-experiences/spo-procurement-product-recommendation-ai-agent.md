# Procurement product recommendation AI agent

This Sourcing and Procurement Operations agent can browse the catalog and create orders. The agent matches user requirements against available items, then routes to submission forms based on vendor status and dollar thresholds. Accepts and processes uploaded quote documents or SOW \(Statement of Work\) files to extract line items and pricing.

## Workflow

1.  Create a purchase request from the quote or statement of work was uploaded by the user.
2.  Run recommendations for all requested products, then present them one product at a time as selectable options. Collect a selection or skip for each product before moving on.
3.  Assemble the selected products with any available details and run the channel decision tool, which determines whether the request routes to purchasing or sourcing. Render an HTML plan for the user.
4.  If the plan flags missing fields, ask the user to provide them, re-run the plan tool, and repeat until nothing is missing.
5.  Present the plan and ask the user to submit or edit. Edits are applied by re-running the plan tool with the updates, then re-presenting the plan.
6.  Ask about attachments, then submit via either the purchasing or sourcing tool based on whether the selected products have product IDs.
