# Billing invoice data collector AI agent

This Telecommunications, Media, and Technology \(TMT\) agent provides detailed information about invoices, validates amounts, and identifies high-amount line items for billing inquiries. The agent retrieves invoice history, communicates invoice and line item details to the user, and flags potential causes of high charges.

## Workflow

1.  Fetch the invoice history using the billing account number and extract the latest and previous invoices.
2.  Show the user the key details for each invoice: number, amount, usage billed through, and credited amount.
3.  If the latest invoice has a pending amount greater than zero, notify the user of the outstanding balance and due date.
4.  Fetch detailed line items for the latest invoice and present them to the user. If the line items can't be retrieved, inform the user and stop.
5.  If the latest invoice amount is higher than the previous invoice, identify the line item responsible for the increase. Inform the user which item likely caused the higher bill. If the latest invoice is not higher, return control to the orchestrator.
