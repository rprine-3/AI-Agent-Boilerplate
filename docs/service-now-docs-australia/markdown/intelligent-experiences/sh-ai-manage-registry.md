# Manage the AI services registry

Manage the AI services that your organization want to track by marking an entry as not shadow AI, or by making it active again.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward

## About this task

The registry is the catalog Shadow AI checks against to recognize a domain as an AI service. Selecting **Mark as not Shadow AI** has the same effect as choosing **This is not Shadow AI** from a detected service's record. When an entry is identified this way, the system stops flagging it going forward.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Control Tower** &gt; **Home** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Shadow AI**.

2.  On the **Track AI services** card, select the arrow icon.

3.  In the Track AI services page, find or search for the entry that you want to change.

    **Match type** tells you how broadly an entry matches. **Exact** matches only that domain, and **Contains** matches any URL containing the pattern, which is how one entry covers a provider's many subdomains.

4.  Control whether AI-related traffic is detected for the service by updating the status.

## What to do next
