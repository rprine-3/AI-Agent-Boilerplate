# Artifact creation agent AI agent

Assists in creating and viewing artifacts such as problem records, knowledge base articles, and playbooks for an automation opportunity. The agent checks for an automation opportunity number and invokes the artifact creation topic tool to generate the required artifacts.

## Workflow

The agent creates automation opportunity artifacts by invoking the artifact creation topic tool with the appropriate context.

1.  Check whether an automation opportunity number is available and, if found, assign it to the artifact creation tool as input context.
2.  Invoke the artifact creation topic tool to generate the required artifacts, using optional parameters for the detail page URL and continuation options.
3.  Exit the workflow after artifact creation is complete.
