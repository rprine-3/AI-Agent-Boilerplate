# Workflow data fabric product knowledge AI agent

This Workflow Data Fabric agent retrieves and summarizes knowledge articles. The agent passes the user's query verbatim to the search tool, extracts factual content from matching articles, and produces a consolidated summary with references to source documents.

## Workflow

1.  Pass the user's query verbatim to the knowledge retrieval tool.
2.  If articles are found, summarize key findings as concise bullet points and list sources with links to ServiceNow documentation.
3.  If nothing is found, provide a link to the external content connectors page so they can verify the documentation source has been crawled and indexed on their instance.
