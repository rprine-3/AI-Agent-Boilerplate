# Create a derived dataset

Create a smaller, derived dataset from an existing dataset using AI Data Kit. Use derived datasets to isolate specific records for focused ground truth labeling or evaluation without modifying the original dataset.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_data\_kit.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Data Kit** &gt; **Home**, and open an existing dataset in the **Datasets** tab.

2.  Select the **Create derived dataset** button at the top of the **Records** list.

3.  In the **Add dataset info** section, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Dataset name|Name of the derived dataset.|
    |Dataset description|Description of the derived dataset. This field is pre-populated with a reference to the parent dataset.|
    |Tags|Keywords to help identify and search for the dataset.|

4.  In the **Choose records** section, select a selection method and choose the records to include.

    A minimum of 10 records must be selected before you can create the dataset.

    -   **Manual Selection**: Select the check box next to each record you want to include.
    -   **Sampling Selection**: Select a sampling method from the drop-down menu, enter a number in the sample size box, and select **Run** to preview the sampled records.
5.  Select **Create dataset**.

    The derived dataset is added as a separate dataset.


## What to do next

After you have created the derived dataset, you can add ground truth to its records.
