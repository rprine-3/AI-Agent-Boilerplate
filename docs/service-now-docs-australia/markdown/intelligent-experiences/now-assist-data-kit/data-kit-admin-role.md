# AI Data Kit roles \(sn\_data\_kit.admin\)

Users with this role can create, update, and publish datasets and data collections in AI Data Kit. This role includes all permissions granted by `sn_data_kit.analyst`.

## Contains Roles

List of roles contained within the role.

None.

## Groups

List of groups this role is assigned to by default.

None.

## Special considerations

The `sn_aia.viewer` role \(Now Assist AI Agents viewer\) inherits `sn_data_kit.admin`. As a result, any user assigned `sn_aia.viewer` — for example, to grant read-only access to the AI Agent Analytics dashboard — also receives full AI Data Kit admin permissions. This behavior is unintended and is tracked under PRB2003416. Until the defect is resolved, review the roles assigned to `sn_aia.viewer` users before deploying that role broadly in governance-sensitive environments.
