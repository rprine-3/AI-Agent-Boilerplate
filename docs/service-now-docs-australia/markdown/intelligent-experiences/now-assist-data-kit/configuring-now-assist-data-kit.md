# Configuring AI Data Kit

Configure system properties, plugins, and roles to enable all features of AI Data Kit.

## System properties

Some AI Data Kit features require system properties that are not enabled by default. Configure the following properties in System Properties after installation.

|Property|Value|Description|
|--------|-----|-----------|
|`sn_data_kit.enable_ground_truth`|true|Enables the **Create ground truth guidelines** button on dataset records. Must be created manually in the **Global** application scope as a String type. If this property does not exist or is set to any other value, the button does not appear.|

## Required plugins for sensitive data scanning

The sensitive data scan feature requires the following plugins to be active on your instance. Activate these before using [Find and cleanse sensitive data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-data-kit/sensitive-data.md).

-   `sn_data_discovery`
-   `sn_dp_store_app` \(Data Privacy\)
-   `com.glide.data_privacy`

## Role configuration

After installing AI Data Kit, assign roles to users who need access. The platform `admin` role alone does not grant access to the application. All users, including administrators, require at least `sn_data_kit.analyst` to access the AI Data Kit Home page. For full role descriptions and special considerations, see .
