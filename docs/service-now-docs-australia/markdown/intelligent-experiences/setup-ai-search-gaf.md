# Set up AI Search for GAF

Configure AI Search to enable Group Action Framework \(GAF\) to improve quality and consistency of agentic AI and generative AI on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

GAF is a feature on the ServiceNow AI Platform that clusters and indexes related records and executes actions on them in agentic AI and generative AI. See [Group Action Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/group-action-framework.md) for more information about GAF's role in intelligent experiences and how it works.

AI Search is the foundation for GAF's optimized prediction feature. AI Search is the backup search for certain workflows, and if it is not enabled and ready, GAF will not return any results.

You must index every table for each workflow or application you'd like to configure GAF for. For example, if you're configuring GAF for ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management, you must index the Incident and related tables.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Status**.

    If you see “AI Search is ready,” proceed. If not, request AI Search installation, which can take 2–24 hours.

2.  Install ServiceNow Otto for AI Search by installing an application with generative or agentic AI features.

    For more information, see [Install ServiceNow Otto for AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/install-now-assist-ais.md).

3.  Verify that your LLM provider is configured and accessible.

    GAF's action strategy skill requires a working LLM provider \(such as OpenAI or Anthropic\) to generate topics and summaries. Before proceeding with AI Search indexing, verify the following:

    -   **LLM provider credentials:** Navigate to the LLM provider configuration and verify that API keys and credentials are current and valid.
    -   **Token quota:** Verify that your LLM provider account has sufficient token quota remaining. If quota is exhausted, the action strategy job will fail with "Action strategy job trigger failed. The topic is not generated for any group."
    -   **Model availability:** Verify that the selected model \(e.g., GPT-4, Claude\) is available and accessible.
    If any of these checks fail, contact your LLM provider to resolve the issue before proceeding.

4.  Navigate to the Now Assist Skill Config \[sn\_nowassist\_skill\_config\] table by entering `sn_nowassist_skill_config.list` in the filter navigator.

5.  Search the Now Assist Skill Config table for action strategy skills by searching **Name** is `*action strategy`, and select the action strategy skill for the application you want to configure.

    For example, if you're configuring GAF for ITSM, select the GAF ITSM action strategy record.

    \[Omitted image "gaf-action-strategy.png"\] Alt text: Now Assist Skill Config table filtered for skill configs with name contains action strategy

6.  In the related list, select the Now Assist Skill Config Var Set record.

7.  Set **Semantic Index Name** to the appropriate field for your table.

    To find the field for your table, go to the Semantic Index Configuration \[ais\_semantic\_index\_configuration\] table by entering `ais_semantic_index_configuration.list` in the filter navigator, filter the **Indexed Source** for the table you want to index, and use the value in the **Name** field. For example, the value is **body** for the Incident table.

8.  Navigate to the Semantic Index Configuration \[ais\_semantic\_index\_configuration\] table by entering `ais_semantic_index_configuration.list` in the filter navigator, filter the **Indexed Source** for the table you want to index and the **Semantic Index Name** you configured in the previous step, and set **Active** to `true` to activate the embedding model.

    \[Omitted image "gaf-sic-is-filtered.png"\] Alt text: Semantic Index Configuration table filtered for Index Source contains Incident

9.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Index** &gt; **Indexed Source**, filter the list so that the **Name** is the name of the table you're configuring, and select the record.

10. Select **Index All Tables**.

    \[Omitted image "gaf-index-tables.png"\] Alt text: Indexed Source record for the Incident table open with a Index All Tables UI action at the top right


## Result

The tables for ServiceNow Otto for AI Search for your Now Assist application is indexed based on the appropriate field.

## What to do next

To confirm that indexing has occurred successfully, check the Indexed Source History related list and ensure that both the **Keyword Ingestion State** and **Semantic Ingestion State** are both set to **Indexed**.

Once your tables have been indexed, you can continue to [Configure Group Action Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-gaf.md) to set up GAF for each application.
