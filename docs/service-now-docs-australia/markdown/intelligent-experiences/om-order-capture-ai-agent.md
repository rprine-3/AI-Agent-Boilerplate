# Order capture AI agent

This AI agent helps order-management agents investigate, understand, and update customer orders in any form, whether direct \(“apply 10% discount to all lines”\), corrective \(“this address is wrong, fix it”\), bulk \(“set quantity to 50 for every item”\), diagnostic \(“why is this order delayed?”\), or follow-up \(“undo the last change”\).

## Workflow

The agent automatically uses the currently opened order as context, validates line-item data, recognizes product and variant references, and interprets both simple and complex change requests. It then determines the safest corrective action—such as updating fields in bulk, modifying specific line items, swapping products, adding new items, removing incorrect ones, or fixing fulfillment or shipping details.

1.  Retrieve and confirm the order number.
2.  AGENT IDENTITY AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
3.  GLOBAL VARIABLES \(AGENT VARIABLE STORE\).
