# Manage AI models

Access and select the LLM \(large language model\) provider used for various AI skills. The selection impacts all the skills within the capability.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

This feature is available in AI Admin Hub version 6.2 and Yokohama patch 6 onwards.

To enable the model provider selection, confirm that the skill is available in that region. The configuration controls for the approved model providers and corresponding conforming skills for specific regions are approved in AI Control Tower by the AI steward. For example, to update the model provider for ServiceNow Otto Q&amp;A Genius Results, confirm that all the skills under Conversational skills are available and active in the region.

As per the AI Control Tower settings, the model provider selection is available at multiple levels, including skill, skill group, and instance levels in AI Admin Hub. When a skill is not conforming or a model provider is unavailable in a particular region, AI Admin Hub console presents the admin persona with alternate region scope options. It seeks approval permissions to proceed with model provider selection. For example: You opt to switch to another model provider to use a particular AI skill. Consider, the region scope must be changed to global location for the skill to work. Here, you can proceed only after consenting to the region scope change.

**Note:** For regulated markets:

-   The **Manage LLM** option will not be available on the AI Admin Hub user interface.
-   Only Now LLM Service skills will be available. Any skill that leverages external providers \(e.g., Azure\) will be hidden on the AI Admin Hub console. With the exception of NSC region, skills leveraging Azure OpenAI is available to the users.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **Settings**.
