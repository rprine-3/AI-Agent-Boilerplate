# EDR AI agent

This Operational Technology Security Incident Response agent retrieves host details or isolates a host associated with a security incident.

## Workflow

1.  Identify the configuration item \(CI\) from the security incident using hostname, IP address, or device identifier. If no CI is found, inform the user and stop. Run the get host details action. If the request fails, inform the user and stop.
2.  Identify the CI and security incident from user input. If no CI is found, ask the user how to proceed. Run the isolate host action. If the request fails, ask the user how to proceed.
