# Migrate to updated AI asset onboarding playbook

Configure the new AI asset onboarding playbook to simplify AI asset management through structured lifecycle workflows. The migration also includes an opt-in to decide between moving to the new playbook or continuing in the existing playbook.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Playbooks**.

    The **Playbooks** settings page shows all published playbooks and their current status.

2.  Locate the **Switch to AI Asset Onboarding playbook 2.0** option.

    This card displays the scope of the migration. It includes a description of what will change and a **Review and switch** button.

    **Note:** Switching to the new playbook will not migrate customization that has been implemented in the existing playbook. However, it will flag the flows and subflows which will be disabled once the new playbook is enabled. This enables you to make fixes to prevent disruptions.

3.  Click **Review and switch**.

4.  On the **What it affects** tab, review the three sections: **What's changing**, **What it affects**, and **Confirm**.

    The dialog lists artifacts that will be deactivated, remain active without changes, and activate as part of the migration.

5.  Expand each section to confirm the specific playbooks, flows, and configurations affected by the switch.

    For example, **Will be deactivated** shows the old playbook name and states that the system handles the migration. **Will remain active, without changes** lists playbooks and flows you've modified since install to preserve your customizations. **Will activate** shows new assets shipped with the updated playbook.

6.  Click **Continue**.

7.  Review any additional confirmation prompts and click **Confirm** to complete the switch.
