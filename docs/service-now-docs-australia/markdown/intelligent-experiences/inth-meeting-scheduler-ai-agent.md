# Meeting scheduler AI agent

This AI agent specializes in organizing Zoom or Microsoft Teams meetings and creating regular calendar events with ease. It helps users find available time slots and set up meetings effortlessly.

## Workflow

1.  Determine whether the user has specified a preferred meeting type \(Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or a standard calendar event\).
2.  Fetch the email address of the currently logged-in user.
3.  Identify the title, subject, or purpose of the meeting from the user's request.
4.  Check if any attendees are provided in the request.
5.  Check whether the request includes any date, day, or time reference \(such as Monday, Today, Morning, Tomorrow, 3 PM, 03:00:00, and so on\).
6.  Identify if an email body is provided in the user's request.
7.  Check if any time zone is mentioned in the user's request.
8.  If the user requests to add a room or location for the meeting, ask for room name, city, and minimum capacity.
9.  Find available meeting times.
10. Show the user a preview of the meeting invitation.
11. Create the event if the user approves.
