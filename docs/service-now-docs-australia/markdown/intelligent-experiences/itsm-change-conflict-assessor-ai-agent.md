# Change conflict assessor AI agent

This AI agent can assess conflicts for changes. This includes checking mandatory fields and trigger conflict detection, and updating worknotes.

## Workflow

The agent shows users a summary of conflicts and impacted services and CIs.

1.  Use the Get Change request information tool to retrieve information for the change request.
2.  Check the change request for the configuration item field.
3.  Check the change request for the planned start date and planned end date fields.
4.  Show these values to the user.
5.  Verify whether a conflict check has run for the change request. If yes, ask the user if they want to run it again. If no, then run it without asking.
6.  Use the Get list of conflicts for the Change Request group by conflict type tool to find conflicts related to the change request.
7.  Show results to the user.
8.  Update worknotes if the user approves.
