# Explain SLA AI agent

This agent explains Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) details to the user based on the provided task number. It retrieves the matching SLA using timer configurations, along with SLA breakdown details, task SLA information, and an SLA timeline summary.

## Workflow

1.  Retrieve the SLA task record.
2.  Display a numbered list of questions the user can ask.
3.  Use the appropriate tools to retrieve the exact answer and communicate them to the user.
4.  Ask the user if they have other questions.
5.  Repeat until the user requests to end the conversation.
