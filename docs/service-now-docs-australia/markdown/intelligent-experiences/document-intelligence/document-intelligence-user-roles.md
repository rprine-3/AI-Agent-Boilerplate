# Document Intelligence roles

Document Intelligence is installed with these roles.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Document Intelligence is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the Deprecation Process article \[[KB0867184](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184)\] in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Instead, you can extract information from documents using the Now Assist in Document Intelligence application. For more information, see [Now Assist in Document Intelligence \(Legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/docintel-nowassist-landing.md).
