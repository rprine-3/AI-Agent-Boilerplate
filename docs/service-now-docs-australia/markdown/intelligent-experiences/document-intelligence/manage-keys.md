# Create a field for data extraction

Set up fields as part of your use case. Document Intelligence uses fields to identify and extract data from documents. Fields can be grouped to help DocIntel extract data from documents with tables, check box lists, and other logical groupings of fields.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Document Intelligence is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the Deprecation Process article \[[KB0867184](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184)\] in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Instead, you can extract information from documents using the Now Assist in Document Intelligence application. For more information, see [Now Assist in Document Intelligence \(Legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/docintel-nowassist-landing.md).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_docintel.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Document Intelligence** &gt; **Document Data Extraction Administration** &gt; **Use Cases**.

2.  Select a use case in the list.

3.  Go to the **Fields** tab and select **Define your fields**.

    If you have already defined one or more fields and you want to add another field, select **New field**.

4.  Select the type of data that you want to extract from the document.

    You can choose one of the following types of data to extract:

    -   **Single field**

        Single fields are used to extract a single piece of information in the document. For example, a document number or a customer name.

    -   **Check box list**

        Check box lists are used to extract a check box or a group of check boxes. Each check box can be checked or cleared.

    -   **Table**

        Tables are used to extract lists or tables of information. A table can have multiple columns. The number of list items or table rows doesn’t have to be known in advance.

    -   **Single field group**

        Single field groups are used to extract values that are grouped in the document. For example, a location with an address, city, and country. Only one item can be extracted for a single field group, as opposed to the multiple rows extracted for a table.

    A form displays based on the data type you selected.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    The type of form depends on the type of field that you selected in the previous step.

    -   [Single field form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/single-field-form.md)
    -   [Single field group form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/single-field-group-form.md)
    -   [Check box list form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/check-box-list-form.md)
    -   [Table form fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/table-form.md)
6.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The system added the new fields to the Fields list associated with the use case.
