# Complete a document task

After the document task processing is finished, complete the task by providing input or review to train the AI.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Document Intelligence is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the Deprecation Process article \[[KB0867184](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184)\] in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Instead, you can extract information from documents using the Now Assist in Document Intelligence application. For more information, see [Now Assist in Document Intelligence \(Legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/docintel-nowassist-landing.md).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_docintel.extraction\_agent

## Procedure

1.  Do one of the following:

    -   To complete a document task for document data extraction, navigate to **All** &gt; **Document Intelligence** &gt; **Document Data Extraction** &gt; **Document Tasks**.
    -   To complete a document task for document classification, navigate to **All** &gt; **Document Intelligence** &gt; **Document Classification** &gt; **Document Tasks**.
2.  Review the document task list and ensure that the document task's Is Processed field is set to true.

    If the status appears as Setup, go to the document task record and select **Process Task**.
