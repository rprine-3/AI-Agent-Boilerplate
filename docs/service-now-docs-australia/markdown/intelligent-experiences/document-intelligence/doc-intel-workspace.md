# Extract fields using the Document Intelligence workspace

Use the Document Intelligence workspace for field extraction, searching for recommendations, flagging fields, and identifying missing fields to complete document tasks.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Document Intelligence is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the Deprecation Process article \[[KB0867184](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184)\] in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Instead, you can extract information from documents using the Now Assist in Document Intelligence application. For more information, see [Now Assist in Document Intelligence \(Legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/docintel-nowassist-landing.md).

## Overview of the Document Intelligence workspace

The Document Intelligence \(DocIntel\) workspace provides document management features that enable you to quickly review and process text extraction.

With the Document Intelligence workspace, you can:

-   Efficiently review the AI's recommendations, and confirm your document's extracted text.
-   Flag fields, identify missing fields, and review pending fields.

To get started with the Document Intelligence workspace:

-   [Create a document task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/upload-documents-for-extraction.md) for a document data extraction use case, upload a document, and process the task.
-   After DocIntel has processed the task, you can begin using the workspace. See [Complete a document task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/extract-data-from-documents.md).

## Layout of the Document Intelligence workspace

The following illustration shows the Document Intelligence workspace for a document task. The workspace includes the following areas:

-   1 - Thumbnail panel

## Extract single fields

Extract text and number fields from your document in the document fields panel.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_docintel.extraction\_agent

### About this task

Use the following steps to extract single fields from a document.

If the fields are already auto-filled with values, you can review them to ensure they are correct or adjust the fields as needed.

**Tip:** You can also use the draw tool to easily extract fields directly on the document image. For more information, see [Extract fields using the draw tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/use-draw-mode-to-extract-fields.md).

### Procedure

1.  In the document fields panel, expand **Fields**.

2.  Select a field.

3.  Begin typing in the field and select a recommendation from the drop-down list.

    The recommendation with the highest [confidence score](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/document-intelligence/docintel-confidence-scores.md) displays at the top of the list.

    **Tip:** As you move through the recommendations in the drop-down list, they’re highlighted in the document to help you select the correct option.

4.  If needed, filter or flag the recommendations

    -   To filter the list to show only a recommendation that matches exactly what you type, select the exact match mode icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-docintel-exact-match-mode.png"\] Alt text: Exact match mode icon.\) in the field.
    -   To flag the field for later attention, select **Flag for follow-up** in the field options menu \(\[Omitted image "icon-docintel-field-options-menu.png"\] Alt text: Field options menu icon\).
    -   If you can’t find an appropriate match in the document, select **Missing in the document** in the field options menu.To undo, select the **Edit** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-docintel-edit.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon.\) in the field.
    The field will be marked as complete when you move to the next field.

5.  If needed, confirm or correct any field value conversions.

    Some field types convert the extracted value into a standard format. See [Data normalization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/data-normalization.md).

    When the extracted value is ambiguous in a document, DocIntel interprets it as defined in the field configuration. A note prompts you to confirm or edit the converted value.

    \[Omitted image "docintel-normalization-example.png"\] Alt text: Data extraction field and its converted value field

    -   Select **Confirm** in the converted value field to confirm that the converted value is accurate.
    -   Select **Edit**, enter the updated value, and select **Save** to correct the conversion.

## Extract check box fields
