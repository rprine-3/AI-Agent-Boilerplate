# Document Intelligence monitoring dashboard

Monitor the overall performance of Document Intelligence over time in the Document Intelligence monitoring dashboard.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Document Intelligence is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the Deprecation Process article \[[KB0867184](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184)\] in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Instead, you can extract information from documents using the Now Assist in Document Intelligence application. For more information, see [Now Assist in Document Intelligence \(Legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/docintel-nowassist-landing.md).

## Overview of the Document Intelligence monitoring dashboard

The Document Intelligence monitoring dashboard provides a high-level overview of your Document Intelligence usage and value.

\[Omitted image "docintel-monitoring-page.png"\] Alt text: Document Intelligence monitoring dashboard showing metrics on DocIntel activity.

The data visualizations show document extraction activity in your instance. For example:

-   Active use cases
-   Active document tasks
-   Processed pages
-   Processed document tasks
-   Accuracy of the DocIntel recommendations

This dashboard provides useful answers to the following questions:

-   How many documents are processed using DocIntel?
-   How much of the document extraction is automated?
-   How has DocIntel accuracy progressed over time?
