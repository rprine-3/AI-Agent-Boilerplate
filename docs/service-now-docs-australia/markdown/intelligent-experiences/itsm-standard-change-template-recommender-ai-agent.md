# Standard change template recommender AI agent

This AI agent helps users create and submit change requests. Invoke it whenever the user asks to log, create, submit, initiate, or help with a change record of any type \(standard, routine, scheduled, maintenance, infrastructure, software, database, security, or any changes specific to IT service management\).

## Workflow

The agent guides users through the process of selecting a change type and providing appropriate options based on their selection. It retrieves historical template data, suggests templates, and generates links for creating changes.

1.  Ask the user what kind of change they want to make: Standard, Normal, or Emergency.
2.  For Normal or Emergency changes, generate the change link.
3.  For a Standard change, ask the user to choose a template, then generate the change link.
