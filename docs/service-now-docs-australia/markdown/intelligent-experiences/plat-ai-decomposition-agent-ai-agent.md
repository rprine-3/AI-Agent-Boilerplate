# Decomposition AI agent

This AI agent takes resolution steps as input, and then analyzes and breaks down each resolution step into a clear, structured set of smaller, actionable substeps. It then creates records based on user preference. This enables precise execution, improves task clarity, and supports automation and auditability of resolution workflows.

## Workflow

The agent retrieve table configuration, decompose the resolution plan into actionable substeps, create the records and to save the summary in the parent record. It takes resolution steps as input. It does not generate resolution steps on its own.

1.  Retrieve the table action policy XML that defines which tables can be acted on autonomously and which require supervision.
2.  Retrieve resolution steps from memory.
3.  Decompose the steps.
4.  Group actionable steps into autonomous and supervised categories. Proceed automatically with autonomous steps. For supervised steps, wait for user input before executing.
5.  Finalize the execution set.
6.  Create the record.
7.  Save activity notes.

Allow third party to access this AI agent

</td><td>

When enabled, third-party AI agents can use this agent. This value is off \(false\) by default. This setting is defined in the AI Agent configs \[sn\_aia\_agent\_config\] table on the External discoverable field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow AI specialists to access this AI agent

</td><td>

When enabled, AI specialists can use this agent. This value is off \(false\) by default. When set to true, more configuration options for tools become available so that an AI specialist can map inputs and response templates to tool outputs. This setting is defined in the AI Agent configs \[sn\_aia\_agent\_config\] table on the Specialist enabled field.

Manage long-term memory

</td><td>

When enabled, all previous user interactions are used as context for the LLM. This value is off \(false\) by default. This setting is defined by the **sn\_aia.ltm.enable\_long\_term\_memory** system property.
