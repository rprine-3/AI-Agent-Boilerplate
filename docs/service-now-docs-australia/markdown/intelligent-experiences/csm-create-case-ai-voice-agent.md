# Create case AI voice agent

This voice agent enables users to log cases using voice input. It guides the user through a structured conversation to capture and validate all mandatory case details, creates the case record, and provides confirmation upon successful submission.

## Workflow

The agent helps users log a case from a phone call.

1.  Start the conversation politely.
2.  Collect the issue details.
3.  Validate mandatory information.
4.  Generate a short description.
5.  Confirm and enrich the details.
6.  Create the case record.
7.  Confirm case creation.
8.  Link the case number and interaction record from the customer's current phone call.
