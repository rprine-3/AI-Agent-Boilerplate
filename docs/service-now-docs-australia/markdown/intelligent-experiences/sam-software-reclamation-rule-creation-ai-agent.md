# Software reclamation rule creation AI agent

This Software Asset Management agent analyzes software utilization and spend, then creates a reclamation rule based on user-approved criteria.

## Workflow

1.  Identify the target product. If a Product ID is provided, use it directly. Otherwise, present available products for the user to select.
2.  Fetch reclamation rule suggestions for the product. If a rule already exists, show the user a link to it and end.
3.  Analyze utilization and spend data, then present the analysis alongside a draft reclamation rule for user review.
4.  Collect feedback. The user can approve the draft, request changes \(including reclamation type, thresholds, and other rule details\), or cancel. Iterate until approved or cancelled.
5.  Create the reclamation rule using the approved details.
6.  If other existing reclamation rules lack a VIP exclusion condition, offer to update them. Only update if the user approves.
7.  If software usage data collection is not set up, notify the user with a documentation link.
