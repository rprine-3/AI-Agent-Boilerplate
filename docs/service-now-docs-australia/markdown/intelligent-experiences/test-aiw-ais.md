    Once a record is chosen, you can select the open link button to open the record in a new browser tab to check the details.

    **Note:** Choose records that you can safely make changes to. The work is actually being done on the record during the preview.

5.  Select **Run** to begin the preview.

    The test begins on the record. You can watch what fields it updates and any comments or work notes it generates.

    When the test is complete, you can review all the changes made.
