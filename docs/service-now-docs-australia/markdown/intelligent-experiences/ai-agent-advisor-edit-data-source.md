# Edit an analysis data source

Edit a scheduled analysis of your instance records.

## Before you begin

You must have access to an ACL-protected table to configure the analysis for it.

For AI Agent Advisor to run a successful analysis, the data source must contain a minimum of 500 records.

Role required: sn\_na\_center.nac\_admin

## About this task

Follow these steps to change the configuration of the data source, filters, schedule, and cost profile that AI Agent Advisor uses to identify the automation opportunities.

You can only edit an active analysis data source. To edit a deactivated analysis data source, you must first reactivate it. For more information, see [Activate a deactivated analysis data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-agent-advisor-activate-data-source.md).
