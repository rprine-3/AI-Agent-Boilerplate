# Duplicate an NLU model

Duplicate an existing Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) model to create a new one. Duplicating a model copies the settings and contents of the original model, including its default test set.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
-   Identify an existing NLU model to copy from. The source model should have the language and purpose you want for the new model. If a suitable model does not exist, create and train one.
-   Role required: nlu\_admin or admin.

## About this task

In this example procedure, you've already created a model that's titled NLU for Access Requests. You want to customize it for another department. You duplicate the model to create a new, separate model. To customize the new model, you then add content related to the other department.

## Procedure

1.  Set your scope to the scope of the model you want to create.

    After creation, these model settings cannot be changed: language, purpose, scope.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **NLU Workbench** &gt; **Models**.

3.  On the far right column of the model list, select the **More options** menu for the model you want to duplicate.

    \[Omitted image "clone-nlu-modelT1.png"\] Alt text: More options menu with Duplicate this model selected.

4.  Select **Duplicate this model**.

5.  In the **Duplicate this Model** window, enter a name and description for the new model.

    \[Omitted image "clone-nlu-modelT2.png"\] Alt text: Duplicate this Model window.

    In this example scenario, you enter `NLU for Access Requests Copy1` for the description.

6.  Click **Duplicate**.

    The system duplicates the model. The **Model details** page loads for your new model.


## What to do next

You can customize the new model by adding new content to it. Train, test, and publish the new model. For more information, see [Build and train your model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/nlu-service/managing-model-content.md).
