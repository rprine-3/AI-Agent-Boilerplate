NLU Workbench com.snc.nlu\_studio

</td><td>

Enables the creation of Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) models. These models can understand the intent \(action\) and entities \(details about the action\) for a given user utterance. Any ServiceNow application can invoke an NLU model.Requires the NLU Workbench - Core plugin and the NLU Common Model plugin.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Predictive Intelligence com.glide.platform\_ml

</td><td>

Enables the NLU Service APIs used for model creation and inference. Enables the creation of machine learning solutions that are trained on data in your instance. Provides frameworks for classification, similarity, and clustering. A trained solution can be invoked by any application by using a prediction API.

</td></tr><tr><td>

NLU Common Modelcom.glide.nlu.model

</td><td>

Packages all language NLU common models. Also includes commonly used pattern entities that can be imported and used in any NLU model in the NLU Workbench. Commonly used patterns like email, phone, and ServiceNow specific pattern entities such as INT, RITM are made available. Requires the NLU Workbench - Core plugin.

</table>## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the following plugins using the filter criteria and search bar: NLU Workbench - Core \(com.glide.nlu\), NLU Workbench \(com.snc.nlu\_studio\), Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\), and NLU Common Model \(com.glide.nlu.model\).

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed.
