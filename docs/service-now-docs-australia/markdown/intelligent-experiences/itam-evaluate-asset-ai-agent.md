# Evaluate asset AI agent

This AI agent assists users in troubleshooting asset-related issues by using the Web Search tool, guiding them to select an appropriate resolution, and automatically completing the troubleshooting task upon confirmation.

## Workflow

The agent helps users troubleshoot asset-related issues.

1.  Perform a web search and create a step by step hardware evaluation plan from the official &lt;asset\_manufacturer&gt; website for &lt;asset\_model&gt;. Provide warranty consideration guidelines and void-prevention measures for different inspection scenarios. Give detailed steps for each issue.
2.  Refine and format search results.
3.  Display numbered troubleshooting steps to the user, one at a time.
4.  If the user indicates that the problem is solved, end the workflow.
5.  If the user indicates that the problem is not solved, go to the next troubleshooting step.
6.  When all steps are exhausted, end the workflow.
