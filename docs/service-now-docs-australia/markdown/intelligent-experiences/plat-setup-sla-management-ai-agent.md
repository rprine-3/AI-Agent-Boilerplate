# SLA management AI Agent

This ServiceNow Otto for Setup agent enables administrators to create and edit SLA definitions through a conversational interface. The agent guides you through SLA configuration, including setting target type \(Resolution/Response\), duration, table, schedule, start/pause/stop conditions, and flow associations.

## Workflow

1.  Determine whether the admin wants to create an SLA or edit an existing one \(asking if unclear\).
2.  Collect the target type \(Resolution/Response\), applicable table, classification \(priority, type, model, or service\), duration, and name, using existing SLAs and smart defaults to recommend values where possible.
3.  Confirm which schedule applies and associate a notification/escalation flow.
4.  Recommend and confirm start, pause, and stop conditions based on the SLA type.
5.  Present a full summary of the configured SLA and get admin confirmation.
6.  Save the SLA definition, handling any duplicate-configuration conflicts along the way.
7.  Display a confirmation summarizing what was created or changed.
