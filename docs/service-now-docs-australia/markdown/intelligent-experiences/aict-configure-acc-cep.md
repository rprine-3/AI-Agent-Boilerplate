# Add an Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) connection

Block and unblock AI usage on managed devices by configuring Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) as a control enforcement point.

## Before you begin

Confirm the following:

-   The Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) agent is deployed to the devices you want covered. For details, see [Agent Client Collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/acc-landing-page.md).
-   Devices with the deployed ACC agent can connect to your ServiceNow instance through a MID server or a proxy.
-   If ACC is already installed and in use, confirm agents are reporting data on the **ACC Agent health dashboard**.
