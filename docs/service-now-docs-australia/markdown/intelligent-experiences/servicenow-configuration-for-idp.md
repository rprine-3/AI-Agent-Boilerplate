# ServiceNow\(Glide\) configuration for IDP

This process involves setting up the necessary tables and mappings within your ServiceNow instance. This includes configuring ServiceNow, creating the MCP server, and connecting the MCP client.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Important:** The minimum version required is Australia patch 3 or Zurich patch 10. Microsoft Entra is supported in Australia patch 4 or Zurich patch 11 onwards.

## Procedure

1.  Configure the OIDC provider

    **Note:** Okta is used as the use case to guide you through the steps.

    \[Omitted image "mcp-configure-oidc.png"\] Alt text: Configure OIDC provider

2.  Navigate to the **oidc\_provider\_configuration** table and select **New**.

3.  Enter a **Name** for the OIDC provider.

    For example, `Okta MCP Third Party`.

4.  Set the **Cache Configuration Lifespan**.

    The maximum value is 720 hours.

5.  Enter the IDP metadata URL into the **Metadata URL** field.

6.  In the **User Field**, select **email**.

    This maps the user claim from the IDP token to the `email` field in the `sys_user` table.

7.  Let **Enable JT1 claim verification** option remain unchecked.

    Enabling the JSON Web Token Identifier \(JTI\) would require the MCP client to reauthenticate with every request. Therefore, disabling the JTI check in the OIDC provider configuration is recommended for MCP third-party integrations. This is because the client reuses the same token for tool calls until it expires.

8.  Select **Submit**.

9.  Create the MCP server
10. Navigate to the MCP server console and select **Create Server**.

11. Enter a name for the server and add the required tools.

    For example, `MCP with Third Party IDP`.

    After you create the server, automatically generates an entry in the **oauth\_protected\_resource** table and populates it with the list of APIs allowed for that server.

12. Map the protected resource to the IDP:

    \[Omitted image "mcp-oath-idp-mapping.png"\] Alt text: Map protected resource to the IDP

13. Navigate to the **oauth\_protected\_resource\_idp\_mapping** table and select **New**.

14. In the **Protected Resource** field, select the resource that was created for your MCP server.

    If your MCP server name is `sn_mcp_server_default`, the protected resource path is `/sncapps/mcp-server/mcp/sn_mcp_server_default`.

15. In the **OIDC Provider** field, select the OIDC provider configuration you created earlier.

    1.  For Microsoft Entra integrations only, configure the **Accepted Audiences** field in the `oauth_protected_resource_idp_mapping` table with the Entra Application ID URI \(for example, api://&lt;Application-ID&gt;.

        This allows ServiceNow to accept Entra-issued access tokens whose audience claim matches the configured Application ID URI.

16. Select **Submit**.


## Result

Your MCP server is now configured to authenticate users through the third-party IDP. Users who connect an MCP client to this server are redirected to the related IDP to authenticate.

## What to do next

1.  Configure and set up the third-party IDP. This process involves setting up the application and authorization server within the third-party IDP setup. This document uses Okta as the use case, however, Microsoft Entra is also recommended.
2.  Integrate and test from your MCP Client.
