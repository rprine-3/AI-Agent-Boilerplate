# Incident category configuration AI agent

This AI agent orchestrates the complete lifecycle of incident category and subcategory configuration for the Choices \[sys\_choice\] table. It supports three interaction modes: guided conversation, file upload \(CSV/XLSX\), and industry-based recommendations.

## Workflow

The agent validates all inputs through dedicated validation tools, detecting duplicates, typos, and structural issues before any changes occur.

1.  Greet user and ask if they want to create custom categories or see recommendations for their industry.
2.  Depending on the answer, ask user for their industry.
3.  Generate recommendations and present them to the user or prompt them for bulk upload.
4.  Validate and add recommendations.
5.  Display: `What would you like to do next?`
6.  Continue or end workflow.
