# Create dataset assets

Create AI assets to track and manage the life cycles of your datasets.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward or sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner

**Note:** Users with the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role can only create AI assets and submit them for life-cycle review. They can't start or complete any life-cycle reviews.

## About this task

A dataset is a collection of data used for training, fine-tuning, or evaluating an AI model.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Al Control Tower** &gt; **Home** &gt; **Inventory****Assets**.

2.  On the Inventory page, select **Add AI asset**.

    The Add AI asset dialog box opens.

3.  In the dialog box, select **Enter asset details**.

4.  From the list of available asset types, select **Dataset**.

    The dialog box closes and you're automatically redirected to the Add dataset asset form.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>6.  Select **Save draft** to save the details in the form or select **Cancel** that provides you with the following options:

    -   **Keep editing**: to continue editing the form.
    -   **Save draft and exit**: saves the form and you exit the form.
    -   **Discard and exit**: your unsaved changes are discarded and you exit the form.
7.  Select **Submit for review**.

    The Asset record page opens and your asset is in an unmanaged state. You can edit details related to your asset on the **Details** tab by using the pencil icon in the sections titled **About this asset** and **Use and purpose**.

8.  If you have the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role, select the **Actions** menu and then select **Start lifecycle review**.

    **Important:** Only users with the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role can start the life-cycle review.

    The Start AI steward review dialog box opens.

9.  In the **Managed by** field of the dialog box, search for and select the user that you want to assign the life-cycle review to.

    **Important:** You must select a user with the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role.

10. Select **Start review**.

    The asset automatically changes from an unmanaged asset to a managed asset and starts the onboarding workflow. The Lifecycle tab now contains three sub tabs: **Onboard**, **Maintain**, and **Retire**. The **Maintain**, and **Retire** are disabled and are enabled once onboarding is complete.

    The **Onboard** sub tab contains the Onboarding playbook with tasks displayed. If tasks are not already present in the Onboarding playbook, users with the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role can create tasks by selecting **New** and assign them to other AI stewards.

11. If you're assigned to the life-cycle review, select **Mark complete** to complete each activity in the onboarding playbook.

    If your tasks are open and you select **Mark complete**, those tasks automatically get closed with the **Closed skipped** state and you move to the next stage of onboarding. Once you move forward, you can no longer create tasks in the previous stage.

    You can select the **Actions** menu and **Reject request** to cancel the onboarding playbook and mark this asset as unmanaged.

    When all stages in the onboarding playbook are marked as complete, the playbook status updates to **Completed**. The **Maintain** and **Retire** tabs show a status of **Not Started**.

    **Note:** The end-to-end onboarding process from start to finish may take a few days.
