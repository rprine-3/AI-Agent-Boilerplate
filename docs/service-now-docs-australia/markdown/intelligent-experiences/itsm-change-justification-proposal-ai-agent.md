# Change justification proposal AI agent

This AI agent identifies the justification for a provided change request.

## Workflow

The agent collaborates with the user to suggest justification, revising it based on feedback.

1.  Fetch the current change request details.
2.  Search for similar past change requests.
3.  If no similar past change data is available, ask the user: `No similar past change requests were found. Would you like to proceed with generating a justification based on best practices?`
4.  If the user agrees to proceed, continue to the next step; otherwise, stop execution.
5.  Generate a draft justification based on either the retrieved similar change requests or best practices.
6.  Present the justification to the user and ask for their feedback.
7.  Revise the justification based on the user’s feedback.
