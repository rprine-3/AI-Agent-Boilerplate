Role required: sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward

## Procedure

2.  On the **Established** sub-tab, select the connection you want to deactivate.

3.  Deactivate the connection using one of the following methods.

## Result

The connection remains on the **Established** sub-tab with a **State** of **Inactive**. Trace collection stops and no further observability metrics are generated from this connection until it is reactivated.

## What to do next

Reactivate the connection by editing the connection and select the **Active** option.
