# Spend categorization AI agent

This Sourcing and Procurement Operations agent predicts and populates product and spend categories in purchase requisition lines, reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy.

## Workflow

1.  Run category prediction and document extraction based on user provided ID
2.  Identify whether the user wants to update product categories or spend categories.
3.  Extract purchase header record numbers from the user's request, and optionally collect a reason for the update and a suggested category.
4.  Run the validation tool to generate AI-suggested categories and present both AI and user suggestions as selectable options.
5.  Let the user choose a category for each line item or skip individual lines.
6.  Submit the selected categories to update the records.
