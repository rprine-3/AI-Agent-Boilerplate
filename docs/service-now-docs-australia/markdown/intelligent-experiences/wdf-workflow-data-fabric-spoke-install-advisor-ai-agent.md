# Workflow data fabric spoke install advisor AI Agent

This Workflow Data Fabric agent helps you search for available IntegrationHub spokes that aren't installed on the instance. This agent takes the your search query, retrieves matching non-installed spokes from the instance catalog, and returns a prioritized list of candidates with installation links.

## Workflow

1.  Identify a specific spoke or system name from the user's request \(for example, Jira or Salesforce\).
2.  If the request is too vague, ask questions to narrow it down. If still unclear, direct them to their ServiceNow admin or the ServiceNow® Store.
3.  Search for non-installed spokes matching the identified term, running the search exactly once.
