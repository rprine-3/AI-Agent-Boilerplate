# Data Discovery util AI agent

This ServiceNow Vault agent assists data stewards in scheduling and managing data discovery jobs by verifying required roles, entitlements, and subscriptions. The agent categorizes discovered data patterns into compliance groups to support regulatory and security requirements. It also help user to add tags to data patterns on demand.

## Workflow

1.  Check the user's permissions. Stop if role or entitlement is missing, and note the subscription status either way.
2.  Verify no active discovery job conflicts with the requested one. Stop if conflicts exist.
3.  Fetch all available data patterns and check which ones already have tags assigned, displaying them grouped by tag.
4.  For patterns without tags, use the discovery grouping skill to recommend classifications across sensitive data categories.
5.  Show tagged patterns first, then untagged patterns with their recommended categories.
6.  Prompt the user to add patterns to existing categories, create custom categories, and assign patterns across multiple categories.
7.  Offer to tag patterns so they're easier to find and assign in future discovery policies. Create tags as needed and associate patterns to them one by one.

Manage long-term memory

</td><td>

When enabled, all previous user interactions are used as context for the LLM. This value is off \(false\) by default.
