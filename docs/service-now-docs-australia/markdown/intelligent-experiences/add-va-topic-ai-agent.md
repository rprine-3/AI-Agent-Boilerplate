# Add a conversational topic to an AI agent

2.  Open the AI agent that you want to add a conversational topic to and navigate to the Add tools and information section.

3.  In the Add tool drop-down list, select **Conversational topic**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

The Virtual Agent topic that you want to add. After it’s selected, the description of the topic displays underneath the drop-down list.If there is a tool used by an AI agent for the same conversational topic, the rest of the form will populate the fields based on the other tool.

If you want the AI agent to work in Off Glide architecture with Premium Chat experience, you must turn-on the **Display output** toggle. When the toggle is turned-on, you can add widgets that can be used in assistants built with Premium Chat experiences. The widget configuration includes:

-   **Widget**: Defines the display output to render the content in a better user experience. You can select the widget from the drop-down.
-   **Require widget transformation**: An additional LLM call is required to transform the raw tool. If you choose to skip this transformation step, the tool output will be directly mapped to the widget.

-   **Display refined widget message**: Refines the widget message when configured.
