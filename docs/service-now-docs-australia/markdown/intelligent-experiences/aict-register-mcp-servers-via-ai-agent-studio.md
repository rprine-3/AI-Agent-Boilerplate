Registering MCP servers via AI Agent Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_aia.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace** &gt; **AI Agent Studio**.

2.  Open the agent that uses the MCP server.

3.  Select **Edit**.

4.  Select **Tools**.

5.  Select the MCP server tool you want to update.

6.  Update the connection configuration:

    1.  Enter the Server URL.

    2.  Enter the Client ID.

    3.  Enter the Client secret.

    4.  Enter the Authentication endpoint URL

    5.  Enter the Token endpoint URL.
