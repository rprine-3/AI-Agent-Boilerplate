# Use AI Guardian features in AI Admin Center

Use AI Guardian features in the AI Admin Center workspace to detect offensive content, prompt injection attacks, and sensitive topics in generative AI interactions.

## Before you begin

The following applications must be installed before performing this task:

-   AI Admin Center

    For more information, see [Confirm installation of AI Admin Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-center-install.md).

-   AI Admin Hub

## About this task

Follow these steps to use AI Guardian capabilities from AI Admin Center.

AI Guardian provides safety and governance controls for AI-generated content. It monitors AI interactions for potentially harmful, offensive, or policy-violating content.

In AI Admin Center, the integration of AI Guardian includes multi-tabbing support for working with safety and governance controls without leaving the application context.

For more information on AI Guardian, see [AI Guardian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/now-assist-guardian.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Center** or **Workspaces** &gt; **AI Admin Center**.

2.  Select **Admin** \(\[Omitted image "icon-now-assist-center-nav-admin.png"\] Alt text: Admin icon. \) in the side navigation bar.

    The Admin tab opens showing AI Admin Hub options.

3.  Select one of the options under **AI Guardian** to configure.

    AI Guardian provides three guardrails. Each guardrail has a different scope.

**Offensiveness detection**

</td><td>

This guardrail detects offensive or harmful content in AI inputs and outputs. It applies to specific generative AI skills and workflows.

 Select **Offensiveness** to open the Offensiveness tab.

 For more information on how to configure this guardrail, see [Activate offensiveness protection for generative AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/activate-offensiveness-protection-for-generative-ai.md).
