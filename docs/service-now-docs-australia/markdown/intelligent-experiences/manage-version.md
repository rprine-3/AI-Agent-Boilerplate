# Manage version

Manage the version of the model providers across skills and instance levels. You can change and update versions for the out-of-box and custom skills.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

See [Default and target model version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/default-and-target-model-model-version.md) to know more about default and target model versions.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub**.

2.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Manage AI models**.

3.  Select **Manage model version**.

4.  View the summary of the active, deprecated, retiring model versions, and recommended actions, providing effective version management system to the admins.

    **Note:** A model version will not be available for selection as target model version, if it is in deprecated, retired, in review or rejected state.

5.  Identify your use case and key factors to choose the model that best fits your needs.

6.  View or update the model version instantly under the **Overview** tab.

7.  Edit the model provider version for out-of-box or custom skills for the instance.

    Customize it to update it at the skill or skill group level, under the respective tabs. Customizing the model version for skills replaces the instance-level model version currently assigned to each provider. This action is typically reserved for specific situations.

8.  Select **Instance level configuration** to manage the model provider version for the skill across the instance.

    1.  Select **Out-of-box skills** to set the target model version against the current version of the applicable model providers, for the default skills.

    2.  Select **Custom skills** to set the target model version against the current version of the applicable model providers, for the custom skills.

        **Model preview program**

        To reduce the wait time around enabling new models on the platform, the model onboarding is process and life cycle is accelerated with the model preview program. Models that are enabled with the model preview program feature are highlighted with the badge 'Preview'.

        This program aims to provide an opportunity for the user to explore and experiment with the new models even before they are generally available.

        -   The preview models are enabled to provide early access to custom skill users as soon as the new models are available.
        -   The admin can choose to opt-in or out of the program. A toggle is presented in AI control tower allowing the user to opt in to the preview program. The toggle defaults to off.
    3.  Select **Save and activate** to update your changes.

    4.  Select **Update model version** to override ServiceNow shipped mappings or create a default and target model versions mapping.
