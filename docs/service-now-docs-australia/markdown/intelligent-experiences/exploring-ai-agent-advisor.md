# Exploring AI Agent Advisor

AI Agent Advisor automatically discovers automation opportunities in your instance and helps you to deploy AI agents to implement them.

## AI Agent Advisor overview

AI Agent Advisor analyzes your instance data to identify the most frequent and impactful opportunities for efficiency gains in your workflows. For each identified opportunity, it proposes AI agents that can automate the solution, and generates new agents when no existing match is available.

This gives the AI administrator a data-driven starting point for AI adoption, eliminating the guesswork of deciding where to apply automation.

AI Agent Advisor operates through three sequential phases:

-   **Mine**

    The system analyzes the records in your instance \(for example, incident and case records\) on a scheduled basis to identify recurring problems that are candidates for automation.

    You can configure the data sources, filters, and schedule to target the most relevant records for your organization.

-   **Match**

    For each identified opportunity, the system maps the resolution steps to existing AI agents, tools, and agentic workflows already available on your platform.

-   **Make**

    When no existing agent is a strong match for a resolution step, the system generates a new AI agent tailored to that specific problem.


The result is a prioritized list of automation opportunities. Each opportunity displays the estimated time and cost savings, number of records analyzed, and available AI assets. AI Agent Advisor generates the resolution steps using the data from existing records on your instance. You can use this list to decide which opportunities to act on first.
