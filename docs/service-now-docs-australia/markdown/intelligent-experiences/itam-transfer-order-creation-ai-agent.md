# Transfer order creation AI agent

This AI agent is used for creating a transfer order to source a requested item.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to transfer order creation.

1.  Use the Get Destination Stockrooms for requested item tool to retrieve a list of destination stockrooms.
2.  Ask the user to select a stockroom if multiple choices are available. If none are available, end the workflow.
3.  Use the Get Source Stockrooms tool to retrieve a list of source stockrooms.
4.  Ask the user to select a source stockroom if multiple choices are available. If none are available, end the workflow.
5.  Use the Create transfer order using input source plan tool to create the Transfer Order Line with the user's selected source and destination stockroom details.
6.  Create the transfer order using the Create transfer order with guided source plan tool.
7.  Display results to the user.
