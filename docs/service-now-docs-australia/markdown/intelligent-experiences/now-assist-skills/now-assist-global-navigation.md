# Navigation

Use the navigation skill in to take you where you want to go on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Overview of navigation

Navigation is a skill in the ServiceNow Otto panel that handles record search requests during a chat. When you ask for records or tables in plain language ServiceNow Otto shows you links in the chat to take you to the best match to your request. For example, you could enter `Show me incident records`.

In the following figure, the user entered `navigate me to incidents` in the ServiceNow Otto panel. ServiceNow Otto responds with a link to the Incidents table.

When you select the link, the list of all records in the Incidents table displays.

## Refining your results

You can refine your results further by using more detailed requests. If you enter `Show me all incident records whose status is Complete`, ServiceNow Otto shows you only the records in the table with a Complete status.

In the following example, the user asks for all P1 incidents that are in the New state.

The number of results is based on how many potential results ServiceNow Otto finds in response to your request. If more than 10 results are generated, the list is paginated. In the following example, there are two possible tables: the Catalog Item table and the Catalog table.

If ServiceNow Otto does not understand your request, you receive an error message asking you to rephrase your request. You can also choose to navigate to a "best guess" based on your previous request.
