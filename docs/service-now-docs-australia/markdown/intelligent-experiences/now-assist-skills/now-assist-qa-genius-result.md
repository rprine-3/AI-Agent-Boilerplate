# Q&amp;A Genius Results

The Q&amp;A Genius Results skill enables users to get answers to their questions from knowledge articles, external sources, and uploaded files directly in the ServiceNow Otto panel.

## Overview of Q&amp;A Genius Results

Q&amp;A Genius Results answers your questions in the ServiceNow Otto panel. It uses content from knowledge base articles, external sources, such as Microsoft SharePoint, Google Drive, and Confluence Cloud, and files you upload. You can also attach images or documents to get answers grounded in that content. Answers are summarized from the most relevant content across one or more sources. So, you get a single, consolidated response instead of a list of articles to read through. Each response shows the source for you to refer back to the original article or document. If the skill can't find a relevant answer, it returns a no-result response instead of a generic reply.

The skill supports multi-turn conversations by retaining your conversation history. The follow-up questions are answered in the context of what you previously asked without re-uploading your file or repeating yourself.

The skill is a part of the Platform workflow and is turned on by default. To turn it off, navigate to **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **AI Skills** &gt; **Platform** and select **Deactivate skill** on the skill card.

## Use cases

Q&amp;A Genius Results is useful in the following use cases:

-   Search across knowledge articles and external sources such as SharePoint or Confluence to get a single consolidated answer.
-   Ask follow-up questions to build on a previous answer within the same session, without repeating context.
-   Upload a screenshot of an error and ask what it means and how to resolve it, without describing the image manually in text.
-   Upload a PDF crash log or SLA document and ask questions about its contents, without reading through the full document.
