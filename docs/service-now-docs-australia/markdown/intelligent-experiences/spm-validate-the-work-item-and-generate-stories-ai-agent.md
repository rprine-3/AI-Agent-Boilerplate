# Validate the work item and generate stories AI agent

This Strategic Portfolio Management agent transforms Enterprise Agile Planning work items \(epics and features\) into a set of well-formed, actionable user stories. It evaluates work items to verify that it contains sufficient information, and guides users through a structured validation process.

## Workflow

1.  Collect the work item number, description, and any additional context as needed \(based on flags from the system\), confirming with the user before saving each piece of information.
2.  Produce user stories based on the validated work item and collected context.
3.  Display the generated stories and offer refinement options: discard stories, combine or split them, adjust personas or metrics, or add new ones.
4.  If the user chooses to refine, apply their changes, re-display the updated stories, and offer the same refine-or-save choice again. This loop continues until the user chooses to save.
5.  Save the finalized stories to the system and give the user a navigation link to view them.
