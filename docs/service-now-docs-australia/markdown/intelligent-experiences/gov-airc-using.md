# Review AI governance posture and compliance status

The Risk &amp; Compliance tab under **Govern** displays regulatory classification, risk posture, and governance readiness for AI assets.

## Overview of Govern

Use the **Govern** tab in AI Control Tower to monitor and understand the governance status of AI assets. Learn how AI systems are classified, what risks they present, what governance work is required, and whether governance information is sufficiently complete to support review and decision-making.

With the **Govern** tab, you can:

-   Review regulatory classification
-   Review AI risk posture
-   Track compliance posture
-   Monitor cases, issues, and governance actions

\[Omitted image "aict-govern-risk-compliance-tab.png"\] Alt text: Govern tab showing compliance posture and risk posture sections with analytics widgets for regulatory classification, compliance scores, and risk metrics.

The page is divided into the following components:

-   Compliance posture — Monitor compliance of implemented controls and regulatory risk across the AI portfolio.
-   Risk posture — Monitor inherent and residual risk across the AI portfolio.

## Compliance posture

The widgets under compliance posture display the top action items to execute and track the risk classification and compliance score of AI systems and controls. Each widget reflects the active filter state. View details for each metric area by selecting the arrow for each metric. Select an individual component on the widget to view underlying assets.
