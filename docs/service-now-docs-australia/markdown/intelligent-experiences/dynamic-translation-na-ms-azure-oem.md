# Microsoft Azure OEM for Dynamic Translation in Now Assist

Support multi-language input in Now Assist applications with the Microsoft Azure OEM translator service included in Generative AI Controller.

## Multi-language support for Now Assist applications

\[Omitted image "dynamic-translation-na-ms-azure-oem-X1.png"\] Alt text: In the Translator Configurations table, the Microsoft Azure OEM record

When dynamic translation in the Generative AI Controller is enabled, your users' input text is handled by Microsoft Azure OEM \(com.snc.microsoft\_oem\_translation\_spoke\) as follows:

1.  The language of the text is detected.
2.  The text is dynamically translated to English, then provided to Now Assist.
3.  Now Assist returns a response in English.
4.  The English response is translated to the user's preferred language and displayed in the UI.

For more information about enabling dynamic translation in this context, see [Configure multilingual service for ServiceNow Otto applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/enable-dynamic-translation-for-now-assist-applications.md) and [Enable Dynamic Translation for capabilities in Generative AI Controller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/generative-ai-controller/enable-dynamic-translation-for-generative-ai-capabilities.md).

From the Zurich release, this spoke has available support for specific regulated markets, subject to conditions. For information see [KB0743854](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0743854) on the Now Support portal.

## Activation

The Microsoft Azure OEM translator service is included with Generative AI Controller. Microsoft Azure OEM requires Dynamic Translation tables, so Generative AI Controller activates Dynamic Translation if it isn't already active.

Microsoft Azure OEM appears as a row in the Translator Configurations \(sn\_dt\_translator\_configuration\) table. This record is not editable. The connection credentials of this translator service are already configured. For more information about this integration, see [https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/gen-ai-now-platform.html](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/gen-ai-now-platform.html).

If you try to update this record in the Translator Configurations table, the following error is displayed: "The Microsoft Azure OEM translator configuration is used in Generative AI flows. It cannot be edited".

With the Xanadu Patch 3 release, the Microsoft Azure OEM translator includes support for [Exclusion Framework in Dynamic Translation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dyn-translation-exclusion-framework.md). Also the API used by flows and subflows is automatically updated to v4.

The application scope for Microsoft Azure OEM is sn\_ms\_oem.

For more information, see [Dynamic Translation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation-overview.md).

## Languages supported

The Microsoft Azure OEM service supports all of the languages available as language packs on the ServiceNow platform, except I18N: Latin American Spanish Translations. Self-localized languages \(languages other than the default language packs\) aren't supported.

For the list of available language packs, see [Activate a language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateALanguage.md).

## Alteration or deactivation

You can use a different machine translation service in Generative AI Controller, rather than the provided Microsoft Azure OEM translator configuration. If you want to switch to a translation service provider of your choice, you can update a system property as follows.

1.  With the admin role, create an account with a third-party machine translation service provider and configure it in your instance. For details see [Integration with other translation services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/integration-with-other-translation-services.md).
2.  Open the record for your translation service provider by navigating to the Translator Configurations \[sn\_dt\_translator\_configuration\] table, then selecting the appropriate row.
3.  Copy the sys id of the record by opening the form context menu \[Omitted image "List\_MenuIcon.png"\] and selecting **Copy sys\_id**.

    \[Omitted image "dynamic-translation-na-ms-azure-oem2.png"\] Alt text: On a translation service provider record in the Translator Configurations table, the form context menu is selected and Copy sys\_id is highlighted.

4.  Navigate to the sys\_properties table and select New to create a system property.
5.  Enter values in the System Property - New record form as follows.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Name|com.snc.gen\_ai.translator\_configuration.sys\_id|
    |Value|Enter the translator configuration sys id that you copied in the previous step.|

6.  Select **Submit**.

Alternatively, you can deactivate Dynamic Translation in this context using another sys property.
