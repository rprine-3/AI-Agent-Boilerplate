# Procurement request tracking AI agent

This Sourcing and Procurement Operations agent provides a summary of a procurement request. It can provide current status and next steps for the request.

## Workflow

1.  Parse the user's message to determine what they're looking for and whether they've provided a specific record number.
2.  If no record number is provided, construct a query based on the user's intent and search for matching records. If nothing is found, rephrase the query and retry once before asking the user for more details.
3.  Present the search results and ask the user to select one.
4.  Run the summary tool against the selected record and the original question, display the result.
