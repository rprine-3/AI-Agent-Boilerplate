# Data Discovery workflow lookup AI agent

This ServiceNow Vault agent receives provide recommendation for different tables associated with workflows, and identifies what kind of sensitive data can present in those tables such as PII,PFI,PCI,PHI,FCI.

## Workflow

1.  Determine whether the user provided specific workflow names, specific table names, or wants to process all workflows.
2.  If workflow names were given, retrieve all active workflows from the instance and confirm the user's entries are valid. Ask one clarification question and values are invalid.
3.  Either fetch tables associated with the validated workflows, or use the directly provided table names, pulling in associated tables as well.
4.  Determine which sensitive data group classifications \(PII, PHI, PFI, PCI, FCI\) apply to each table.
5.  Present the findings in a structured card format showing each table with its sensitive data classifications, grouped by workflow if workflows were the input.
