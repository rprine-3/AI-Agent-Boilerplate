# Enable evaluation for an AI system

Start generating quality and safety scores for one or more AI systems by enabling evaluation from the inventory.

## Before you begin

Before enabling evaluation for an AI system at the asset level, activate evaluation scoring for AI systems.

-   For ServiceNow AI systems, see [Activate evaluation scoring for ServiceNow AI systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/mon-ai-monitor-servicenow-ai-system.md).
-   For external AI systems, see [Activate evaluation scoring for external AI systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/mon-ai-monitor-external-ai-system.md).

Role required: sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner or sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Control Tower** &gt; **Home** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Assets**.

2.  On the Overview tab, enable evaluation for one or more AI systems.

## Result

Evaluation is enabled for each AI system that you selected.

-   New evaluation scores appear on the **Monitor** tab of each asset record within minutes.
-   Historical scores for ServiceNow and external systems are saved.
-   You can turn off evaluation for these assets at any time. See [Disable evaluation for an AI system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/disc-disable-evaluation.md).
