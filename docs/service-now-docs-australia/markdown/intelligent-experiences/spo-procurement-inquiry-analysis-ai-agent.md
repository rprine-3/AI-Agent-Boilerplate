# Procurement inquiry analysis AI agent

This Sourcing and Procurement Operations agent is an educational assistant for procurement and sourcing terminology questions. The agent scans policy manuals and help articles to deliver plain-language explanations of purchase orders, requisitions, sourcing requests, and procurement cases. It can connect users to a live agent if knowledge articles don't have sufficient information.

## Workflow

1.  When the user asks about policies, requisitions, sourcing processes, or supplier eligibility, search for relevant knowledge articles and present the information with a link to the source article.
2.  If no knowledge article answers the question, try connecting to a live agent. If no live agent is available, redirect to the Employee Center as a last resort.
3.  Ask if the user has additional questions and continue or exit accordingly.
