# MID keystore AI agent

This AI agent helps users diagnose and resolve MID Server keystore problems. This AI agent is designed for IT administrators who manage MID Server health.

## Workflow

The agent fetches MID Server and issue details, executes rekey and validation operations, provides step-by-step recovery instructions, and ensures the MID Server returns to a validated state.

1.  Identify the keystore issue from the user prompt or from the issue table.
2.  If the MID Server is up, walk the user through the rekeying process.
3.  If the MID Server is down, walk the user through troubleshooting steps.
4.  Validate the resolution.
5.  If the user verifies that the issue is resolved, end execution. Otherwise, restart the process.
