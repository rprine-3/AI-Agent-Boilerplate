# Post incident review AI agent

This AI agent generates a post-incident review report for the user to review and revise after a major incident report.

## Workflow

A post-incident review \(PIR\) report is a comprehensive document created after a major incident or disruption has been resolved. Its purpose is to analyze what happened, understand the root causes, and assess the impact of the incident, while also providing actionable recommendations for preventing future occurrences. The report should contain 4 sections: Executive Summary section, Customer / Service Impact section, Detailed Technical Summary section, and Action items &amp; Prevention section.

1.  Collect the details about the major incident, including short description, description, assignment group, assigned to, category, subcategory, service, configuration item, resolution notes, business impact, and activities.
2.  Collect child incidents and related records.
3.  Generate a post-incident review report with four sections.
4.  Collect feedback on the report from the user.
5.  Update the incident record.
6.  Acknowledge the result and conclude the conversation.
