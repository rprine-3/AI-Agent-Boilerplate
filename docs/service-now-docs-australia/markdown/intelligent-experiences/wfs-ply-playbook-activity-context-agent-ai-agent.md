# Playbook activity context AI agent

This ServiceNow Otto for Creator agent helps users complete ServiceNow forms by fetching form fields, automatically matching pre-filled field values, and prompting for any missing required information. The agent saves the summary of what it has done.

## Workflow

1.  Pull the form's field definitions \(formFields\), including each field's type, label, constraints, and reference/choice details.
2.  Extract the most relevant available data for each field, matching field type. Leave fields empty when no relevant data exists rather than guessing.
3.  Compress or truncate any value that exceeds its field's character limit before assigning it.
4.  Package all filled fields into the required schema, along with a summary of the activity and separate success/failure variants of that summary.
5.  Execute the slot-filling script with the completed fields and summary.
6.  If the JSON output is malformed \(not if data is simply missing or wrong\), regenerate it one time; otherwise accept the result as final.
