# Tagging in Knowledge Graph Designer

Use Knowledge graph tags to mark the key tables, that are important for answering natural language questions for specific use cases.

Use Knowledge Graph Designer to create and edit tags from the **Enterprise Graph Tags** section.

<table id="table_xct_jg3_4hc"><thead><tr><th>

Name

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Enterprise Graph- regular mode

</td><td>

Provides suggestion to Enterprise Graph on which tables to prioritize when retrieving information, to improve the accuracy of results.Tag up to 30 tables for regular mode as hints to prioritize while searching.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enterprise Graph \(Small\)

</td><td>

Provides a list of tables to run the search operation. Enterprise Graph \(Small\) will only search on the tables provided by tags.

 It is mandatory to add a tag when Enterprise Graph \(Small\) is used with any of the prebuilt integration with AI agent, Virtual Agent or ServiceNow Otto panel.

 You can tag a maximum of 50 tables.

 Note that to enable querying on columns of table which are references to another table, also include referenced table in tags.

</table>## Creating tags

Tags are created by kg\_admins using the Knowledge Graph Tags section. Tags has to be linked to schema when selecting the Enterprise Graph or Enterprise Graph \(Small\).

Link Knowledge Graph schema for your use case in Virtual Agent, ServiceNow Otto panel or AI agent.

Knowledge Graph ships the following prebuilt tags:

1.  Virtual Agent DEFAULT TAG: A prebuilt tag listing common to core, ITSM, and HR tables for integrating Enterprise Graph with the Virtual Agent on the employee portal. Admins can edit this tag to include additional tables relevant for answering Virtual Agent queries.
2.  ServiceNow OttoPANEL DEFAULT TAG: A prebuilt tag listing common to core, ITSM and HR tables which can be leveraged as general tag on ServiceNow Otto panel. Admins can edit this tag to add additional important table for answering questions on ServiceNow Otto panel.

Follow these steps to create or edit tags:

-   Go to the Knowledge Graph Designer to view the existing tags and their associated tables. You can use an existing tag, edit one to fit your needs, or create a new tag for your particular use case.
-   Navigate to the admin center for consuming apps.
    -   For the Virtual Agent or ServiceNow Otto panel, go to your virtual agent’s setup, select Information Sources, and open the Knowledge Graph.
    -   For AI agent, proceed to its setup and open the Knowledge Graph tool for the AI agent.
-   Select Enterprise graph or Enterprise Graph \(Small\) as the Knowledge Graph schema and select the required tag from Tag drop down to link it to graph schema.

**Note:** In this release, the Enterprise Graph option is hidden by default for Virtual Agent and ServiceNow Otto panel, and only Enterprise Graph \(Small\) can be selected as schema option. To use Enterprise Graph, Admins can enable it as a schema option by setting the property `sn_kg.va.enable_global_graph_all_modes` to true. The role required is Admin.

## Recommended tables for different use cases

-   Virtual Agent: For Virtual Agent, include the tables necessary to answer the expected user queries. For example if you want to deploy a new virtual agent on employee center portal, you should add a tag having tables relevant for answering employee questions.
-   ServiceNow Otto panel: ServiceNow Otto panel operates as a unified assistant across multiple workspaces, hence it is essential to tag tables as follows:
    -   An individual tag for each workspace that encompasses key tables relevant to that workspace. This ensures the ServiceNow Otto panel can deliver responses specific to queries related to the workspace tables when accessed within each workspace.
    -   Create a general tag that includes the most important tables required to answer users questions on ServiceNow Otto panel, allowing the panel to provide answers when used outside of any workspace.
    -   For more information on adding workspace tags in ServiceNow Otto panel, see [Add a Knowledge Graph schema to a chat assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/add-kg-schema-assistant.md).
-   AI agent: For an AI agent use case, include key tables relevant to the agent's purpose. For example, for asset manager agents User, Asset, and other crucial tables should be included in the tag.
