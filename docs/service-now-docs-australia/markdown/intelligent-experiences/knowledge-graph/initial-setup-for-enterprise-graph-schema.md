# Enterprise Graph initial setup in production instance

Setup and use Enterprise Graph Schema, a unified Knowledge Graph schema, that captures all the ServiceNow and third-party tables and their connections.

## Before you begin

When you install Enterprise Graph, it automatically begins configuring instance tables. This may take several days and until the setup is complete, the schema won’t respond effectively to queries.

If you have already completed the setup in sub-production instance, you can import the generated descriptions to production instance and fasten the process.

Assuming that you have completed the setup in sub-production instance, do the following to complete the initial setup in production instance:

-   Create an integration user, in the sub-production instance. For more information, see [Create a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateAUser.md)
-   Verify if the descriptions are generated in sub-production instance.
-   Use the following procedure to:
    -   Import the data into production.
    -   Run the associated Transform Maps.
-   Remove tracker records from the production instance.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.
