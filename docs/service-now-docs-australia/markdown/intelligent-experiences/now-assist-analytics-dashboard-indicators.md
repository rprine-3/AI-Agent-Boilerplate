# AI Analytics dashboard indicator details

Indicator details help you understand the data and calculations behind an indicator that is presented in the form of a visualization on the dashboard.

AI Analytics indicators contain the following details: indicator type, data source, calculation, available breakdowns, unit, and so on.

To access these indicators, navigate to **Platform Analytics Administration** &gt; **Indicators**. You must have the Now Assist Analytics Admin \[sn\_na\_analytics\_admin\] role to access the indicators.

These indicators collect data at a daily frequency. Data is only available for dates before the current date. If you want to see results from the current day, you must wait until the next day.

**Note:** The Generative AI Usage Log \[sys\_gen\_ai\_usage\_log\] table is maint-only.
