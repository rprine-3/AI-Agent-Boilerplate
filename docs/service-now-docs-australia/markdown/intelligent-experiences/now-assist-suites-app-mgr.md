# Now Assist suite versions

The Application Manager uses Now Assist suite versions to verify compatibility between multiple generative AI applications in one instance.

## Now Assist Suite overview

Now Assist applications often function interdependently, which can result in runtime errors when one Now Assist application is dependent on a specific version of another one. Now Assist suites help reduce runtime errors by bundling compatible versions of Now Assist applications together. Suite versions are independent from the application versions that they contain.

The Application Manager uses Now Assist suite versions to verify compatibility between every new Now Assist application version you install and all Now Assist application versions already present on your instance. This verification happens when installing new applications for the first time and when updating application versions. The installation details for Now Assist applications enable you to select a Now Assist suite version and review which applications, if any, need to be updated or procured for suite compatibility.

\[Omitted image "app-mgr-suite-installation.png"\] Alt text: Based on the Now Assist suite version selected, 35 other Now Assist applications need to be updated for compatibility.

A Now Assist application version might be included in multiple Now Assist suite versions based on its compatibility with other applications. When you install or update a Now Assist application, you can choose any suite version that the application is compatible with. Based on the Now Assist suite version you choose, multiple applications might be updated.

## Example: Install a Now Assist Suite version

Some Now Assist applications are part of multiple Now Assist suites because they're compatible with multiple other Now Assist application versions.

**Note:** The following examples are for illustrative purposes only. They might not reflect actual Now Assist suite versions. For details about available Now Assist Suite versions and their compatibility with ServiceNow AI Platform versions, see [Now Assist Suite release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-now-assist-suite-release-notes.html).

Assume that you want to install ServiceNow Otto for ITSM for the first time. You have the following Now Assist applications installed on your instance already:

-   ServiceNow Otto for ITOM \(version 1.5.0\)
-   ServiceNow Otto for Creator \(version 27.1.1\)

When you start to install ServiceNow Otto for ITSM, you can select different Now Assist suite versions based on the versions of ServiceNow Otto for ITSM that are compatible with your instance. You can choose from Now Assist suite 4.0.0, 3.0.0, or 2.0.0.

### Now Assist suite 4.0.0

The latest available Now Assist suite version is selected by default. The following information is displayed when Now Assist suite version 4.0.0 is selected:

|Now Assist application|Version|Status|
|----------------------|-------|------|
|ServiceNow Otto for ITSM|9.0.1|Will be installed|
|ServiceNow Otto for ITOM|2.0.3|Will be updated|
|ServiceNow Otto for Creator|27.2.2|Will be updated|

Now Assist suite version 4.0.0 includes the latest versions of ServiceNow Otto for ITSM, ServiceNow Otto for ITOM, and ServiceNow Otto for Creator.

If you want to update to the latest version of ServiceNow Otto for ITSM and ServiceNow Otto for ITOM now, Now Assist suite version 4.0.0 could be a good option.

**Note:** Test application updates in a non-production environment to verify expected functionality before making updates in production instances.

### Now Assist suite 3.0.0

The following information is displayed when you select Now Assist suite version 3.0.0:

|Now Assist application|Version|Status|
|----------------------|-------|------|
|ServiceNow Otto for ITSM|9.0.1|Will be installed|
|ServiceNow Otto for ITOM|2.0.2|Will be updated|
|ServiceNow Otto for Creator|27.2.2|Will be updated|

Now Assist suite 3.0.0 includes the latest version of ServiceNow Otto for ITSM \(9.0.1\). It also includes a newer \(but not the latest\) version of ServiceNow Otto for ITOM and the latest version of ServiceNow Otto for Creator.

ServiceNow Otto for ITSM version 9.0.1 and ServiceNow Otto for Creator version 27.2.2 are both in Now Assist suites 3.0.0 and 4.0.0. The difference between Now Assist suite versions 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 are the versions of ServiceNow Otto for ITOM that are available. Which version of ServiceNow Otto for ITOM you want can help you decide between updating to Now Assist suite 3.0.0 or 4.0.0.

### Now Assist suite 2.0.0

The following information is displayed when you select Now Assist suite version 2.0.0:

|Now Assist application|Version|Status|
|----------------------|-------|------|
|ServiceNow Otto for ITSM|8.0.0|Will be installed|
|ServiceNow Otto for ITOM|1.5.0|Up to date|
|ServiceNow Otto for Creator|27.1.1|Up to date|

Now Assist suite 2.0.0 includes versions of ServiceNow Otto for ITOM and ServiceNow Otto for Creator that are already installed on your instance. The latest version of ServiceNow Otto for ITSM isn't part of Now Assist suite 2.0.0, but a previous version \(8.0.0\) is.

In this case, you can choose to install the older version of ServiceNow Otto for ITSM, and not update your other Now Assist applications yet.

**Note:** Not updating the suite version might not be an option. Depending on compatibility of a new Now Assist application, you might have to update your Now Assist suite version to complete installation.
