# Order fulfillment AI agent

This Sales Customer Relationship Management agent identifies fulfillment tasks for a domain order by checking historic tasks from similar orders, confirms the task list with the user, and creates them.

## Workflow

1.  Fetch the details for the given domain order number.
2.  Check for existing historic fulfillment tasks for the order and display any that are found.
3.  Present the task list and ask the user to confirm. If rejected, let the user provide their own task list, validate it, and confirm again.
4.  Create the fulfillment tasks in the system.
5.  Update the trigger task status to completed.
6.  Display a mandatory summary of all steps taken, including each created task's name and sys\_id.
