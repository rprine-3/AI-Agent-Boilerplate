</table>**Important:** By default, all agentic workflows and AI agent records are read only.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must either [activate the agentic workflow template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-aia-use-case.md) or [duplicate the agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn’t necessary.

## Tools mapped to AI agents in agentic workflows

To find the tools mapped to AI agents used in the agentic workflows, you can perform the following steps:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**
2.  In the Agentic workflows tab, select the agentic workflow.
3.  In the **Describe and connect** step of the guided setup, select the AI agent you want to see the tools for.
4.  Go to the **Add tools and information** step.
5.  Review the tools mapped to the AI agent.
6.  Repeat for all AI agents in the agentic workflow.

## Agentic workflows and UI actions

To enable users to access agentic workflows with UI actions, you can open the agentic workflow in AI Agent Studio and navigate to the **Select channels and access** step. You can select a UI action as a possible way to access the workflow

If you don't see your UI actions after configuring it in AI Agent Studio, ensure that the property **com.glide.agentic\_processes\_view.enabled** is set to `true`.

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).
