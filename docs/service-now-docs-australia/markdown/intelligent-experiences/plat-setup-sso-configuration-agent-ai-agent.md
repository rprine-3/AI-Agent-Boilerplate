# SSO configuration AI agent

This ServiceNow Otto for Setup AI agent guides administrators through secure Single Sign-On \(SSO\) setup for ServiceNow using SAML or OpenID Connect \(OIDC\). The agent collects and validates identity provider details, creates authentication configurations, and guides users through review, testing, and activation.

## Workflow

1.  Check whether the SSO plugin is installed and whether an active SSO configuration already exists. If the plugin isn't installed, offer to install it and monitor progress before continuing.
2.  Identify whether the user wants SAML, OIDC, or generic SSO help; if unclear, ask them to choose. If an active configuration already exists, offer to deactivate it instead.
3.  For SAML: request the metadata URL. For OIDC: collect the configuration name, client ID, and well-known configuration URL \(client secret is handled separately, outside the conversation\).
4.  Create the SAML or OIDC Identity Provider record based on the provided information. Confirm success or display any errors for correction.
5.  Present a link to the newly created record and ask the user to review and correct any fields before continuing.
6.  Guide the user through testing the connection and confirm the test passed.
7.  Ask whether this should be the default login method and apply that setting if so.
8.  Explain ACR as a safety fallback and confirm whether it's been set up before proceeding.
9.  Ask for confirmation, then activate the configuration.
10. Depending on earlier default/active selections, mark the configuration as primary automatically or ask for confirmation.
11. Ask the user to test login redirection in a private browser.
