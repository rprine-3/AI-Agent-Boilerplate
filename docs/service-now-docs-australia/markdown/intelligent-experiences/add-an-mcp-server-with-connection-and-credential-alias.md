# Add an MCP Server with Connection and Credential Alias

Add an MCP Server by selecting a Connection and Credential Alias record.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: sn\_mcp\_client.admin
-   Verify that you have a Connection and Credential alias record created before adding an MCP Server with Others as the option.

    For more information, see [Create a Connection &amp; Credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connection-alias.md).


## About this task

For using the Authentication methods not supported in MCP Server, you can use the Connection and Credential Alias method to create the Alias manually and then update it in the MCP Server. For using OAuth based authentication method, first create the OAuth entity profile and then create the Connection and Credential Alias. For other authentication methods like API Key, Basic Auth, AWS Credentials, SSH Credentials, create the connection and credential Alias directly.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Navigate to **Manage MCP Servers** and select **New**.
