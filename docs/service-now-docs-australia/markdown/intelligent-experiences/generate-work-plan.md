# Platform Generate my work plan agentic workflow

Use the Platform Generate my work plan agentic workflow to create personalized work plans for currently assigned work.

## Generate my work plan overview

The Generate my work plan agentic workflow creates personalized work plans based on current assigned work. This reduces manual effort and guesswork in work planning. The AI agents identify and retrieve all work assigned to the user, predict effort required to complete work, and generate an actionable work plan. Effort is estimated based on historical records related to the open work items. Generated work plans emphasize the highest priority work by examining the following information and can result in faster resolution and fewer missed SLAs.

-   User sentiment
-   Short description
-   Priority
-   Description
-   Due date
-   Escalation
-   State
-   Updated
-   Number
-   Impact
-   SLA

Along with the plan itself, the agentic workflow also provides reasoning behind its decisions for creating the plan.

The agents, tools, and triggers associated with the Generate my work plan agentic workflow are provided by AI applications. You can [activate the agentic workflow template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-aia-use-case.md) by adding triggers and setting the display settings to include the ServiceNow Otto panel. To change this agentic workflow's instructions, [duplicate it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), adjust the settings to suit your specific needs, and activate the duplicated version instead.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## Prerequisites and setup

To access this workflow, you must have ServiceNow Otto for Platform installed on your instance. You can get this by installing any other AI application.

Now LLM is not a supported LLM provider for the Generate my work plan agentic workflow.

## Role masking

Required role: sn\_uxc\_gen\_ai.platform\_ai\_work\_planner.

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

In the data access settings, add the necessary roles to enable reading of the tables for the records you want to access for potential work plans. For example, add the itil role to the agentic workflow's list of approved roles so that it can access Incident records.

## Additional configuration

Change different settings related to the agentic workflow by changing values for the Now Assist Skill Config Var Set. To access the variable set and make changes, do the following while in the Platform AI Agents and Skills scope:

-   Go to the Now Assist Skill Config \[sn\_nowassist\_skill\_config\] table.
-   Open the record named **Generate my work plan config**.
-   In the Now Assist Skill Config Var Set related list, select **New**.
-   Enter a name for your Config Var Set.
-   Set Config Type to be either `User schedule` or `Generate my work plan`.
-   Save the Var Set record.
-   Set the variables for the config type.
-   Save the Var Set.

The work plan config var set includes general variables for running the agentic workflow.

<table><thead><tr><th>

Config field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Schedule job

</td><td>

Creates a scheduled job that automatically runs, allowing users to see updated prioritization suggestions after making progress in their work. Default: Unselected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Predict estimated time to complete work per record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Exclude task table

</td><td>

By default, certain fields are used for prioritizing work on the Task table. You can configure what fields to use on individual tables, such as the Incident table. Enable this to only plan for tables configured and not other records which are task or extension of task tables.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max tasks

</td><td>

The maximum number of tasks that can be recommended to a user for their work plan. Default: 30 tasks

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The Incident config var set includes the following variables. Configure either the AIS fields or the GAF field for determining how the agentic workflow gathers what work the user has. If you configure GAF, it takes priority when running the agentic workflow. For more information about GAF, see [Group Action Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/group-action-framework.md).

Use this config var set as a template to change any values for other tables, such as the Case or HR Case tables.

**Note:** If you select **Exclude task table** in the work plan config var set, only the tables that have these var sets configured are included for work in the suggested work plan.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order by

</td><td>

JSON object array containing the ordering information for how work records are prioritized.

 Default is as follows. Any direction other than “DESC” is considered ascending in order.

 ```
[
{ column: 'priority', direction: ''},
{ column: 'due_date', direction: ''},
{ column: 'escalation', direction: 'DESC' },
{ column: 'sys_created', direction: 'DESC' }
]
```

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>By default, the Generate my work plan agentic workflow relies on the User \[sys\_user\] record's Schedule field. If there is no schedule defined on the User record, the workflow consults the Schedule \[chm\_schedule\] table for the user. If neither are present, the assumed schedule is a weekday schedule from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

Change what tables and fields to look for schedule information with the **User schedule** config type.

## In-product agentic AI and UI actions

Access agentic workflows in the Core UI and in workspaces in the AI Activity panel. From there, track their progress, provide or review input, and see the results of the work performed. For more information, see [In-product agentic AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/in-product-agentic-ai.md) for more details about the AI Activity panel.

To enable users to access agentic workflows with UI actions, open the agentic workflow in AI Agent Studio and navigate to the **Select channels and access** step. Select a UI action as a possible way to access the workflow.

If you don't see your UI actions after configuring it in AI Agent Studio, verify that the property **com.glide.agentic\_processes\_view.enabled** is set to `true`. See [Enable the in-product experience for agentic workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/enable-inproduct-aia.md).

## Testing the Generate my work plan agentic workflow

Manually test an agentic workflow execution or access on the Testing page of AI Agent Studio if you have the sn.aia\_admin role and all other roles configured [in the security controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md). Start a manual test, select a test type and the name of the workflow, and use utterances in the Task field like the following samples. See [Test an agentic workflow execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-aia-use-case.md).

To evaluate the agentic workflow over many different execution logs, run an [automated evaluation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/execute-aia-eval.md).

## Sample utterance

After the workflow is activated in AI Agent Studio, enter `What should I work on today?` or similar phrases in the ServiceNow Otto panel to trigger the workflow. You must have the sn.now\_assist\_panel\_user role to run the workflow. Also run this workflow on the Testing page of AI Agent Studio with the same utterance in the Task field if you have the sn.aia\_admin role.

Users must have the sn\_uxc\_gen\_ai.platform\_ai\_work\_planner role to execute the agentic workflow.
