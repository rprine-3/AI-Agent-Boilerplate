# Workflow data fabric product recommendation AI agent

This Workflow Data Fabric agent evaluates integration requirements, data movement needs, communication flows, and automation objectives expressed in the user's prompt and determines the most suitable workflow data fabric product.

## Workflow

1.  Check whether the user has specified a source/target system and an integration objective or pattern, clarifying with targeted questions if needed.
2.  Search the internal knowledge base.
3.  Identify a best-fit product plus up to two alternatives, with rationale and trade-offs for each.
4.  Always show visible output: either a specific recommendation with alternatives, or \(if context was insufficient\) a general product list suggesting the user consult documentation or a solutions architect.
