# Test a prompt

After you create a prompt for your custom skill, test the prompt template before you finalize it. Testing the prompt verifies that you’re seeing the expected prompt results before it’s activated.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Skill Kit** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select the skill that you created the prompt for.

3.  In the Test prompt section, select **Run tests**.

4.  Choose a test incident or record.

5.  Select **Run test**.

    **Important:**

    Testing a skill consumes at least one Now Assist assist for the base prompt call.

    If the skill has LLM-judged evaluation metrics attached on the **Deployment and skill settings** tab, each metric execution consumes additional assists. Metric execution is billed as a custom call at one assist per 1,000 output tokens. Script-based metrics \(metrics with a script instead of a judge prompt\) don't consume assists.

    For information about adding evaluation metrics, see [Configure deployment and skill settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/configure-skill-settings.md).

    |Tab|Description|
    |---|-----------|
    |Response|The response is the result that the large language model \(LLM\) sends back from the prompt.|
    |Grounded prompt|The grounded prompt enables you to see the data that was brought into the prompt from your skill inputs and tools. With this view, you can see if your skill inputs and tools are returning the correct data.|

6.  If the skill is deployed as a flow, disable the system property com.glide.oneapi.fdih.async.quick.mode, and then enable flow reporting.

    This property allows the generation of flow execution details when running flows, subflows, and actions from a custom skill. You can use flow execution details to test and troubleshoot your flow, subflow, or action. For more information about the system property, see [Workflow Studio flow system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/flow-designer-system-properties.md).

7.  Refine the prompt if you want, and repeat testing as necessary.

8.  Select the run test history icon \[Omitted image "icon-nask-test-history.png"\] Alt text: Run test history icon. to see the results from your previous run tests.


## What to do next

After you test your prompt, you must finalize and publish it. To learn more about publishing a skill, see [Finalize and publish a skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/publish-skill.md).

If you have not configured the deployment settings for your skill, see [Configure deployment and skill settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/configure-skill-settings.md).
