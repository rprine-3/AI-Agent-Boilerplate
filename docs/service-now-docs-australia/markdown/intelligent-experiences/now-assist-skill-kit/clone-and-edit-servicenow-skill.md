# Clone a skill

Clone an existing skill to use it as a starting point for a new one. You can clone both base system ServiceNow skills and custom skills you have created.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

## About this task

Cloning a skill creates a copy in Draft state with the original prompt content, inputs, and outputs carried over. You can then edit the prompt, change the provider, or adjust other settings without affecting the original skill.

**Important:** Deployment settings for clones of base system ServiceNow skills cannot be edited after cloning. If you need custom deployment settings, create a new skill instead. Deployment settings for clones of custom skills can be edited normally.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Skill Kit** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select the skill that you want to clone.

3.  Open the **Clone skill** dialog.

    There are two ways to access this dialog depending on the skill type:

    -   For base system ServiceNow skills, select **Clone Skill** in the banner at the top of the skill page, or select the three-dot menu next to **Publish skill** and then select **Clone**.
    -   For custom skills, select the three-dot menu next to **Publish skill** and then select **Clone**.
4.  Fill in the fields and select **Clone**.
