# Retriever chunking and reranking

When you’re building a skill prompt that uses a retriever you can use chunking and reranking to enhance the accuracy and relevance of your responses.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

## About this task

To set up the chunking and reranking options for a retriever, you must have a retriever tool added to your skill with the **Hybrid** or **Semantic** search criteria. The following steps come after the semantic configuration in [Add a retriever](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/add-retriever.md).

## Procedure

2.  Select the skill that you’re adding a retriever to.

3.  [Add a retriever](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/add-retriever.md).

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Fixed size breaks down the full text into smaller passages. You can choose the passage size limit in number of words or number of sentences.

-   Small to big

Small to big enables you to choose the top K best matched indexed chunks and expand them to include surrounding chunks. Then the expanded chunks are linked together into a large text and broken into smaller passages.

Don’t use the small to big chunking strategy if you’re using full text or truncate index chunking configuration.
