# Create a skill

Create a custom skill for Otto. Creating a custom skill enables you to have greater flexibility with Otto's generative AI capabilities.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

**Note:** When you update AI Skill Kit you should also update Generative AI Controller to ensure that your skills continue to perform correctly.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Skill Kit** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select **Create new skill**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default provider

</td><td>

Available providers:-   Now LLM Service
-   External LLM

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/servicenow-large-language-model-now-llm/exploring-large-language-models.md).

    -   Spokes
    -   Custom LLM

For more information on setting up a custom large language model \(LLM\), see [Configure a generic large language model \(LLM\) connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/generative-ai-controller/configure-a-generic-llm-connector.md)

Available prebuilt spokes that enable you to connect with an external LLM:

-   Microsoft Azure OpenAI Generative AI Spoke
-   OpenAI Generative AI Spoke
-   Aleph Alpha
-   WatsonX
-   Google Gemini \(MakerSuite and Vertex AI\)
**Note:** The spokes don't consume Integration Hub transactions. The spokes consume assists.

User access

-   Any authenticated user

As long as a user is logged in, they can access and execute the skill.

-   Select roles

**Note:** If you select multiple roles, a user must only have one of the roles to execute the skill.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Role restrictions

</td><td>

Role restrictions define the specific roles under which a skill in ServiceNow executes. While ACLs determine which user roles are permitted to trigger the skill, role restrictions determine the roles the skill will operate with during execution.

5.  Select **Next**.

6.  Add skill inputs and outputs.

7.  Select **Go to summary**.

8.  Select **Finish**.


## What to do next

After you create the skill, you must configure it. To learn more about configuring a skill, see [Configure a skill prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/configure-skill-prompt.md).

If you don't need to set any configurations for your skill, you can create your skill prompt and tools. To learn more, see [Create a prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/create-prompt-template.md) and [Add a tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/add-a-tool.md).

-   **[Clone a skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/clone-and-edit-servicenow-skill.md)**  
Clone an existing skill to use it as a starting point for a new one. You can clone both base system ServiceNow skills and custom skills you have created.
