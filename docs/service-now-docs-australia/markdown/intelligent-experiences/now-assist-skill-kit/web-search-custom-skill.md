# Web search custom skill

The web search custom skill performs an internet search to answer a query. Web search is used whenever the LLM and AI Search are unable to provide results or whenever web search mode is activated.

The web search custom skill is based on a prebuilt topic block in Virtual Agent Designer, and is available when you turn on Otto in Virtual Agent. This feature is automatically triggered when both AI Search and the LLM can't find information to answer an end user's query. This feature can also be manually triggered whenever end users select the Web search results icon \(\[Omitted image "Globe.png"\] Alt text: Web search results icon.\) to enter into web search mode. Once web search activates, a third-party AI performs the search and returns with an answer.

For more information about the web search mode end-user display and functionality, see [Web search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/web-search-requestor.md).

Web Search AI choices are available in the OneExtend Definition Configs related list within the **AI Search answers** entry in the OneExtend Capabilities \[sys\_one\_extend\_capability\_list\] table. Select one of the AI definitions there, such as Perplexity, and set its value to `true`. Activate a matching AI credential by navigating to **ALL** &gt; **Connections &amp; credentials** &gt; **Credentials**, and setting the matching API key \(such as **Perplexity API key** active value to `true`\).
