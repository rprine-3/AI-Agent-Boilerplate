# Security metrics analysis AI agent

This Operational Technology Security Incident Response agent calculates and analyzes security incident response metrics for an individual analyst or a team over a specified time range.

## Workflow

1.  Determine whether the user is asking about an individual analyst or a team \(group\), and extract the time range. Convert dates to GlideDate or GlideDateTime format.
2.  Run the Calculation tool with the analyst or group name and date range. Results are displayed automatically.
3.  Ask if the user wants a deeper look at a specific metric: security incident volume, MTTR, or MTTA. If accepted, run the Analysis tool for the selected metric.
4.  If analysis completed successfully, ask if the user wants improvement suggestions. If accepted, run the recommend tool using the analysis results.
5.  Ask if the user needs anything else. Route out-of-scope questions to other agents.
