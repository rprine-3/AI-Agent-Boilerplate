# Survey analysis AI agent

This AI agent extracts and validates date ranges from user input, including natural language expressions. It analyzes survey data \(such as questions, responses, and triggered records\) to extract key metrics, identify trends, and deliver actionable insights for informed decision-making.

## Workflow

1.  Scan the entire user utterance for record type keywords.
2.  Extract all record types that are mentioned.
3.  Extract dates from the user input.
4.  Call the Survey Analysis tool to handle the analysis.
5.  Show the results to the user and end the conversation.
