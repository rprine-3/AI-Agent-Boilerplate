# Repair asset AI agent

This AI agent assists users in resolving issues with assets that are in a defective or pending repair state. It specializes in identifying and suggesting appropriate repair steps by leveraging the Web Search tool. The agent guides users through the repair process, helps them select a suitable resolution, and automatically updates and completes the repair task upon confirmation.

## Workflow

The agent helps users to repair assets.

1.  Initialize variables and use &lt;asset\_manufacturer&gt; and &lt;asset\_model&gt; for asset context which is already provided.
2.  Determine if the issue is known.
3.  If the issue is known, perform a web search and create a step by step hardware evaluation plan from the official &lt;asset\_manufacturer&gt; website for &lt;asset\_model&gt; having &lt;issue&gt;. Provide part requirements for each of the suggested repair steps. Give detailed steps for each issue.
4.  Refine and format search results.
5.  Display numbered troubleshooting steps to the user, one at a time.
6.  If the user indicates that the problem is solved, end the workflow.
7.  If the user indicates that the problem is not solved, go to the next troubleshooting step.
8.  When all steps are exhausted, end the workflow.
