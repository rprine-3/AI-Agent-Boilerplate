# Discover your agent network with the map

Use the agent map to visualize your entire agentic ecosystem, including ServiceNow and third-party AI assets.

## About this task

The agent map shows a holistic view of the relationships between your AI providers, AI models, MCP servers, AI agents, agentic workflows, and tools. You can use the map to review these relationships and get details about the AI assets in your enterprise.

Below the map, all of your managed agentic AI assets are listed.

\[Omitted image "gov-sec-access-map.png"\] Alt text: Agent map with managed agentic assets list below it.

## Before you begin

Role required: AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\]

Configure Veza access intelligence to show risk score and other information for each AI asset in the map. For more information, see [Configure Veza access intelligence in the agent map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/gov-sec-configure-veza-access-intelligence.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **AI Control Tower** &gt; **Govern** &gt; **Security**.

2.  On the **Overview** tab, select the agent map to go to the agent map details.

3.  On the agent map, select agentic assets to view details such as type and domain.

    -   To find an asset in the map, enter a partial or entire name in the search box in the map.
    -   To identify asset symbols, select **Legend**.
    -   To zoom and refresh the map, use the controls in the map.

Agent and AI Model

-   **Agent risk**

The severity of risk as defined by the Veza tenant for your instance. Risks can be classified Critical, High, Medium, and Low. For more information, see [Risk level tiers in Veza documentation](https://docs.veza.com/4yItIzMvkpAvMVFAamTf/features/access-reviews/how-to/access-path-risk-score#risk-level-tiers).

-   **Risk score**

A score representing the risk of the agent or model. Risk scores in Veza are calculated for each AI asset based on the number of associated risks and their risk levels. The scoring system weighs both the severity of risks and their cumulative impact using an algorithm designed to provide comparable scores across all AI assets in the agent map. For more information, see [How risk scoring works in Veza documentation](https://docs.veza.com/4yItIzMvkpAvMVFAamTf/features/insights/risks#how-risk-scoring-works).

-   **Nonhuman identity**

The user of the AI agent or model.

-   **Human owner**

The creator of the AI agent or model.
