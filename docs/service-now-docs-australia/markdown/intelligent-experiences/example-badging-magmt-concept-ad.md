# Example: Automate badge request management using AI Desktop Actions

Automate various tasks related to badge requests through desktop actions using AI Desktop Actions and AI agents.

Your HR representatives manage repetitive badge-related tasks. For example, issuing new badges, distributing temporary badges, replacing lost badges, and disabling badges during offboarding. To streamline and automate this work, you can create a desktop action for each task and assign these actions to an AI Agent in AI Agent Studio.

When new requests come in, HR representatives can trigger the AI agent from the ServiceNow Otto panel. The AI Agent automatically selects and runs the appropriate desktop action. This automation reduces manual effort and enables them to focus on higher-value work.

## Create badge desktop action in AI Desktop Actions

Automate various badge-related tasks through desktop actions in AI Desktop Actions.

### Before you begin

To access the AI Desktop Actions functionality, perform the following steps:

-   Enable AI Desktop Actions on your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Configure AI Desktop Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-agentic-desktop.md).
-   Download the AI Desktop Actions installer to automate repetitive tasks across applications and systems. For more information, see [Download AI Desktop Actions installer for defined desktop actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/download-agentic-desktop-installer.md).

Confirm that the following system requirements are met:

-   Windows 11 operating system is used.
-   A .NET 9.0 runtime v9.0.10 and .NET 9 Desktop Runtime v9.0.10 is installed.
-   No extended monitors are connected.
-   Theme must match between the systems used for recording and execution.
-   For record with AI, the ServiceNow AI Lens skill must be active on your instance. Contact your ServiceNow administrator if you're unsure whether this condition is met.

Familiarize yourself with the Design workspace and Action recorder. For more information, see [AI Desktop Actions Design workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/agentic-desktop-overview.md) and [Action recorder in AI Desktop Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/action-recorder-ad.md).

Role required: sn\_desktop\_core.desktop\_action\_user

### About this task

Record with AI generates more accurate anchor positions automatically, reducing the time you spend on manual anchor adjustments.

When you record with AI, after you finish recording, AI analyzes the recording, validates anchor positions, and corrects inaccuracies before you save or activate the desktop action. AI also generates a screen context for each captured screen and description for the desktop action. Screen context is a description of what the screen does and what it contains, which helps reviewers and AI agents understand the screen's intent.

**Note:** If your automation requires manual inputs, such as entering an OTP or CAPTCHA, you must provide instructions to the AI Agent to wait for the user input during execution. Otherwise, the automation can't proceed.

The **sn\_desktop\_core.record\_with\_ai** property is enabled by default, making **Record with AI** the default recording option. Turn off this property to set the manual recorder as the default recording option.

### Procedure

1.  From your Windows system, launch the AI Desktop Actions application.

2.  On the login page, in the **Add ServiceNow URL** field, enter the ServiceNow instance URL.

    For example, `https://<instance name>.service-now.com`.
