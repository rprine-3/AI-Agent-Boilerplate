# Reviewing policy enforcement in AI Control Tower

Review policy activities and execution results.

## Key benefits

-   Confirm a policy actually reached every point it applied to.
-   Tell a real failure apart from a policy that simply didn't apply anywhere it could.
-   Look up a specific person or asset, without checking policies one at a time.

View policy enforcement as an audit trail in the **Enforcement activity** tab. Each entry represents enforcement against one asset and shows its outcome. When a policy triggered the entry, the entry also shows which policy. A policy that enforces through more than one connector produces a separate entry for each connector.

For AI agent containment specifically, the **Enforcement activity** tab shows all agents that were contained automatically through a Threat Response policy, and those contained manually using kill switch protocol. Those contained manually show Kill Switch Manual Trigger in the **Source** column.

An outcome other than success has a specific meaning, not just pass or fail:

-   **Error** means something actually went wrong at a connector, and the record includes why.
-   **Skipped** means no connector applied to that context; there was nothing to enforce against, which isn't a failure.
-   **Timeout** means a connector didn't respond within its window.

## Use cases

-   Confirm whether a particular person was blocked from a particular model, and which connector enforced it.
-   Check an entry to determine whether a policy needs to be fixed. An outcome other than success can mean the policy simply didn't apply rather than failed.
-   When a user reports they've lost access, or a security review needs to know whether a specific asset has been affected by any policy, filter the activity by that person or asset.
