# AI Agent Analytics dashboard

Track the AI agent use and efficiency gain on your instance through the AI Agent Analytics dashboard. The dashboard can reveal trends in how AI agents are used to improve the time to resolution and the number of tasks closed.



## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

To use the AI Agent Analytics dashboard, you must have either the sn\_aia.viewer or the sn\_aia.admin role.

If you want to change the dashboard, you must duplicate it and apply changes to the copy. You can redirect the Analytics page in AI Agent Studio to the new dashboard by replacing the dashboard sys\_id in the system property **sn\_aia.analytics\_dashboard\_sysid**.

## Accessing the AI Agent Analytics dashboard

To open the dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Analytics**.

You can also access the dashboard from the AI Agent Studio overview page. Go to the Recent agentic workflows and AI agents activity section and select the **View analytics** link.

## Indicators

Most indicators are updated daily. The latency indicators are updated every 15 minutes.

Once you have installed AI agents, you can collect initial data by running the \[Now Assist AI Agents\] Historical Data Collection job. The other data collection jobs, \[Now Assist AI Agents\] Daily Data Collection and \[Now Assist AI Agents\] Periodic Data Collection, update the indicators.
