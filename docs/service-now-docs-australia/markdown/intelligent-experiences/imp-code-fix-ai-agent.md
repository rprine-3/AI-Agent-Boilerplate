# Code fix AI agent

This AI Agent automates the process of analyzing, suggesting, and implementing fixes for code violations or issues detected within code repositories or running scripts. It leverages LLM-driven suggestions while keeping the user in control of approval and refinement.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to fixing code.

1.  Receive the user's code request.
2.  Execute the appropriate tools to detect and handle code violations.
3.  Allow user-driven approval, rejection, or refinement.
