# Add an MCP server with OAuth 2.1

Add an MCP server with OAuth 2.1 in the AI Agent Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_mcp\_client.admin

## About this task

OAuth is the standard method to authenticate MCP servers. If your MCP server supports it, choose OAuth 2.1 as the authentication method.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Settings**.

2.  Navigate to **Manage MCP Servers** and select **New**.

3.  On the Add MCP server form, enter a name and the web address for your MCP server.

4.  In the **Authentication Type** field, select **OAuth 2.1**.

5.  Select **Next**.

    The form extends with the registration details.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    The Dynamic Client Registration form auto-populates the field data.

    **Note:** If dynamic registration is supported by the MCP server, you're prompted to confirm the grant type and other inputs. If dynamic registration isn’t supported, you can continue to the Manual Registration method.

    The MCP server with dynamic client registration is added as a simple connection and credential alias.

7.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:**

    -   If your MCP server doesn’t support dynamic client registration, then you can register the OAuth client for AI agents in your MCP server manually and update those client details in AI Agent Studio.
    -   The manual registration doesn’t auto-populate the field data and must be manually provided.

8.  Select **Add**.

    You're redirected to the MCP Server record to authenticate the MCP server for adding an MCP tool to an AI agent.

9.  Select **Authenticate**.

10. In the third-party authorization page, select **Authorize**.

    **Note:** When OAuth access or refresh tokens aren’t available, you must authenticate the OAuth configuration on the MCP server record to add it as an AI agent tool.
