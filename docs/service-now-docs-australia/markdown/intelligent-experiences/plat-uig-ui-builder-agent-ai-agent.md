# UI builder AI agent

This agent helps users edit pages and answer questions within the ServiceNow UI Builder editor.

## Workflow

1.  Get the user's request \(or pick it up from the initial mission context\).
2.  If the user wants to make changes to their page, take control of the editor, perform the requested operations, return editor control, and summarize what changed.
3.  If the user is asking a question, search product documentation and the component library, then present an answer.
4.  Ask if the user has additional requests and repeat.
