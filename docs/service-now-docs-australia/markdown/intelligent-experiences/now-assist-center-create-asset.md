Use the asset library to create AI assets in your instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_na\_center.nac\_admin

## About this task

Follow these steps to create an AI asset.

From the asset inventory, asset types are created by opening their respective application.

-   Create agents and agentic workflows with AI Agent Studio.

    For more information, see [AI Agent Studio overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-agent-studio.md).

-   Create assets with Assistant Designer, including topics, virtual assistants, subflows, and actions.

    For more information, see [Assistant Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/assistant-designer.md).

-   Create custom skills with AI Skill Kit.

    For more information, see [AI Skill Kit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit/now-assist-skill-kit-landing.md).

-   Create datasets with AI Data Kit.
