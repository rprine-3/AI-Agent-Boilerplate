# AI Desktop Actions Design workspace

The Design workspace is an interactive environment within AI Desktop Actions that enables you to create desktop actions by recording and configuring user interactions with desktop applications. The workspace provides a visual canvas where you can design multi-screen automation workflows that capture business processes across different applications.

**Important:** Access to the Design workspace and Execution workspace depends on the user’s role.

-   When users with the AI Agent Admin \(sn\_aia.admin\) role sign in from their desktop, they can access the Home page and Design workspace to create desktop actions. When they test a desktop action, the Execution workspace launches automatically.
-   When users with the ServiceNow Otto panel user \(now\_assist\_panel\_user\) role trigger an automation from the ServiceNow Otto panel, the Execution workspace launches automatically to run the desktop action.

You don’t open the Execution workspace directly. It launches automatically when you test or run a desktop action.

## AI Desktop Actions home page

The home page provides an intuitive interface to help you quickly create, track, and manage your desktop actions. You can easily find and manage your existing desktop actions and monitor their status.

\[Omitted image "home-page-actions-ad.png"\] Alt text: AI Desktop Actions home page with Create desktop action UI action, search and filter options, and cards of existing desktop actions.

When you log in to AI Desktop Actions, the home page is the first screen you see. The home page lets you interact with various functionalities.

-   **Create desktop action**

    You can create desktop actions by manually capturing steps or auto-capture steps through recording.

-   **Search and manage actions**

    You can search for specific actions and manage them directly from the home page.

-   **My Actions and All Actions**

    **My Actions** tab shows only the actions published by the logged in user. **All Actions** tab shows list of all actions available on the instance the logged in user is connected to.

-   **Desktop action cards**

    Configured desktop actions with details, such as created date, user who created, applications added, and activation status.

-   **Edit desktop actions**

    You can modify a desktop action by selecting the **Edit** option for each card. Any changes you make are saved and reflected on the home page.

-   **First-time user onboarding**

    When you open AI Desktop Actions for the first time, an onboarding wizard guides you through steps to create and activate a desktop action.

    Select **Skip intro** to bypass the onboarding wizard and go to the home page. Select the **Don't show this again** option to prevent the wizard from appearing the next time you open the app. After completing the onboarding wizard, select **Get started** to start creating desktop actions.

-   **Access to profile and documentation**

    A dedicated section enables you to view your profile information, access product documentation, and check the product version.


## What AI generates after recording

When you use record with AI option, AI badge, AI analysis retry option, and screen context are shown in the properties panel for each screen. If you aren't satisfied with the results, you can regenerate anchors and screen context by selecting **Retry** \[Omitted image "icon-retry.png"\] Alt text:.

\[Omitted image "ad-screen-ai-tag.png"\] Alt text: AI badge, retry option, and screen context for screens in the properties panel.

An AI badge appears for each anchor generated using AI.

\[Omitted image "ad-anchor-ai-tag.png"\] Alt text: AI badge for anchors in the properties panel.

## AI Desktop Actions Design tab

The Design workspace provides a no-code environment for creating, managing, and testing your desktop actions. You can either auto-capture or manually record a series of steps you perform on your computer, such as clicking buttons, entering text, selecting from drop-down, or interacting with different applications. You can then save this sequence as a reusable desktop action.

\[Omitted image "design-tab-overview-ad.png"\] Alt text: AI Desktop Actions Design tab that shows interface elements like Design, Details tabs, Screens and steps panel, and a captured currency converter screen with numbered annotations.
