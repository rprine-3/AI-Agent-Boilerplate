# Security incident resolution AI agent

This Operational Technology Security Incident Response agent walks the user through resolving a security incident by generating and executing a resolution plan.

## Workflow

1.  Fetch the security incident details and resolution plan. End if already closed or resolved.
2.  Summarize the incident's current state, including any resolution steps already completed, and show it to the user.
3.  Present the resolution plan for user review. Iterate on revisions until the user approves.
4.  Execute each step in the approved plan in order. Falls back to other agents for steps it can't perform itself.
5.  Confirm completion with the user. Only end when the user explicitly confirms no further actions are needed.
