# Create offboarding requests for AI assets

Create an offboarding request to retire AI assets that are no longer needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] or AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\]

**Note:** Users with the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role can create offboarding requests only for the AI assets that they are assigned to manage. In addition, they can only create offboarding requests and submit them for review. They can't approve or reject requests or complete any corresponding offboarding tasks.

## About this task

To retire a deployed AI asset, you can initiate the offboarding process by creating and submitting an offboarding request. This triggers the offboarding workflow that assigns tasks to impacted asset owners and updates the status of the AI asset record to **Retired** on completion.

You can create offboarding requests for the following AI asset types:

-   AI systems \(classic, generative, and agentic\)
-   AI models
-   Datasets
-   MCP servers

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Al Control Tower** &gt; **Home** &gt; **Inventory**.

2.  From the list of available assets, open an asset record with a state of **Deployed** and a status of **Approved**.

3.  Initiate the offboarding request by using one of the following navigation options.

    -   Open the asset record, select the **Actions** menu and select **Create offboarding request**.
    -   In the Lifecycle tab, go to the Retire stage and select **Create offboarding request**
4.  On the Offboarding form, fill in the fields.

6.  In the Submit offboarding request dialog box, select **Submit request**.

    The offboarding workflow is initiated. The **Impacted assets** and the**Offboarding workflow** tabs also appear.
