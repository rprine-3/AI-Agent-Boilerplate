# Run the GenAI/AgenticAI Assessment scheduled job

Before you can view the agentic AI or generative AI assessment results, you must first run the GenAI/AgenticAI Assessment scheduled job.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Set the Scheduled Jobs filter to `Application is AI Readiness Evaluation`, and then select **Run**.

    **Tip:** If the Application column isn’t displayed in your ServiceNow instance, personalize the column settings using the Update Personalized List icon \[Omitted image "gear-changes-outline-24.svg"\] from the list header.

3.  Select **GenAI/Agentic AI Assessment** from the Name column.

4.  Select **Execute Now**.

    This action begins the scheduled job for the agentic and generative AI assessments found in **Workspaces** &gt; **AI Readiness Evaluation**.


## What to do next

If you must rerun all the scheduled jobs, or specifically, the agentic AI scheduled jobs for ITSM and CSM, repeat these steps.

**Note:** You must complete the additional steps in the AI Readiness Evaluation guided setup if you want to work with the ServiceNow Otto for HRSD product. If you don’t complete the additional guided setup steps for the ServiceNow Otto for HRSD product, the assessment continuously fails. For more information about completing the AI Readiness Evaluation guided setup, see [Configure the AI Readiness Evaluation guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-readiness-evaluation/configure-nare-guided-setup.md).
