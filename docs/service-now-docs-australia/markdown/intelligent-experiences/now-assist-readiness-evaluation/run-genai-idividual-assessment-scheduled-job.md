# Run individual assessment scheduled jobs

Use individual scheduled jobs to assess readiness for generative and agentic AI implementations across your instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The ServiceNow AI Platform provides scheduled jobs that assess your instance readiness for generative and agentic AI. The following individual scheduled jobs are available:

-   AI Assessment - Virtual Agent
-   AI Assessment - ITSM
-   AI Assessment - HRSD
-   AI Assessment - CSM
-   AI Assessment - AI Search
-   AgenticAIHRSDAssessment
-   AgenticAICSMAssessment
-   agentic AI Assessment - ITSM - Change Request

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Filter the list by setting **Application** to `AI Readiness Evaluation`.

3.  Select the job that you want to run.

4.  Select **Execute Now**.


## What to do next

**Important:**

For the Virtual Agent assessment to yield results, the following plugins must be active on your instance:

-   Virtual Agent \(com.glide.cs.chatbot\)
-   Catalog Conversational Coverage \(sn\_catalog\_con\_cov\)

The Virtual Agent assessment requires the Catalog Conversational Coverage \(sn\_catalog\_con\_cov\) plugin required for the assessment to run. For more information on Now Assist in Conversational Catalog Request, see [AI in Conversational Catalog Request](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/servicenow-platform/service-catalog/now-assist-in-conversational-catalog-request).
