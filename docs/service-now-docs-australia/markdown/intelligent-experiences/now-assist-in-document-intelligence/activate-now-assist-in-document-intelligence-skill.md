# Activate a Now Assist in Document Intelligence skill

Activate the Now Assist in Document Intelligence skills that agents can use to help analyze and extract information from documents with generative AI.

## Before you begin

Now Assist in Document Intelligence skills are turned on by default. The skills will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. The new default behavior works as follows:

-   **New customers**

    When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.

-   **Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Australia Patch 1\)**

    There is no change to skills that are currently enabled and customized. A skill is turned on if:

    -   The Now Assist plugin is installed, but the skill was never turned on.
    -   An admin has never adjusted roles for the skill.
    A skill is not turned on if:

    -   The skill was previously turned on, and then turned off again.
    -   An admin has adjusted roles for the skill.

This skill doesn’t require configuration in the Now Assist Admin console.
