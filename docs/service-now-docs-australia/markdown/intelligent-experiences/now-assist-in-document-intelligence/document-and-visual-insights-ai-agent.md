# Document and visual insights AI agent

The document and visual insights AI agent gathers context from user input and document orimage attachments, generates the requested information based on the content, and provides the information along with any relevant task details.

## Document and visual insights AI agent overview

The document and visual insights AI agent performs tasks to process documents and images.

-   **Data extraction**

    Extract specific information.

    Summarize the key topics of documents and images.

-   **Question answering \(Q&amp;A\)**

    Answer questions about the document or image content.


The document and visual insights AI agent is not typically used in standalone mode and any use case can access it. For more information on AI agents, see [AI Agent Studio \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-ai-agents.md).

AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aia.md).
