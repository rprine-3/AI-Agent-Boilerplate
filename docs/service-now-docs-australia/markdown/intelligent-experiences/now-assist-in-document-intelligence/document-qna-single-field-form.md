# Question form for use casesetup

The Question form enables you to define a question you want to ask about the document.

The Question form includes the following fields.

<table id="table_e3b_jz5_12c"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Question

</td><td>

The question about the document. This question is sent to the generative AI for a prediction.

 Write a clear and concise question about the information you want to find in the document. For example, "Is this document subject to expiration?". 

 Below the question, add details about how generative AI can best provide the correct answer. For example, “Review the sections where validity, duration or time frames are discussed and look for any details about expiration dates, renewal requirements, or explicit statements declaring the document as permanent. Answer ‘Yes’ if the document is subject to an expiration date. Answer ‘No’ if there is no mention of expiration or contains an explicit statement that it is permanent.”

 **Tip:** View the **Question assistance** tab for additional guidance on forming an effective question.

 This question is displayed to the agent when reviewing the answers in the Document Intelligence workspace.
