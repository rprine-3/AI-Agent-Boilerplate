# Field form for use casesetup

The Field form enables you to define a single field for extraction.

The Field form includes the following fields.

</th><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Field name

</td><td>

The name for the field as it appears in the Document Intelligence workspace.

 Clearly state the information you want to extract. Be specific, clear and concise. For example: "Order number"

</td></tr><tr><td>

Details

</td><td>

A description of the information you want to extract. Along with the field name, the description is used to help the LLM predict the text to extract from the document.

 Include any relevant context or additional details to identify the right information. This might include keywords. For example, "The contract number or the number of the reference contract”.

 Provide examples of what information you want to extract. For example, “AGR-2023-0042”, “CON2039739”, or “BV-22122KEY”.

 Example of a description:

 Field name: “Currency”

 Details: “The currency in which the contract is denominated. Only valid for Order Forms. Otherwise, leave it empty \(''\). If the currency symbol is '$', answer 'USD'. Examples: 'USD', 'EUROS', 'GBP', etc.”

 **Tip:** View the **Field assistance** tab for additional guidance on forming an effective field.
