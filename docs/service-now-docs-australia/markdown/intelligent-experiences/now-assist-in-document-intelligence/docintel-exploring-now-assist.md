# Exploring Now Assist in Document Intelligence

With Now Assist in Document Intelligence,you can use generative AI to extract key information from your documents and images for use in your workflows.

## Now Assist in Document Intelligence overview

Now Assist in Document Intelligence makes the following generative AI capabilities available:

-   Extract information from documents. Extract information in the form of fields, tables, and answers to predefined questions from documents and image files. The information can be reviewed by agents in the Document Intelligence workspace, stored in mapped fields, and used as defined in the workflow.
-   Document Q&amp;A: Agents can save time when reviewing documents by using the predictive capabilities of generative AI to provide answers to predefined questions.
-   Document and visual insights AI agent. The AI agent gathers context from user input and document or image attachments, generates the requested information based on the content, and provides the information along with any relevant task details. For more information on AI agents, see [Document and visual insights AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/document-and-visual-insights-ai-agent.md).
-   Contract metadata extraction and contract analysis. The skills for contract metadata extraction and contract analysis are only available with the Now Assist in Contract Management application. For more information, see .
-   Attachment summarization. Agents can view a summary of attachment content along with the record summary in ITSM. Attachment summarization is available in Now Assist for ITSM. For more information, see [Customize a ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/cust-now-assist-itsm-skill.md).
-   Document chat. Agents can receive chat responses based on document content. Document chat is available in Now Assist for Virtual Agent. For more information, see [Upload documents in a chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/upload-documents-na-va.md).
-   Invoice data extraction. Extract invoice details from PDFs submitted through email or supplier portal and automatically process the digitized invoice within Accounts Payable Operations \(APO\). For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Accounts Payable Operations \(APO\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/now-assist-apo.md).
-   ESG information extraction. Extract ESG-related information from invoices to support Operational Sustainability Management \(ESG\) initiatives and regulatory compliance. For more information, see [Filter citations documents for Operational Sustainability Management \(formerly ESG Management\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/filter-citations-and-authority-documents-for-esg.md).

## Now Assist in Document Intelligence skills

Now Assist in Document Intelligence skills are enabled in the Platform workflow on the Now Assist Admin Console.

-   **Extract information from documents**

    The extract information from documents skill allows you to use Now Assist predictions to extract fields and tables and find answers to predefined questions from a document or image. Agents can review and edit predictions in the Document Intelligence workspace. For more information, see [Review extracted information in the Document Intelligence workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/review-extracted-information.md).

-   **Multimodal chat**

    The multimodal chat skill is used to enable chat responses about the content of uploaded documents and images. It is only used on the server side by the document and visual insights AI agent and by the question answering capability in Now Assist for Virtual Agent. This skill doesn’t require configuration in the Now Assist Admin console.

    For more information on these capabilities, see [Document and visual insights AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-in-document-intelligence/document-and-visual-insights-ai-agent.md) and [Upload documents in a chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/upload-documents-na-va.md).

\[Omitted image "mmasset0021089-docIntel-admin-nowassistssist-vertical.svg"\] Alt text: Diagram showing the activity flow in Now Assist in Document Intelligence.

In this workflow:

-   An admin activates a skill and sets up a use case for it.
-   A workflow integration creates a document task as part of its flow.
-   A document is uploaded for processing in a document task.
-   Now Assist processes the document and makes predictions based on the fields defined in the use case.
-   If the use case is not set to full automation, the task is sent to a live agent for review.
-   The agent provides input to validate or correct the values predicted by Now Assist.
-   The task is completed and the integrated workflow proceeds as defined.
