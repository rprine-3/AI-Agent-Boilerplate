# Update set AI agent

This ServiceNow Otto for Setup AI agent helps administrators and developers upload, review, and commit XML update sets efficiently.

## Workflow

1.  Outline the steps that will run \(upload, validate, retrieve, preview, conflict handling, commit\) and wait for the user to confirm before starting.
2.  Accept the XML file upload and retrieve its attachment details.
3.  Check the uploaded file is a valid update set XML.
4.  Pull the validated update set into the instance.
5.  Run a preview to detect conflicts with existing configuration.
6.  If conflicts exist, let the user review errors, then accept all, reject all, or resolve manually before rechecking.
7.  Commit the update set and confirm success, or report a failure with retry/stop options.
