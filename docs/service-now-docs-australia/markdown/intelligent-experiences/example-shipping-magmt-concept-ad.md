# Example: Automate shipping management tasks using AI Desktop Actions

Automate various tasks related to shipping management through desktop actions using AI Desktop Actions and AI agents.

Your shipping coordinators frequently handle repetitive data-entry tasks. For example, entering PO numbers, invoice details, customer information, shipping addresses, item dimensions, and weights from Excel into the Shipping Management application on their desktops. When there are dozens of rows to process, it becomes time-consuming, error-prone, and significantly slows down their daily workflow.

To streamline this process, you can create a dedicated desktop action that reads each row from the Excel file and automatically inputs the data into the Shipping Management application. You can then assign this action to an AI Agent. When new shipping batches arrive, shipping coordinators simply trigger the AI Agent from the ServiceNow Otto panel. The agent then automatically processes each line item by selecting and running the appropriate desktop action.

    4.  Capture the area of the external application’s window by selecting the **Select** icon \[Omitted image "ad-select-icon.png"\] Alt text: on the Capture panel or pressing the `Ctrl + Shift + C` on the keyboard.

        **Note:** If the `Ctrl + Shift + C` shortcut conflicts with another application on the your machine, such as Zoom, then you must use the **Select** button to initiate manual screen capture.

        For example, you can capture the area surrounding a button or a text field in a web browser. The cursor icon changes to the \[Omitted image "plus-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: icon.

    5.  Drag the \[Omitted image "plus-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: icon and select the required screen area.

        When you leave the \[Omitted image "plus-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: icon, the selected area is captured as a screenshot in the Design workspace.

        If you aren't satisfied with the captured screen, you can recapture the screen area by selecting the **Capture image** icon \[Omitted image "ad-capture-image-icon.png"\] Alt text:.

8.  Insert anchors.

    1.  Insert an anchor on the captured screen by selecting the **Add anchor** icon \[Omitted image "ad-add-anchor-icon.png"\] Alt text:.

        \[Omitted image "ex-ship-app-anchor-ad.png"\] Alt text: Screen capture of the Shipping Management app with anchor added on the Window title

        **Note:** If two applications in the frame have similar logos or visual elements, verify that the anchor position is unique to the target application to avoid incorrect element identification during automation.

        An anchor is a reference point on the screen that helps the automation identify and interact with a nearby UI elements. During execution, the system uses computer vision to locate the anchor and then identifies the UI elements at a related distance from the anchor. Anchors improve the stability and accuracy of steps when the target element’s location may shift or when the UI layout varies across sessions.

        **Note:** Don't use dynamically changing UI elements as anchors. If an element changes its color, text, or state after an action \(for example, after a click\), select a different anchor that remains static on the screen.

    2.  Move the anchor to a part of the captured image that won’t change.

        For example, move the anchor to a title or field label.

        If the area under the anchor doesn’t exactly match the corresponding area of the captured image, the anchor isn't recognized, and the steps aren't performed as intended. Choose a static area of the image for setting your anchor.

        You can add multiple anchors on each screen. Multiple anchors let you define the geographical relationship between anchor and target with greater accuracy when targeting different locations in the image.

9.  Configure the steps.

    1.  From the Step control menu, select the **Add step** icon \[Omitted image "circle-plus-outline-24.svg"\].

    2.  Select the type of step for each field on the ORDER FORM from the contextual menu.
