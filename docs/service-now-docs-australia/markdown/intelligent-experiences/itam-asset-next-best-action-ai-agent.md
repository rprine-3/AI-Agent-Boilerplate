# Asset next best action AI agent

This AI agent guides users through the repair order task process by validating task numbers, identifying task types, and routing the workflow to the correct specialized agent for troubleshooting or repair. The agent processes one task at a time to ensure accurate handling of hardware asset repair order tasks.

## Workflow

The agent identifies a repair order task type and routes the work to the appropriate specialized agent for completion.

1.  Verify that a repair order task number is provided, prompting the user if it is missing.
2.  Retrieve the task details and perform validation to confirm the task name, asset information, and status.
3.  If validation returns an error, inform the user and end execution.
4.  Display the identified task details to the user, including the task name, asset model, and manufacturer.
5.  Route to the appropriate workflow: if the task name is Troubleshoot Asset, invoke the evaluate asset flow; if the task name is Repair Asset, invoke the repair asset flow.
6.  Terminate the workflow after the appropriate section has completed execution.
