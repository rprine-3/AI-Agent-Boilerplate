# Predictive Intelligence Usage Analytics dashboard

The Predictive Intelligence Usage Analytics dashboard is a central location to understand the effectiveness and overall value of all your Predictive Intelligence solutions. View metrics for model training successes and failures. Monitor prediction statistics including breakdowns by individual model.

\[Omitted image "predictive-intel-usage-analytics-overview-a.png"\] Alt text: An overview of the PI Usage Dashboard, with the tab for the Classification tab open. The Date Range selector is highlighted. Several widgets are visible, such as Total Active Solutions.

For your models in the Classification, Similarity, and Clustering capabilities, the Predictive Intelligence Usage Analytics dashboard gives you visibility into training and predictions. You can specify the time periods to report on, as well as select specific solutions for a deep dive.

With the ml\_report\_user or ml\_admin role, view the Predictive Intelligence Usage Analytics dashboard by navigating to **Predictive Intelligence** &gt; **Dashboards** &gt; **Monitoring**.

The dashboard has separate tabs for each capability. The Classification tab opens by default, or you can select Similarity or Clustering. Each tab contains a set of reports in the form of widgets.

You can drill down into the underlying records by selecting a report's chart or graph, which opens a query-filtered list. Many reports in the Training Statistics section of PI Usage Dashboard are drawn from the ml\_solution table. Reports in the Prediction Statistics section are drawn from the ml\_predictor\_results table.

## Date Range

The **Date Range** selector opens a calendar picker where you can select the time frame for the reports. Your selected date range applies to all widgets on the current tab.

The calendar picker offers a variety of preset dates under its **Standard** subhead. Choose from **Last 3 months**, **Today**, **YTD** \(year to date, from January 1 of the current calendar year\), and so forth.

You can also choose **Custom range** to select your own dates. Enter dates directly into the **Start date** and **End date** fields, or select a date range using the calendar. Then select **Apply** to update the reports in all widgets on the page.

\[Omitted image "predictive-intel-usage-analytics-date-selector-a.png"\] Alt text: The Date Range selector is open, showing a variety of Standard date ranges. Also available is a calendar and fields for specifying a Custom range.

## Available metrics for Classification and Similarity

The following tables describe the widgets available on both the Classification and Similarity tabs, unless otherwise noted. The Clustering capability has different widgets, so refer to the **Available metrics for Clustering** section on this page.
