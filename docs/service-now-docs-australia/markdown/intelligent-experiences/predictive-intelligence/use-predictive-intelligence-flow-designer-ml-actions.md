# Use Predictive Intelligence in Workflow Studio with ML actions

Use Predictive Intelligence actions in Workflow Studio to create flows that incorporate your model predictions.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure the following plugins are activated in your instance: Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\) and Predictive Intelligence for Workflow Studio \(com.snc.ml\_flowdesigner\).
-   Create or use an existing trained Predictive Intelligence solution.
-   Roles required: ml\_admin or admin, and flow\_designer or delegated\_developer.

## About this task

Workflow Studio enables you to automate complex processes. The first thing to identify is what process you want to automate. In this example scenario, you're automating the assignment of a Category to an incident record. When you complete the flow, the next incident record created in your instance updates the Category field in the record based on the text entered in the **Short description** field.

You can deploy any active and trained classification, similarity, or regression ML solution in your flow, as appropriate for your use case.

**Note:** The regression framework is deprecated in the Australia release. You can continue to use existing regression solutions but you can't create new ones.

In this example procedure, you create a flow that implements the ml\_incident\_categorization solution in a Workflow Studio action. You can find this solution by searching on the ML Solutions \[ml\_solution\] table, as shown in the image below. Confirm that the solution you use has been trained and its **Active** value is set to **true**.

    \[Omitted image "use-predictive-intelligence-flow-designer-ml-actions3Y.png"\] Alt text: The screen for Let's get the details for your flow, with fields filled according to the example.

    The Flow screen appears, showing the Auto-assign Category to Incident name you assigned to the flow. If a Getting started screen appears, select **Skip tour**.

5.  In the TRIGGER section of the Flow screen, configure the following fields to create a trigger for the flow.

    1.  **Select a Trigger**: Select **Record**, then from the list of possible options for Record, select **Created**.

        \[Omitted image "use-predictive-intelligence-flow-designer-ml-actions4Y.png"\] Alt text: On the tab for the example flow, in the Trigger section, the Record-Created selection is highlighted. \[Omitted image ""\] Alt text:

    2.  **Table**: Select **Incident \[incident\]**.

        **Note:** After you configure both the **Trigger** and **Table** fields, record data pills appear in the **Data** section of the screen so you can use them in your flow.

        \[Omitted image "use-predictive-intelligence-flow-designer-ml-actions5Y.png"\] Alt text: On the tab for the example flow, in the Trigger section, the Table field is filled with the value Incident.

    3.  **Condition**: Select **Add filters** if you want to add any conditions to the flow.

    4.  Open the **Advanced Options** panel to view additional conditions you can apply to the flow.

    5.  To close the panel, select **Advanced Options**.

    6.  Select **Done**.

6.  In the ACTIONS section of the screen, configure the following fields to create a Classification Prediction action.

    1.  **Action** tab: Select **Action** &gt; **Predictive Intelligence** &gt; **Classification Prediction**.

        \[Omitted image "use-predictive-intelligence-flow-designer-ml-actions7Y.png"\] Alt text: In Actions section of the example, the search result for Predictive Intelligence is highlighted. Under that installed spoke is a list of ML model types with Classification Prediction highlighted.

        Select the information icon \(\[Omitted image "info-icon.png"\]\) to see the description of a Classification Prediction.

    2.  **Solution \[ML Solution\]**: Select **ml\_incident\_categorization**.

    3.  **Top N**: Enter `3` for the example scenario.

        When you enter a number, such as 3, the system uses the top three ML predictions that have the highest prediction confidence score. If you don't enter anything, the system sets the default value to 1.

    4.  **Input Record**: Drag and drop your **Trigger → Incident Record** data pill into the Input Record field.

        \[Omitted image "use-predict-intel-flow-designer-ml-actions8.png"\] Alt text: An image showing how to drag and drop the trigger record pill into the Input Record field.

        The Action, Solution Name, Top N, and Input Record values provide a base for the Category prediction.

        **Note:** The data pill you drop into this record must also be a record. For example, don't try to drop a table pill or a date/time pill into the Input Record field.

    5.  Select **Done**.

        **Result**: The Classification Prediction action is completed in the flow and its data pills appear in the Data section of the screen.

        \[Omitted image "use-predict-intel-flow-designer-ml-actions9.png"\] Alt text: An image showing the completed Classification Prediction action

7.  In the ACTIONS section of the screen, use the following steps to create actions and flow logic for the incident's Prediction Results.

    **Note:** Although you can use a loop to iterate through every prediction result, the scenario shown in this documentation uses a relatively small number of actions. For more advanced flow configurations, see the [Flow Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/flow-designer.md).

    1.  **For each item in** **list of items**: Drag and drop the **Prediction Results** data pill into the **Items** field.

        \[Omitted image "use-predict-intel-flow-designer-ml-actions10.png"\] Alt text: An image showing how to drag and drop the Prediction Results data pill into the Classification Prediction action

        **Note:**

        In order to access the list of items in the Regression Prediction action, you don't need the **For Each Item in** flow logic.

        \(The regression framework is deprecated in the Australia release. You can continue to use existing regression solutions but you can't create new ones.\)

    2.  Select **Done**.

        **Result**: The Prediction Results action is started in the flow and its data pills appear in the Data section of the screen.

8.  In the ACTIONS section of the screen, select **Action** &gt; **Predictive Intelligence** &gt; **PI Confidence Check**.

    The PI Confidence Check is a tool you can use to compare values in a flow. In this use case, it compares prediction result values, and the output from the check is either True or False.
