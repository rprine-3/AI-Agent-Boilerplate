# Remove others label

Reduce noise in your classification model and enhance predictive accuracy by removing records with the label "others" from training data. These are records with a distribution frequency of under one percent.

## Before you begin

Role required: ml\_admin or admin

## About this task

When this option is set to true, records under 1% of total data distribution are excluded from training. These records are labeled "others" in the interface. The 1% threshold can't be modified.

You can add this option in the solution definition form by using the following procedure. Alternatively, you can use a script to add this option.

To add this option using a script:

```
config.removeOthersLabel(true);
```

In JSON format:

```
{
    "remove_others_label": true
    }
```

## Procedure

1.  To add this option in the solution definition form, navigate to **All** &gt; **Predictive Intelligence** &gt; **Classification** &gt; **Solution Definitions**.

2.  Open an existing classification solution or create a new one.

3.  Select the **Advanced Solution Settings** tab in the **Related Links** section of the form.

4.  Select **New** to open the **Advanced Solution Setting** \(ml\_advanced\_solution\_settings\) form.

5.  In the **Solution Parameters** field, search for `Remove others label`, then select **Submit** to save your update.

## Result

The setting appears as a row on the **Advanced Solution Setting** tab on your solution's form.

## What to do next

Retrain your solution.
