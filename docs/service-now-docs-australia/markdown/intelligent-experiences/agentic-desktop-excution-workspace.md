# AI Desktop Actions Execution workspace

Execution workspace enables you to test, run, and monitor your desktop actions. It enables you to observe how your automations interact with desktop applications, including handling situations where human input is needed.

**Important:** Access to the Design workspace and Execution workspace depends on the user’s role.

-   When users with the AI Agent Admin \(sn\_aia.admin\) role sign in from their desktop, they can access the Home page and Design workspace to create desktop actions. When they test a desktop action, the Execution workspace launches automatically.
-   When users with the ServiceNow Otto panel user \(now\_assist\_panel\_user\) role trigger an automation from the ServiceNow Otto panel, the Execution workspace launches automatically to run the desktop action.

You don’t open the Execution workspace directly. It launches automatically when you test or run a desktop action.

This session acts as a virtual environment where the automations run in isolation. While desktop actions run in the Execution workspace, you can continue working on other desktop tasks.

**Note:**

To avoid conflicts, don't run the AI Desktop Actions Execution workspace and RPA Attended Desktop mode at the same time.

## Execution workspace features

Execution workspace offers the following features:

-   **Desktop-in-Desktop \(DiD\) mode**

    A virtual environment where your automation executes. You can monitor the execution of your desktop actions and how they interact with desktop applications.

-   **Step in/Step out**

    You can manually take control to provide an input by selecting **Step in**. Once done, you can leave the control by selecting **Step out**.

    **Note:** If your automation requires manual inputs, such as entering an OTP or CAPTCHA, you must provide instructions the AI Agent to wait for user input during execution. Otherwise, the automation cannot proceed.

-   **Single execution**

    The system supports one automation execution at a time within the workspace.

-   **Smart sizing**

    Smart Sizing enables your desktop sessions automatically adapt to your display. This ensures each captured desktop session is fully visible, readable, and usable, regardless of the device resolution and scaling.

    **Fit to window**: Automatically scales the desktop session to fit within the Execution workspace while keeping it fully visible and readable.

    **Original resolution**: Displays the desktop session at its original resolution. Scroll bars appear if the desktop session is larger than the Execution workspace.


## Execution statuses

Execution workspace shows the following statuses throughout the execution process.
