# Analyze potential impact AI agent

This agent analyzes the potential business and operational impact of a proposed change by identifying affected servers and services. The agent reviews the change request, performs impact analysis, and documents findings in work notes to support informed decision-making and effective mitigation strategies.

## Workflow

The agent analyzes a change request to identify and document the potential impact on services and servers.

1.  Validate that all prerequisites for the impact analysis are met before proceeding.
2.  Extract the affected server IDs from the change request.
3.  Identify which services are potentially impacted by mapping affected servers to suggested services.
4.  Retrieve a combined view of impacted servers and suggested services.
5.  Perform a full impact analysis for each suggested service, including cascading effects.
6.  Compile the analysis results and update the change request work notes with a consolidated summary.

When enabled, third-party AI agents can use this agent. This value is off \(false\) by default. This setting is defined in the AI Agent configs \[sn\_aia\_agent\_config\] table on the External discoverable field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow AI specialists to access this AI agent

</td><td>

When enabled, AI specialists can use this agent. This value is off \(false\) by default. When set to true, more configuration options for tools become available so that an AI specialist can map inputs and response templates to tool outputs. This setting is defined in the AI Agent configs \[sn\_aia\_agent\_config\] table on the Specialist enabled field.
