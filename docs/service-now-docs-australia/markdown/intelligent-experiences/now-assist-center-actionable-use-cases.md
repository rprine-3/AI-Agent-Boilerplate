# Activating actionable use cases from AI Admin Center

Actionable use cases are quick-start scenarios that help you rapidly adopt AI capabilities on your instance.

## Overview of actionable use cases

Actionable use cases are represented as cards in the first section of the home page. Each card shows a supported and ready-to-activate AI solution for your instance, such as activating an AI skill for ITSM or configuring a safety setting through AI Guardian.

Actionable use cases use generative AI to tailor the solution and guide setup. The system analyzes your instance profile, organizational context, license entitlements, installed products, and current AI enablement state to determine which use case cards to display and in which order. Only cards for products that you're entitled to use appear on the home page.

-   Case summarization for CSM
-   Chat summarization for CSM
-   KB generation for CSM
-   Resolution notes generation for CSM
-   Chat summarization for ITSM
-   Incident summarization for ITSM
-   KB generation for ITSM
-   Resolution notes generation for ITSM

## How actionable use cases work

When you navigate to AI Admin Center, the home page displays the use cases most relevant to you. For each card:

-   Select **Activate** to start a guided setup conversation in the ServiceNow Otto panel. The panel describes the solution, confirms the current state, and asks you to confirm before making any change.

    **Important:** ServiceNow Otto panel must be enabled to activate the use cases. Actionable use cases work with the ServiceNow Otto panel to guide you through the setup in a chat conversation. For more information, see [Enable the ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-center-enable-now-assist-panel.md).

-   Select **Dismiss** to permanently remove a card.

    **Warning:** Dismissed cards don't reappear in future sessions.


After you successfully activate a solution, the card disappears from the home page and a confirmation message appears at the top of the workspace. The activated solution appears in the Recently activated AI section of the home page, where you can monitor its performance.
