# Fetch end points in Now Assist Conversational Help skills

The Now Assist Conversational Help skills architecture solves latency by fetching answers hosted at the nearest location, which is best suited to the user.

## Fetching solutions hosted on multiple geographical location

The possible solutions to users queries posted on Now Assist Conversational Help skills are hosted on three main locations: Japan, EMEA and the US.

For optimal performance, the central instance should be situated in the same geographic area as the user's instance. To achieve this alignment, we utilize DISH service, a tool within the user's instance, that helps identify the correct endpoint. The Now Assist Conversational Help skills uses the Mimir lookup service feature, inside the different data centers.

The DISH service communicates with the Mimir lookup table to determine the end points matching the user's location. Once we obtain this endpoint, it gets securely stored in the sys-service table within the customer instance. Moving forward, all the users' queries are routed through the specific endpoint, ensuring consistency and reliability. The Get Help skill uses the endpoint present in the sys-property `com.snc.get_help.endpoint`.

**Note:** The Now Assist Conversational Help skill version is stored in sn\_ads\_now\_help.com.snc\_now\_help\_skill.version, ensuring backward compatibility within the conversational shared services.
