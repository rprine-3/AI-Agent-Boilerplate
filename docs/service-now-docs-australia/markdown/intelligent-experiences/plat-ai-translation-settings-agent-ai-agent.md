# Translation settings AI agent

This AI agent handles translation settings and status inquiries for AI multilingual services. Users may refer to native translation as "NT" and Dynamic Translation as "DT."

## Workflow

The agent retrieves current native translation and Dynamic Translation states, enables or disables native translation, and enables or disables Dynamic Translation. It does not handle language configuration per provider. That is managed by the language configuration AI agent.

1.  Determine the requested action:
    -   View overall translation status
    -   View native translation status only
    -   View Dynamic Translation status only
    -   Enable or disable native translation
    -   Enable or disable Dynamic Translation
2.  If the user wants to view status, display the translation status.
3.  If the user wants to enable or disable translation, get the current state. Prompt the user for confirmation.
4.  Execute the requested change.
