# Test a voice assistant from Assistant Designer

Test your voice assistant and the AI voice agents assigned to it by making browser-based voice calls and viewing turn-by-turn analysis directly from Assistant Designer.

## Before you begin

The following are required to access the voice testing experience:

-   Conversational Studio v7 or later
-   Zurich Patch 7 or later
-   Microphone enabled on your device
-   ServiceNow Otto for Virtual Agent version 20 or later

Roles required: sn\_aia.admin and sn\_voice\_aia.admin

## About this task

Use voice testing to evaluate how your voice assistant handles real conversations before deploying it.

-   Voice mode: Initiate a call, speak to the assistant using your microphone. The assistant responds with synthesized speech.
-   Chat mode: Type messages in a chat interface. This mode follows the same testing experience as chat assistants.

As the conversation progresses, the Analysis tab shows a turn-by-turn breakdown including timestamps, the agent or tool invoked for each utterance, tool execution latency, and tool status, helping you identify gaps and fine-tune behavior.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assistant Designer** &gt; **Assistants** tab and select **Test** for the voice assistant you wish to test.

    **Note:** You can test a voice assistant without activating it first. The **Test** button is disabled until at least one AI voice agent is added to the assistant. Hover over the button to see the reason it is disabled.

    The voice testing interface opens in a new window. The window displays:

    -   Left panel: A drop down for testing mode with Voice and Chat options. Live transcription of the conversation along with the assistant greeting and input controls.
    -   Right panel: Assistant summary showing the assistant name, primary language and persona, secondary language and persona \(if configured\), and the Analysis tab.

2.  Test your voice assistant.

    1.  In voice mode, select **Start call** \(green phone button\) to begin voice-based testing.

        Your browser may prompt you to allow microphone access. Click **Allow** to proceed.

        The call connects using WebRTC \(Web Real-Time Communication\). A voice waveform animation indicates the connection is active.

    2.  Speak to the assistant using your microphone.

        The assistant processes your speech and responds with synthesized voice output. The conversation transcript appears in the left panel.

    3.  Continue the conversation to test different scenarios and intents.

        If the voice assistant is configured with multiple languages, test in each secondary language to verify that the assistant responds correctly and uses the expected voice persona for that language.

    4.  When finished, select **End call** \(red phone button\) to disconnect.

    1.  In chat mode, type your message in the **Reply** field at the bottom of the conversation panel.

        Text-based testing follows the same experience as testing chat assistants. You can view the chat transcription, AI agents invoked and tools executed.

    2.  Select the send button to submit your message.

        The assistant processes your text input and responds in the conversation panel.

    3.  Continue the conversation to test different scenarios and intents.

3.  Select the **Analysis** tab in the right panel to view real-time analysis.

    The Analysis tab shows a turn-by-turn breakdown of the conversation. For each user utterance, the following details are displayed where applicable:

    -   **Timestamp** — the date and time of the utterance.
    -   **Agent name** — the name of the AI voice agent invoked, or voice assistant if no agent was invoked.
    -   **Response latency** — the time taken to generate the bot's response for that turn, including any tool calls made during the response.
    -   **Tool name** — the name of the tool invoked, where applicable. Expand a tool name to view:
        -   **Tool inputs**
        -   **Tool execution latency**
        -   **Tool status** \(success or failure\)
        -   **Tool response**
    The Analysis tab displays a turn-by-turn breakdown of AI voice agents invoked, tools executed, and tool execution latency for the conversation.

4.  Select **Restart** to start a new voice conversation or close the browser window to exit testing.

    Selecting **Restart** clears the current conversation and resets the testing session.


## Result

You have tested your voice assistant using the voice testing interface. Use the analysis results to identify issues with agent routing, tool execution, or voice assistant performance, and refine your assistant configuration as needed.
