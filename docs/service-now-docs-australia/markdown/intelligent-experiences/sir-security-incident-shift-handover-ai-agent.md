# Security incident shift handover AI agent

This Operational Technology Security Incident Response agent adds a security incident to a shift handover report, walking the user through each section for review.

## Workflow

1.  Get a valid security incident number from the user if one is not provided.
2.  Run the pre-processor to find active shift handover records for the user. If none exist, inform the user and end.
3.  If multiple shift handover records exist, ask the user to select one.
4.  Validate the selected handover record and generate its content. If validation fails, ask for a valid record number.
5.  If the security incident is already in the report, inform the user and get confirmation before adding it again.
6.  Walk through each section of the report. For each section, show the content, collect approval or revisions, and save to the database before moving to the next section.
7.  After all sections are processed, show a summary of saved and skipped sections.
