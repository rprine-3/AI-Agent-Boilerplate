# Define ServiceNow AI Lens behavior with Lens actions

As a Lens admin, you can create Lens actions in ServiceNow AI Lens to customize Lens behavior by providing default instructions, configuring context, and more.

Use Lens actions to define default instructions, trigger options, custom context, and post processing instructions for the Lens response. With Lens actions, you can achieve the following goals:

-   Trigger ServiceNow AI Lens from a desktop, ServiceNow instance, or Virtual Agent \(from a mobile device or a portal\)
-   Auto-fill a form on the ServiceNow instance
-   View the gathered insights in an editable preview
-   Trigger flows, subflows, or actions after Lens execution
-   Invoke AI agents
-   Run ServiceNow AI Lens as a back-end service
-   Auto-map the column headers of an Excel sheet with the columns of a ServiceNow table, and then insert the Excel sheet data into the ServiceNow table.

Whenever ServiceNow AI Lens is launched from an instance, it checks if any active Lens action is available for the table. If available, it uses the logic defined in Lens action during execution. The Lens action can only be used by the users or groups or roles that are assigned to the Lens Actions record.

Refer to the following examples to understand the different use cases of setting up the Lens actions.

-   [Example: Scan documents to auto-fill the Insurance Request form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/servicenow-lens/servicenow-lens-actions.md)
-   [Example: Extract structured data from vendor agreements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/servicenow-lens/servicenow-lens-actions.md)
-   [Example: Auto-fill user records on a user table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/servicenow-lens/servicenow-lens-actions.md)
-   [Auto-map Excel sheet column headers with ServiceNow table columns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/servicenow-lens/servicenow-lens-actions.md)

</table>When ServiceNow AI Lens is triggered from the instance or desktop to auto-fill a form, it uses an active Lens action associated with the target table.

For example, if a user selects **Create with Lens** from Incident table list, ServiceNow AI Lens checks for an active Lens action record for the Incident table where **Trigger From** is set to Instance and **Trigger For** is set to Form. If a matching action record exists, Lens executes in the context of that action.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ServiceNow AI Lens** &gt; **Lens Actions**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Enter a name and description for the Lens action in the Name and Description fields respectively.

4.  In the **Trigger From** field, select one of the following options.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Desktop**|Option to specify that this action must be used when ServiceNow AI Lens is triggered from the ServiceNow AI Lens desktop app.|
    |**Instance**|Option to specify that this action must be used when ServiceNow AI Lens is triggered from a ServiceNow instance.|

5.  To save the changes, right-click the form header and select **Save**.

6.  Set up the Lens action by filling the fields in the Lens Actions form, under the Customize heading.

## Example: Auto-fill user records on a user table

Enable service agents to create user records by extracting specific information from identity documents using ServiceNow AI Lens, directly from the ServiceNow instance.

### Before you begin

Role required: lens\_admin

### About this task

A service agent must onboard multiple users by scanning their official ID cards \(for example, government-issued ID\). Instead of manually entering each user's details, the agents can trigger ServiceNow AI Lens from the instance to automate data extraction and auto-fill specific fields defined in the Lens action record.

You can define in the Lens action that ServiceNow AI Lens must be triggered from the instance to create user records and provide default directions.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ServiceNow AI Lens** &gt; **Lens Actions**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter `Auto-fill the user records`.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter `Lens action to auto-create the user records on the ServiceNow instance`.

5.  From the **Trigger From** option, select Instance.

6.  In the form header, right-click and select **Save**.

7.  Confirm that the Form option is selected in the **Trigger For** field.

    The Form option is selected by default.

8.  In the **Table** field, select the User \[sys\_user\] table.

9.  Confirm that Supported Fields is selected in the **Request Context** field.

    The Supported Fields value is selected by default, and it provides context.

10. From the **Fields** field, move the fields to the Selected list.

    `userID, first_name, last_name, title, and date_of_birth`

11. In the **Default Additional Directions** field, enter `User ID must always be in lower case and uses the firstname.lastname format. Enter Date of birth in the dd-mm-yyyy format.`

12. Add users or groups who can use this Lens action.

    1.  In the Assigned Users and Groups related list, select **New**.

    2.  Select the required users or group of users that have the lens\_user role.

## Auto-map Excel sheet column headers with ServiceNow table columns

Use ServiceNow AI Lens to map the column headers of an Excel sheet that you specify with ServiceNow® table columns and then insert the Excel sheet data into the table.

### Before you begin

Role required: lens\_user

Ensure that the Lens action for this purpose is already defined. To view the steps to define a Lens action, see [Define a Lens action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/servicenow-lens/servicenow-lens-actions.md). Ensure that the values in the Lens action form are exactly as specified in the following table.

|Field|Option you must select|
|-----|----------------------|
|Trigger From|Desktop|
|Trigger For|Excel Mapping|
|Table|Name of the table with which the Lens action will auto-map the Excel sheet column headers.|
|Request context|Supported Fields|
|Fields|Columns of the table|

**Tip:** A preconfigured Lens action that is designed to auto-map Excel sheet column headers with table columns is available by default on your instance. The name of the Lens action is `Import Excel Sheet data to custom table`. To use the Lens action, create a copy of this Lens action, and customize to create your own Lens action for this purpose.

### Procedure

1.  From your system, launch the ServiceNow AI Lens desktop application.

2.  On the login page, in the **Instance URL** field, enter the ServiceNow instance URL.

    For example, `https://<instance name>.service-now.com`.

3.  Select **Proceed**.

4.  Log in to your ServiceNow account by entering your username and password.

5.  On the onboarding journey widget, complete the onboarding and select **Got it**.

    \[Omitted image "onboarding-widget-lens.png"\] Alt text: Onboarding journey widget with three pages to show you the highlights of the application.
