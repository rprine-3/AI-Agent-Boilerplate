## About this task

ServiceNow AI Lens isn’t a standalone store application that you can install directly. To enable ServiceNow AI Lens on your instance, you must install other generative AI applications, such as ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) or ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\).

-   Review the [ServiceNow AI Lens](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/2527a8af90db9e10f877653916085448/1.0.0) application listing in ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   Refer to the [document](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/sn-assist-overview.pdf) to see the prebuilt skills that exist and are currently available for purchase in AI packages and to review the number of assists consumed.
-   Perform these steps in your ServiceNow instance.

By enabling the ServiceNow AI Lens application \(sn\_ai\_lens\), you can view the ServiceNow AI Lens and download modules in your ServiceNow instance.

The following items are installed with ServiceNow AI Lens:

-   Roles
-   Tables
