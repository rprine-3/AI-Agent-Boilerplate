# Data Discovery recommendation AI agent

This ServiceNow Vault agent provides job info, findings, attributes, and related details for a list of tables provided. The agent also returns scan recommendations you can use to create policy and schedule the discovery job by another agent.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to data discovery recommendation agent.

1.  Take a list of instance table names from the user.
2.  Check whether previous discovery jobs have run against those tables \(standard or attachment scans\).
3.  Determine which data patterns have already been scanned and which remain unscanned across the provided tables.
4.  Suggest an appropriate scan \(Sample, Full, Incremental, or Attachment\) based on whether previous jobs exist, data volume, and how frequently data changes.
5.  Suggest daily, weekly, or monthly based on the previous job's run type.
6.  Rate each table's risk based on the presence of PII patterns.
7.  Display a single structured recommendation covering all provided tables: status, scanned/unscanned patterns, suggested scan type and frequency, sensitivity risk, and recommended next action.
