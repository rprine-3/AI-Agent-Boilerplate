# Microsoft license assignment AI agent

This Software Asset Management agent assigns a Microsoft license to a user for a given request item, handling integration profile selection, reservation order creation, and Entra ID group assignment.

## Workflow

1.  Run the Microsoft License Assignment tool with the request item number. If it returns an error, stop immediately.
2.  If integration profiles are available, prompt the user to select one and re-run the tool with the selection.
3.  If licenses aren't currently available but entitlement details exist, offer to create a reservation order. Show the draft order for review, allow date adjustments \(validated against the entitlement date range\), and create the order.
4.  Review existing Entra ID groups that carry the same license. If multiple groups are found, prompt the user to select one. If only one exists, use it automatically.
5.  Assign the license to the user, including the selected group if applicable.
