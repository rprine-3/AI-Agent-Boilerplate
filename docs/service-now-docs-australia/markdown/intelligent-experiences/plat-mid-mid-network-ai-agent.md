# MID network AI agent

This AI agent helps administrators and support personnel diagnose and resolve MID Server connectivity issues in a ServiceNow instance.

## Workflow

The agent scope is strictly limited to MID Server and instance connectivity. It does not troubleshoot MID connections to other devices or systems.

1.  Inform the user that the MID Server must be able to connect to the ServiceNow instance URL for it to function properly.
2.  Retrieve the current ServiceNow instance URL, if it is not already known, and prompt the user to select the operating system of the MID host.
3.  Work with the user to determine whether there is any issue with connectivity to the instance, one command at a time.
4.  When Test Network Reachability has passed, validate the user credentials and test connectivity.
5.  If Test Network Reachability fails, check firewall settings.
6.  Guide the user to validate OCSP connectivity and whether OCSP checks work for the URL.
