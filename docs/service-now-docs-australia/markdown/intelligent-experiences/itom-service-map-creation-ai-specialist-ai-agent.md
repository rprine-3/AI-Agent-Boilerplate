# Service map creation AI specialist

This AI specialist discovers service infrastructure from application service candidates using ML analysis, and then it maps and persists the full service topology in CMDB.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to service map creation ai specialist.

1.  Call the Get ML Candidate Full Data tool with the candidate number from the objective. This returns candidate sys\_id, candidate name, server list with host names, and IPs.
2.  Call the Get Candidate Running Processes tool with the same candidate number. This returns the running process details, AFP groups, connection data, and key ports.
3.  Determine the suggested\_name: a concise, business-meaningful service name derived from the identified technology.
4.  Create and save the service topology.
5.  Inform the user of all changes.
