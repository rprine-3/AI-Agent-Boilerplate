# Create an MCP app

Build, register, and display user interfaces along with your tool's logic with MCP apps. This allows you to implement and manage interactive interfaces for your tools that can be displayed by MCP clients.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_mcp\_server.tools\_admin \(for configuration\)

## About this task

Create an MCP app and enable MCP tools to deliver interactive user interfaces to hosts. It defines how tools declare UI resources, that hosts render securely in iframes, and how the two communicate.

Create apps as a pre-step before MCP tools creations, so that you can choose one of the created apps while configuring the tool.

**Note:** The minimum version required is: Zurich patch 11 and Australia patch 4.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MCP Server Console**.

2.  From the Configuration tab, select **Apps**.

3.  View the tools created from various categories, and their associated attributes.

4.  Select **Create app**.

## What to do next

Create an MCP tool and add one of these apps, created to render an interactive user experience displayed by the MCP client.
