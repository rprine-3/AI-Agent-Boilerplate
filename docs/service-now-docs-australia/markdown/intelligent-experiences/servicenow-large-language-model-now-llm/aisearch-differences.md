# Discrepancies when using different AI search tools

Different AI search tools may return different answers for the same or similar searches. This difference in results is expected. It occurs because each large language model \(LLM\) uses a different approach to find results and generate answers that match your search.

## Overview of how LLMs create responses

Large Language Models don’t retrieve answers from a single source. Instead, they generate responses by predicting the next most likely word, one at a time, based on patterns they’ve learned from the data they were trained on.

Because of that, several factors can make the answers vary each time. The factors include:

-   Probability
-   Multiple good answers
-   Context sensitivity
-   LLM variation

Answer generation involves probability, context, and variation. Therefore, responses to the same question can differ slightly each time it is asked, and from provider to provider.
