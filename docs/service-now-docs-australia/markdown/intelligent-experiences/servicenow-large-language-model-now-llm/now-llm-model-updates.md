# Model provider updates

Review these updates to learn which model providers and models are available for your skills and agents. Review the model cards for information about how each model is intended to be used.

## Model cards

Large language models \(LLMs\) are complex machine-learning models that are trained on large datasets like websites and documentation to perform language-related tasks. Examples include text generation for case summaries and resolution notes.

Model cards explain the specific model's context, intended use, training data, limitations, and other important information.

These model cards are for skills that use the Now LLM Service. There are certain skills, such as Now Assist Multi-Turn Catalog Ordering, that use Azure OpenAI instead. To see what LLM a skill is using, you can check the skill list in the AI Admin Hub console and review the LLM service column.

## September 2026

The September release adds restricted models from AWS Anthropic. Restricted models support specific features only. You can't select them for your skills and agents.

This release doesn't add any general purpose models. The models that you can select in the AI Admin Hub console are unchanged.

-   Claude Sonnet 5 and Claude Fable 5 support the Build Agent.

-   Restricted replaces limited: The card now uses **Restricted** instead of **Limited** to identify models that you can't configure. Claude Opus 4.6 and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite use the new term. Their supported features haven't changed.


## July 2026

The Now LLM Service model strategy has moved toward integrated model provider flexibility. Store application updates have started shipping, and the default model for base system skills and agents is changing from the Now LLM Service to an integrated third-party model provider. If you haven't changed the default model for a skill, that skill uptakes the new default.

-   Integrated third-party model providers: The integrated third-party model providers are Google Gemini, AWS Claude, and Azure OpenAI.

-   New general purpose models: You can select these models for your skills and agents in the AI Admin Hub console. Model availability varies by your instance, your configuration, and your geographic region.

    -   Azure OpenAI: GPT-5.1, GPT-5.4 Mini, and GPT-5.1 Mini
    -   Google Gemini: Gemini 3.5 Flash
-   The Now LLM Service is still supported: The change to the default model provider doesn't remove access to the Now LLM Service. You can still select it for your skills and agents if you require a ServiceNow hosted model.

-   Existing selections preserved: If you have already selected a model provider, that configuration is preserved. The update doesn't overwrite an explicit selection.

-   Changing your model provider: To select a model provider other than the default, review the providers that are allowed for your instance in AI Control Tower. Navigate to **Configurations** &gt; **Controls** &gt; **AI model providers**, and then make your changes in the ServiceNow Otto Admin Center by navigating to **Settings** &gt; **Manage AI Models** &gt; **Manage Model Providers**.

-   Explicit model names required: Generic model references such as `cloud_small` and `cloud_large` are no longer supported as of December 2026, when the Now LLM Service transitions to integrated third-party model providers.


## June 2026

The June release includes updates to third-party model defaults. It also contains a change to the default reasoning effort setting for GPT-5 Mini, and the retirement of the Now LLM long-term support \(LTS\) SKU.

-   Third-party default model version update: Teams that did not update their third-party default model versions to the latest available versions in the May release must do so in the June release. GAIC 13.1.2 is the required version for this update.

-   GPT-5 Mini: `reasoning_effort` default change: The default `reasoning_effort` setting for GPT-5 Mini has changed from `none` to `minimal`. This change is included in GAIC Snapshot 14.0.0, which is compatible with Now Assist for Platform 12.0.0.

    Teams using GPT-5 Mini should run regression and functional testing to confirm that the new default works as expected. If you explicitly set `reasoning_effort` in your generative AI config additional properties, smoke test to verify there are no unexpected effects. If you have `reasoning_effort: none` set in additional properties, update the value to `minimal` and run regression and functional testing.

-   Claude Sonnet 4.0 retirement: Claude Sonnet 4.0 references are being redirected on the backend. No team action is required.

    -   `claude_large` / Claude 4.0 Sonnet redirects to Claude 4.5 Sonnet
    -   `claude_small` / Claude 4.0 Sonnet redirects to Claude 4.5 Sonnet
-   Now LLM LTS SKU retired: ServiceNow no longer offers the LTS model SKU. There are no testing requirements or expectations for teams related to this retirement.
