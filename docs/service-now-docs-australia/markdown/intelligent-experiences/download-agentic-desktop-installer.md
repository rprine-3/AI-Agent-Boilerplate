# Download AI Desktop Actions installer for defined desktop actions

Download the AI Desktop Actions installer so that you can install AI Desktop Actions on your Windows machine for designing and running defined desktop actions.

## Before you begin

-   Perform this task in the ServiceNow instance.
-   A .NET 9.0 runtime v9.0.10 and .NET 9 Desktop Runtime v9.0.10 is installed.
-   Confirm that you install the AI Desktop Actions installer using Windows administrator privileges.
-   Confirm that the Desktop-in-Desktop settings are configured correctly.
-   Add the end users who interact with the Execution workspace of AI Desktop Actions to the Remote Desktop Users group on the target machine and provide Remote Desktop access permissions for seamless automation execution.

    If your organization uses Group Policy, add the end users to a Microsoft Active Directory group that is permitted to use Remote Desktop through Group Policy on each target machine where desktop actions run.

    -   Local changes to the Remote Desktop Users group are temporary unless they align with Microsoft Active Directory entitlements.
    -   If the user is not entitled, Group Policy refresh automatically removes them from the group.

Role required: Windows administrator

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Desktop Actions** &gt; **Downloads**.

2.  In the AI Desktop Actions Downloads page, do any of the following actions to download the required application for Windows:

    -   Select the download icon \(\[Omitted image "rpa-hub-download-icon.png"\] Alt text:\).
    -   Select the copy link \(\[Omitted image "rpa-hub-copyurl-icon.png"\] Alt text:\). In a browser, right-click and select the **paste and go** option.

    The system might prompt you to save or open the file.

    **Note:** Depending on your browser setting, the browser might automatically save the file to your Downloads folder.

3.  Execute the application installation file \(.msi file\).

4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to install the application.

    AI Desktop Actions is installed in a per-machine folder by default, making it available to all users. You can change the folder location during setup.

5.  Keep the option **Enable Remote Desktop access for the logged-in user** selected to automatically add the logged-in user to the Remote Desktop Users group.

6.  If not already installed, download and install the .Net Desktop Runtime framework.

    The installer validates if required .NET Desktop Runtime is installed or not on the user machine. If not installed, the installer provides a link to instructions for downloading and installing the same. For more information, see [Download and install .Net Desktop Runtime for AI Desktop Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-dot-network-framework-ad.md).

1.  Navigate to the **SessionRegistry** folder of the AI Desktop Actions installation directory.
2.  Right-click **SN.AGENTICDESKTOP.SESSION.REGISTER.exe** and select **Run as administrator**.
3.  Restart your system.
