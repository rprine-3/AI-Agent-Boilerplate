# Billing account information collector AI agent

This Telecommunications, Media, and Technology \(TMT\) agent retrieves billing case and account details and communicates them to the user in a structured format.

## Workflow

1.  Fetch the billing inquiry case information using the case number already provided by the user.
2.  Pull the case account number and account name from the case details, then present them to the user.
3.  Fetch the billing account details using the case account information. If the billing account can't be found, ask the user to correct the case account number and retry.
4.  Show the billing account details to the user.
