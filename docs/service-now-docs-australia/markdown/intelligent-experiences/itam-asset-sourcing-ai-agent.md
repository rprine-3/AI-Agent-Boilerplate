# Asset sourcing AI agent

This AI agent helps source a requested item by generating and executing sourcing plans through consumption, transfer, and purchase. The agent creates plans autonomously or with user guidance, coordinates with external agents for transfer and purchase orders, and validates sourcing status throughout the process.

## Workflow

The agent sources a requested item by executing three independent flows in sequence: auto source, guided source, and user input source.

1.  Verify that a requested item number is provided and retrieve the item details, including quantity and model name.
2.  Attempt to source the item automatically using the auto source plan flow, consuming, transferring, or purchasing assets as determined by the generated plan.
3.  If the item is not fully sourced, generate a guided source plan, present it to the user for confirmation, and execute the approved plan steps.
4.  If the item still requires sourcing, generate a user input source plan and prompt the user to confirm transfer and purchase actions as needed.
5.  Validate the sourcing status after each phase and notify the user when all requested quantity has been sourced or if quantity remains outstanding.
