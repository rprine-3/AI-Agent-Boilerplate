# Email to new task creation AI agent

This agent creates a new task from an email and then processes it. This agent never sends emails.

## Workflow

1.  Extract email details: Parse the email to get subject, sender, body, and key details.
2.  Retrieve configurations using the email action and information AI agent to determine the table to create the new record in and whether an interaction needs to be created.
3.  Get details of the new task to be created \(a new task, not a child task\).
4.  Use the record management AI agent to create a record in the table that is specified in the configurations, using the email information returned in step 1.
5.  Post-process the newly created task using the email action and information AI agent and end the workflow.
