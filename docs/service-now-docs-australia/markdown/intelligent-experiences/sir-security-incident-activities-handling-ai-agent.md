# Security incident activities handling AI agent

This Operational Technology Security Incident Response agent manages security incident core activities, ensuring efficient and effective handling of incidents, problems, change requests, and security incident response tasks. It is intended for use by security incident management teams.

## Workflow

1.  Generate a description for an incident, change request, problem, or response task. Prompts user to review and approve the content before creation. If a response task is created, collect the outcome from the user and log it.
2.  Confirm recipient addresses, generate the subject and body, and present for user review and approval before sending.
3.  Update the state as requested. No further action is taken.
