# AI Search readiness for ServiceNow Otto on the ServiceNow AI Platform

ServiceNow Otto for AI Search is built directly on the robust foundation of ServiceNow® AI Search. AI Search provides the underlying infrastructure that enables ServiceNow Otto to retrieve and rank enterprise content—such as knowledge articles, records, and documentation—based on relevance and access permissions.

Because AI Search adheres to ServiceNow security models, responses are always grounded in content the user is authorized to access. Additionally, AI Search admin tools give you control over relevancy tuning, allowing you to refine how content is surfaced and ensure that ServiceNow Otto delivers the most useful and trustworthy results.

Every AI-generated answer includes citations and references, allowing users to see exactly where the information came from. This not only boosts confidence in the accuracy of responses, but also reduces the risk of hallucination by grounding outputs in your organization’s actual content.

To maximize its impact, ServiceNow Otto for AI Search should be activated before ServiceNow Otto is more broadly implemented. Once enabled, it powers actionable Q&amp;A through Genius Results cards in global search, Service Portal, Employee Center, and Virtual Agent.

## High-level checklist

-   **1. Verify AI Search status**

    Make sure AI Search is active on your instance. To check status, navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Status**. If AI Search is not active, select the **Request AI Search** button to initiate activation.

    -   [Enable AI Search in supported ServiceNow AI Platform® applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/explore-now-platform-apps-ais.md)
-   **2. Review search sources**

    Configure search sources to determine what data will be searched by user queries.

    See:

    -   [Control access to searchable content using search sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/explore-search-sources-ais.md)
    -   [Create a search source for AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-search-source-ais.md)
-   **3. Configure search sources for external content**

    Allows ServiceNow Otto Q&amp;A search to include external content.

    See:

    -   [Indexing and searching external content in AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/external-content-ais.md)

    -   [Configuring External Content Connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/configuring-ext-cont-connectors.md)
-   **4. Enable AI Search on one or more portals**

    Display AI Search results in the portals on your instance.

    See:

    -   [Search application configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/defining-search-app-cfgs-ais.md)
    -   [Enabling and configuring AI Search in ServiceNow AI Platform® applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/enable-configure-apps-ais.md)
-   **5. Install ServiceNow Otto for AI Search**

    Install a ServiceNow Otto product in the AI Admin Hub console.

    See: [Install ServiceNow Otto for AI Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/install-now-assist-ais.md)

-   **6. Enable ServiceNow Otto Q&amp;A Genius Results in AI Search portals**

    Specify the ServiceNow Otto Genius Result types you want to make available in each of your AI Search portals. ServiceNow Otto Multi-Content Response Genius Results use an LLM to generate search and chat responses that synthesize information from knowledge articles, Service Catalog items, and other available content types. Answers are presented in Q&amp;A format.

    See:

    -   [Enable ServiceNow Otto for AI Search Genius Results in AI Search portals and mobile applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/enable-now-assist-gr-ais-apps.md)
    -   [Knowledge base articles Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/now-assist-qna-genius-results.md)
-   **7. Verify AI Search widget customizations**

    Customized AI Search widgets may not correctly show Q&amp;A search results even when configured for ServiceNow Otto, since customizations get skipped during upgrades.

    See: 


The ServiceNow AI Platform® offers a variety of search tools, which may return different answers for the same or similar searches. This disparity in results is expected. For more information, see [Search result disparities between AI Search and ServiceNow Otto® search features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/search-disparities-ai-search-now-assist.md).
