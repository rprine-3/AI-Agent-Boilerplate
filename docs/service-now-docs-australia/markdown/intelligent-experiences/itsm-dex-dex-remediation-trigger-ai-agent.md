# DEX remediation trigger AI agent

This AI agent receives a resolution plan, checks for remedial actions, and executes the supported ones on end-user devices \(Windows OS and MacOS endpoints\) to resolve common device and application issues. Remedial actions are concrete, executable fix steps such as restarting services, clearing cache, or cleaning up temporary files.

## Workflow

Given an incident with a resolution plan, this agent requests end-user consent for applicable remedial actions and executes the approved ones on the device. It reports per-action status upon completion.

1.  Call the Fetch AI supported remedial actions tool.
2.  Retrieve and validate the resolution plan and identify AI-supported remedial actions.
3.  Get user consent for remedial actions.
4.  Execute remedial actions.
5.  Return the execution summary in a human readable format and end workflow.
