# AI portfolio overview

Act on the AI governance work that matters most, review the state of your AI portfolio, and track the value your AI assets deliver on the **Home** page in AI Control Tower.

## Key benefits

-   Identify the highest-priority recommendations and lifecycle tasks that need your attention today.
-   Review the size and composition of your AI asset inventory and the split between managed and unmanaged assets.
-   Check the governance posture of your managed AI assets across quality, safety, security, compliance, and residual risk avoidance.
-   Track the total value your managed AI assets deliver and the trend over time.

The **Home** page provides a portfolio-level view of all AI assets across your organization. For a detailed view scoped to a single AI asset, see [Working with AI asset records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/disc-managing-ai-assets.md).

**Note:** If you have the AI Asset Owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role, the **Home** page displays details only for the AI assets that you're assigned to manage.

## Required roles

The AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\] or AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role is required to access the **Home** page in AI Control Tower.

## Accessing the overview

Access an overview of your AI portfolio on the **Home** page in AI Control Tower by navigating to **All** &gt; **AI Control Tower** &gt; **Home**.

## Use cases

-   Act on the recommendations AI Control Tower has surfaced for you from the **Your top recommendations** widget.
    -   Review each recommendation and resolve it using the primary action on the card.
    -   Select **See all Recommendations in Activity Center** to open the full list of recommendations for your portfolio. For more information, see [Recommendations and AI insights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aict-recommendations-ai-insights.md).
-   Check how much work is waiting for you across AI Control Tower from the **Pending work items** widget.
    -   Review the total count of work items assigned to you or created by you, spanning recommendations, lifecycle tasks, and the other work types tracked in Activity Center.
    -   Select the widget to open **Activity Center** and work through the underlying items. For more information, see [Addressing your AI action items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aict-addressing-ai-action-items.md).
-   Review the size and composition of your AI inventory.
    -   If you have the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\] role, you can view the total number of AI assets in the **Inventory** widget. If you have the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role, you can view the total number of assets you own in the **Your inventory** widget.
    -   Break down your inventory by **By type**, **By status**, **By department**, or **By management status**, and identify where your assets are concentrated.
    -   Select the widget to open the **Inventory** page, where you can search, filter, and take action on individual assets.
-   Track unsanctioned AI use across your organization from the **Shadow AI traffic** widget.
    -   Review the number of AI services detected in the last 30 days and the percentage change from the previous period.
    -   Select the arrow icon on the widget to open the **Shadow AI** overview page, where you can review detected AI traffic in more detail. For more information, see [Shadow AI overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/sh-ai-overview.md).
    -   This widget appears only when Shadow AI is activated and configured. See [Configuring Shadow AI in AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/sh-ai-configuring.md).
-   Assess the governance health of your managed AI assets from the **Governance posture summary** widget.
    -   Review the distribution of managed AI assets across five dimensions: **Quality**, **Safety**, **Security**, **Compliance**, and **Residual risk**.
    -   Identify the dimensions where your portfolio has the most assets in the **Low** or **NA** category, and use those findings to prioritize governance work.
    -   If you have the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role, this widget reflects only the assets you own. The **Quality** and **Safety** dimensions remain interactive, but **Security**, **Compliance**, and **Residual risk** are summary-only.
-   Monitor the regulatory risk of your AI assets from the **Regulatory risk classification** widget.
    -   Review the number of AI assets classified as **Unacceptable**, **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** risk.
    -   Focus remediation efforts on assets in the higher-risk tiers, where misclassification or inadequate controls can have the most significant consequences.
    -   If you have the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role, this widget reflects only the assets you own, and does not link out to the full **Regulatory risk classification** page.
-   Track the value your AI assets deliver from the **AI Value** widget.
    -   Check the total return for all managed AI assets and the percentage change over the previous period. If you have the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role, this reflects only the assets you own.
    -   If you have the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\] role, select the widget to open the full Value page, where you can see per-asset contribution and filter the view by time period, team, or AI system.
-   Review your governance workload in the **Lifecycle tasks needing attention** table.
    -   Select **By inventory** to view a list of AI assets with the most pending tasks. Use this view to identify the assets that are consuming the most governance capacity. If you have the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role, this view is scoped to the assets you own.
    -   If you have the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\] role, select **By team** to view a list of tasks for team members. Use this view to identify team members who may be overloaded or falling behind.
-   If you have the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\] role, use the **Get started with AI Control Tower** widget to launch a guided setup experience that helps you configure AI Control Tower.
    -   Track your overall setup progress and see the milestone you're currently working on.
    -   Select **Set up now** to open guided setup, or select **Continue** to pick up where you left off.
