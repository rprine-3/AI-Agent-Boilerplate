# Change template suggestion AI agent \(autonomous\)

This AI agent identifies the most relevant change template and model for new change requests by analyzing request details and comparing them against available templates and historical data.

## Workflow

This autonomous AI agent runs as part of the Create change request agent. The agent analyzes change request details and automatically selects the most appropriate change template and model from your organization's inventory.

1.  Autonomously retrieve the complete inventory of available change templates and models.
2.  Analyze the change request details provided by the parent Create change request agent.
3.  Apply large language model judgment to identify candidate templates based on relevance to the change request.
4.  If a template with sufficient confidence is identified, autonomously select it as the best-fit template and return it to the parent agent.
5.  If no template meets the confidence threshold, autonomously perform semantic search over past change requests created by members of the user's assignment group.
6.  Rank semantic search results by combining two factors: frequency of past use and relevance to the current request, weighting each factor roughly equally.
7.  Return the best-fit template identified through semantic search to the parent agent.
