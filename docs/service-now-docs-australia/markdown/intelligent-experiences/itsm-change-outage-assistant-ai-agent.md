# Change outage assistant AI agent

This AI agent creates outage records for the change request based on the impacted CIs.

## Workflow

1.  Extract the current change request number or ask the user to provide it.
2.  Check if both Configuration Item and Affected CIs are missing from the change request. \(If both are missing, stop execution and notify the user.\)
3.  Check if the change request already has an outage created and display it to the user.
4.  Validate planned start and end dates.
5.  If the user approves, create the outage; otherwise, stop.
6.  Review CIs and impacted services with the user.
7.  Display the final outage link.
