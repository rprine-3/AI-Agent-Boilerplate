# Remediation tasks AI agent

This AI agent identifies the remediation tasks for resolving an issue by referencing the action plan field on the issue record.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to remediation tasks.

1.  Fetch the sn\_grc\_issue sys\_id or number from the memory, or ask for the issue number.
2.  Use the Suggest remediation tasks for the issue tool to generate recommendations.
3.  Ask the user to accept, edit, or dismiss the suggestions.
4.  If the user chooses to edit the suggestions, refine them based on feedback.
5.  If the user accepts the suggestions, create the remediation tasks.
6.  End flow when tasks are complete or the user dismisses suggestions.
