# Create AI system assets

Create AI assets to track and manage the life cycles of your AI systems

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward or sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner

**Note:** Users with the AI asset owner \[sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner\] role can only create AI assets and submit them for life-cycle review. They can't start or complete any life-cycle reviews.

## About this task

An AI system is a software artifact that provides AI and machine learning \(ML\) capabilities to generate outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, and decisions, with varying levels of autonomy. Each AI system can be associated with one or more AI models, which may also be associated with one or more prompts and datasets. These AI models, prompts, and datasets enable the AI system to process data and solve complex problems with little to no human intervention.

When you manually create an asset, the asset defaults to a **Design** state.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Al Control Tower** &gt; **Home** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Assets**.

2.  On the Inventory page, select **Add AI asset**.

    The Add AI asset dialog box opens.

3.  In the dialog box, select **Enter asset details**.

4.  From the list of available asset types, select **AI system**.

    The dialog box closes and you're automatically redirected to the Add AI system asset form.

5.  In the Details section of the form, fill in the fields.

10. Select **Submit for review**.

    The Asset record page opens and your asset is in an unmanaged state. You can edit details related to your asset on the **Details** tab by using the pencil icon in the sections titled **About this asset** and **Use and purpose**.

11. If you have the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role, select the **Actions** menu and then select **Start lifecycle review**.

    **Important:** Only users with the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role can start the life-cycle review.

    The Start AI steward review dialog box opens.

12. In the **Managed by** field of the dialog box, search for and select the user that you want to assign the life-cycle review to.

    **Important:** You must select a user with the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role.

13. Select **Start review**.

    The asset automatically changes from an unmanaged asset to a managed asset and starts the onboarding workflow. The Lifecycle tab now contains three sub tabs: **Onboard**, **Maintain**, and **Retire**. The **Maintain**, and **Retire** are disabled and are enabled once onboarding is complete.

    The **Onboard** sub tab contains the Onboarding playbook with tasks displayed. If tasks are not already present in the Onboarding playbook, users with the AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\] role can create tasks by selecting **New** and assign them to other AI stewards.

14. If you're assigned to the life-cycle review, select **Mark complete** to complete each activity in the onboarding playbook.

    If your tasks are open and you select **Mark complete**, those tasks automatically get closed with the **Closed skipped** state and you move to the next stage of onboarding. Once you move forward, you can no longer create tasks in the previous stage.

    You can select the **Actions** menu and select **Reject request** to cancel the onboarding playbook and mark this asset as unmanaged.

    When all stages in the onboarding playbook are marked as complete, the playbook status updates to **Complete**. The **Maintain** and **Retire** tabs show a status of **Not Started**.

    **Note:** The end-to-end onboarding process from start to finish may take a few days.
