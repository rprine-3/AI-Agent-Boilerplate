# Summarize Access Observer logs AI agent

This ServiceNow Vault agent summarizes access observer logs and provides detailed breakdowns by caller type, users, and roles for specific table and column combinations.

## Workflow

1.  Check the user has the security\_admin role \(required.\)
2.  Retrieve available table/column combinations that have Access Observer logs, display them with log counts, and let the user pick one.
3.  Confirm logs exist for the selected table-column pair.
4.  For each of the seven supported caller types \(UI action, UI page, script include, scripted REST API, scheduled jobs, business rule, and unidentified sources\). Retrieve the access logs and display a summary showing total accesses, users, roles, and caller sources.
5.  Point the user to the **Field Encryption with Vault module** skill for encrypting the field and creating module access policies.
