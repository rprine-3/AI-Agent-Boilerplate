# Configure AI Desktop Actions

You can enable the AI Desktop Actions application if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

To get started with AI Desktop Actions, you must have:

-   A ServiceNow Pro Plus or Enterprise Plus license.
-   An instance on Australia Patch 2 or later.
-   A .NET 9.0 runtime v9.0.10 and .NET 9 Desktop Runtime v9.0.10 is installed.

Role required: administrator

## About this task

AI Desktop Actions isn’t a standalone store application that you can install directly. To enable AI Desktop Actions on your instance, you must install other generative AI applications, such as ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) or ServiceNow Otto for Customer Service Management \(CSM\).

-   Review the [AI Desktop Actions](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/dc9057f4873932d0221e8409dabb35a5) application listing in ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   Refer to the [document](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/sn-assist-overview.pdf) to see the prebuilt skills that exist and are currently available for purchase in AI packages and to review the number of assists consumed.
-   Perform these steps in your ServiceNow instance.

For more information about the components installed, see [Components installed with AI Desktop Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/components-installed-with-agentic-desktop.md).

## Procedure

2.  Search for and select a generative AI application, such as ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) or ServiceNow Otto for Platform.

3.  Select **Install**.
