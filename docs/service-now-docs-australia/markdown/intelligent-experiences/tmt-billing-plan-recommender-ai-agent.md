# Billing plan recommender AI agent

This Telecommunications, Media, and Technology \(TMT\) agent generates recommended service plans and updates the billing inquiry case work notes with the results. The agent helps to ensure a seamless recommendation process without requiring additional user input beyond initial confirmation.

## Workflow

1.  Retrieve plan recommendations based on the high usage line item code \(not the case sold product code\).
2.  If no recommended plans are available, inform the user and stop.
3.  Write the recommended plan and summary to the billing inquiry case record as a numbered, line-by-line work note entry.
