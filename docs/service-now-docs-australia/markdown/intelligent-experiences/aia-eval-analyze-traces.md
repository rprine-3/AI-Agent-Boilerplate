# Analyze traces found in agentic evaluation run results

Investigate the full record of an agentic interaction to diagnose the root cause of a quality failure. Trace each step the agent took, including tool calls and outputs, to pinpoint where things went wrong.

## Before you begin

You must have a completed agentic evaluation with issues identified.

Role required: sn\_aia.admin

## About this task

If you're already in the flow for identifying issues, skip to step 5.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Skill Kit** &gt; **Agentic Evaluations**.

2.  Select the automated evaluation you want to review the results of.

    The evaluation details page opens, displaying the overall results and performance metrics.

3.  If any issues are identified, select **Review and optimize** to view details.

    The optimization guided setup opens for that agentic AI asset.

    Each issue is associated with a specific tool or agentic AI asset.

4.  Select an issue to review.

5.  Select **Show traces**.

    Each execution plan where the issue occurred can be reviewed node-by-node with the inputs and outputs of each node displayed. You can navigate between nodes by selecting them in the center section.

6.  Close the traces modal.


## What to do next

Select **Apply optimization** to look at LLM-generated suggestions for optimizations to fix the issues.
