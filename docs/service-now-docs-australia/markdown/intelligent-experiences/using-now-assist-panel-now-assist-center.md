# Using the conversational experience in AI Admin Center

Use the ServiceNow Otto panel to perform AI administration and setup tasks through a conversational interface directly in AI Admin Center.

The ServiceNow Otto panel appears pinned along the right side of the browser by default, and is accessible from every page in the workspace. You can interact with your AI companion by typing questions and instructions in plain language.

## AI companion capabilities

Use the ServiceNow Otto panel to perform the following types of actions in AI Admin Center:

-   **Setup and configuration**

    Start guided setup workflows for generative AI skills, AI Guardian settings, model configurations, multilingual service, data sharing and processing, integrations, and account details. The AI companion executes setup steps on your behalf and asks for your confirmation before any change takes effect.

-   **Skill activation and deactivation**

    Activate or deactivate generative AI skills through conversation. The panel presents skill details and current state before requesting confirmation.

-   **Instance and product details**

    Query configuration details about your instance including translation status, language configurations, data sharing settings, model providers, model versions, and integrations.

-   **AI-assisted help**

    Ask questions about AI features, concepts, and admin tasks. The panel sources product documentation and training resources and returns answers with references and links to the source material.


After you enter your request in the chat, your AI companion generates a plan to implement your AI solution using the available AI assets. You can review the details of the solution, test it, and activate it, all in the conversation.
