# Map a skill to a dashboard

Map an AI skill to a dashboard to view skill performance indicators and skill details.

## Before you begin

Be sure to map a dashboard with a skill in the same domain.

**Note:** You can only map a skill to a dashboard. Mapping a feature \(that consists of multiple skills\) is currently not supported.

If you're mapping a skill to a custom dashboard, be sure to share appropriate access to the dashboard. See [Share a Platform Analytics dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/share-db-in-ac.md) for more information.

Roles required: sn\_na\_analytics.admin and sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **All** menu and enter `sn_na_analytics_configuration.list`.

    The Now Assist Analytics Configuration \[sn\_na\_analytics\_configuration\] table appears.\[Omitted image "naa-create-skill-dashboard-mapping.png"\] Alt text: AI Analytics Configuration table.

2.  Create a new mapping by selecting **New**

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Document Id|The Skill that you want to map to the dashboard. Use the lookup icon \(\[Omitted image "na-list-lookup-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup icon.\) to search for and select the skill that you want to map to the dashboard.|
