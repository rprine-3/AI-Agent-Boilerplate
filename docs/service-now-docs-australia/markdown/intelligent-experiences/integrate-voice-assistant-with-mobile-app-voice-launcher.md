Configure your voice assistant to be accessible through the voice launcher functions in mobile app.

## Before you begin

5.  In Chat launcher functions, select from the **Add chat launcher function** drop-down to add a chat launcher function to open the assistant in chat mode.

6.  In Prominent action button override, select from the **Add tab override** drop-down to allow a prominent action button to launch the assistant.

    The prominent action button overrides what’s been defined in the chat launcher and voice launcher functions.
