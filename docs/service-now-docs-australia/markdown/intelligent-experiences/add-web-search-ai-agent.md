# Add a web search to an AI agent

Add a web search to an AI agent in AI Agent Studio using a third-party search API such as Microsoft Bing or Google.

## Before you begin

**Note:** If you select Google as your web search tool provider, the web search tool leverages [Grounding with Google Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/grounding-with-google-search), offered under a Global Standard deployment. Because grounding is not [data resident](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/security-controls), Google's global infrastructure routes traffic to a global data center for each web search request. This processing may be different than your data processing location chosen for your ServiceNow instance. Please consider your organization's data policies before adding a web search tool with Google as the provider.

Role required: sn\_aia.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage** &gt; **AI agents**.

2.  Open the AI agent that you want to add a web search to and navigate to the Add tools and information section.

3.  In the Add tool drop-down list, select **Web search**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

If you want the AI agent to work in Off Glide architecture with Premium Chat experience, you must turn-on the **Display output** toggle. When the toggle is turned-on, you can add widgets that can be used in assistants built with Premium Chat experiences. The widget configuration includes:

-   **Widget**: Defines the display output to render the content in a better user experience. You can select the widget from the drop-down.
-   **Require widget transformation**: An additional LLM call is required to transform the raw tool. If you choose to skip this transformation step, the tool output will be directly mapped to the widget.

-   **Display refined widget message**: Refines the widget message when configured.
