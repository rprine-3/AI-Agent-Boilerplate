1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Admin Console** &gt; **Now Assist Skills**.

2.  Within the Platform category, select the feature **Conversation Evaluator** and verify that all the skills shipped with the Conversation Evaluator application are activated.

3.  After that, activate the skills shipped with this application.

    -   Themes Update Definition
