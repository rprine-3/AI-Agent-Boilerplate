# Investigate a low-scoring session

Determine the root cause of a low quality or safety score by working through the session detail, trace timeline, and span-level input and output data.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner or sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward

## About this task

Trace and span detail for a session is available only for a limited time. To review the judge's reasoning and the input and output for each trace and span, complete your investigation within 7 days for ServiceNow AI systems, or within 30 days for external AI systems. After that window, the session's quality and safety scores remain available, but the trace and span detail is removed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Control Tower** &gt; **Home** &gt; **Insights** &gt; **Monitor** and select the **Evaluated sessions** tab.

2.  In the Evaluated sessions list, find the session that you want to investigate.

    For example, sort by score to identify the lowest-scoring sessions, search for a specific session by name, or filter the list to find the session.

3.  Select the session that you want to investigate.

4.  On the session detail page, determine which quality metrics are contributing to the low score by reviewing the Quality score card.

    1.  Open the quality scoring breakdown by selecting the side panel icon.

    2.  Review each metric's weight and score to determine which metric is affecting the score.

    3.  Close the side panel.

    For example, if the session quality score is 67%, the side panel might show that Task completion scored 50% at 40% weight, while Answer completeness scored 91% at 35% weight. The low Task completion score is the primary contributor to the low quality composite.

5.  On the session detail page, determine which safety metrics are contributing to the low score by reviewing the Safety score card.

    1.  Open the safety scoring breakdown by selecting the side panel icon.

    2.  Review each metric's weight and score to determine which metric is affecting the score.

    3.  Close the side panel.

    For example, a Profanity detection score of 0% at 49% weight would immediately explain a low safety composite.

6.  Review the score and the judge's reasoning for every evaluated metric in the Session scores and aggregate scores section.

    Metrics scored at the session, trace, or span level all roll up here, so you can identify what's driving the quality and safety scores without opening each trace or span. The reasoning explains why the judge assigned each score. For example, a Task completion score of 50% might include reasoning such as "The user's goal was partially accomplished but the agent did not confirm the resolution."

    When a metric's score is an average aggregated from the trace or span level, open an individual span or trace to read the judge's reasoning for each one.

7.  Identify which trace is responsible for the low score by sorting the traces list.

    -   Find the trace with the lowest quality score by selecting **Lowest quality score**.
    -   Find the trace with the lowest safety score by selecting **Lowest safety score**.
8.  Select the trace that you want to investigate.

9.  In the trace side panel, determine which metrics failed on that trace by reviewing the trace-level evaluation scores and the judge's reasoning.

    The evaluation scores table shows only the metrics applicable to this trace. Different metrics are available at the trace level than at the session level.

    The judge's reasoning tells you what specifically went wrong. For example, an Answer completeness score of 60% with reasoning "The response did not address all aspects of the user's query" tells you the agent's response was incomplete.

10. Determine whether the agent's response addressed the user's request by reviewing the trace-level input and output.

    The input and output show you the actual conversation between the user and the AI system.

    1.  Select the **Input** tab to see what the user asked or what data was passed to the agent.

    2.  Select the **Output** tab to see how the agent responded.

    3.  Select **Open details** to view the full content when the preview is truncated.

11. Identify and select the span that caused the issue using the quality and safety indicators in the span timeline.

12. Confirm the root cause by reviewing the span's evaluation scores and comparing its input and output data.

    1.  Review the evaluation metric scores and the judge's reasoning for this specific step.

    2.  Select the **Input** tab to see what data was passed to this span.

    3.  Select the **Output** tab to see what the span produced.

    4.  Select **Open details** to view the full content when the preview is truncated.

    At the span level, the input and output show the agent's internal execution, not the user-facing conversation. For example, the input might be a correctly formatted API request, while the output shows the agent called the wrong endpoint or passed a malformed parameter.

13. Review additional traces to determine whether the issue is isolated or recurring by selecting **Next trace** or **Previous trace** to navigate between traces.


## What to do next

After identifying the root cause, coordinate with the product owner to adjust the agent's configuration, prompts, or tool access. Monitor subsequent sessions to verify that the issue is resolved.
