# Enhanced chat

ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat is a conversational support experience within a dynamic window that also includes the ability to have multiple active conversations and superior search capabilities. Use ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat to improve your productivity and efficiency by leveraging generative AI to perform tasks such as summarize a chat, case, or incident, request help, generate resolution notes, among others.

Agents can use the ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat to interact with and get assistance from generative AI. You can move the chat window by selecting the header and dragging the chat window to the desired location. You can resize the chat window by using the window's edges to resize to your desired size or use the toolbar icons.

Conversational aspects of the ServiceNow Otto panel, such as skill detection, are powered by Now LLM Service.

**Note:** To use the full capabilities of ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat, AI Search must be enabled for your portal. Without it, ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat functions in a limited capacity. Basic conversational interactions such as predefined topic flows and simple questions and answers are available, but knowledge article retrieval, AI responses grounded in instance content, and semantic search capabilities require AI Search. For more information, see [Enable and configure AI Search in Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/enable-ais-sp.md).

Selecting the go to search results icon \(\[Omitted image "nass-search-result-icon.png"\] Alt text: Go to search results icon.\) redirects you to the search results page and begins a search query using the last five chat utterances you entered.Additionally, a copy message icon \(\[Omitted image "dw-feedback-copy-message-icon.png"\]\) appears on received Virtual Agent responses.

## Agentic conversations

**Note:** Admins must first enable AI agents before end users can experience agentic conversations. ServiceNow Otto panel discovers and executes agentic workflows. For more information on agentic workflows, see [Agentic workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/sn-aia-use-cases-list.md) and [Multiple conversations in AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/multiple-conversations-aia.md).

When you ask a question to the ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat, the agent understands the query and begins a flow. When you submit a message with multiple questions or requests, ServiceNow Otto panel enhanced chat answers the multiple questions consecutively in its response. It can reason, plan, and execute across AI agents, ServiceNow Otto panel topics, conversational actions and subflows, catalogs, Knowledge Base articles, custom skills, and any ServiceNow Otto supported skills to help you. You receive on-screen messages to let you know where the agent is in the agentic processing flow prior to receiving the response. After the processing has completed its flow, a View AI Steps section header appears, where the processing flow steps can be expanded and viewed. You can stop the agentic processing flow at any time by selecting the End flow icon \(\[Omitted image "agentic-end-flow-icon.png"\] Alt text:\). After an action starts, it can't be stopped. Selecting the End flow icon only stops the proceeding processing steps.

## Navigating from the ServiceNow Otto panel

You can navigate from the ServiceNow Otto panel without leaving the current conversation by entering a navigation request in the **Ask ServiceNow Otto to...** field. If you enter "navigate me to active incidents," ServiceNow Otto displays a button that enables you to view the active incidents.

## Chat summarization

Quickly learn the details of a chat by reading a chat summarization. The chat summarization gives you enough details about the chat so that your requester doesn't have to repeat the same information to you.

To generate a chat summarization from the ServiceNow Otto panel, select **Chat Summarization** or enter `summarize chat` in the **Ask ServiceNow Otto to** field.

**Note:** You can also generate a chat summarization by using the `/summarize` quick action in Agent Chat.

## Case or incident summarization

Quickly learn the details of a case or incident by reading a case summarization. The summarization gives you enough details about the interaction so that your requester doesn't have to repeat the same information to you.

You can generate a case or incident summarization from the ServiceNow Otto panel for ServiceNow Otto for CSM, ServiceNow Otto for HRSD, or ServiceNow Otto for ITSM:

-   For ServiceNow Otto for CSM, select **Summarize record** or enter `summarize a record` in the **Ask ServiceNow Otto to** field.
-   For ServiceNow Otto for HRSD, select **Summarize record** or enter `summarize a record` in the **Ask ServiceNow Otto to** field.
-   For ServiceNow Otto for ITSM, select **Summarize incident** or enter `summarize an incident` in the **Ask ServiceNow Otto to** field.

## Conversation Help

Get specific and accurate answers to your queries by using the Get Help skill option on the ServiceNow Otto panel. This skill is available to everyone entitled to ServiceNow Otto capabilities.

For more information about the ServiceNow Otto Conversational Help skill that represents as Get Help on the ServiceNow Otto panel, see [Conversational Help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/conversational-help-skills.md).

## Resolution notes generation

Quickly learn the details of how an interaction was resolved by generating and reading resolution notes.

To generate resolution notes from the ServiceNow Otto panel, select **Generate resolutions notes** or enter `generate resolutions notes` in the **Ask ServiceNow Otto to** field.

## Streaming responses

After you enter a question or request on the panel, ServiceNow Otto gathers information from Knowledge Base articles, external content, product documentation, catalog items, and workflows and combines them into a synthesized, comprehensive answer. Instead of waiting for the entire message to render, the synthesized response streams in real time and stops streaming after the entire message has been delivered. An animated sparkle icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-ai-sparkle.png"\] Alt text:\) appears while the response is generated and changes to the static sparkle icon after the response has fully loaded.

## Fallback options

**Note:** For more information about where and how to enable fallback options, see [Manage an assistant chat experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/manage-assistant-chat-experience.md).

A fallback state can occur whenever search results are unavailable. Scenarios where search results are unavailable include when ServiceNow Otto didn't understand the query, complaint small talk was found, or an error occurred. When search results are unavailable, the **Search the web** fallback option may appear. If you select the **Search the web** fallback option, the web search mode is triggered and uses the internet to search for the results.

**Note:** Only the last query entered into the conversation is considered when entering web search mode via this **Search the web** fallback option.
