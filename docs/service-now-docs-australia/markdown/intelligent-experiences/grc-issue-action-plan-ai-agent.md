# Issue action plan AI agent

This AI agent identifies the optimal steps for resolving an issue by referencing the past similar issue details. It presents a step-by-step summarized action plan to the user.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to issue action plan.

1.  Get record details.
2.  Generate an action plan for the issue using the Generate Issue Action Plan tool.
3.  Ask for user feedback.
4.  If the user chooses to dismiss the action plan, inform the user that they can populate the action plan manually.
5.  If the user chooses to edit the action plan, show a message asking for the user’s feedback to refine the action plan.
6.  Use user feedback to refine the action plan.
7.  If the user chooses to accept the action plan, format and save it.
