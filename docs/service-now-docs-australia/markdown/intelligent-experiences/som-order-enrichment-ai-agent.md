# Order enrichment AI agent

This Sales Customer Relationship Management agent identifies enrichment tasks for order line items and their children using historic data, confirms the task list with the user, and creates them.

## Workflow

1.  Fetch the details for the given top-level order line item and all its children.
2.  For each order line item, check for existing historic enrichment tasks. If none exist, identify the available tasks instead.
3.  Display the proposed tasks grouped by order line item. If rejected, let the user provide their own task list per line item, validate it, and confirm again \(repeating until satisfied\).
4.  Once confirmed, create the enrichment tasks for each order line item.
5.  Mark the trigger task as closed complete. If no tasks were created, reset all order line item states back to new.
6.  Display a summary of all steps taken, including created task numbers grouped by order line item, or note that none were created.
