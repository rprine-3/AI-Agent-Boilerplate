# Invoice dispute support assistant AI agent

This agent helps users efficiently identify, review, and answer questions related to invoice disputes. It validates information, maintains data integrity, and answers questions regarding the invoice case.

## Workflow

The agent can offer assistance to the user for resolving or closing invoice disputes and fetching similar invoice cases to help with invoice case resolution.

1.  Identify and confirm the invoice number with the customer.
2.  Use the Validate invoice case and fetch invoice tool to validate the invoice case number.
3.  Provide the user with a list of options, such as viewing invoice details, find similar invoice cases, and closing the case.
