# Workflow data fabric spoke asset discovery AI Agent

This Workflow Data Fabric agent finds specific flows, subflows, and actions inside a named spoke that fulfill a user's stated automation goal. This agent is triggered only when a user has identified a spoke and wants to explore what reusable assets it contains for their use case.

## Workflow

1.  Identify the likely spoke/integration and ask the user to confirm before searching.
2.  Check whether both the spoke name and a clear purpose \(what the user wants to accomplish\) are present, and ask additional questions if not.
3.  Search for flows and actions using both the spoke name and the user's stated intent as filters.
4.  Present matched flows and actions grouped by type, noting which spoke/package each belongs to.
