# ServiceNow AI organization and tools

The ServiceNow AI experience includes generative AI skills, agentic AI, and conversational user engagement layer. A good AI experience depends on quality data and a coherent AI policy that functions as its guiding star. AI Search capabilities and other tools help connect the pieces.

The following infographic illustrates the components of the ServiceNow AI experience. You can think of each area as a layer, with AI policy as the basis for your implementation. Data plays an important role, since poor data will lead to poor outcomes, and the search experience drives both generative and agentic AI capabilities. The conversational engagement layer allows your users to communicate with AI and perform tasks and self-serve more easily.

\[Omitted image "mmasset0022320.svg"\] Alt text: The ServiceNow AI experience includes a policy layer, a data layer, a content layer, a generative AI and agentic AI layer, and a conversational engagement layer.

## AI policy

AI governance is defined by your organization and then implemented on the platform using AI Control Tower. AI Control Tower is designed to scale with your organization’s AI maturity. It enables end-to-end life cycle management of AI agents and models, from intake and evaluation to deployment and optimization. It also acts as a bridge between governance committees and implementation teams, ensuring that policy decisions are translated into technical configurations and operational controls. The platform includes the AI Risk and Compliance application, which comes with pre-built content aligned to the EU AI Act and NIST AI Risk Management Framework \(AI RMF\), helping organizations accelerate compliance and implement responsible AI practices from day one. For more information, see [AI governance on the ServiceNow AI Platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/sn-ai-impl-governance.md).

For real-time guardrail enforcement for AI interactions, you can use AI Guardian to monitor and mitigate risks related to offensive content, sensitive topics, and security threats in generative AI outputs. Admins can configure these guardrails directly in the AI Admin Hub console, and logs are available to track detection events and guide decisions about blocking or escalation.

## Agentic AI

In an agentic AI system, autonomous agents perform complex tasks by reasoning, planning, and executing actions across multiple steps. These agents are not just reactive; they can break down goals, make decisions, and coordinate with other agents or systems to complete workflows. In AI Agent Studio, AI agents and agentic workflows are built to handle tasks such as resolving incidents, managing requests, or navigating service catalogs using generative AI and orchestration logic. For a list of available agentic workflows by product, see [Agentic workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/sn-aia-use-cases-list.md).

Use AI Agent Studio to perform the following tasks:

-   Build or modify AI agents and agentic workflows using intuitive list views and guided setup tools.
-   Simulate tasks and view execution logic to refine agent behavior.
-   Access execution logs and version control to track performance and changes.
-   Use the Settings page to enable AI Guardian for runtime safety, including detection of offensive content and prompt injection.
-   Use the AI Agent Analytics dashboard to view usage stats, efficiency gains, and execution volume to help measure value.

The Model Context Protocol \(MCP\) client enables you to access the Model Context Protocol tools that are hosted externally and published using an MCP Server. MCP facilitates communication between an AI host application \(like AI Agent Studio\) and one or more MCP servers that expose specific capabilities such as tools.

The MCP Server Console is a tool for administrators to set up and manage Model Context Protocol \(MCP\) servers. These servers provide AI applications with access to ServiceNow features like incident lookups, case summaries, and workflow actions. The console lets you choose which capabilities to make available, ensuring everything stays secure and compliant. Then, from an MCP client, users can request information from the server and automate functionality using the available tools and data that the server returns.

Roles and responsibilities:

-   **[AI Agent Admin \[sn\_aia\_admin\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/na-aia-reference.md)**

    This role is required to create, manage, update, test, and delete AI agents and agentic workflows.

-   **[MCP Client Admin \[sn\_mcp\_client.admin\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/mcp-reference.md)**

    This role is required to administer the MCP client in AI Agent Studio. It is inherited from the AI Agent Admin \[sn\_aia.admin\] role.

## Conversational AI engagement

ServiceNow® Otto for Virtual Agent acts as the conversational front door to your organization’s AI capabilities. It enables users to interact naturally with AI-powered assistants that understand intent, recommend actions, and deliver synthesized responses—all within familiar channels like the service portal, mobile app, and Microsoft Teams. This conversational layer connects users to a wide range of AI-powered resources, including AI agents, generative AI skills, catalog items, Virtual Agent topics, Q&amp;A Genius results from AI Search, and even custom subflows and actions.

By integrating with the AI agent framework, Virtual Agent can discover and trigger agentic workflows that dynamically solve problems based on context. For example, a user might ask about ordering a device, and the system can invoke a multi-turn catalog ordering skill, refine the request, and complete the task, all in one conversation. Similarly, Q&amp;A Genius capabilities allow users to ask open-ended questions and receive actionable answers, links, or follow-up options, improving deflection rates and reducing the need for live agent intervention.

ServiceNow® Otto for Virtual Agent also makes it easier to discover content without needing to know exact keywords. Users can search for and interact with catalog items, AI agents, and Virtual Agent topics using natural language. LLM topic discovery and Knowledge Graph slot-filling can return personalized responses and reduce repetitive questions.

To configure ServiceNow® Otto for Virtual Agent, you set up an assistant. An assistant is a container for a specific conversational experience that can be delivered in portals on your instance, mobile apps, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. Use the Assistant Designer to create, configure, and manage these assistants, as well as link them to conversational assets in Virtual Agent.

To implement ServiceNow® Otto for Virtual Agent, admins use guided setup that requires no deep technical expertise. Assistant configuration includes the following options:

-   AI agent enablement and orchestration
-   Search sources
-   Knowledge Graph schema usage
-   Conversational assets, such as Virtual Agent topics, subflows, actions, generative AI skills, and AI agents
-   The portals, channels, or apps the assistant will be used in
-   Branding: the look and feel of the assistant
-   Chat experience, such as greeting, closing, and fallback messages

You can also customize an assistant for the ServiceNow Otto panel. The ServiceNow Otto panel is available in workspace experiences and is typically used for contextual assistance within a specific workflow or record. ServiceNow Otto panel assistants have different configuration options and skill availability.

Roles and responsibilities:

-   **Virtual Agent \[virtual\_agent\_admin\]**

    This role, or the admin role, is required to install ServiceNow® Otto for Virtual Agent and set up and manage assistants in Assistant Designer. It is also required for users who create and manage Virtual Agent topics and assets.

-   **[Now Assist Admin \[sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/roles-installed-with-now-assist-admin.md)**

    This role is required to turn on and configure the ServiceNow Otto panel in the AI Admin Hub console.
