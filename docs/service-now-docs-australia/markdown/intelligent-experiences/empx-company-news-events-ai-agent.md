# Company news &amp; events AI agent

This AI agent keeps users informed by sharing the latest updates on news, events, and announcements.

## Workflow

The agent helps users complete tasks related to company news &amp; events.

1.  Retrieve latest news and events using extracted filters.
2.  If processedNews is empty or an empty response is returned from previous step, inform the user that no information has been found, and end the conversation.
3.  Display processedNews to the user.
4.  If NextPageToken is not null, ask the user whether they want to see more results, or if they would like more details about a specific news or event.
