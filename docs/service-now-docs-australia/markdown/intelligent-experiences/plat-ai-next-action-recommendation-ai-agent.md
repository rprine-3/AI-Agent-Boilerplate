# Next action recommendation AI agent

This AI agent identifies the optimal steps for resolving tasks by reviewing similar record details, related list record details, relevant knowledge articles, and web search results.

## Workflow

The agent summarizes and presents to the user a step-by-step summarized resolution plan and derived action plan.

1.  Fetch the record details.
2.  Fetch a list of similar records to understand how they were resolved.
3.  Fetch a list of related records to find all records from related lists to provide additional context.
4.  Fetch a list of relevant knowledge articles based on the short description of the task.
5.  Analyze the issue and use the web search tool to provide additional resolution steps based on the web search results.
6.  Generate the resolution steps.
7.  Display results to the user.
