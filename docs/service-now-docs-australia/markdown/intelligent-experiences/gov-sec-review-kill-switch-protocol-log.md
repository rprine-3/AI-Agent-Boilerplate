# Review the agent containment list

The agent containment list shows agents that were deactivated and reinstated for the instance manually with kill switch protocol or automatically by policy enforcement. You can view audit log information for each AI agent which can help you stay compliant with regulatory guidance and your business rules.

## Before you begin

Role required: AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward\]

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Security** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Contained AI Agents**.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

The current state of the operation. Possible values are:-   Completed — The operation was successful. If the agent was deactivated, all AI agent credentials were revoked across all providers, the session was ended, and no new access tokens will be provisioned. If the agent was reinstated, all AI agent credentials were restored across all providers.
-   Failed — The containment or reinstatement operation didn't take effect on any provider. Failed to deactivate or reinstate agent on all configured providers or skipped providers \(for example, agent not found, subflow error, or an unhandled exception\).
-   In progress — The operation is actively executing. Policy enforcement point \(PEP\) subflows \(for example, AWS Bedrock\) are running, with audit log information being captured.
-   Partial — The operation succeeded on at least one provider and failed on at least one provider. For example, the AWS Bedrock AI agent deactivation succeeded, but the Okta deactivation failed.
