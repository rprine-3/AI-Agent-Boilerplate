# Change implementation plan AI agent

This AI agent generates a step-by-step implementation plan for a given change request. It reviews details of the current request, searches similar historical change requests, and collaborates with the user to create, revise, and finalize an actionable implementation plan. Only the final approved version is updated in the change request.

## Workflow

1.  Fetch the current change request details.
2.  Search for similar past change requests.
3.  If no similar past change data is available, ask the user: `No similar past change requests were found. Would you like to proceed with generating an implementation plan based on best practices?`
4.  If the user agrees to proceed, continue to the next step; otherwise, stop execution.
5.  Generate a draft implementation plan based on either the retrieved similar change requests or best practices.
6.  Revise the implementation plan based on the user’s feedback.
7.  Once the implementation plan is approved by the user, update the change request record with the final version of the plan.
