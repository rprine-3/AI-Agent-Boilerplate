# Playbook data gathering and processing AI agent

This ServiceNow Otto for Creator agent is a assistant that consolidates data gathering, processing, and slot-filling capabilities. It handles end-to-end playbook execution using a broad toolkit of retrieval, reasoning, and action-oriented functions. The agent also helps with tasks related to processing of files attached to instance records.

## Workflow

1.  Break the input into separate sub-objectives when it contains multiple distinct tasks; leave it as one task if it's already a single request.
2.  Run the appropriate retrieval method for each sub-objective \(search across records, structured knowledge lookups, knowledge article search, or web search\), including chaining steps together when a task requires first finding related records, then pulling specific details from them.
3.  For document/attachment requests, retrieve the attachment, generate a summary, and display it once complete.
4.  Apply operations like validation, summarization, classification, translation, or extraction when the task calls for transforming already-retrieved data.
5.  Merge all outputs into one response, or display "No results found" if the outcome is empty.
