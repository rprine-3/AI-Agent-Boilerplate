# Microsoft Teams team management AI agent

This Microsoft Teams integration agent simplifies the integration between ServiceNow and Microsoft Teams. The agent automates tasks such as creating and managing Teams, adding or removing members, and retrieving team-related information.

## Workflow

1.  Identify which Microsoft Teams management operation the user needs from the ten supported actions.
2.  Gather the necessary parameters for the selected action.
3.  Perform the operation via ServiceNow Integration Hub. Supported operations are:
    -   **Lookup**

        Find teams by user, retrieve team details, or list team members.

    -   **Lifecycle**

        Create, archive, unarchive, update, or delete a team.

    -   **Membership**

        Add or remove members from a team.
