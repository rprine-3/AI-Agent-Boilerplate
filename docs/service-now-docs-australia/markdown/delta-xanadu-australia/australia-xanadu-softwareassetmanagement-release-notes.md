# Combined Software Asset Management release notes for upgrades from Xanadu to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Software Asset Management from Xanadu to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Software Asset Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Xanadu to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Software Asset Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Xanadu

</td><td>

After upgrading to the Microsoft Entra ID spoke 4.3 version, the **Microsoft Azure AD - Download Group Membership** directory job isn't executed for existing Microsoft Entra ID SSO or Directory integrations. This directory job also isn't created for new Microsoft Entra ID SSO or Directory integrations. Instead, the **Microsoft Azure AD - Download Groups** directory job downloads all groups and group memberships configured on Microsoft Entra ID.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

Starting from the Yokohama release, all the reconciliation script includes are being moved from the family release to the Software Asset Management store application \(com.sn\_itam\_samp\). When upgrading to Yokohama, if you have made customizations to reconciliation script includes, you must move your customizations to the new script includes. The old script includes will be deprecated.

When upgrading to Yokohama Patch 1 with the Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 2.1.0 store application installed, you must delete the entitlements for the existing CrowdStrike integration profiles. Then, create new entitlements for various CrowdStrike products, such as CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection and CrowdStrike Falcon Discover, based on their license metrics. These metrics include the Reserved Hourly Average Sensor and Sensor Subscription, which are found under the CrowdStrike License Metric Group.

    -   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the Draft state, create new integration profiles and delete the existing ones.
    -   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the Published state, their state changes to Draft.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

Starting from the Zurich release, the following workflows are migrated to Flow Designer as flows:

    -   Reclamation workflow
    -   Procurement Process Flow - Auto allocation enabled
When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the workflows were customized. If you haven't customized the workflows before the upgrade, the fix script deactivates the legacy workflows from the instance and deploys the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. If you have customized the impacted workflows in the previous release, the fix script doesn’t deploy the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. You can view and access the impacted workflows in the instance after the upgrade. However, the deprecated workflows are considered as custom code and ServiceNow doesn’t support those workflows.

Starting from the Zurich release, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is moved from the family release to the Software Asset Workspace store application. After upgrading to Zurich, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is inactivated and the Software Asset Workspace store application \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is enabled in the instance.

When upgrading to the Software Asset Management – SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) version 16.0.6 or later in the Zurich release, verify that the Software Asset Workspace store app \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is updated to version 9.0.4.

Software Asset Management is available with activation of the Activate all Software Asset Management Professional plugins, including the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_samp\_master\_ws\). Activating this plugin automatically activates the Activate all Software Asset Management Professional plugin \(com.sn\_samp\_master\) and the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\). After the new plugin is activated, you can't access the classic user interface. For details about the plugins and how to request them, see [Components installed with Software Asset Management Professional](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sam-installed-components&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 In the ServiceNow AI Platform® Xanadu release, there's limited support for the Software Asset Management classic user interface. While it remains active in your instance, including when you upgrade to a new ServiceNow AI Platform® release, you can move to the new workspace for an intuitive and personalized experience.

 For releases prior to Utah, if you activated the older Software Asset Management Professional plugin \(com.sn\_samp\_master\), the Software Asset Workspace is available with activation of the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\). After the Workspace plugin is activated, you can't revert to the classic user interface. For details about the plugins and how to request them, see [Request the Software Asset Management plugins](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmt&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 To activate Next Experience, make sure that the **glide.ui.polaris.experience** system property in your instance is set to true.

 Install the following Software Asset Management applications by requesting them from the ServiceNow Store. Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store.

-   **Accessibility information**
    -   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

    -   **Reflow**

The configurable workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%. This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
