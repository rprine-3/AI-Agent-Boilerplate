-   **[HL7 v2.x Inbound REST API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hl7-inbound-api&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The HL7 v2.x Inbound REST API receives inbound HL7 v2.x ADT messages from EHR systems over HTTP and returns standard HL7 v2.x acknowledgment responses. It implements the HAPI HL7-over-HTTP convention, accepting raw pipe-delimited ER7 message bodies and processing them against configured parser profiles.

-   **[HL7 message log](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hl7-message-log-about&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Every inbound HL7 v2.x message is stored with its raw payload, ACK response, message metadata \(type, trigger event, sending application and facility, message control ID\), and processing status. Metadata fields are queryable and available as Flow Designer trigger conditions.

-   **[Parser configurations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hl7-parser-configs-about&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

When a message is received, ServiceNow parses it with the matching parser configuration and writes the extracted values to the message log record's structured JSON \(`parsed_data`\). Parser configurations define which segments and fields to extract and the output path for each value.

-   **Demo parser configurations**

Demo parser configurations for ADT A01, A02, A03, and A08 are available when you load demo data, covering the EVN, PID, and PV1 segments. They are editable, and you can clone them for hospital-specific customization.

-   Works alongside the HL7 v2.x Inbound REST API to receive HL7 v2.x messages from EHR systems over HTTP and return standards-compliant acknowledgment responses.
-   Receive raw HL7 v2.x messages directly in ServiceNow and automatically return standards-compliant ACK responses — with no custom scripting on the integration engine side.
-   Parse raw HL7 v2.x messages into structured JSON on the message log using a configurable, no-code parser, enabling hospital workflow automation without HL7 v2.x expertise.
-   Demo parser configurations for ADT A01 \(Admit\), A02 \(Transfer\), A03 \(Discharge\), and A08 \(Update\) provide ready-to-edit starting points for the most common hospital ADT workflows.
