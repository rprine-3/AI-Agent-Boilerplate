-   **[Target instance modal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-ui-request-clone&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Request a clone to copy the data from a production instance to a non-production instance or to copy the data between non-production instances. You can request a clone without leaving the form by using the **add an instance** option in the **clone request target instance** field.

-   **[Using the same backup from another clone](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Clone-UI&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the backup from another clone when you're selecting a backup option for a faster backup process. If the backup no longer exists, it triggers an on-demand backup instead.

-   **[Clone storage](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=Clone-UI&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Legacy clones and new clones are stored separately. Clones that you request via the Clone Admin Console are stored on a new table and displayed within the new console.  Legacy clones aren't shown in the Clone Admin Console. Clones that you initiate via the legacy Request Clone page are stored on the legacy Clone History table.

-   **[Instance Overview Page](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=instance-clone-landing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Instance Overview page now displays last-cloned timestamps for each instance, enabling you to quickly identify stale environments and prioritize update activities.

-   **[Multi-Instance View](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=instance-clone-landing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

View clone activity across connected instances from a single console. Opt in from **Configuration** &gt; **Multi-Instance View** to begin monitoring multiple instances simultaneously.

Both the source and target instances must be on Australia Patch 2 or a subsequent release to use **Multi-Instance View**.

-   **[Clone FAQ Agent \(via Now Assist\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=instance-clone-landing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get answers to clone questions directly in the console, powered by curated ServiceNow clone documentation. This AI-assisted capability streamlines the learning experience for new users.

-   **Now Assist license requirement**

Requires a Now Assist license. If Now Assist is installed after the Clone Admin Console, reinstall the console from the Store to enable the skill.

-   **[Help Page](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=instance-clone-landing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The static FAQ section on the Homepage has been replaced with a dedicated Help page. Links to curated clone help articles are now consolidated into the new dedicated Help page for a streamlined user experience and details about the Now Assist AI skill.

-   **[Clone Request Estimated Completion](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=instance-clone-landing&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Clone Request page now displays an estimated completion time beneath the selected Date/Time. A relative time indicator \(for example, "in 2 hours" or "in 2 weeks"\) helps you plan activities accordingly.


 -   **[OAuth 2.0 authentication for clone targets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=clone-oauth-authentication&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Authenticate clone requests to target instances using OAuth 2.0 without requiring local admin credentials.
