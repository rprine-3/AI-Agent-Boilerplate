-   **[Directions for generative AI updates for Generative AI Controller](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=reference-for-generative-ai-controller&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The prompts, which are the instructions to the large language model \(LLM\), for all four capabilities \(Generic Prompt, Generate Content, Summarization, and Sentiment Analysis\), semantic filtering, and recursive summarization have been updated.

Generative AI Controller has changed to use the Data Privacy application instead of the Sensitive Data Handler to help anonymize PII. The process for choosing what gets anonymized and how has shifted to different tables and forms that your administrator must configure for your organization.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Australia Early Access, AI usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: AI Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).

Starting with Zurich Patch 5, the Generative AI Controller \(GAIC\) no longer supports direct action calls in order to support the security requirements that all AI capabilities be protected by Access Control Lists \(ACLs\). To create custom generative AI functionality, use AI Skill Kit instead.

    -   Configure actions in the Generative AI Controller
    -   Generate Content to create AI-generated text responses
    -   QnA to answer user questions
    -   Summarize to shorten long or complex text
    -   Generic Prompt to generate ideas or content on any topic
    -   Sentiment Analysis to identify the sentiment of user input
