-   **[View the class mappings available for the Service Graph Connector](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sgc-claroty-ctd-classes&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the **Claroty CTD SGC Class Mappings** table to view the available class mappings and targeted CMDB classes.

-   **[Avoid importing empty rack slots](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-sgc-claroty-ctd-guided-setup&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

During import, empty rack slots are removed to avoid importing them into the CMDB.

-   **[Capture firmware version of devices](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sgc-claroty-ctd-classes&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Firmware Installation \[cmdb\_firmware\_install\] table to capture the firmware version of your Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD devices.

-   **[Use the ire\_criterion\_attribute in the OT Entity \[cmdb\_ot\_entity\] table](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sgc-claroty-ctd-classes&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The ire\_criterion\_attribute acts as a criterion attribute for an OT entity-related entry and helps avoid entity update issues.

-   **[Clean up serial number data](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sgc-claroty-ctd-classes&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Clean up the serial number \[cmdb\_serial\_number\] records imported into the Source \[sys\_object\_source\] table from the Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD with a fixed script. This script establishes that a null pointer exception doesn't occur when the serial number and MAC address are the same. The script runs automatically when the plugin is upgraded.

-   **[Categorize your OT devices into the industrial product model category](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=model-categories-for-ot&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The enhanced Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD creates assets in the Industrial product model category for OT class devices. This enables compatibility with the Enterprise Asset Management product for full lifecycle management of OT class devices.
