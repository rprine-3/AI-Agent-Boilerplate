# Combined Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio release notes for upgrades from Xanadu to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio from Xanadu to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Xanadu to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio to Australia

After upgrading, users who previously had the fd\_read\_operations role will now see only basic execution details such as the run state and duration. This restriction prevents users with this role from seeing sensitive information in execution details. To provide read access to all execution details such as input configuration and runtime values, grant the user the new role fd\_read\_operations\_all.

-   Removed the system property com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.iteration.lastn that was used to specify the number of loop iterations that a flow would generate execution details for. To report on all iterations of a loop, create a flow execution settings record for the flow instead. For more information about flow execution settings, see [Flow execution settings](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=flow-execution-settings&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
-   The user preference for flow authors to include draft actions in the list of available actions has been removed. To see a custom action during flow design, publish the action. For more information, see [Create an action in Workflow Studio](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-action&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
