For a complete list of the applications that are required to implement Security Posture Control, see [Install Security Posture Control](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-install&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US). Starting with Zurich Patch 12, Now Assist for Vulnerability Response is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. The change is reflected in the name of ServiceNow® products, including Now Assist for Vulnerability Response which is called ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management. See [ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-for-usem-landing-ties&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

-   **[Mitigation Controls Monitoring with Security Posture Control](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-mitigation-exploring&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

From within the Security Posture Control workspace, detect mitigation controls of various types as described by MITRE on all on-premise and cloud enterprise assets. Gain insight into which threats to your assets are mitigated by available mitigation controls based on how various security tools are configured.

    -   Activate mitigation control policies that are included with the application that identify MITRE mitigations on your assets.
    -   Identify your assets that have Web Application Firewall \(WAF\) protection with supported tools that include F5 BIG-IP. Automatically map a WAF mitigation to vulnerable items by analyzing the policy signatures in the firewall and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVE\) information.
    -   Identify exploit mitigation controls from endpoint protection or Endpoint Detection and Response \(EDR\) tools like CrowdStrike and Microsoft Defender. Automatically map the EDR exploit mitigation controls to relevant vulnerable items by analyzing the vulnerability information and the EDR mitigation control configuration.
    -   Populate vulnerable items with relevant attributes that can be used in your Vulnerability Response risk calculator rules.
    -   Import agent information from the SentinelOne product into your ServiceNow AI Platform® with the [Service Graph Connector for Sentinel One](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sgc-sentinelone-integration&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Import asset data from the Splunk product into your ServiceNow AI Platform® with the [Service Graph Connector for Splunk](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sgc-splunk-integration&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
-   **[Enhancements to custom insights in the Security Posture Control Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-custom-insight-overview&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The name of the Custom insights module has been changed to the Configured insights module in the Security Posture Control Workspace.

You must assign groups to organize your reports by categories when you create custom insight records. Groups determine where your data visualizations are displayed on the dashboard in the Configured insights module according to the criteria you set.

-   **[Enhancements to the Condition policy builder in the Policies and findings module](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-create-policy&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Select **With aggregated data** for **Connection** to ensure that your policy matches assets that have slight variations in reported data. The following properties for policies for hardware assets are supported as they’re reported by different sources:

    -   Host name
    -   FQDN
    -   OS
    -   OS Version
    -   OS Domain
    -   OS Service Pack
-   **[Test result and remediation task state transitions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-findings-state-transition&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhancements to policy audits ensure that retired assets are not evaluated by activated policies. If the state of an asset transitions from **Retired** back to **Active**, it is included in the next policy evaluation.

-   **[Create a custom API service graph connector in the Security Posture Control workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-creating-sgc-template&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use generative AI to help your developers create SPC API connectors quickly with the Connector builder framework module in the Security Posture Control workspace. With a Now Assist skill that is included with the ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management application, your developers have the option to automate steps in the Connector builder framework.

    -   You have the option to automate the steps for selecting API templates, populating request and header parameters, and response field mapping with generative AI.

**Note:** You must install [Yokohama Patch 11](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=yokohama-patch-11&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) of the ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management application to have access to the generative AI skill for the Connector builder framework. See the [ServiceNow Otto for Security Incident Response \(SIR\) release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=secops-now-assist-security-operations-rn&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) and [Supporting information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=supporting-information-now-assist-vr&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

    -   Use your custom API connector to integrate with security tools and import asset data that is based on the unique requirements of your environment.
    -   Help your cybersecurity teams monitor your overall security posture and identify assets that are missing key security tools with the API connectors that you build.
-   **[Enhancements to policies and asset profiles included with the Security Posture Control application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-policies-overview&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get insights into your overall security posture and configuration gaps in your security tools using new policies and asset proﬁles that are included with the Security Posture Control application. Activate these asset proﬁles and policies in the Security Posture Control workspace so that you can identify gaps in configuration or coverage for the following tools:

    -   CrowdStrike
    -   Microsoft Intune, Defender, and SCCM
    -   HCL Big Fix
    -   SentinelOne
    -   Qualys
    -   Rapid7
-   **[SentinelOne integration for mitigation controls monitoring](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-controls-policies-for-edr&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can import SentinelOne mitigation controls data with this integration to help you detect which mitigation controls are on your assets. Use this integration with the asset and software data that you import with the SentinelOne Service Graph Connector to help you monitor your security tool coverage on your enterprise assets.

-   **[Netskope](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sgc-netskope-integration&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

This product pulls in asset inventory data for hardware and software from the Netskope database into the ServiceNow Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) application.

-   Security Posture Control relies on data from service graph connectors that is populated in the CMDB 360 Data \[cmdb\_multisource\_data\] table. This data is populated only when the glide.identification\_engine.multisource\_enabled system property is set to true. You must have the cmdb\_ms\_admin role to modify property values. To set the property, navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CMDB 360 Properties**.
-   The labels on the form view for the mitigation control details record associated with vulnerable item records \(VITs\) have been enhanced for more clarity. These updates make the interface more user-friendly by expanding abbreviations on the form view, such as changing "EDR" to "Endpoint Protection."

 -   **Coral theme**

Coral is now the default theme for new portal, web, and mobile experiences with Next Experience or Core UI enabled. This theme provides a fresh look and feel, featuring brand-neutral illustrations to enhance your user experience. A dark theme option is available for web and mobile experiences.
