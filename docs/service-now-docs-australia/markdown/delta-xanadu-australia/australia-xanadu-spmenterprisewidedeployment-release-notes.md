-   **[Partitions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-partition-ewd&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Separate and control record visibility across functions using partitions.

    -   Create partitions for functions such as IT Operations, HR, and Finance using the EWD admin \(sn\_spm\_ewd.ewd\_admin\) role.
    -   Configure partition criteria using reference fields such as Department on the project, demand, program, and portfolio tables.
-   **[Supported tables and workspaces](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=supported-tables-for-partition-ewd&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Partitioning is supported on the following primary tables and their related entities:

        -   Project \[pm\_project\]
        -   Demand \[dmn\_demand\]
        -   Program \[pm\_program\]
        -   Portfolio \[pm\_portfolio\]
Related entities such as cost plans, resource plans, and planning items automatically inherit the partition value from the parent record.

    -   Partition enforcement applies automatically at runtime across the following workspaces:
        -   Strategic Planning Workspace
        -   Portfolio Planning Workspace
        -   Project Workspace
        -   Resource Management Workspace
-   **[Assign PMO role for visibility across all partitions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=assign-pmo-roles-for-visibility-across-all-partitions&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Assign the EWD PMO \(sn\_spm\_ewd.ewd\_pmo\) role to users or user groups who require visibility across all partitions, regardless of their assigned partition role. This role is intended for PMO users such as organization leads who require enterprise-wide visibility across all departments.

-   **[Update existing records with partition details scheduled job](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=update-partition-details-for-existing-records&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Populate partition details on records in the project, demand, program, portfolio, and planning item tables that were created before partition configuration was completed. Run this job only after completing partition configuration and assigning partition roles to users or user groups.
