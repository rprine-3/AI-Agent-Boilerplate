Xanadu

</td><td>

-   **[Generate an audit report for an engagement using Microsoft Word template](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-audit-report&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Audit Workspace to generate audit reports for an engagement using Microsoft Word template to collaborate with your auditors in an effortless and user-friendly manner. You can manage the generated report as a cloud file either on cloud \(Microsoft SharePoint\) or as a sys\_attachment that is attached to the engagement record.

-   **[Cloud document management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-cloud-docs-using-onedrive-int&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Upload documents from your local computer as cloud files and link them to any record in ServiceNow. You can upload files to a predefined folder path and location.

-   **[User role enhancements in Audit Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_RolesInstallWAudit&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following roles have been added:

    -   Use the Audit approver \(sn\_audit.approver\) role to approve an engagement and audit plan. Anyone with this role can be a part of an approver list. This role is also classified as a lite operator role.
    -   Use the Audit reader \(sn\_audit.reader\) role to view the audit-related entities, such as engagements, plans, observations, and audit tasks. Anyone with this role has exclusive read access to all the entities in the Audit Management application. This role is also classified as a lite operator role.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Matrix report in the Audit Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=matrix-report-audit-ws&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Analyze relationships between different variables by using a Matrix report that presents data in a structured format. Assess and document risks and the internal controls designed to mitigate those risks through the Risk and Controls Matrix.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **Audit Period Start and End Dates [\[Placeholder link text to key t\_CreateEngagement\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_CreateEngagement&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Set audit period start and end dates directly on Engagement records to focus audits on specific time-frames. The system displays only indicator results that fall within your defined audit period, keeping the audit time-frame separate from the overall engagement time-frame. This helps you audit past or future periods without affecting the broader engagement timeline.

-   **[\[Placeholder link text to key unified-content-management\_0\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=unified-content-management_0&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify the installation of pre-configured content packs with the new Unified content management icon in the Audit Workspace. Content Accelerator includes the Digital Operational Resilience Act \(DORA\) content pack, offering citations and authority documents for DORA compliance. Audit shared manager and Audit WS supervisor roles can access Content Accelerator.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Audit entry fields on GRC objects](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=audit-entry-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Classify the following GRC objects as third-line audit records using the new audit entry option:

    -   Entity
    -   Engagement
    -   Control objective
    -   Control
    -   Risk statement
    -   Risk
Control visibility with role-based access so that only users with the sn\_audit\_ws.third\_line\_manager role can view audit entry \(third-line\) records. The **Audit entry** option is selected by default when the third-line manager creates a record and is set to read-only after the record is saved.

**Note:** An administrator must manually assign the sn\_audit\_ws.third\_line\_manager role to a user to use this feature.

-   **Accessibility information**
    -   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

    -   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%. This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
