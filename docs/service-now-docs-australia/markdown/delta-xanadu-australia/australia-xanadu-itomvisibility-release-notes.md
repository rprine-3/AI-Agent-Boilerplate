# Combined ITOM Visibility release notes for upgrades from Xanadu to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for ITOM Visibility from Xanadu to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family ITOM Visibility release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Xanadu to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading ITOM Visibility to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

-   **Upgrade information**

3DES support is planned for permanent removal from the MID Server for MID Servers with SSH-based Discovery or SSH-based integrations. For more information, see [3DES deprecation in SSH from Xanadu \[KB1644950\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1644950).

After upgrading to Yokohama, a Fix Script named "Add Explicit Public SNMP Credential" might create a public SNMP credential in Production instances. This could lead to unnecessary records via Discovery. The Fix Script is present in Yokohama instances, including OOB. Before applying the upgrade of Discovery core, Yokohama version, verify the fix script behavior in a sandbox environment. Remove the public SNMP credentials if not required.

    -   [Azure Marketplace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=azure-cloud-discovery-patterns&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) - Available with the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns November 2024 store release \(1.21.0\). The pattern supports the discovery of the following Azure Marketplace products:

-   **[Oracle Java process discovery](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oracle-glas-discovery&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Discover Java processes to comply with Oracle licensing agreements- Use the ITOM Oracle GLAS plugin \(1.8.4\) November 2024 store version to track Java installations and usage.

-   **[MID Server features for better discovery performance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-server-rn&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Run other applications without storing any credentials on the instance with the Microsoft Azure Key vault.
    -   MID Server supports log file compression. The new log file handler settings are available as MID Server properties on the instance. The compression mode isn't enabled out of the box.
-   **[Use CMDB based mapping to create new application services](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-based-mapping&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Automated Service Suggestions and CMDB data instead of the MID Server, to create new application services.

-   **[Use the latest CNO for Visibility features](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cnov-configuring&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 3.6.3, benefit from new features in Cloud Native Operations for Visibility.

    -   Upgrade the CNO for Visibility Informer from the ServiceNow instance.
    -   Control Informer execution parameters from the instance.
    -   Store instance credentials in the Microsoft Azure Vault when Informer uses the Azure Kubernetes Engine \(AKS\)
    -   Enable Informer to connect to the instance using OAuth2.0 authorization
-   **[Enjoy multi-architecture support for docker image](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cnov-deploy-prepare&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 3.9.0 \(Informer version 2.3.0\), the docker image supports both arm64 and amd64 architectures. Upgrading from the previous image to the new one will not cause any disruptions. However, the new image requires more storage space in your image repository than the previous one.

-   **[Change the Informer's extensibility settings from the instance](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cnov-params-override&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 3.9.0 \(Informer version 2.3.0\), update the Informer's extensibility configuration directly from the Instance using the **Additional resources ConfigMap** parameter. By providing a JSON map with keys such as `resources`, `mappings`, and `mappings_oob`, you can instruct Cloud Native Operations for Visibility to retrieve additional information. If one of these keys exists and the system finds a change, it patches the ConfigMap and restarts the Informer.

-   **[View the OpenShift version in the Cluster version field on the Kubernetes Cluster CI](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cnov-deploy-install&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 3.9.0 \(Informer version 2.3.0\), see the OpenShift version and the Kubernetes Cluster version in one place. OpenShift operates on top of Kubernetes, so there's an OpenShift version and a Kubernetes Cluster version. By installing the Informer with the **--set openShift=true** flag, the system adds the OpenShift version number to the **cluster\_version** field on the Kubernetes Cluster CI in addition to the Kubernetes Cluster version.

-   **[Use Service Fingerprints to refine the selection of application service candidates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-serv-suggest&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Explore unique, classified components of application service candidates provided by Automated Service Suggestions. By supplying specific information such as the product name and description, gain deeper insights into the most suitable candidate to convert to an application service.

-   **[Streamlined access to Cloud Service Accounts in Discovery](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=discovery-admin-workspace-home&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Discovery Admin Workspace version 1.10.0, Cloud Service Accounts can be accessed directly from the Discovery section of the navigation menu.


 -   **[Name updates in Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=red-hat-virtualization-discovery&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

    -   The label for the \[cmdb\_ci\_rhv\_ldc\] datacenter type has been changed from RHV LDC to oVirt LDC

-   **[Automate your certificate workflows using Keyfactor EJBCA and ACME](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=automate-certificates-ejbca-acme&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version XX of Certificate Inventory and Management, you can automate the life cycle of requesting, renewing, and revoking your certificates by integrating the Keyfactor EJBCA certificate authority with the ACME automated certificate management environment. Predefining your routing policies enables automated completion of the fields in your Certificate Signing Request \(CSR\) and provides a secure environment for an automated flow of certificates.

-   **[Discover a Root Certificate from a Browser](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=discover-root-certificate-browser&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Standard Discovery collects information about the certificates stored in your servers. You can also discover root certificates stored outside your servers and connect them to your certificate chain.

-   **[Prevent credential exposure by updating HTTP Classify behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-an-http-classifier&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The HTTP Classify probe no longer attempts credentials over the HTTP protocol by default. This change enhances security by helping prevent potential exposure of credentials over unencrypted connections. To override this behavior, a new MID Server property, **mid.http\_classy.allow\_credentials\_over\_http**, has been introduced. Enabling this setting might expose credentials to man-in-the-middle \(MitM\) attacks. Therefore, it’s strongly recommended to keep this property set to false and use HTTPS whenever possible.
