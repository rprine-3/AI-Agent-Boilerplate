If you are a VRM user upgrading to TPRM, when upgrading to Vancouver or later from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. This means upgrading from Utah to Vancouver, Vancouver to Washington DC, and so on. If the scripts do not run in the correct order, it can result in data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

 For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **Upgrade information**

Starting with the Vancouver release, if you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM, from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. This means upgrading from one release to the next rather than skipping to the latest release. Not running scripts in the correct order can result in data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 20.2.4, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

-   **Upgrade information**

If you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Vancouver or a later release from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Utah to Vancouver, Vancouver to Washington DC, and so on. If the scripts don’t run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn’t reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM and the differences between the Smart and Classic Assessment engines, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 21.0.3, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

The Zurich release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform®. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. Refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) for additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings.

Australia

-   **Upgrade information**

If you're a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Australia from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Xanadu to Yokohama, Yokohama to Zurich, and so on. If the scripts don't run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) is set to the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition is irreversible.

**Warning:** Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so can result in unexpected issues.

Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content. Update any customizations that reference the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

After upgrading to version 22.3.3, the `grc_business_user` and `grc_reader` roles are no longer directly inherited by TPRM roles. During upgrade, most users are automatically migrated to new feature‑specific roles. Users with custom role combinations may not be migrated automatically and require manual review before the grace period ends.
