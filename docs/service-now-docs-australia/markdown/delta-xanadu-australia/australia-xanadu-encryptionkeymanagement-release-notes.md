-   **Upgrade information**
    -   The GlideEncrypter API uses the three-key Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption standard which [NIST 800-131A Rev 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf) has recommended against using after 2023. The following changes are taking place in the Yokohama release in preparation for a full deprecation of GlideEncrypter/3DES in the future.
        -   New Yokohama instances can’t use GlideEncrypter. All base system scripts have been changed to use alternative encryption processes.
        -   if you’re upgrading your Yokohama instances, you can still use 3DES, but you can also disable 3DES usage with a system property.
        -   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

-   **Upgrade information**
    -   In previous releases, the GlideEncrypter API used the three-key Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption standard, which [NIST 800-131A Rev 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf) has recommended against using after 2023.
