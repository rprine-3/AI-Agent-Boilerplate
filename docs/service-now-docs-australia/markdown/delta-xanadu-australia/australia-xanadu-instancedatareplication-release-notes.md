-   **Upgrade information**

Improve the performance and processing efficiency of Instance Data Replication \(IDR\) by upgrading your replication sets to V2, which uses Hermes Messaging Service. For details, see [Upgrading legacy sets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=upgrading-legacy-replication-sets-v2&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

Log rotation is automatically enabled for the Replication Payload Error \[idr\_replication\_payload\_error\] table after the upgrade. By default, the log rotation schedule is comprised of seven shards, with five days for each shard. All log entries in this table created before the upgrade are automatically truncated.
