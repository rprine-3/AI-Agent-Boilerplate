-   **[Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The skills are automatically available to appropriate role users for the application, such as ITIL roles on incident forms or change forms. This change simply activates the skill and does not touch the roles that may be needed to use the skill. The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills and agentic workflows are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill, agent, or agentic workflow is turned on automatically \(the AI asset was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills and agentic workflows that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[Preview deduplication template results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-cmdb-mng-dupe-cis-skill&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

While you're working in the manage duplicate CIs skill, select **Review existing templates** to help you to decide which deduplication template to apply. Now Assist generates a summary of the results of applying a template without actually running the remediation process. You can preview the results for any existing template. When you see the desired result in a preview, you can specify that template and proceed with the deduplication process.

-   **[View CI details on CI forms](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-skill-ci-form-help&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The skill answers your questions on CI classes and attributes to help you work in CI forms, dashboards, home pages, and other views on the workspace. You can submit similar queries on the Explore CI view.

-   **[CMDB searches can include relationships](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-awf-search&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Search queries can depend on relationships between CIs and can span multiple tables. For example, you might ask: "Search for servers that depend on databases - only Linux servers running Redhat".

-   **[Configure ACLs for AI agents and agentic workflows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=aia-security-implementation&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure the access control lists for who can discover and trigger AI agents and agentic workflows in their guided setups in AI Agent Studio. You can determine whether an AI agent or agentic workflow behaves as a dynamic user or as an AI user.
