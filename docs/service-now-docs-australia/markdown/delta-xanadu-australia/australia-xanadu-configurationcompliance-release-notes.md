-   **Upgrade information**

If you are currently using Configuration Compliance, and you do not intend to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), install a version below v30.x of Configuration Compliance and for upgrades to supported third-party integration applications.

The Missing Assets \[sn\_vul\_wiz\_missing\_asset\] table used for storing assets imported by the backfill integrations for the [Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vr-wiz-exploring-host-cf&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) is deprecated. If you are currently using the Vulnerability Response with Wiz integrations, after updating to version 1.1, you must backdate any of your existing Wiz primary integrations by three days and run them. Please review more information about the Wiz integration at [SecOps articles on the Security Operations Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/secops-articles/announcement-wiz-integration-with-servicenow-secops/ta-p/3325055).

For more information about the released versions of the Vulnerability Response application as well as the third-party and ServiceNow applications that are compatible with the Zurich release, see the [Vulnerability Response Compatibility Matrix and Release Schema Changes \[KB0856498\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0856498) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   **Upgrade information**

If you're currently using Configuration Compliance, and you don't intend to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), install a version previous v30.x of Configuration Compliance and for upgrades to supported third-party integration applications.

Starting with Australia Patch 5, Now Assist for Vulnerability Response is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

ServiceNow Otto® is the new AI experience brand. This change is reflected in the name of ServiceNow products, including the Now Assist for Vulnerability Response product name, which will be replaced with ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management. Your product entitlements remain unchanged. Check your entitlements to determine your access to specific features.

The Missing Assets \[sn\_vul\_wiz\_missing\_asset\] table used for storing assets imported by the backfill integrations for the [Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vr-wiz-exploring-host-cf&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) is deprecated. If you're currently using the Vulnerability Response with Wiz integrations, after updating to version 1.1, backdate any of your existing Wiz primary integrations by three days and run them. See more information about the Wiz integration at [SecOps articles on the Security Operations Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/secops-articles/announcement-wiz-integration-with-servicenow-secops/ta-p/3325055).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Qualys Integration – API enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=qualys-rest-messages-cc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Qualys Integration has been upgraded to support newer Qualys API versions across Host Detection, Host List, Knowledgebase, PC Controls, PC Policies, and PCRS integrations. The integrations now ingest additional data fields, including vulnerability detection source, authentication privilege status, active status for controls and policies, and cloud metadata, giving you better visibility into your vulnerability and compliance data. Use the new `posture_api_version` integration instance parameter to choose between the default v2.0 APIs or the newer v5.0 streaming APIs for the PCRS Policy Host and PCRS Test Results integrations.

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Activate the Wiz Asset Integration and identify resource types for import](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=wiz-assets-resources-tab&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhancements to the Wiz integration include:

    -   Starting with version 32.1 \(USEM\) and version 4.1 \(non-USEM\), the Asset integration is deactivated by default. It is not a mandatory prerequisite for the other Wiz integration imports.

If you choose to activate it, the Asset integration will retrieve assets for all resource types if you don't specify the ones you want on the **Asset Integration Configuration** tab. To avoid importing vulnerability data you don't need, identify only the resources \(assets\) that you want to import with this integration.

    -   Resource Type is no longer a mandatory field for configuring the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz. You can now save Wiz configurations for the integrations without specifying a Resource Type, simplifying setup for use cases where specifying a Resource Type isn't appropriate.

Enhancements to policy audits for Security Posture Control verify that retired assets are not evaluated by activated policies. If the state of an asset transitions from **Retired** back to **Active**, it is included in the next policy evaluation.

-   **[Non-zero risk score for passed test results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cc-rollupcalc-example&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

The risk score is calculated for passed test results to determine how much risk is mitigated.

-   **[Deprecated the privilege to delete a test result for the Admin role](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-config-compliance&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

As an admin with the sn\_vulc.admin role, you can’t delete a test result. This privilege is now given to the sn\_vulc.delete granular role.


-   **[Updates to the Risk Score calculation for a Remediation Task](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=v11create-rollup-calc&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**
