-   **[CAM supports the OSCAL format to export control-related information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oscal-support-cam&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Export SSP files in the OSCAL format based on various models such as SSP, Profile, Catalog, and Catalog overlay. The generated report is compatible to share the information with other systems. CAM supports the National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) recommended OSCAL format to provide control-based information in machine-readable formats.

-   **[CAM ATO artifacts](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-ato-artifacts-cam-ws&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate ATO artifacts from an authorization package in Microsoft Word format for the following reports:

    -   SSP
    -   Security Assessment Report \(SAR\)
    -   POA&amp;M
-   **[Enhancements in CAM user roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=assign-cam-roles&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Overlay enhancement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=prepare-auth-pkg&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Apply policies as an overlay in an authorization package to determine how the control objectives in the policy impact the baseline. This can be done in the following ways:

    -   Addition: Create control objectives to address specific requirements not covered in the baseline.
    -   Subtraction: Move existing control objectives to **Not Applicable**.
    -   Customization: Create, move existing control objectives to not applicable, or skip control objectives.
-   **[OSCAL enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oscal-cam-ws&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the OSCAL import playbook to follow a user-friendly, step-by-step approach for importing OSCAL models. Using the playbook, you can:

    -   Add multiple Catalog overlay files.
    -   Preview OSCAL data before importing them to confirm accuracy. You can preview the following:
        -   Authorization boundary
        -   Authorization package
        -   System elements
        -   Information types
        -   Baseline controls

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Support for exporting and importing the OSCAL Assessment Results \(AR\) model](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oscal-cam-ws&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.3.3, Continuous Authorization and Monitoring supports import and export of OSCAL data for Assessment Results \(AR\) format.

-   **[Skip attestations configuration for controls within a package](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=skip-attestations&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.3.3, skip the attestation stage at the package level and move controls directly from Draft to Review without completing the attestation workflow.

-   **[Control tailoring request enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=request-control-tailoring&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.3.3, control tailoring requests support changes to overlay controls. You can add new overlay controls or modify existing ones within a control tailoring request.

-   **[OSCAL export and import enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oscal-cam-ws&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.2, OSCAL import and export support additional details for various records, including status, frequency, weighting, implementation statement, control tailoring requests, overlays, and activities.

-   **[Support for exporting and importing the OSCAL Assessment Plan \(AP\) model](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=oscal-cam-ws&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.2, Continuous Authorization and Monitoring supports import and export of OSCAL data for Assessment Plan \(AP\) format.

-   **[Request control tailoring](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=request-control-tailoring&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.2, make incremental changes to control sets while preserving the state of unchanged controls without having to reset the entire package life cycle. Supported modifications include adding new controls, marking controls as not applicable, changing control allocation \(baseline to inherited or hybrid\), and modifying inheritance configurations.

-   **[Inherit from multiple providers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=inherit-from-multiple-providers&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.2, Controls can inherit individual control requirements from multiple Common Control Providers \(CCPs\) across different authorization packages. Previously, inheritance was limited to a single provider per control, which required creating duplicate inherited controls when requirements came from different sources.

-   **[Control grid view](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-controls-in-grid-view&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.2, edit implementation statements and attestation respondents directly in a hierarchical data grid through the Controls tab in an authorization package.

-   **[Control tests grid view in Engagements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-control-tests-in-grid-view&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.2, toggle between traditional related list and hierarchical data grid on the Control tests tab. Changes to assessment procedure effectiveness automatically cascade to parent control test effectiveness.

Package detail forms now use a structured vertical layout instead of the previous horizontal tab arrangement.

-   **[CAM workflow configuration enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cam-workflow-configurator&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.2, configure control button visibility, UI page access, and related list actions across different workflow steps. Previously, related list actions \(such as add or remove buttons for information types or baseline control actions\) required manual scripting to support custom workflows.

The following new state model attributes have been introduced:

    -   Required Authorization Documents Page
    -   Required Overlay Page
    -   Required Information Type Actions
    -   Required Baseline Actions
    -   Required Overlay Actions
    -   Request Control Tailoring
    -   Generate OSCAL AP
    -   Generate OSCAL AR
