# Exploring Financial Services Operations Integration with Mastercard

Use the Financial Services Operations Integration with Mastercard to automate and simplify how financial institutions manage Mastercard disputes. This integration leverages Mastercard Spoke actions and Mastercom APIs to support a range of dispute lifecycle events and ensure alignment with Mastercard specific business rules.

## Overview of Financial Services Operations Integration with Mastercard

Financial Services Operations Integration with Mastercard helps manage disputes easily and efficiently within ServiceNow. It uses Mastercard Spoke actions to support key steps in the dispute process, such as searching transactions, creating claims and chargebacks, handling pre-arbitration and arbitration, and reporting fraud.

You can find more information about the Mastercard Spoke actions and setup details in the [Mastercard Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/mastercard-spoke.md) documentation.

The application includes predefined subflows for common use cases, and you can extend them to meet custom requirements. Its adapter layer simplifies the connection to dispute workflows, helping you resolve cases faster and more accurately.

**Important:** The Financial Services Operations Integration with Mastercard provides predefined subflows. However, these subflows are not yet integrated with the Workspace.
