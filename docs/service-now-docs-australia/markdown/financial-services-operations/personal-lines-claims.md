# Personal Lines Claims dashboard

With the Personal Lines Claims dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the claim service requests that were received for your personal lines policies.

The Personal Lines Claims dashboard enables you to monitor the status of the claim cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view. For any given duration, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\), open cases that need immediate attention, and duration of closed claim cases.

**Important:** Platform Analytics Workspace is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

To access the Personal Lines Claims dashboard, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Financial Services Workspace** &gt; **Analytics Center** \(\[Omitted image "analytics-center-icon.png"\] Alt text: Analytics center icon.\).

You can also access the dashboard from the Platform Analytics Workspace. For more information about the Platform Analytics Workspace, see [Analytics Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md).
