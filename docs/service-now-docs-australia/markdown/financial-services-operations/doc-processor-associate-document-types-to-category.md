# Associate document types to a document category

Associate the relevant document types to a document category. For example, for the Proof of Identity document category, the types of documents could be Driver's License and Passport.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_doc\_processor.admin

You can associate one or more document types with a document category.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Document Processor** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Document Categories**.

2.  In the list, select the document category that you want to add a document type to.

3.  In the Document type related list, select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the document type that is displayed in document service tasks. An example is Passport.|
    |Active|Option to activate this document type to be used in document service tasks.|

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  Select the newly created Document Type record.

7.  In the Document Type record, select **New** in the Attributes related list to define an attribute for the document type.
