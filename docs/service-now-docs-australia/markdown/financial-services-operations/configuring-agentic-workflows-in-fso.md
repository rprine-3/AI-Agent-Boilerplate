</table>## Activating agentic workflows

Agentic workflows in FSO are inactive by default. To activate a workflow:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Select the agentic workflow.
3.  In the guided setup, select **Define trigger**.
4.  Select the agentic workflow trigger in the list.
5.  In the Edit trigger form, set **Active** to true.
6.  Select **Save**.

## Modifying agentic workflows

**Important:** By default, all agentic workflows and AI agent records are read only.

To modify an agentic workflow, you must first [duplicate the agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the agent within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically.

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

For more information on activating agentic workflows, triggers, and agents, see [Activate an agentic workflow template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-aia-use-case.md) and [Modify an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/modify-ai-agent.md).

## Choosing a language model service provider

You can choose which service provider to use for AI agents and agentic workflows in the AI Admin Hub console. For more information, see [Manage model providers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/edit-model-providers.md).
