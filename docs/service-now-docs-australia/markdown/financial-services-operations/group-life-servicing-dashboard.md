# Group Life Servicing dashboard

With the Group Life Servicing dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the group policy service requests that were received for your insurance services.

**Important:** The Group Life Servicing dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

The Group Life Servicing dashboard enables you to monitor the status of the policy service cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view. For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached an SLA, the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the policy service cases.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

-   sn\_ins\_group\_life.manager, required to view the dashboard widgets and data.
-   sn\_ins\_group\_life.admin, sn\_bom\_pa.admin, and pa\_admin, required to edit the dashboard.
