# Business Loan Operations dashboard

With the Financial Services Business Loan Operations dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for business loan cases. You can monitor the status of loan cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view.

**Important:** The Financial Services Business Loan Operations dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

This dashboard is automatically activated when you install the Financial Services Business Loan Operations application.

For any time period that you specify, you can view the details for the open cases, the new cases, and the average closing times of the loan cases.
