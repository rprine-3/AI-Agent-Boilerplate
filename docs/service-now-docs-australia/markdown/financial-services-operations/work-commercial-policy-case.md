# Work on a policy service case

Review a policy case for a policy service request and update its details to trigger its workflow.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ins\_policy\_b2b.bop\_processor

## About this task

The Commercial Lines Servicing modules enable processors to work on cases and tasks for commercial policy accounts. When a customer requests an insurance policy service, a policy service case is created and assigned to an insurance policy processor. After the processor updates the case details, the configured workflow is triggered. The flow triggers various tasks from the case and the assignment rules route these tasks to the appropriate back-office teams such as insurance policy, underwriting, or document service. A new task is created when an agent closes the previous task. All tasks that are associated with the case appear in respective tasks tabs.

Use the case playbook that provides the activities and tasks required to research and fulfill the request.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, under **Policy Service Cases**, open the case list.

    -   For your assigned cases, click **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all cases, click **All**.
4.  In the list, select the case to work on.

    -   To work on a case that is assigned to you by someone else, click **Accept**.
    -   To work on a case that is not assigned to you yet, assign it to yourself by clicking **Assign to me**.
    The state of the case updates to Work in Progress.

5.  Select the **Playbook** tab.

6.  Use the activities and tasks under the playbook stages to fulfill the request and resolve the case.

    **Note:** Depending on the policy service request type, a playbook might have additional or fewer activities and tasks.

    Any tasks generated during playbook activities appear in the **Tasks** tab of the case.

7.  For any ad hoc work, create a policy service task by navigating to the **Policy Service Tasks** tab of the case and clicking **New**.

8.  Click **Update**.


## Result

The case workflow triggers next tasks for underwriter and document agent and the case moves to the next stage.

## What to do next

Work on the tasks associated with the case to resolve it.
