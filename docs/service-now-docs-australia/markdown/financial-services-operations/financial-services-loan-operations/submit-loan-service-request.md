# Submit a loan service request as a requester

Help your customers by submitting a loan service request for them. As a requester in the front office, you can do this service for your customer \(consumer or business contact\).

## Before you begin

Role required: Based on the type of the customer that you are submitting the request for, you need the following roles:

-   For a personal loan service for a consumer: sn\_bom\_loan.b2c\_requestor
-   For a business loan service for a business customer \(account or contact\): sn\_bom\_loan\_b2b.requestor

## About this task

Business customers and consumers can also submit loan service requests from the Customer Service Portal, Consumer Service Portal, or another self-service portal. They can select service catalog items, fill out the necessary forms, and then submit these forms.

**Note:** For consumers to submit a request using the Consumer Service Portal, you must have the Consumer Service Portal plugin \(com.glide.service-portal.consumer-portal\) activated.

## Procedure
