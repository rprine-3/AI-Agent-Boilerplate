# Work on a document task to verify documents

Work on a document task to manage and track documents \(inbound and outbound\) that are needed for a loan service case.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   For a personal loan service case: sn\_bom\_document.b2c\_agent
-   For a business loan service case: sn\_bom\_document.b2b\_agent

## About this task

The Document Processor service determines which documents \(inbound and outbound\) are required in a workflow. If any documents must be collected or distributed to the customer, a task is automatically generated for a document agent. The task is assigned to the document service team or a document agent based on the assignment rules.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, under **Document Service**, open the task list.

    -   For your assigned tasks, click **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all document tasks, click **All**.
4.  In the list, select the task that you want to work on.

    To work on a task that is not assigned to you yet, assign it to yourself by clicking **Assign to me**.

5.  Find out which documents are required for the case:

    -   For a list of inbound documents, click the **Inbound Documents** tab.
    -   For a list of outbound documents, click the **Outbound Documents** tab.
6.  Verify the completeness of all documents that the customer has submitted \(inbound\) or the bank should share with the customer \(outbound\).

2.  Click **Request Exception**.

</table>    **Note:** Depending on the document rules, a deferment or an exception for a document might require an approval by a document agent to close the task. To approve, click the **Approvals** tab in the document and click **Approve**.

8.  Click **Close**.


## Result
