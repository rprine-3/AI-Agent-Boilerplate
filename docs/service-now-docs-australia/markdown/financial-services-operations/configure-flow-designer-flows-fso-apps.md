# Configure flows

Review the flows that are available with Financial Services Operations applications to see if these flows meet your business needs. You might need to customize these flows or design new ones as needed.

Role required: Based on the application that you are configuring, you need the following roles:

-   Financial Services Business Deposit Operations: sn\_bom\_deposit\_b2b.admin and admin
-   Financial Services Business Loan Operations: sn\_bom\_loan\_b2b.admin and admin
-   Financial Services Card Operations: sn\_bom\_card.admin and admin
-   Financial Services Complaint Management: sn\_bom\_compl.admin and admin
-   Financial Services Payment Operations: sn\_bom\_payment.admin and admin
-   Financial Services Personal Deposit Operations: sn\_bom\_deposit\_b2c.admin and admin
