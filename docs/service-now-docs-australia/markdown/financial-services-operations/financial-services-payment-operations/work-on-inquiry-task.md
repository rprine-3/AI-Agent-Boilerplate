    **Note:** If the inquiry case is not resolved or closed within the number of days that are mentioned in the **sn\_bom\_payment.inquiry\_task\_folow\_up\_interval\_in\_days** [payment property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-payment-operations/properties-installed-with-payment-operations.md), the system creates another follow-up inquiry task for the case.
