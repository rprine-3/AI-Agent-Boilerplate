# Field descriptions for a payment inquiry case

Payment inquiry cases help the inquiry agents resolve inquiries that they receive from the bank's customers or third-party banks.

When a payment inquiry request is submitted, it creates an inquiry case. Some of the fields on the case form are populated from the request from which the inquiry case is created.

After the case is assigned, an inquiry agent fills out the fields on the case when dealing with the next steps. The next steps could include investigating the case, sending emails requesting information from the recipient bank, and proposing a solution for the case.
