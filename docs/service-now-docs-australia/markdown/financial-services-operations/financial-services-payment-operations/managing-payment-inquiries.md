# Managing payment inquiries

The Financial Services Payment Operations application enables you to submit and manage payment inquiry requests from customers and third-party banks. The application supports personal and business claims and debits.

Inquiry agents in the middle and back office receive inquiries from customers and external banks.

-   Internal inquiries: These inquiries come from a bank's customers. The payment recipient could be either internal or external to the bank, which determines how an inquiry is resolved.
-   External inquiries: These inquiries come from third-party banks, which means that the payment recipient is always internal.

## Types of payment inquiries

The application enables creating the following types of payment inquiries:

-   Beneficiary Claim Non-Receipt \(BCNR\): The customer has sent a payment but the recipient claims that they didn't receive the money. These inquiries can be internal or external.
-   Payment in Error \(PiE\): The customer made a mistake when sending a payment and is trying to retrieve the money.

## How to initiate payment inquiries

-   **Internal inquiries**

    For internal inquiries such as Beneficiary Claim Non-Receipt - Internal and Payment made In Error:

    -   Branch workers and call center agents can create these requests on behalf of their customers from interaction records and the service catalog.
    -   Business customers and consumers can create these requests from the Customer Service Portal and Consumer Service Portal respectively by selecting catalog items and filling out and submitting forms.
-   **External inquiries**

    Inquiry agents can create inquiry cases for external inquiries such as Beneficiary Claim Non-Receipt - External.


## Assignment and resolution for payment inquiries

After an inquiry case is created from a submitted request, it is assigned to an assignment group or inquiry agent using assignment rules. Inquiry agents handle the next steps such as investigating the case, sending emails for requesting information from the recipient bank, and proposing a solution for the case.

Some internal inquiries can also result in the creation of a claim.
