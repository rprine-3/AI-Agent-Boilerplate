# Submit a payment inquiry request for an internal inquiry

As a front-office worker \(branch employee or call center agent\), you can submit a payment inquiry request on behalf of a customer.

## Before you begin

## About this task

Business customers and consumers can create payment inquiry requests from the Customer Service Portal and Consumer Service Portal respectively or another self-service portal by selecting service catalog items, filling out the necessary forms, and then submitting these forms.

**Note:** To use the Consumer Service Portal, activate the Consumer Service Portal plugin \(com.glide.service-portal.consumer-portal\).

Branch workers and customers can submit only internal payment inquiries such as Beneficiary Claim Non-Receipt - Internal and Payment made In Error.
