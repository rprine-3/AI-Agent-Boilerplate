# Managing payment claims and debit approvals

The payment claims capability of the Financial Services Payment Operations application enables you to submit and manage payment claims and debit approvals for your financial institution. The application supports both personal and business claims and debits.

## Types of Claims

-   **Internal claim**

    This claim comes from a customer of the bank—either from an inquiry or through an employee in the front-office \(branch or call center\) of your financial institution. Before a claim agent can resolve a claim, the agent needs to know where the refund comes from. For an internal claim, the refund type can be external or internal.

    -   An external refund type indicates that the refund comes from a third-party bank.
    -   An internal refund type indicates that the refund comes from someone at your bank. In this case, a debit approval may be required.
-   **External claim**

    This claim comes from a third-party bank. For an external claim, the refund type is always internal, which means that the refund is made by the bank internally – by a customer or the bank itself. In this case, a debit approval may be required.


## How to initiate payment claims

-   **Internal claims**

    An internal claim can be initiated in the following ways:

    -   An inquiry agent can create a claim on behalf of a customer if the inquiry case has been determined to be a valid claim. This means that the bank believes that the customer is entitled to a refund.
    -   Branch workers and call center agents can create these requests on behalf of their customers from interaction records and the service catalog.
    -   Business customers and consumers can create these requests from the Customer Service Portal and Consumer Service Portal respectively by selecting catalog items, filling out the forms, and then submitting these forms.
-   **External claims**

    Claim agents can create claim cases for refund requests that come from third-party banks.


## Debit approval

Claim agents can create debit approval cases to get approval from their customers for a refund against claims. Customers can either accept or reject the debit.
