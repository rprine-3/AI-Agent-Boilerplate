# Submit a request for an internal claim

As a front-office worker \(branch employee or call center agent\), you can submit a claim request on behalf of a customer.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_payment.requestor

## About this task

Branch workers and customers can submit claim requests only for internal claims. For information about external claims, see [Create a case for an external claim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-payment-operations/create-case-external-claim.md).

Internal claims can also be created by inquiry agents if the investigation of an internal payment inquiry case shows that it is a valid claim. For more information, see [Create a claim for a payment inquiry case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-payment-operations/create-claim-case-inquiry-case.md).
