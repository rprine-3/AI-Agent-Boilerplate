# Close a payment inquiry case

Close the case after you've created a claim case for the inquiry case or the customer has accepted your proposed solution.

## Before you begin

If the inquiry case is set to be a valid claim, ensure that you've [created a claim case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-payment-operations/create-claim-case-inquiry-case.md) for it.

If you've proposed any other solution for the case, ensure that the customer has accepted your proposed solution.

Role required: sn\_bom\_payment.inquiry\_agent or or sn\_bom\_payment.inquiry\_agent\_connector

## About this task

If there's a Customer or Consumer Service Portal for customers, they get a notification for the proposed solution on the portal from where they can choose to accept or reject the proposed solution for a case. If the customer accepts the solution proposed by the agent, the case state automatically changes to Closed.

For more information, see [Accept or reject a case solution from the Consumer Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/resolve-cases-consumer-portal.md).

**Note:** To use the Consumer Service Portal, activate the Consumer Service Portal plugin \(com.glide.service-portal.consumer-portal\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

    1.  In the **Resolution code** field, select an appropriate resolution code.

    2.  In the **Resolution notes** field, enter your comments for the proposed solution.

6.  Click **Close**.

A pre-configured email about the case closure is sent to the customer.
