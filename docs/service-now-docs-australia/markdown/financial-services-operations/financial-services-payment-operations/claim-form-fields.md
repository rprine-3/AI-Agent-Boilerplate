# Field descriptions for a claim case

Claim cases help the claim agents resolve payment claim requests that they receive from the bank's customers or third-party banks.

When a claim request is submitted, it creates a claim case. Some of the fields on the case form are populated from the request from which the claim is created.

After the case is assigned, a claim agent fills out the fields on the case when dealing with the next steps. The next steps could include investigating the case, requesting a refund from a bank or customer, and completing the refund.

## Details tab fields for a claim case

The **Details** tab on the form provides case-related information.
