# Investigate a payment inquiry case

Investigate the payment inquiry case so that you can get enough information about the case to resolve it.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_payment.inquiry\_agent or sn\_bom\_payment.inquiry\_agent\_connector

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, under **Payment Inquiry Cases**, open the case list:

    -   For your assigned cases, click **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all cases, click **All**.
4.  In the list, select the case to work on.

    -   To work on a case that is assigned to you by someone else, click **Accept**.
    -   To work on a case that is not assigned to you yet, assign it to yourself by clicking **Assign to me**.
    The state of the case updates to Work in Progress.

    For information on Payment inquiry form field descriptions, see [Field descriptions for a payment inquiry case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-payment-operations/payment-inquiry-case-form-fields.md).

5.  Review the inquiry type in the **Inquiry type** field.

6.  If the inquiry type is set to Beneficiary Claim Non-Receipt - Internal, select the recipient type in the **Recipient type** field and a recipient bank in the **Recipient bank** field.

    The **Recipient bank** field displays the list of banks that are based on the recipient type.

7.  To request any information from the recipient bank, add your request comments in the **Additional comments** field and click **Request info**.

    The state of the case updates to Awaiting info.

    For a Beneficiary Claim Non-Receipt - Internal case with external recipient, an inquiry task is automatically generated and assigned to the inquiry agent working on the case.

8.  For any ad hoc internal follow-up, create an inquiry task by navigating to the **Inquiry Tasks** tab of the case and clicking **New**.

9.  If there's an inquiry task associated with the case, [work on the inquiry task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-payment-operations/work-on-inquiry-task.md) and move it to the **Closed** state.

10. After you've received the required information from the recipient bank, update the necessary fields on the case as per the received information and change the state of the case to **Work in Progress**.

11. If the investigation shows that it's a valid claim, select **Valid claim** and create a claim for the inquiry.

    **Note:** You can set a case as a valid claim only if it's an internal payment inquiry case.
