# Work on a debit approval case to complete a refund

Work with your internal customer or bank to get the debit amount approved so that you can complete the claim refund.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the debit customer or the refund bank has approved the debit amount.

Role required: sn\_bom\_payment.claim\_agent or sn\_bom\_payment.claim\_agent\_connector

## About this task

If there's a Customer or Consumer Service Portal available for customers, they get notification for the debit approval case on the portal from where they can choose to accept or reject the requested debit amount. If the debit customer accepts the debit amount, the debit approval case state automatically changes to Closed. For more information, see:

-   [View a case from the Consumer Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/view-cases-consumer-portal.md)
-   [Accept or reject a case solution from the Consumer Service Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/resolve-cases-consumer-portal.md)

**Note:** To use the Consumer Service Portal, activate the Consumer Service Portal plugin \(com.glide.service-portal.consumer-portal\).

## Procedure

</table>4.  If the total refund amount should be debited from multiple financial accounts in parts as per the customer's instructions, set up instructions for each debit account in the **Debit instructions** tab.

5.  Get an acceptance from the debit customer or debit account for each debit account listed in the **Debit instructions** tab and complete the refund.

6.  In the **Outcome** field, select an appropriate refund outcome.

7.  In the **Outcome notes** field, enter your comments that are related to the refund outcome.

8.  Click **Close**.


## Result

-   The state of the associated claim case updates to Refund Complete.
