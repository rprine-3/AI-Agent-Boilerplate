# Commercial Lines Claims dashboard

With the Commercial Lines Claims dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the personal policy service requests that were received for your insurance services.

The Commercial Lines Claims dashboard enables you to monitor the status of the claim cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view. For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached an SLA, the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the claim cases.

To access the Commercial Lines Claims dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **Commercial Lines Claims** &gt; **Dashboard**.
