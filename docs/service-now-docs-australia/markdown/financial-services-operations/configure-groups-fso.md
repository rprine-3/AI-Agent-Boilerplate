## About this task

User groups are used across most processes in the ServiceNow AI Platform for assigning work to teams and requesting approvals.

Any rule that is applied to a group is automatically assigned to group members. For example, roles and assignment rules are automatically assigned to group members.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **User Administration** &gt; **Groups**.

2.  Create a group or modify an existing group.

    -   To create a group, click **New**.
    -   To configure an existing group, open the group that you want to configure.
3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For detailed instructions and field descriptions, see [Create a user group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateAGroup.md).

4.  Click **Submit** or **Update**.


## What to do next

-   Assign roles to the group. For more information, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).

    Configure agent connector and contributor roles for the group, if required.

    **Important:** For the agent connector or contributor role to work, they must be combined with one of the roles in CSM industry data model or Contributor users. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).
