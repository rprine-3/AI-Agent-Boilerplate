# View an insurance customer profile in Agentic Contact Center for Insurance

Review a customer's AI-generated insurance profile, financial overview, and interaction history in the Customer 360 page so that you can understand the customer's insurance relationship.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ins\_csr.servicing\_agent, sn\_ins\_csr.claims\_agent

## Procedure

1.  Open a customer record.

    -   From an active interaction, select the customer's name in the customer details card.
    -   Navigate directly to the consumer, account, or contact record from the workspace.
    The Customer 360 page opens in a separate tab.

2.  Review the **Customer summary** section for an AI-generated overview of the customer's insurance relationship.

    The summary includes two sections:

    -   **Profile**: A brief overview of the customer and their active insurance policy types.
    -   **Status**: The current state of the customer's active policies which have overdue premiums or upcoming renewals within a month.
    **Note:** The Customer summary section is only visible when the Insurance Customer Profile Summarization skill is activated. For details, see [Configure insurance customer profile summarization in ServiceNow Otto for FSO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/configure-insurance-customer-profile-summarization.md).

    For more information on the component, see [Summarize an insurance customer profile in Agentic Contact Center for Insurance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/summarize-insurance-customer-profile.md).

3.  Review the **Overview** section to assess the customer's financial and activity totals.

    The gauges displayed depend on your assigned role:

    -   **Total premiums**: The combined premium amount across all of the customer's insurance policies, broken down by product type. Visible to all agents.
    -   **Claim payouts**: The net total of approved claim payments associated with the customer, broken down by product type. Visible to agents with a claims role only.
    -   **Case distribution**: The count of open cases associated with the customer, grouped by service type. Visible to agents with a servicing role only.

4.  For a consumer, review the **Customer details** section for their profile information.

    The section displays the customer's name, contact details, date of birth, nationality, and address information.

5.  For an account, review the **Account details** and **Contact details** section for profile information.

    The **Account details** section displays the account name, primary contact, contact details, address information, and industry.

    The **Contact details** section displays the associated account, contact details, date of birth, nationality, and address information.

6.  Review the **Interaction history** section to see recent customer activity.

    The list shows recent interactions including phone and chat interactions. Use the search bar, filter, or calendar controls to narrow the list.
