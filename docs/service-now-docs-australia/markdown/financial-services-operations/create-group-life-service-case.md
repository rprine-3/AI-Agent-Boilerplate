# Create a group life service case

A processor or contributor can begin the change member info request process by creating a group life case on behalf of your customer.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ins\_group\_life.processor, sn\_ins\_group\_life.processor\_connector, or sn\_ins\_group\_life.contributor

**Note:** The applicable universal contributor role can also be assigned to create a case. For more information, see [User roles and FSO Business rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-core-roles.md).

**Important:** For the agent connector or contributor role to work, they must be combined with one of the roles in CSM industry data model or Contributor users. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).
