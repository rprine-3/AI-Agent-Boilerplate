# Complaint Management dashboard

With the Financial Services Complaint Management dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the complaints that were received for your financial services. You can monitor the status of the complaint service cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view.

**Important:** The Financial Services Complaint Management dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached an SLA, the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the complaint cases.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

-   sn\_bom\_compl.manager, needed to see the dashboard widgets and data.
-   sn\_bom\_compl.admin, needed to edit the dashboard.
