# Field descriptions for a complaint case

Complaint cases help the complaint agents resolve complaint service requests that they receive from the customers.

When a complaint service request is submitted, it creates a complaint case. Some of the fields on the case form are populated from the request from which it is created.

After the case is assigned, a complaint agent fills out the fields on the case when working on the playbook activities in the case.

## Complaint case fields

The playbook activities in the **Playbook** tab of the complaint case provide case-related information.
