# Work on a complaint task for a complaint case

Work on a complaint task to perform a legal review or to provide business unit inputs for the associated complaint service case.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_compl.agent or sn\_bom\_compl.agent\_connector

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

-   When a complaint case is identified as having a legal impact, the workflow automatically generates a complaint legal fulfillment task.
-   When a complaint agent clicks **Request business input** in the Review and response stage of a complaint case, the workflow automatically generates a complaint task for a business unit input.

If assignment rules are configured, the task is automatically assigned to an agent.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

5.  Enter the requested information in **Closure comments** field

6.  In the **Work notes** field, enter any comments.

7.  Click **Close** to close the task.
