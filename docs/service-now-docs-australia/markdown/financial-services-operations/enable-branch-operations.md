# Enable branch operations

You can enable a set of branch operations features so that managers can gain views into operational performance and cases across the branches they manage.

Branch banking enables banks to provide banking services through a wide network of branch offices, and provides customers the option to conveniently bank with a branch in their vicinity. Using branch operations features for FSO, Location managers responsible for managing operations can view performance metrics, and view and create cases, for the branches that they manage.

Branch operations for FSO includes these components:

-   Location manager contributor role \(sn\_bom.location\_manager\_contributor\)
-   Branch location support
-   Branch location field on case tables and records
-   Location manager workspace with landing page, case list, and metrics dashboard
-   Demo data

## FSO Applications that support branch operations

These FSO applications support branch operations by installing the branch location field and demo data components.

-   Financial Services Card Operations
-   Financial Services Complaint Management
-   Financial Services Credit Operations
-   Financial Services Business Lifecycle
-   Financial Services Client Lifecycle
-   Financial Services Business Deposit Operations
-   Financial Services Personal Deposit Operations
-   Financial Services Business Loan Operations
-   Financial Services Personal Loan Operations
-   Financial Services Payment Operations
-   Financial Services Treasury Operations

The following additional plugins must be installed to fully enable branch operations.

## Required plugins to enable branch operations

The following plugins install the Location manager contributor role and workspace, location table field, branch location support, and demo data components that comprise branch operations.

-   Financial Services Operations \(FSO\) application plugin - Applicable FSO application plugins install branch operations demo data and add the branch location field on case tables and records.
-   Financial Services Operations Core application plugin - The Financial Services Operations Core application plugin \(sn\_bom\) is automatically installed when you install an applicable FSO application. The sn\_bom plugin installs the Location manager contributor role \(sn\_bom.location\_manager\_contributor\). The Location manager contributor role enables a personalized Workspace with dashboard for viewing metrics and managing cases. The role can collect and submit case documents, and add staff members to a branch location.

    **Note:** The Business Location plugin must be activated for the sn\_bom.location\_manager\_contributor role to be enabled. For more information, see [Activate the Business Location plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/activate-business-location.md)

-   Business Location plugin \(com.snc.business\_location\) - The com.snc.business\_location plugin enables support for banks that interact with customers through branches. The com.snc.business\_location plugin automatically activates the Service Organization plugin \(com.snc.service\_organization\), which enables support for internal branches. For information on activating the Business Location plugin, see [Activate the Business Location plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/activate-business-location.md).

## Location manager contributor workspace

The Location manager contributor workspace contains these pages.

-   Customized landing page under the business location associated with the role. The landing page shows an overview of open cases, breakdown of open cases by application, and quick links to each installed application that enable Location managers to initiate creating cases for customers.
-   List view of cases assigned to branches managed by the role. The Location manager contributor role can open a case form record to edit the branch location field. The branch location field is editable until a case is closed.
-   Branch Performance Metrics dashboard page

The Location manager contributor role can select metric numbers from the landing or Branch Performance Metrics dashboard pages to drill down to a breakdown list or KPI Details performance analytics view.
