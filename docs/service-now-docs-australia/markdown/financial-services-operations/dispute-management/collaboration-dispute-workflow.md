# Collaboration dispute workflow

In the collaboration workflow, dispute agents work to resolve consumer disputes and processing errors. In this workflow, issuers can choose to initiate pre-arbitration and arbitration, and acquirers can respond to these events.

The transaction **Dispute Workspace** helps dispute agents in handling **Consumer disputes** and **Processing errors** within the Visa collaboration workflow. The **Dispute Workspace** includes key tasks such as initiating chargebacks, reviewing dispute responses, and managing pre-arbitration and arbitration tasks.
