# Review arbitration response

Review the arbitration response received from Mastercard and proceed to resolve the dispute. This step occurs in the Mastercard dispute process when you’ve escalated from pre‑arbitration to arbitration or skipped pre‑arbitration and moved directly into arbitration.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector.

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

This task displays during one of the possibilities in the chargeback stage:

-   An arbitration request is submitted after a pre-arbitration.
-   Arbitration is initiated directly, skipping pre-arbitration.

Review the ruling from Mastercard and choose whether to resolve the dispute or take further action.

If Card Data Security is installed and configured, **Attachments** in the contextual side panel will handle files differently in transaction records. For more information, see [Manage attachments in Card Data Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/manage-attachments-in-card-data-security.md).
