# Using the Dispute Rules Content Pack for Mastercard

By using the Dispute Rules Content Pack for Mastercard's questionnaire, your agents can help customers complete the reason code mapping for their disputes. This mapping enables the agents to categorize the dispute and determine the chargeback eligibility according to the Mastercard Chargeback Guide.

## Dispute Rules Content Pack for Mastercard workflows

When an agent disputes a transaction on behalf of a customer, a dispute service case begins and the dispute card transaction flow is triggered. This flow includes the various tasks that are specific to the case details. Each task is created when an agent closes the previous task.

1.  Create a dispute service case.

    The agent initiates the dispute service process by entering the initial case information and creating a dispute case on behalf of a customer.

2.  Initiate a dispute.

    The agent enters the dispute details, including the account being referenced, the dispute amount, and the type of dispute. The agent provides the necessary information for the available options in the type of dispute \(Authorization, Point of Interaction Error, Fraud, Cardholder Disputes, Installment Billing Dispute, Cardholder Dispute Not Classified Elsewhere\).

3.  Submit the case for investigation.

    The agent submits the case for investigation by reviewing the dispute amount, the dispute reason code, and the associated dispute reason code message.

    After submission, the agent can review the chargeback eligibility status and reason in the State of transactions panel or the **Card disputes transactions** tab.

    The following example shows the State of transactions panel.
