Review the disputed transactions and the reason for dispute.

 To modify the disputed transactions, select **Modify transactions**. Select or deselect the transactions and select **Modify** to save your changes.

 At least one transaction must be selected to continue. Multiple transactions can only be selected for Fraud dispute cases.

 To modify the dispute category and reason, select **Modify dispute reason**. Answer the questions presented, then select **Modify**.

 Each dispute can only address a single dispute category. If the reason code doesn’t match the dispute category for the case, you must cancel the case and create a new one.

**Note:** If the transaction is part of another dispute case, it will be flagged with a link to the case and information on the case outcome.

 **Note:** In case of integration with Visa and Mastercard APIs, if an error displays, refer to the **Activity stream** to see the error cause, resolve it and then select **Continue** to be able to proceed to the next activity.

**Additional questions**

</td><td>

Provide answers to any additional questions not answered by the customer and update any additional questions as required. If the dispute category changes, the system will produce a questionnaire for the newly selected category, which you must fill out. Select **Continue** when you have finished the questionnaire.

**Customer signature required**

For compliance purposes, inform the customer to sign a written statement for the unauthorized ACH debit and submit the document emailed to them.

 According to NACHA guidelines, customer must send a signed acknowledgment to the bank acknowledging they are disputing an unauthorized ACH debit transaction under certain reason codes.

 A pre-written email template is sent to the customer. This email can be e-signed and can be amended by your organization as needed.

 Once the customer completes this, the signed statement is added as an attached document on the Document verification task created for the case.

 **Note:** In order for users to view the Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit \(WSUD\) document, the Document Templates \[sn\_doc\] plugin must be activated.
