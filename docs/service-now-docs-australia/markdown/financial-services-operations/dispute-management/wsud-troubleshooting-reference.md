# Written Statement for Unauthorized Debit \(WSUD\) Troubleshooting

This reference topic provides troubleshooting topics for common issues in the Written Statement for Unauthorized Debit \(WSUD\) process. This includes customer signature activities, email notifications, and document verification tasks.

## Additional troubleshooting information

For the Written Statement for Unauthorized Debit playbook activity for ACH disputes:

-   The `sn_doc_processor.external_user` role is added to `sn_bom.customer` and `sn_bom.consumer`, enabling customers and consumers to view and electronically sign WSUD documents through the portal.
-   The `sn_doc_processor.agent` role is added to `sn_bom_credit_card.dispute_agent` and `sn_bom_credit_card.dispute_agent_connector`, allowing dispute agents and connectors to verify and manage WSUD documents during case review.
-   When transactions are modified in the **Review** lane, the WSUD document is automatically regenerated and a new e-signature link is sent to the customer when the required conditions are met.
-   If the dispute reason code is changed to one that doesn't require a WSUD, the associated Document Verification task created during intake is automatically canceled.
