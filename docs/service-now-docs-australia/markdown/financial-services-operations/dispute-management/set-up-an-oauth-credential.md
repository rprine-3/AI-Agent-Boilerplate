# Set up a credential

Create a credential to enable secure authentication for Card Data Security integrations. This credential authenticates your ServiceNow instance with the tokenizer service gateway.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

For card network integrations \(Visa, Mastercard\), this task requires an OAuth Provider created for Card Data Security. See [Set up an OAuth Provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/set-up-an-oauth-provider.md) for more information.

For Verifi integration, this task requires the unique API key provided by the tokenizer service during connection setup.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Integration Hub** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select the credential type.

    -   For Verifi integration, select **API Key Credentials**.
4.  For card network integration, enter the following field values.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |**Name**|&lt;Name of the OAuth 2.0 credential&gt;|
    |**OAuth Entity Profile**|&lt;The default profile from the OAuth Provider created for Card Data Security&gt;|

    For Verifi integration, enter the following field values.

    |Field|Value|
