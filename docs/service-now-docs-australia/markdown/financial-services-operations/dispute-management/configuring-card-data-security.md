Where to perform

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

[Provision our tokenizer service and complete the onboarding procedure](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2830577)

</td><td>

Ensure that you have provisioned our tokenizer service and that you have completed the onboarding procedure. Tokenizer service accounts are hosted on multi-tenant shared infrastructure, isolated by account and vault boundaries.

 For more information, contact your ServiceNow account representative.

</td><td>

Tokenizer service

</td></tr><tr><td>

[Create tokenizer service vault](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2830577)

</td><td>

Create the tables in our tokenizer service. These tables will contain the PCI data from Third-Party Systems.

</td><td>

Tokenizer service

</td></tr><tr><td>

[Set up connections, service accounts, and context-aware authorization in the tokenizer service](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2830577)

</td><td>

Set up the connections, service accounts, and context-aware authorization to enable communication between your ServiceNow instance, the tokenizer service, and the Third-Party System.

[Set up OAuth for Card Data Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/set-up-oauth-for-card-data-security.md)

</td><td>

For OAuth authentication, follow these steps to set up connectivity with your ServiceNow instance. These connections are required to get file metadata and download URLs from files hosted in the tokenizer service vault.

**Note:** You must set up OAuth to use the Card Data Security container components, including the [PAN reveal components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/reveal-a-pan-using-card-data-security.md) and the [file viewing component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/manage-attachments-in-card-data-security.md).

[Customize your card disputes workflow with the Card Data Security container](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/card-data-security-component.md)

</td><td>

Card Data Security includes a [PAN reveal component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/reveal-a-pan-using-card-data-security.md) and a [document viewing component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/manage-attachments-in-card-data-security.md).
