# Managing dispute service requests

Dispute management enables agents to create dispute cases for both personal and business debit and credit card accounts, as well as non-card ACH transactions, and automate the process of dispute routing and fraud-related activities. Learn how agents initiate, investigate, and resolve dispute cases for personal and commercial customers.

By using the dispute service case and its associated tasks, you can manage dispute cases for your customers. Customers can dispute a transaction on their account due to several reasons, such as:

-   Unauthorized transactions
-   Fraudulent activities
-   Billing errors
-   Receipt of damaged, unsatisfactory, or returned goods
-   Any other valid reasons for dispute

## Automated workflow

Dispute management incorporates predefined workflows that streamline the process. When a dispute case is initiated, a dispute request flow is automatically generated, based to the specific case requirements. This workflow is based on the following factors:

-   Information provided during the initiation stage of the case.
-   Decisions made according to predefined business rules.
-   Inputs obtained from previous tasks.

The tasks assigned to a dispute case are determined by the information or decisions updated within the case. These dispute tasks are then assigned to dedicated dispute agents, who are prompted to perform follow-up actions, such as notifying the merchant and issuing provisional or final credit.

To resolve cases, agents perform various activities such as performing investigations, and initiating chargebacks for the tasks assigned to them. Both the case and its tasks are assigned to the assignment groups or agents by using assignment rules.

For more information, see [Overview of the Dispute Management workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/dispute-management-workflows.md).

## Financial adjustments

Financial adjustments are changes made to an account during a dispute, such as issuing a temporary \(provisional\) credit, reversing it, or applying a final credit based on the outcome.

In Financial Services Operations, the Financial adjustments depend on the policies, Immediate Provisional Credit, Immediate Final Credit, and No credit.

## Regulatory SLAs

In addition to regular SLAs in the dispute management workflow, the Dispute Content Pack for US Regulations is available to enable issuers in the United States to track Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) due dates that align with regulatory guidelines.
