# Review and respond to collaboration

The merchant responds to the collaboration by either providing a refund, a voucher, or a First-Party Trust evidence. If the collaboration isn’t successful, then the second presentment is awaited.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector.

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

In this task, three scenarios are possible: merchant responds to collaboration by either a voucher, a refund or a First-Party Trust evidence.

-   **Voucher**:
    -   If the cardholder accepts the voucher, the dispute ends and the transaction moves to Financial adjustments 1. For more information, see [About Financial adjustments in Mastercard disputes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/financial-adjustments.md).
    -   If the cardholder rejects the voucher, the process awaits a second presentment from the merchant.
-   **Refund**:
    -   If the cardholder receives and accepts the refund, the dispute ends and the transaction moves to Financial adjustments 1.
    -   If the refund isn’t received, the agent raises a **Second first chargeback** and waits for the merchant's second presentment.
-   **First-Party Trust** evidence indicating that this is a valid transaction:
    -   If the cardholder agrees with the provided First-Party Trust evidence, the dispute ends and the transaction moves to Financial adjustments 1.
    -   If the cardholder disagrees with the provided First-Party Trust evidence, the agent raises a **Second first chargeback** and waits for the merchant's second presentment.

For the second presentment:

-   If not received, the case favors the cardholder and the transaction moves to Financial adjustments 1, ending the dispute.
-   If received, the transaction progresses to the next task [Review chargeback response and decide on pre-arbitration or arbitration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/review-and-decide-prearbitration.md) in the chargeback process.

If Card Data Security is installed and configured, **Attachments** in the contextual side panel will handle files differently in transaction records. For more information, see [Manage attachments in Card Data Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/manage-attachments-in-card-data-security.md).
