# Allocation dispute workflow

In the allocation workflow, dispute agents work to resolve fraud and authorization disputes. Acquirers can choose to initiate pre-arbitration and arbitration, and issuers can respond. This is a part of the allocation dispute workflow for the Chargeback stage.

The transaction **Dispute Workspace** helps dispute agents in handling **Fraud** and **Authorization** within the Visa allocation workflow. The workspace includes key information such as case number, status, customer details, amount, transaction details, open and closed tasks, SLA and merchant details. The following table outlines the use case steps in this process.
