# Initiate chargeback and fill merchant response

This is a part of the collaboration dispute workflow for the **Chargeback** stage. Initiate a chargeback request for the card network issuer to credit the customer with the card network and await a response from the merchant.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab under **Card disputes service cases**, open the case list.

    -   For your assigned cases, select **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all dispute cases, select **All**.
4.  In the list, select which case you want to work on.

    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

5.  Select the transaction ID from the playbook.

6.  Select the **Initiate chargeback and fill merchant response** task.

7.  The chargeback reason code and dispute amount is displayed.

8.  Review the details and add any other details.

9.  Submit the request by selecting **Initiate chargeback**.


## Result

The questionnaire data from the **Initiate** stage is sent to Visa. The task is set to the **Awaiting External Info** state, and the form is set to read-only during this waiting period. Once you receive the response, the transaction state changes to **Work in Progress**. The activity stream displays whether the request to Visa was successful. If the request fails, the **Retrigger** option appears to retry.

## What to do next

Review the response from the merchant and fill the further details.

1.  After you receive the merchant's response, the **Dispute response** field is set to **Yes** or **No** and the next activity [Review a dispute response and initiate pre-arbitration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/review-dispute-response-and-create-pre-arbitration.md) is displayed.
2.  Select **Close task**. The next task appears based on the selected option.
