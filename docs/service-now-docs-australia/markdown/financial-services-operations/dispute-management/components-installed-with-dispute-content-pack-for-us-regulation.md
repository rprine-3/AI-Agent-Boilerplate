# Components installed with Dispute Content Pack for US Regulations

The Dispute Content Pack for US Regulations plugin installs components such as SLAs and additional plugins.

## Plugins installed

**Note:** The Dispute Content Pack for US Regulations application is dependent on the Financial Services Card Operations application.

|Plugin|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Financial Services Card Operations \[com.sn\_bom\_credit\_card\]|Enables quick processing of credit card applications and card transaction disputes.|
|Dispute Content Pack for US Regulations \[sn\_disp\_reg\_cp\_us\]|Enables issuers in the United States \(US\) to track dispute cases and conform with regulatory guidelines.|

## Tables installed

The Dispute Content Pack for US Regulations application includes no new tables.

## Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) definitions installed

The following SLA definitions are preconfigured with Dispute Content Pack for US Regulations.

**Note:** Billing cycle date and Statement date are retrieved from the financial account via core banking integrations.

An SLA will not trigger if the billing cycle days or statement generation date are empty.

SLA durations are calculated from key regulatory dates — primarily the dispute reported date, and, for Reg Z, the statement date and billing cycle date. When a task is created after the dispute is reported \(for example, provisional credit\), the elapsed time between the reported date and task creation is accounted for so the SLA still reflects the regulatory window.
