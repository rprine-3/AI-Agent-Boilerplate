# Review a case filing response and appeal the decision

An appeal can be created by the issuer or acquirer if either party isn’t satisfied with the arbitration ruling from Visa. Review the case filing response and receive the decision letter from Visa.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector

## About this task

After reviewing the case filing response, Visa issues a decision letter that supports either the acquirer or the issuer. If either party isn’t satisfied with the decision, they can file an appeal.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

    -   For your assigned cases, select **Assigned to me**.

    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.
