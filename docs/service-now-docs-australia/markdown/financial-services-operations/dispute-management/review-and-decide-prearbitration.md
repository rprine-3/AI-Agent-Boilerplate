# Review chargeback response and decide on pre-arbitration or arbitration

Review second presentment for the chargeback and initiate pre-arbitration or arbitration, as required for the dispute workflow of the Chargeback stage. For Mastercard transaction chargeback, you can skip raising the pre-arbitration and directly raise the arbitration request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector.

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

This task becomes active when the merchant proceeds with a second presentment after the collaboration step is not successful. The following outcomes are possible:

-   Mark as **Resolved**: Review the second presentment, mark it as **Resolved**, and close the chargeback. The transaction moves to Financial adjustments 1.
-   Mark as **Unresolved**: If the second presentment is **Unresolved** and the cardholder decides not to proceed further with the chargeback, the transaction moves to Financial adjustments 2.
-   Escalate to pre-arbitration or arbitration: If the second presentment is **Unresolved** and the cardholder decides to proceed with the chargeback, then create a pre-arbitration or arbitration.
    -   If the merchant responds, the task progresses to the next stage.
    -   If the merchant doesn't respond within the specified time frame, a response from Mastercard displays on your **Landing page** and according to which you can manually take an action on the disputed transaction.

        **Note:** You can access this response from your **Landing Page** &gt; **Acquirer deadline expired tasks**. For more information, see [Dispute agent workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/workspace-for-agent.md)


If Card Data Security is installed and configured, **Attachments** in the contextual side panel will handle files differently in transaction records. For more information, see [Manage attachments in Card Data Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/manage-attachments-in-card-data-security.md).

    You can also review the **Chargeback reason code and description** to review the chargeback reason codes.

    **Note:** In case the merchant is providing documents with the chargeback response, check the **Activity** section for the document attachment or a download failure message.

    **Note:**

    -   You must upload a single `.zip` file whenever you submit documents to Mastercard.
    -   When integrated with Mastercard's Mastercom APIs, the system automatically compresses multiple attachments into a single zip file. It also validates attached files against Mastercard requirements for file type and size, and alerts you when any attachment doesn’t meet Mastercard requirements.
