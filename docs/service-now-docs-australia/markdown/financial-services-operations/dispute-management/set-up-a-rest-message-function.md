# Set up tokenized REST message record

To use tokenized data with a Third-Party System, update the endpoint URL for the Third-Party System's REST message entry in ServiceNow.

## Before you begin

Set up your Third-Party System connections in our tokenizer service. For more information, see [Initial setup for Vault schema, Connections and Service Account for Card data security \(KB2830577\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2830577).

Install and set up integrations to the Third-Party Systems \(such as Visa Spoke or Mastercard Spoke\). Card Data Security requires these integrations to function correctly. For more information, see [Integrating with spokes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/spokes.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **Outbound** &gt; **REST Message**.

2.  Open the Visa Resolve Online or Mastercom record.

    Create a new REST Message record if you don't see one for your Third-Party System. For more information, see [Create a REST message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/t_ConfiguringARESTMessage.md).

3.  For the **Endpoint** field in the REST message form, enter the connection's base URI from the tokenizer service.

    \[Omitted image "rest-message-endpoint.png"\] Alt text: Image showing the Endpoint field containing the connection base URL from the tokenizer service.

    The connection's base path can be viewed in the tokenizer service administration website by navigating to **Connections**, expanding the connection, and selecting **Sample Request** on a route. The base URL is the domain name of the value in the **Path** field.

## What to do next

Repeat these steps for each REST message entry you need to set up.
