# Review the pre-arbitration response and create a case filing

Review the merchant’s response to the pre-arbitration and create a case filing.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector

## About this task

After you receive the merchant’s response for pre-arbitration, the response is updated in the system and the task is moved to closure automatically.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab under **Card disputes service cases**, open the case list.

    -   For your assigned cases, select **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all dispute cases, select **All**.
4.  In the list, select which case you want to work on.

    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

5.  Select the transaction ID from the playbook.

    The **Chargeback** stage is initiated for the transaction.

6.  Select the **Review pre arbitration response and create case filing** task.

7.  Review the acquirer’s pre-arbitration response details in the **Pre arbitration response received** field of the record.

    You can also view the merchant response as an attachment in the activity stream.

    **Note:** If Card Data Security is installed and configured, **Attachments** in the contextual side panel will handle files differently in transaction records. For more information, see [Manage attachments in Card Data Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/manage-attachments-in-card-data-security.md).
