**Configure roles and user groups**

</td><td>

Determine the roles of the individuals that you need to work on the claim cases for your line of business. Set up the roles to support the permissions that are required to adjudicate a claim. The roles should inherit the included roles from FSO core. For more information, see [Managing roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/ua-creating-roles.md).

 Required roles include:

 -   Viewer: Included in the Individual Life Claims application and inherits the viewer role, and account or customer data viewer roles from FSO core. This role can view the customer, case, and policy information for your line of business.
-   Adjuster: Included in the Individual Life Claims application and inherits the core adjuster role, and document processor agent role, from FSO core. This role evaluates the claims for your line of business.
-   FNOL Agent: Included in the Individual Life Claims application and inherits the first-notice-of-loss \(FNOL\) representative core role. This FNOL agent role is shared across all lines of business.
-   Manager: Included in the Individual Life Claims application and inherits the death benefit claims adjuster role. This role contains the adjuster roles for all your lines of business. This role has the permission to view Performance Analytics dashboards. This role is shared across all lines of business.
-   Admin: Included in Individual Life Claims and inherits the service definition admin core role. This role performs the configurations that are required for the application. This role is shared across all your lines of business. You may not need to make any changes to this role.

**Set up script includes**

</td><td>

Use script includes to store JavaScript that runs on the server. By using script includes in your claims flow, you enable reusability and inheritance from the base objects. Add the following for each table that was created for your line of business:

-   An Action layer script include contains the UI-level action functions.
-   A Service layer script include contains the middle layer business logic.
-   A DAO layer script include contains the methods to perform CRUD operations.
-   Any other script includes based on your requirements.
Modify the ClaimConstants script include to reuse the object names across functions.

For more information, see [Script includes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).

Configure the tables by reviewing the existing tables that were provided in Insurance Claim Core and the tables included in this application, and make changes according to your requirements.Configure access control lists \(ACLs\) on these tables to give the appropriate permissions to the roles and personas who work on the cases and tasks.

**Note:** The claims data model supports working on a single case with either a single policy, or multiple policies, or beneficiaries.
