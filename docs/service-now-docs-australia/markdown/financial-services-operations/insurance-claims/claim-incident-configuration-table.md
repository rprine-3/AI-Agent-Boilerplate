# Claim Incident Configuration table

Associate the service definition of a case with the incident and adjuster task service definitions by using the Claim Incident Configuration \[sn\_ins\_claim\_incident\_config\] table in the Insurance claims application.

## Claim Incident Configuration table overview

You can define the claim incidents that can be created in the Insurance claims workflow by making an entry in the Claim Incident Configuration \[sn\_ins\_claim\_incident\_config\] table. This incident type also creates an adjuster task in the system for the corresponding case so that you don't have to notify the adjuster about the case.

To access the Claim Incident Configuration \[sn\_ins\_claim\_incident\_config\] table, set the application scope of your instance to **Insurance claims**, and then navigate to **All** &gt; **Insurance claims** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Claim incident configurations**.

The following example shows the table fields of the Claim Incident Configuration \(sn\_ins\_claim\_incident\_config\) table. For more information, see the next section.\[Omitted image "claim-incident-configurations-table.png"\] Alt text: Claim Incident Configuration table in Insurance claims.

</table>## Travel insurance example of the Claim Incident Configuration table

In the following travel insurance line of business \(LOB\) example, the claim incident configuration is reflected in the workflow when reporting a travel claim. The **Incident details** activity in the first notice of loss playbook shows the entries in the table and information about each entry.
