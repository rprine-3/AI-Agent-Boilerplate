# Configure the fraud score ranges with UI Builder

Configure the fraud score ranges by using the UI Builder. You can configure certain fields, such as the **Ranges** field, in the fraud information page of the CSM Configurable Workspace, so that you can set the score range.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder** &gt; **Page collections**.

2.  **CSM default record post-Details** &gt; **Fraud score** &gt; **Default**

3.  If a `Different application scope` message appears, select **Edit in original scope**.
