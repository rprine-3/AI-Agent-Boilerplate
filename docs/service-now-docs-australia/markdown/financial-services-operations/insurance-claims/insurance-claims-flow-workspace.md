# Insurance claims landing pages and workspaces

In the Insurance claims application, you can view summaries of your claims work in the landing page. You can also work on your claim tasks from the claim workspace.

## Landing pages

The following dashboards are included as part of the Insurance claims application:

-   Claims Processor landing page
-   Claims Adjuster landing page
-   Claims Manager landing page
-   FNOL landing page \(as part of Financial Services Operations Core\)

Each Insurance claims role can have a different landing page.

For example, in the included travel insurance claim line of business \(LOB\) model, the following table shows the layout of what each role sees.

</table>## Case section tabs

In the Insurance claims application, you can use section tabs to add information on the claim case. For example, in the base level travel insurance LOB model, the following table shows the section tabs that are available.

|Section tab|Description|

|Playbook|Displays the responses to the FNOL intake playbook.|
|Claim summary|Displays a summary of the claim. See [Reviewing claims in the claim summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/insurance-claims/insurance-claims-flow-workspace.md).|
|Details|Contains the details on the claim case record, such as the case number, consumer or account, insurance policy, case status, or case work notes.|
|Customer information|Contains the workspace cards that show the customer record details, policy overview, claim overview, insurance policy details, case history, or recent phone and chat interactions.|

|Tasks|Lists the adjuster tasks for this claim.|

## Reviewing claims in the claim summary

The claim summary contains an overview of the claim's status, its participants, and data about the coverages and financials.

**Note:** FNOL representatives don’t have access to this workspace.

For example, in the Insurance claims application's travel insurance LOB model, you can navigate through the sections in the following table.

|Container|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Claim details|Displays the details about the claim number, policy holder, policy snapshots, priority, stage, report date, and incident date.|

|Coverages and financials|Displays the coverages, reserves, and payment information for this claim.|
|Notes and activities|Displays the work activity and work notes against this claim.|

## Working on adjuster tasks in the claim workspace

Use the claim workspace to get a unified view of all the actions that you can perform as an adjuster on an Insurance claims claim. From the claim workspace, you can work on a claim to verify documents, evaluate claim coverages, determine claim payout details, and approve a settlement for a claim.

For example, in the included travel insurance LOB model, you can navigate through the sections that are shown in the following table.

|Container|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Claim details|Reviews the details about the claim number, policy holder, policy snapshots, priority, stage, report date, and incident date.|
|Incident details|Reviews the details about the incident records.|
|Claim participants|Views the claim participants and their roles.|
|Adjuster assignment details|Updates the assignment group and who the case is assigned to.|
|Tasks|Views, creates, and works on the adjuster tasks for the current claim case.|
|Coverages and financials|Works on the claim coverages, reserves, and payments.|
