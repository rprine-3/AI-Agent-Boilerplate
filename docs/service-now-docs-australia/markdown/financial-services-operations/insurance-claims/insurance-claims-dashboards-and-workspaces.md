# Setting up Insurance claims workspaces and dashboards

You can set up the workspace and dashboards for each persona by using the Insurance claims application.

## Workspaces included in Insurance claims

The following workspaces are included in Insurance claims:

-   Claim Summary \(360\)
-   Claim Workspace

For more information about these workspaces, see [Insurance claims landing pages and workspaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/insurance-claims/insurance-claims-flow-workspace.md).

You can modify these workspaces in UI Builder. You can also customize the subpages in these workspaces by creating a variant.
