# Grant the Insurance claims roles access to an insurance policy table

Grant the Insurance claims contributor \(sn\_ins\_gen\_claim.fnol\_representative\) and agent \(sn\_ins\_gen\_claim.processor\) roles with access to an insurance policy table by using the Insurance claims application. This way, the users with these roles can view the policy details when they’re processing claims.

## Before you begin

Create a role that can access a table that extends the Insurance Policy \(sn\_bom\_ins\_policy\) table. For more information, see [Create a role to access insurance policy tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/insurance-claims/create-roles-acls-and-grant-access.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Set the application scope in your instance to **Insurance claims**.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Users and Groups** &gt; **Roles**.

3.  Search for sn\_ins\_gen\_claim.fnol\_representative and open the record.

4.  In the Contains Roles related list, select **Edit**.

5.  Add the role that can access the Insurance Policy \(sn\_bom\_ins\_policy\) table.

6.  Repeat this procedure for the sn\_ins\_gen\_claim.processor role.


## Result

The Insurance claims contributor \(sn\_ins\_gen\_claim.fnol\_representative\) and agent \(sn\_ins\_gen\_claim.processor\) roles have access to the insurance policy table. These roles can now interact with the table in an Insurance claims workflow.

## What to do next

Create an instance of the insurance policy by creating a policy record.
