# Create a role to access insurance policy tables

Create a role to enable an authorized agent to access tables that extend the Insurance Policy \(sn\_bom\_ins\_policy\) table by using the Insurance claims application. By creating a role, you ensure that only authorized agents can view the policies that are relevant to their roles.

## Before you begin

Create a table that extends the Insurance Policy \(sn\_bom\_ins\_policy\) table for a particular type of policy. For more information, see [Create an insurance policy table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/insurance-claims/create-an-insurance-policy-table.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Set the application scope in your instance to **Financial Services Operations Core**.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Users and Groups** &gt; **Roles**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  In the **Suffix** field, enter the name of the role.

5.  In the **Assignable by** field, select **sn\_bom.admin**.

    This role is an admin role of the Financial Services Operations Core application.

6.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the role.

7.  Select **Submit**.


## What to do next

Create an access control list \(ACL\) to define which roles can access an insurance policy table. For more information, see [Create an access control list for an insurance policy table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/insurance-claims/create-an-access-control-list-for-the-insurance-policy-table.md).
