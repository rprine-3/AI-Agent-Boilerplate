# Create an access control list for a claim incident table

Create an access control list \(ACL\) for a claim incident table by using the Insurance claims application. By creating an ACL, you ensure that users with specific roles can interact with tables for particular claim incidents.

## Before you begin

Set the application scope of your instance to **Insurance Claims Core**.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Tables**.

2.  Search for and open the claim incident table.

3.  Elevate your role to security\_admin.

4.  In the Access Controls related list, select **New**.

5.  Add the reader and writer roles to the Requires role list.

    Refer to the existing ACLs in the Trip Incident \[sn\_ins\_claim\_trip\] table as an example.


## What to do next

Grant Insurance claims roles access to the claim incident table so that they can read and write entries during the claim creation process.
