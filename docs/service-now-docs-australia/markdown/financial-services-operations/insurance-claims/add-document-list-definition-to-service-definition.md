# Add a document list definition to a service definition

Add a document list definition to a service definition by using the Insurance claims application so that you can define the required documents that a customer needs to provide for a particular claim.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

After setting up FSO Document Processor and creating a document list definition to detail the required documents for an insurance claim, link it to the claim's service definition by updating the Insurance claims document rules decision table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Select **Decision tables**.

3.  Open **Insurance claims document rules**.

4.  Add a new decision row to the decision table.

5.  In the Case service definition column, select your claim service definition.

6.  In the Answer column, select the document list record.

7.  Select **Save**.


## Result

This decision table executes in the background when a case is created through the first notice of loss playbook. It also creates a document verification task on the case.
