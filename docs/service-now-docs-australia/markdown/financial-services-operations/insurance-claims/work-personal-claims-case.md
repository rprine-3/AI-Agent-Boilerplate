## Result

Depending on the current stage of the case:

-   When the adjuster accepts the task, the task status sets to Work in progress.
-   When the adjuster submits a reserve or payment, if the amount is within their authorization limit, it is auto approved.
-   If the adjuster settles the claim, the claim case automatically closes, with the case status set as Closed complete, and claim stage moved to Closed rejected. System-generated work notes stating the rejection automatically add to the Activity stream for the task and claim case.
-   If one of the adjuster related tasks is approved, a task triggers to the claim processor to close the case. System-generated work notes stating the approval automatically add to the Activity stream for the task and claim case.
