# Create a coverage specification

Create a coverage specification in the Insurance claims application so that you can outline the scope and limits of the protection that is provided by an insurance policy.

When creating the coverage specification, you also create the coverage types that act as the primary data for the coverage specification and the coverage type options for each coverage type.

For example, if the coverage specification is travel coverage, then you can select the following options:

-   A coverage type may be Baggage delay.
-   The coverage type options may be \(in U.S. dollars\) $200 \(24 hours\), $300 \(12 hours\), or $500 \(12 hours\).
