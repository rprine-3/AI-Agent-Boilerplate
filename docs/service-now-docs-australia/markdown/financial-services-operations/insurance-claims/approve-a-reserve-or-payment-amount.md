# Approve a reserve or payment amount for an Insurance claims case

Approve an assigned claim reserve or a payment amount that is higher than an adjuster's approval authority for Insurance claims cases. A reserve or payment may be rejected if the requested amount doesn't support the findings from the claim investigation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ins\_gen\_claim.manager

## About this task

If an adjuster assigns a reserve or creates a payment amount that's higher than their approval authority, the claims manager receives a request to approve the amount.

This procedure references service definitions and products that are used in the included travel insurance claim line of business. Your workflow may vary depending on your configuration.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

## Result

-   If the claims manager approves the reserve or payment amount, the claim reserve task returns to the adjuster to proceed with the claim payment evaluation or settlement.
-   If the claims manager rejects the reserve or payment amount, the manager provides another recommendation. A notification of the rejected status triggers to the adjuster.
-   System-generated entries for the reserve or payment amount approval or rejection are added to the activity stream. These automated entries support auditing and tracking.
