# Business Deposit Operations dashboard

With the Financial Services Business Deposit Operations dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for deposit service requests received for your financial services. You can monitor the status of deposit service cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view.

**Important:** The Financial Services Business Deposit Operations dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

For any time period that you specify, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached an SLA, the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the deposit cases.
