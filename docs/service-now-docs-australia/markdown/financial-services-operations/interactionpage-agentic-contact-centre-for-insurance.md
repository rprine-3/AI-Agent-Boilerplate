# Interaction page for Agentic Contact Center for Insurance

The Interaction page is a dedicated workspace for insurance CSR \(customer service representative\) agents. It consolidates customer identification, interaction history, and live call transcript analysis into a single view during active customer interactions.

The Interaction page opens automatically when a CSR accepts a customer interaction, such as an inbound voice call. CSRs use this page during an active interaction with an insurance customer. It combines policyholder information, contextual history, and AI-powered assistance in a single page. The CSR can manage the entire interaction in this page—from the first interaction to case creation and wrap-up.

## Live transcript and AI-driven assistance

During an active voice interaction, a live transcript of the conversation is captured. The transcript serves as the primary input for the AI agent.

As the conversation progresses, the AI agent processes the customer's request, and displays relevant information and recommended next steps in the ServiceNow Otto panel when the CSR requests recommendations . The AI agent queries customer records, Knowledge Graph, and your configured knowledge bases.

CSRs can also type their own questions directly into the ServiceNow Otto panel at any time. The panel displays responses from the AI agent in a structured format that may include insights, recommendations, and guidance based on the content and sentiment of the conversation.

## Policyholder context summary

The customer context summary provides the CSR with an AI-generated overview of the customer before and during the call. This context-based summary is generated from the customer's profile, policies, recent interactions, and case history at the time the interaction begins, providing the CSR with immediate context without manual research .

The customer summary includes:

-   Customer or account details
-   Similar issues that the customer has previously contacted the insurer about
-   Policies and coverages affected by the current issue
-   Related cases

The customer summary is not visible when no account or consumer has been associated with the interaction.

2.  Activity stream
3.  Attachments
4.  Templates
5.  Recommended Actions

The Activity stream tab displays the activity stream for the interaction record, enabling CSRs to review and add notes without leaving the page.

## Wrap-up

The CSR wraps up the interaction when it concludes. When wrap-up codes are set up and the Wrap Up Completion ServiceNow Otto skill is configured, the CSR can generate an AI-powered chat summary. This summary provides a record of what is discussed and any action items in the interaction.
