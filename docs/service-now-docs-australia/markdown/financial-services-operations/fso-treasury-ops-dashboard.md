# Treasury Operations dashboard

With the Financial Services Treasury Operations dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the treasury service requests that were received for your financial services.

**Important:** The Financial Services Treasury Operations dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

You can monitor the status of the treasury service cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view. For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\), the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the treasury cases.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

-   sn\_bom\_treasury.manager, needed to see the dashboard widgets and data.
-   sn\_bom\_treasury.admin, sn\_bom\_pa.admin, and pa\_admin, needed to edit the dashboard.

## Access the Financial Services Treasury Operations dashboard

To access the Financial Services Treasury Operations dashboard, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Financial Services Workspace** &gt; **Analytics Center** \(\[Omitted image "analytics-center-icon.png"\] Alt text: Analytics center icon.\).

You can also access the dashboard from the Platform Analytics Workspace. For more information about the Platform Analytics Workspace, see [Analytics Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md).
