# Personal Lines Servicing dashboard

With the Personal Lines Servicing dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the personal policy service requests that were received for your insurance services.

**Important:** The Personal Lines Servicing dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

The Personal Lines Servicing dashboard enables you to monitor the status of the policy service cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view. For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\), the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the policy service cases.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles
