# Payment Operations dashboard

With the Financial Services Payment Operations dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for payment inquiries, claims, and debits.

**Important:** The Financial Services Payment Operations dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

You can monitor the status of these cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view. For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the open cases, the new cases, and the average closing times of the payment cases.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

-   sn\_bom\_payment.manager, required to view the dashboard widgets and data.
-   sn\_bom\_payment.admin, sn\_bom\_pa.admin, and pa\_admin, required to edit the dashboard.

## Access the Financial Services Payment Operations dashboard

To access the Financial Services Payment Operations dashboard, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Financial Services Workspace** &gt; **Analytics Center** \(\[Omitted image "analytics-center-icon.png"\] Alt text: Analytics center icon.\).

Alternatively, you can navigate to **All** &gt; **Payment Operations** &gt; **Analytics**.

You can also access the dashboard from the Platform Analytics Workspace. For more information about the Platform Analytics Workspace, see [Analytics Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md).

If you have upgraded from an earlier version, you can access the existing Core UI dashboard layout as usual by navigating to **All** &gt; **Payment Operations** &gt; **Dashboard**.
