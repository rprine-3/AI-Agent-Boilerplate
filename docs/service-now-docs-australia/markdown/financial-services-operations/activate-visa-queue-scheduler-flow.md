# Configure the Visa Queue Scheduler Flow

Use the Visa Queue Scheduler Flow to control the frequency at which Visa batch queues are processed. This flow runs as a scheduled job at a predefined time interval, triggering the subflow that processes incoming batch queues.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Designer**.

2.  In the Search field, search for **Visa Queue Scheduler Flow**.

3.  To set the conditions and frequency for the flow, select the **Trigger** field.

    Locate the flow you want to activate from the list of saved flows and open it.

4.  Select **Activate**.

    **Note:** When using Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa for the first time, you must activate the Visa Queue Scheduler Flow and set the desired frequency.
