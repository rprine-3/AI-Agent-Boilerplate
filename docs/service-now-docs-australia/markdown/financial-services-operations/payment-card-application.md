# Payment card

The Payment card application stores details of payment cards, which can be used across the entire card life-cycle, from issuance to servicing.

## Overview of Payment card

The Payment card application is a data model that represents payment cards that are issued to users. It supports multiple payment card types, including credit and debit cards.

It also supports storing tokenized values for sensitive data, such as the primary account number \(PAN\).

Cards in Payment card can be associated with a Financial Account in Financial Services Operations Core. This relationship can then be used in a Financial Services Operations \(FSO\) workflow that involves a card account, such as selecting a credit or debit card containing a disputed card transaction.
