# Work on a group life policy service case

Work on a group life case to change or review member information, and complete the policy service request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ins\_group\_life.processor, sn\_ins\_group\_life.contributor, or sn\_ins\_group\_life.processor\_connector

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

When a customer requires an insurance policy change, a Group life contributor, such as a relationship manager, initiates a case and updates its details, triggering the workflow. Throughout the workflow, insurance and document agents complete their assigned tasks and update the status of the case.

**Note:** Depending on the policy service request type, a workflow might have additional or fewer tasks.

Use the case playbook that provides the activities and tasks required to research and complete the request.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, under **Group life service cases**, open the case list.

    -   For your assigned cases, select **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all Group life cases, select **All**.
4.  In the list, select which case you want to work on.

    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

5.  Select the **Playbook** tab.

6.  Use the activities and tasks under the following playbook stages to fulfill the request and resolve the case:

    -   **Initiate and review** to enter policy details or coverage changes, collect customer documents, and submit the case for review.
    -   **Processor review** to verify customer documents, review policy details, and submit the review.
    -   **Customer acceptance** to update with the customer's decision to accept or reject the quote.
    -   **Fulfillment** to activate the accepted change, update the policy record, send updated policy documents to the customer, and close the case.
    Any tasks generated during playbook activities appear in the **Tasks** tab of the case.

7.  In the **Work notes** field, enter any comments.

8.  Close the task from the playbook activity or the task form.
