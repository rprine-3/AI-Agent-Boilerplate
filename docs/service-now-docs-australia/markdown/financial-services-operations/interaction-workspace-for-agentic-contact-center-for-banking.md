# Interaction page for Agentic Contact Center for Banking

The Interaction page provides customer service representatives \(CSRs\) with a consolidated view of customer details, live call transcript analysis, and AI-driven assistance during active customer interactions.

CSRs use this page during an active interaction with a banking customer. It combines customer information, contextual history, and AI-powered assistance in a single page. When a CSR accepts an inbound call, the page opens automatically and displays the identified customer's details. The CSR can manage the entire interaction in this space—from first contact to case creation and wrap-up.

## Live transcript and AI-driven assistance

During an active voice interaction, a live transcript of the conversation is captured. The transcript serves as the primary input for the AI agent.

As the conversation progresses, the AI agent reads the transcript, interprets the customer's request, and surfaces relevant information and recommended next steps in the ServiceNow Otto panel whenever the CSR agent prompts it for recommendations. The AI agent references customer records, Knowledge Graph, and your configured knowledge bases.

CSRs can also type their own questions directly into the ServiceNow Otto panel at any time. The panel displays responses from the AI agent in a structured format that may include insights, recommendations, and guidance based on the content and sentiment of the conversation.

## Customer context summary

The customer context summary provides the CSR with an AI-generated overview of the customer before and during the call. This context-based summary is generated from the customer's profile, products, recent interactions, and case history at the time the interaction begins, giving the CSR immediate context without manual research.

The customer summary includes:

-   Customer or account details
-   Similar issues that the customer has previously contacted the bank about
-   Products affected by the current issue
-   Related cases

The customer summary is not visible when no account or consumer has been associated with the interaction.

## Other page sections

The following table lists other sections in the Interaction page. Its contents vary depending on whether the customer is a retail consumer \(B2C\) or a commercial account \(B2B\).

|Name|Customer type|Description|
|----|-------------|-----------|
|Customer details|Account|Displays the account name, primary contact, phone number, email address, industry, and doing-business-as name.|

## Contextual side panel

The contextual side panel appears on the right side of the page and provides access to supplementary tools and record-related information. The panel tabs are displayed in the following order:

1.  Related lists—includes Related Tasks, Recent Interactions, Open Cases, and Financial Accounts
2.  Activity stream
3.  Attachments
4.  Templates
5.  Recommended Actions

The Activity stream tab displays the activity stream for the interaction record, allowing CSRs to review and add notes without leaving the page.

## Wrap-up

The agent wraps up the interaction when it concludes. When wrap-up codes are set up and the Wrap Up Completion ServiceNow Otto skill is configured, the agent can generate an AI-powered chat summary. This summary provides a record of what was discussed and any action items in the interaction.
