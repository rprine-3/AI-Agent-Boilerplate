# Understanding FSO Core relationships

This section describes the key tables in FSO Core and their relationships. Understanding these relationships helps you manage data effectively and enhances system functionality.

The Financial Services Operations Core application is automatically installed with any of the  Financial Services Operations applications but can also be installed independently for a basic configuration using only its data model.

The following table lists this application's dependencies:

|Name|Value|
|----|-----|
|Customer Service Management \(CSM\)|com.sn\_customerservice|
|Expanded Model and Asset Classes|com.sn\_ent|
|Install Base|com.snc.install\_base|

**Important:** Starting with the Vancouver release, the Financial Services Operations Core model tables will use child tables of Expanded Model and Asset's base Service model \[cmdb\_service\_product\_model\] to classify different service models within the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\). For more information, see [Expanded Model and Asset Classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-model-asset-classes-app.md)

## Using ServiceNow AI Platform, Customer Service Management \(CSM\) tables

The Financial Services Operations data model uses the following tables included within the ServiceNow AI Platform, Customer Service Management \(CSM\), and Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) applications to store data.
