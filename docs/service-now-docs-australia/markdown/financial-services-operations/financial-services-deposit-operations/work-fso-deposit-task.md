# Work on a deposit task for fulfillment

Work on a deposit task to perform a fulfillment activity for the parent deposit service case.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   For a business deposit service task: sn\_bom\_deposit\_b2b.agent or sn\_bom\_deposit\_b2b.agent\_connector
-   For a personal deposit service task: sn\_bom\_deposit\_b2c.agent or sn\_bom\_deposit\_b2c.agent\_connector

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

A deposit workflow automatically generates deposit tasks for the following activities in a deposit case:

-   Verify operating instructions for a standing order
-   Authorize a deposit request
-   Update a deposit account to fulfill and close the deposit request
-   Create and activate account for account origination
-   Send account opening kit to the customer for account origination
-   Delink an account from other financial accounts during account closure

**Note:** Depending on the deposit service type, the number of activities and deposit tasks may differ in a playbook.

Tasks in the playbook activities are also available in the **Tasks** tab of the case.

If assignment rules are configured, the task is automatically assigned to a deposit agent. The deposit agent can use the case playbook or the task form to work on a deposit task.
