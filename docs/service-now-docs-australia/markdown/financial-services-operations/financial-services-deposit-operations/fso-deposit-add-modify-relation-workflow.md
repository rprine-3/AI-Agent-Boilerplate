# Add, modify, and remove financial account relationship workflows

Learn how agents, using the financial account relationship workflows, resolve service requests for adding, modifying, and removing relationships from deposit accounts. These workflows apply to personal deposit service requests.

The following diagram shows how the application helps bank agents resolve a deposit request for a financial account relationship.

\[Omitted image "add-financial-account-relation-workflow.png"\] Alt text: Workflow showing resolution of a deposit request for adding a financial account relationship using the Deposit Operations application. For the text description, refer to the workflow steps that follow.

The deposit admin can review and customize this predefined flow based on the business needs of your organization.

The following workflow routes the case and tasks for adding, modifying, and removing relationship from an account to agents in different departments. The agents log in to the Workspace to work on the tasks in their queue. The case playbook guides agents through the steps that are needed to fulfill the request.

-   **As a deposit contributor, requester, or customer**

    A deposit contributor or a requester submits a request on behalf of a customer.

    A customer \(consumer or contact\) can directly submit a request from the Customer Service Portal, Consumer Service Portal, or another self-service portal.

    **Note:** For consumers to submit a request using the Consumer Service Portal, you must have the Consumer Service Portal plugin \(com.glide.service-portal.consumer-portal\) activated.

    A deposit service case is created based on the request type.

-   **As a deposit contributor**

    In the case playbook, the contributor updates the relationship information in the Initiate and review stage, collects the necessary documentation from the customer, and submits the application for fulfillment.

    A workflow is triggered automatically and the assignment rules route the associated tasks to the appropriate back-office teams.

-   **As back-office agents**
    1.  The document agent works on the document task to review and verify the collected documentation. If the documents are legitimate, the agent marks the task as complete.

        The workflow generates further tasks for deposit agents to work on them.

    2.  A deposit authorizer \(deposit agent\) reviews the case details and approves the deposit task to authorize the deposit request.
    3.  When all prior tasks are completed, a deposit agent updates the deposit account in the core banking system and closes the update deposit task in the playbook.

The case is complete and the state and stage of the case are set to Closed Complete.
