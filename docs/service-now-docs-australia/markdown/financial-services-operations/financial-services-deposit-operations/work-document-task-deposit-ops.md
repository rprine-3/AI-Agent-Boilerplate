# Work on a document task to verify documents for a deposit case

Work on a document task to verify inbound documents that are needed for a deposit service case.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   For a business deposit service case: sn\_bom\_document.b2b\_agent
-   For a personal deposit service case: sn\_bom\_document.b2c\_agent

## About this task

The Document Management Service determines which documents are required in a workflow. If any documents must be collected from the customer, a task is automatically generated for a document agent. The task is assigned to the document service team or a document agent based on the assignment rules.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).

3.  In the **Lists** tab, under **Document Service**, open the task list.

    -   For your assigned tasks, click **Assigned to me**.
    -   For all document tasks, click **All**.
4.  In the list, select which case you want to work on.

    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

5.  In the **Inbound Documents** tab, choose a document.

6.  Once the document has been reviewed, click **Verify**.

7.  In the **Work notes** field, enter any comments.

8.  Click **Close**.


## Result

-   The document task moves to the Closed Complete state.
-   In the parent deposit case, the Verify documents stage in the case playbook shows as complete and the case moves to the next stage.
