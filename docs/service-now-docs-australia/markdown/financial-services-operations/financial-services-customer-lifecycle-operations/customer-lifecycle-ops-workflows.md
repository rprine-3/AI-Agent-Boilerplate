</table>These workflows are built using [Process Automation Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md) and [Flow Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/flow-designer.md). The CLO admin can review and customize these workflows according to their organization's needs.

## General workflow for Financial Services Customer Lifecycle Operations

When a customer requires a service, a CLO contributor initiates a case and updates its details, triggering the workflow. The flow triggers various tasks from the case and the assignment rules route these tasks to the agents in appropriate back-office teams such as deposit and document service. Throughout the workflow, agents complete their assigned tasks and update the status of the case. The case playbook guides agents through the steps that are needed to resolve the case.

**Note:** Depending on the CLO service type, a workflow might have additional or fewer tasks.
