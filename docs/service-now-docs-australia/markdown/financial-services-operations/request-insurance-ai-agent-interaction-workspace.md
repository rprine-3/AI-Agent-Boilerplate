# Request AI agent support in the Interaction page for Agentic Contact Center for Insurance

Request AI-powered assistance during insurance customer interactions to receive real-time insights, intent identification, and recommended responses. The Insurance CSR support AI agent analyzes call context and transcripts to provide next-step guidance and suggested actions within the Interaction page.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ins\_csr.personal\_agent, sn\_ins\_csr.business\_agent

## About this task

When an interaction with an insurance customer begins, the Insurance CSR support AI agent identifies customer intent from the live call context and transcript. It surfaces insights from its findings, then provides next-step guidance with recommendations and suggested responses.

The agent operates in two input modes:

-   **Typed query**: The CSR types a question directly into the ServiceNow Otto panel at any point during the call.
-   **Button-triggered**: The CSR selects **Get customer request** and the agent reads the latest call transcript to infer the customer's most recent question, without the CSR needing to rephrase it manually.

The agent responds only to questions within insurance scope and only about the customer on the current interaction.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Initiate an interaction when a customer contacts you.

3.  In the Interaction page, select **Ask Otto**.

    **Note:** By default, **Ask Otto** is available when:

    -   The interaction **Type** is Phone.
    -   The **Consumer** or **Account** field is not empty.
    -   The interaction **State** is Work in Progress.
    -   The **Assigned to** value is not set to virtual agent.
    The ServiceNow Otto panel displays. The Insurance CSR support AI agent starts processing information from the call transcript and the customer's insurance data. It displays information relevant to the customer's request and presents follow-up options as selectable pills.

    The chat is specific to this interaction record. If you navigate away, you can resume the chat by selecting **Ask Otto**.

    For more information, see [Agentic Contact Center for Insurance AI agents overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/agentic-contact-center-for-insurance-agents-overview.md).

4.  Get a response from the agent using one of the following methods:

    -   Type a question directly into the ServiceNow Otto panel and press Enter to submit it.
    -   Select **Get customer request** to have the agent read the latest call transcript and infer the customer's most recent question automatically.

        The agent retrieves new transcript segments since the last pull and uses them to identify the customer's current request without requiring manual input from the CSR.

5.  Select a follow-up option by selecting a pill or list option, or by directly responding to the agent in the chat.


## Result

The agent answers your questions using information from the customer's insurance records and its configured knowledge sources. Responses are structured for quick review during a live call.
