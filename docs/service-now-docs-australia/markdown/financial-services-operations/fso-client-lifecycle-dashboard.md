# Client Lifecycle dashboard

With the Financial Services Client Lifecycle dashboard, you can get insight into how your team and business are performing for the client lifecycle cases.

**Important:** The Financial Services Client Lifecycle dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

You can monitor the status of the client lifecycle cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view. For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the open cases, the new cases, and the average closing times of the client lifecycle cases.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

-   sn\_bom\_clo.b2c\_manager, required to view the dashboard widgets and data.
-   sn\_bom\_clo.b2c\_admin, required to edit the dashboard.

## Access the Financial Services Client Lifecycle dashboard

To access the Financial Services Client Lifecycle dashboard, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Financial Services Workspace** &gt; **Analytics Center** \(\[Omitted image "analytics-center-icon.png"\] Alt text: Analytics center icon.\).

Alternatively, you can navigate to **Client Lifecycle** &gt; **Analytics**.

You can also access the dashboard from the Platform Analytics Workspace. For more information about the Platform Analytics Workspace, see [Analytics Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md).

If you have upgraded from an earlier version, you can access the existing Core UI dashboard layout as usual by navigating to **All** &gt; **Client Lifecycle** &gt; **Dashboard**.

</table>## Indicators

-   **Open Cases - SLA Breached**

    Percentage of the open cases that breached an SLA. The data is calculated from this formula:

    ```
    [[Number of open Cases with Breached SLAs]] / [[Number of Open Cases]] * 100
    ```

-   **Open Cases - SLA About to be Breached**

    Average number of the open cases for an agent on a day that you specify. The data for this indicator is collected from the \[task\_sla\] table.

-   **Open Cases by Age**

    Breakdown score and trend of open cases by age in days. The data is calculated from this formula:

    ```
    [[Summed age of Open Cases]] / [[Number of Open Cases]] / 24
    ```

-   **Average Time to Close in Last 30 Days**

    Breakdown of the average closing time in days of the cases by the service, agent, or assignment group in the last seven days. The data is calculated from this formula:

    ```
     [[B2C CLO.Summed duration of closed cases]]/[[B2C CLO.Number of closed cases]]
    ```

-   **New Cases vs. Closed Cases**

    Breakdown of the new cases by the service, agent, or agent group versus the closed cases. The data for the cases is collected from the \[sn\_bom\_clo\_service\] table.

-   **Closed Cases - SLA Met vs. SLA Breached**

    Cases where the SLAs were met versus the cases where the SLAs were breached. The data for the cases is collected from the \[sn\_bom\_clo\_service\] table.
