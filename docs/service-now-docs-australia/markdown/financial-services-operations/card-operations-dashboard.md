# Dispute Management dashboard

With the Dispute Management dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the card service requests that were received for your financial services.

**Important:** The Dispute Management dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

You can monitor the status of card service cases from a single view. For any time that you specify, you can view the details for the closed cases that breached a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\), the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the card cases.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

-   sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_manager, needed to see the dashboard widgets and data.
-   sn\_bom\_credit\_card.admin, sn\_bom\_pa.admin, and pa\_admin, needed to edit the dashboard.

## Access the Dispute Management dashboard

To access the Dispute Management dashboard, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Financial Services Workspace** &gt; **Analytics Center** \(\[Omitted image "analytics-center-icon.png"\] Alt text: Analytics center icon\).

Alternatively, you can navigate to **All** &gt; **Card Operations** &gt; **Analytics**.

You can also access the dashboard from the Platform Analytics Workspace. For more information about the Platform Analytics Workspace, see [Analytics Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center.md).

If you have upgraded from an earlier version, you can access the existing Core UI dashboard layout as usual by navigating to **All** &gt; **Card Operations** &gt; **Dashboard**.
