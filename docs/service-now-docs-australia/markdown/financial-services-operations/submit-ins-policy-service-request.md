# Submit a policy service request

Help your customers by submitting a policy service request for them.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ins\_policy\_b2c.homeowner\_policy\_processor, sn\_ins\_policy\_b2c.auto\_policy\_processor, or sn\_ins\_policy\_b2c.contributor

**Note:** The applicable universal contributor role can also be assigned to create a case. For more information, see [User roles and FSO Business rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-core-roles.md).

**Important:** For the contributor role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM Contributor users roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

Requestors, contributors, and processors can submit policy service requests for customers.

Customers can submit policy service requests from the Consumer Service Portal or another self-service portal. They can select a service catalog item, fill out the necessary form, and then submit a form.

**Note:** Before your customers can submit a request using the Consumer Service Portal, you must have the Consumer Service Portal plugin \(com.glide.service-portal.consumer-portal\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

2.  Select the lists icon \(\[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-list.png"\] Alt text: lists icon\).
