    If you want to work on a case that isn't assigned to you yet, you can assign it to yourself by selecting **Assign to me**.

    -   **Investigate**- This stage enables you to investigate the fraud case and request for manager approval to review the fraud investigation.

        **Note:** To resolve cases, agents can also request documents until the closure of the case. The case can also be routed for approval to a fraud manager.​

    -   **Case disposition** - This stage enables you to capture case outcome, notify the customer, update fraud management system, request write-off, and complete all the fulfilment fraud tasks.
    Any tasks generated during playbook activities appear in the **Tasks** tab of the case.
