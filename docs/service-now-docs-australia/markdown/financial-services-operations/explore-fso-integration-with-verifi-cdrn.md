# Exploring Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi application

Learn how you can use ServiceNow® Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi application to seamlessly connect FSO's issuer dispute workflow to Verifi CDRN.

## Overview of the application

Financial Services Operations Integration with Verifi lets issuers automatically negotiate with merchants before disputes move toward chargeback process. When a cardholder disputes a transaction, the issuer submits a case to CDRN, which routes it to the merchant. ServiceNow® manages the issuer-side workflow — submitting cases, polling for updates, and closing cases when the merchant responds.
