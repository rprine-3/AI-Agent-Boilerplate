# Exploring Agentic Contact Center for Banking

Learn more about how Agentic Contact Center for Banking enables customer service representatives \(CSRs\) to handle calls more efficiently, reduce research time, and improve interaction quality.

## Agentic Contact Center for Banking overview

Bank CSRs routinely handle inbound customer calls that require navigating multiple systems to locate the information needed to serve a customer, such as core banking platforms, CRM tools, and case management applications. Constant application switching increases handling time, raises the risk of error, and forces customers to wait on hold while agents gather data on their call.

Agentic Contact Center for Banking addresses these challenges by consolidating customer data and embedding AI assistance directly into the Financial Services Operations workspace. The plugin introduces two purpose-built CSM page variants: **Interaction** and **Customer 360**. Together, they provide an AI-enhanced environment that surfaces the right information at the right moment.

## Agentic Contact Center for Banking users

|User|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Banking personal CSRs|Handle individual retail customer accounts. They take inbound calls from customers and answer inquiries, resolve issues, and raise service requests on the customer's behalf. They also perform other follow-up tasks throughout the day to act on customer insights, such as identifying opportunities for customers.|
|Banking business CSRs|Perform the same functions as banking personal CSRs, but for corporate or commercial accounts.|

## Agentic Contact Center for Banking example workflow

The following image shows an example workflow of a CSR working on a customer interaction in Agentic Contact Center for Banking.

\[Omitted image "agentic-contact-center-banking-workflow.png"\] Alt text: Flowchart showing the agentic contact center workflow for banking customer service interactions.

1.  A customer calls the bank's contact center. An integrated CCaaS routes the call to the human CSR agent. For more information, see [Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\) for voice calls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/contact-center-integration-with-icc.md).
2.  When the CSR accepts the call, the **Interaction** page opens. The customer's details are displayed, and the CSR immediately receives an AI-generated summary of the call based on what has been collected up to that point via the IVR or Voice AI agent. This gives the CSR immediate context before the conversation with the customer begins.
3.  A live transcript of the call is captured and updated continuously throughout the interaction, and serves as the primary input for the AI agent's real-time assistance.

    For more information about the Interaction page, see [Interaction page for Agentic Contact Center for Banking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/interaction-workspace-for-agentic-contact-center-for-banking.md).

4.  As the call progresses, an AI agent monitors the live transcript and surfaces relevant information and recommended next steps in the ServiceNow Otto panel when requested by the CSR. The AI agent interprets the customer's request and retrieves the appropriate data from the configured knowledge graph and knowledge base articles.

5.  CSRs can also ask their own questions at any time by typing into the ServiceNow Otto panel. For example, they may look up recent account transactions, check product eligibility criteria, or retrieve policy information.
6.  At any point during or outside of an active call, a CSR can open the **Customer 360** page by selecting the customer's name from the Interaction page or searching for the customer. The Customer 360 page opens in a separate tab and provides a comprehensive view of the customer's profile and financial relationship with the bank. For more information about the Customer 360 page, see [Customer 360 page for Agentic Contact Center for Banking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/customer-360-agentic-contact-center-for-banking.md).
7.  When the call concludes, a wrap-up summary dialog displays with configured wrap-up codes. The agent can select a code and submit the wrap-up using an AI-generated call summary. For more information, see [Use AI to generate wrap up code and notes summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ai-generated-wrap-up-codes-and-notes-summary.md).
