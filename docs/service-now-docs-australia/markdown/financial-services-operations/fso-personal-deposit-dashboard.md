# Personal Deposit Operations dashboard

With the Financial Services Personal Deposit Operations dashboard, you can get an insight into how your team and business are performing for the deposit service requests received for your financial services. You can monitor the status of the deposit service cases, see trends, and drill down into the details from a single view.

**Important:** The Financial Services Personal Deposit Operations dashboard has been modernized to give you a better user experience.

For any time that you specify, you can view the details for closed cases that breached a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\), the open cases that need immediate attention, and the average closing times of the deposit cases.
