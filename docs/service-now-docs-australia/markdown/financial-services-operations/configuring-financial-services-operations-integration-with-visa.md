# Configuring Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa

Plan and configure your Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa implementation.

**Important:** Set the `sn_bom_credit_card.is_visa_integration_enabled` property to `True` to enable Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa. By default, this property is set to `False`, so you need to update it manually. Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa will not function until this property is enabled.

## Configuration overview

To configure Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa on your ServiceNow instance, you need to set up a sequence of tasks.

1.  [Request Integration Hub subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/request-ih-overview.md).

    Use the Integration Hub to integrate a Visa account with your ServiceNow instance.

2.  [Install Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/install-financial-services-operations-integration-with-visa.md).

3.  [Set up Visa Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/activate-visa-spoke.md).

    IntegrationHub enables execution of third-party APIs as a part of a flow when a specific event occurs in ServiceNow. These integrations, referred to as spokes, are easy to configure and enable you to quickly add powerful actions without the need to write a script.

4.  [Set up instance credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/set-up-financial-services-operations-integration-with-visa.md).

    Configure the Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa application by using the Visa connection and credential record to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

5.  [Configure properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/properties-installed-with-fso-integration-with-visa.md).

    Customize properties that control settings for features in the Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa application, such as integration with specific APIs.
