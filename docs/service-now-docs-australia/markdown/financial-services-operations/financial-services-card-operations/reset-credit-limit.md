# Reset the credit limit for a customer

Revert a card's credit limit to its original limit for a customer who requested a temporary increase in the credit limit.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.agent\_connector

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

This credit card service case is automatically created for a credit card service case for a temporary increase in the credit limit when the **Duration** field is set to **Limited Time**.

If the request is for a temporary increase in the credit limit, the case remains in the Work in Progress state even after increasing the credit limit. The system automatically creates a new credit card service case on the specified end date to reset the credit limit.

The **sn\_bom\_credit\_card.reserverd\_hours\_to\_update\_credit\_limit** [card property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-card-operations/properties-installed-card-ops.md) defines the number of hours before the end date when the system creates a credit card service case to revert the credit limit.

## Procedure
