5.  Based on the value in the **Approved credit limit** field, increase the credit limit for the customer's credit card.

7.  To close the task, in the **State** field, change the state of the task to **Closed Complete**.

8.  Click **Save**.


## Result

-   The stage of the associated credit card service case changes from Update Account to Closed – Complete.

    **Important:** If the request is for a temporary increase in the credit limit, the state of the case remains in the Work in Progress state and in the Update Account stage until the end date that is specified in the case. The system automatically creates a new credit card service case on the specified end date to reset the credit limit.

-   The customer receives a pre-configured email notification about the case closure.

## What to do next

If the associated case is for a temporary increase in the credit limit, work on the new case to [revert the credit limit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-card-operations/reset-credit-limit.md) to the original limit on the end date.
