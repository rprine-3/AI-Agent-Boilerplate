# Decrease the credit limit of a card

Decrease the credit limit of a customer's credit card as per the credit card service request.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.agent or sn\_bom\_credit\_card.agent\_connector

**Important:** For the agent connector role to work, it must be combined with one of the CSM industry data model roles. For more information, see [Roles and Personas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/fso-combine-csm-industry-roles.md).

## About this task

When a credit card service case for a decrease in the credit limit is created, the Decrease Credit Limit flow is triggered. This flow automatically creates a credit card task in the **Tasks** tab of the case to decrease the credit limit for the customer.

For more information on the flows that are installed with the Financial Services Card Operations application, see [Designer flows for Financial Services Operations applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/flow-designer-flows-fso-apps.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Services Operations** &gt; **Workspace**.

    4.  To close the task, in the **State** field, change the state of the task to **Closed Complete**.
