</table>4.  In the **State** field, change the state of the task to **Work in Progress**.

5.  Block the customer's credit card as per the request.

6.  In the **Work notes** field, enter any comments.

7.  To close the task, in the **State** field, change the state of the task to **Closed Complete**.

8.  Click **Save**.


## Result

-   The stage of the associated credit card service case changes from Update Account to Closed – Complete.

    **Important:** If the request is for only temporarily blocking the credit card, the associated case remains in the Work in Progress state and in the Update Account stage until the end date is specified in the case. The system automatically creates a new credit card service case on the specified end date to unblock the card.

-   The customer receives a pre-configured email notification about the case closure.

## What to do next

If the associated case is for temporarily blocking the credit card, work on the new credit service case to [unblock the card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/financial-services-card-operations/unblock-credit-card.md) on the end date.
