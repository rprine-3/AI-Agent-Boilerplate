**Note:** These values are environment-specific and must not be shared across UAT and Production.

|Item|Description|

|Issuer ID|Numeric identifier assigned to your organization within the CDRN platform. Included in every request header and JWT payload.|
|Shared Secret|32-character string used to sign the HMAC SHA-256 JWT. Treat as a password — store in ServiceNow Credential Store, never in plain text.|
|UAT Base URL|https://verifiapitest.visa.com|
|Production Base URL|https://verifiapi.visa.com|

## About this task

Obtain the following information from the Verifi team.

## Procedure

1.  [Configure the REST End Point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/configure-rest-end-point.md)

2.  [Import the TLS Certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/import-the-tls-certificate.md)

3.  [Configure the Authentication Profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/configure-the-authentication-profile.md)


-   **[Configure the REST End Point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/configure-rest-end-point.md)**  
The REST Endpoint record in ServiceNow® stores the base URL, API version header, and connection properties for the Verifi API. Create two endpoint records: one for UAT testing and one for Production.
-   **[Import the TLS Certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/import-the-tls-certificate.md)**  
The Verifi API endpoint is HTTPS-only. ServiceNow® must trust the Verifi/Visa CA certificate chain to establish a secure connection. This section covers importing the certificate into the ServiceNow® certificate store.
-   **[Configure the Authentication Profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/configure-the-authentication-profile.md)**  
The Verifi Issuer API uses JSON Web Tokens \(JWT\) for authentication. A fresh JWT must be generated for every API call. This section explains how to store credentials securely and how the ServiceNow® script generates and attaches the JWT.
