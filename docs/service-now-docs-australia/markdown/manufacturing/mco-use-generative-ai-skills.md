# Using generative AI in ServiceNow Otto for Manufacturing Commercial Operations

If you have an agent role, you can summarize the report details with the ServiceNow Otto for MCO application.

## Skills reuse

By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use ServiceNow Otto in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data within their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, ServiceNow Otto only uses material that exists within the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see . \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)
