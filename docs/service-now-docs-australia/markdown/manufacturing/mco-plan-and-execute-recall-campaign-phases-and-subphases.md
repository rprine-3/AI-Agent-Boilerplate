3.  Submit a request to create phases for my recall campaign.

    The orchestrator activates the Plan and Execute Recall Campaign Phases and Subphases AI Agent, prompting you to proceed with the creation of the phases and subphases.

4.  The agent prompts you to choose one of the **In progress recall campaigns** for which require phases and subphase planning.

5.  The agent reviews the recall campaign, which is selected.

    The agent displays existing phases and sub-phases on the recall campaign. It prompts you to confirm whether draft phases should be cancelled and their associated assets included in the new plan.

    The agent checks if a plan exists. Also, it provides the list on what basis the phases can be organized.

6.  Submit the list on which you want to organize the phases.

    The agent validates the request. The agent prompts you to confirm the request. The agent provides the phase plan options.

7.  Select a plan from the options to add a subphase level plan.

    You can modify phase plans by adding sub-phases, merging phases, or removing phases. Once you approve the plan, the system creates the phases and sub-phases and assigns eligible impacted assets to the newly created phases.

    The recommendation score shows how well the option matches your requirements.

    The agent generates a phased roll-out list with phases and subphases. All phases and subphases are displayed.
