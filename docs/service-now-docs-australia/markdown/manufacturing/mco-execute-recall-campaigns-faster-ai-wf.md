# Execute recall campaigns faster agentic workflow

Use MCO AI agents agentic workflow to generate the corrective actions and charges for the required repair documents quickly and efficiently.

## Execute recall campaigns faster overview

The Execute recall campaigns faster workflow uses the Create Recall Corrective Actions AI agent to streamline recalls by automatically extracting information from uploaded repair documents. This agent systematically identifies and gathers all relevant data from the repair instructions, reducing the need for manual input. As a result, corrective actions are created efficiently, and related charges are calculated accurately. This automation speeds up the process and helps minimize human error.

The recall manager can initiate a recall campaign and associate repair instruction documents with the campaign record. When prompted to add documents, the AI agent requests you to select from the available attachments. You can select the relevant documents. Also, you can upload the additional documentation necessary for implementing corrective actions.

The asset applicability criteria specify which corrective actions apply to a specific subset of the affected asset.

## Execute recall campaigns faster agentic workflow

Leverage the outcomes from the faster recall campaigns to produce a recommended course of action for the human agent.

To access the agentic workflow:
