# Using agentic workflows in ServiceNow Otto for Manufacturing Commercial Operations

Use the MCO AI agents within an agentic workflow to extract relevant data from repair documents, enabling the generation of corrective actions and associated charges.

Execute recall campaigns faster

This workflow enhances the efficiency of recall execution by automatically creating corrective action records and corresponding charge line items using repair documents. The elimination of manual data entry and validation processes reduces cycle time, minimizes errors, and promotes consistency throughout recall operations.

</table>Enable security implementation to execute AI agents and agentic workflows through Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) and user identities. For more information, see 

**Important:** By default, all agent workflow and AI agent records are read-only.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first duplicate the agentic workflow, and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. The triggers for each agentic workflow must be unique. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn’t necessary.
