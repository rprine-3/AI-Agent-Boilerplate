# Create a phase and sub-phase in a recall campaign

Create a set of phases and sub-phase within a recall campaign to enable detailed segmentation, improving tracking, and management at each stage of the process.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_rcl\_claim\_mgmt.recall\_manager and sn\_rcl\_claim\_mgmt.recall\_phase\_owner

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Recall Management** &gt; **My Campaigns**

2.  Select the corresponding campaign record in which you want to create the phases and sub-phases.

3.  Select **Phases &amp; Sub-phases**.

    The page displays the following:

    -   Total impacted assets: The total number of impacted assets associated with the campaign.

        For example: Total impacted assets = campaign assets \(which includes phase assets + sub-phase assets\).

    -   Assigned impacted assets: The total number of impacted assets in a given leaf-level phase or sub-phase.

        For example, assigned impacted assets = phase assets \(leaf\) + sub-phase assets \(leaf\).

    -   Unassigned impacted assets: The total number of impacted assets that are associated with phases or sub-phases that aren’t at the leaf-level.

        For example: Unassigned impacted assets = phase assets \(non-leaf\) + sub-phase assets \(non-leaf\).

        **Note:** Unassigned assets on a parent phase are the assets that are assigned to the parent phase but not to any leaf phase.

4.  Select **Add phase**.

5.  On the required recall campaign phase form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Recall campaign phase form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/manufacturing/mco-recall-campaign-phases-form.md).

6.  Select **Save**.
