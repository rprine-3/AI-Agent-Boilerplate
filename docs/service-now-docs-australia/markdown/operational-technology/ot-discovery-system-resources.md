# OT Discovery System Resources

You can review the OT Discovery component resources before setting up your OT network.

## OT Discovery components required resources

The requirements in this section are a generalization. Consider factors such as segmentation level, communication pathways, network traffic, redundancy, and environmental conditions. Also account for physical constraints when determining network requirements. The following tables provide resource estimates for each OT Discovery component. Review your system requirements beyond these minimums.
