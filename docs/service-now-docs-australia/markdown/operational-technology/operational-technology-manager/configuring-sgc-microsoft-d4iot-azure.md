Role required: admin

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender for IoT \(Azure\), then don’t migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the application scope is set to the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender for IoT \(Azure\) application by using the application picker.

    For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph for MSFT D4IoT \(Azure\)** &gt; **Guided Setup**.

3.  On the Getting started page, select **Get Started**.

4.  To access the Azure resources, complete the following:

    1.  Select the Access to Azure Resources task.

    2.  Once you complete the instructions in the description, select **Mark as Complete**.

5.  To set up the connections and credentials, complete the following:

    1.  In the Configure Connections and Credentials section, select the Setup Connections and Credentials task.

    2.  Select **Configure**.

    3.  Select the **SG-OT Azure Connection** record.

    4.  Select the Create New Connection &amp; Credential related link.

    5.  In the Create Connection and Credential window, fill in the following fields.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Connection Name|Display name for the connection record|
        |Connection URL|Azure URL|
        |OAuth Client ID|Client ID \(application ID\) or Service Principal ID|
        |OAuth Client Secret|Client secret key associated with the Service Principal|
        |OAuth Token URL|URL to fetch Authorization token. Replace &lt;tenantid&gt; in the URL with the Tenant ID value.|

        **Note:** When a token generation is successful, a new window appears with a success message. When a token generation isn’t successful, a new window with the error message `OAuth flow failed` appears. Please check the details provided and try again by editing the record you created.

    6.  Select **Create and Get OAuth Token**.

6.  To test the connection, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Test/Validate Connection task.

    2.  Select the **Test Connection** UI action from the related links section on the data source record for sensors.

        After completing the connection test, view the results. You must perform the suggested troubleshooting steps until the test result returns **Success**.

7.  To configure the system properties, complete the following:

    1.  In the Configure System Properties section, select **Configure**.

    2.  Configure the following system properties.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_msftd4iotazsgc.get\_all\_devices

</td><td>

-   For devices, you can choose to fetch all records \(box checked\) or the delta \(box unchecked\).
-   The DELTA fetches all the records created or updated since the start time of the last successful import in the CMDB.
 **Note:** When you run the Devices Integration for the first time, all records are imported independent of this property.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_msftd4iotazsgc.convert\_sensor\_names\_to\_lowercase

</td><td>

Set this property for devices import. -   This system property is used to convert the sensor names provided by Microsoft Azure into lowercase while importing devices.
-   This is required as Microsoft Azure expects data for the query in a lowercase format.


</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_msftd4iotazsgc.filter.device\_sub\_types

</td><td>

Set this property for filtering the devices during device import by sub type. -   Comma-separated list of Microsoft Azure sub types to filter the devices.
-   For example: to import only PLCs and servers, provide the value from the DeviceSubType attribute from Microsoft Azure as `Server, PLC`.


</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_msftd4iotazsgc.filter.device\_tags

</td><td>

Set this property for filtering the devices during device import by device tag. -   Comma-separated list of case sensitive tags that are needed to filter devices.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_msftd4iotazsgc.filter.custom\_query

</td><td>

Set this property to add more filters for device import apart from the Device SubType and Device Tags filter. -   Query to filter based on other attributes.
-   This allows filtering for other attributes. For more information, see [Azure Query Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/concepts/query-language).

An object of fields from the Microsoft Defender for IoT \(Azure\) Site Map. When a field is set to **True**, the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender for IoT \(Azure\) passes the value of the Site Map field to the corresponding field on each CI discovered by the integration at the Azure site.If set to **False** or not populated on the Site Map record, the field isn't set on the imported CIs associated with the Azure site.

For consistency with the other integrations using the NIDS framework, check this system property. By default, only **location** and **equipment\_model\_entity** are set to **True**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_msftd4iotazsgc.devices\_fetch\_type

</td><td>

Indicates if devices are fetched per sensor, Active Scan devices, or both.
