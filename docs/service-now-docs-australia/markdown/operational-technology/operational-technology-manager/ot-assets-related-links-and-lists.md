# OT device related items and related lists

The All OT Devices, All OT Devices by IP Address, and All OT Devices by CI menu options contain several related items and lists.

## Related items

This section lists any related or subordinate items that are associated with this OT device.

**Note:** Not all OT devices display the following related lists. For OT devices in an Operational Technology class or extended class, the following related lists are displayed. For OT devices categorized in a different hardware class, such as Windows Server, an instance admin must add the related lists to the form.

1.  To view the related records, click the name of the related item \(for example, Memory Modules\).
2.  To add a configuration item \(CI\) relationship for this OT device, click the add CI relationships icon \(\[Omitted image "add-ci-relationships-icon.png"\] Alt text: Add CI relationships icon.\). Use the search field to find the CI item that you want to create a relationship for.
3.  To access the Dependency View form to see a pictorial depiction of the OT device relationships, click the show dependency views icon \(\[Omitted image "show-dependency-views-icon.png"\] Alt text: Show dependency views icon.\).
4.  To change the settings that govern how the related items appear and are filtered, click the settings icon \(\[Omitted image "settings-icon.png"\] Alt text: Settings icon.\).
