# Create CMDB Data Certification Policy for Operational Technology

Create a CMDB Data Certification Policy for Operational Technology \(OT\) to validate and maintain accurate configuration item \(CI\) data.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

CMDB Data Certification policies help maintain the accuracy and reliability of data in the CMDB. The policies define when and how configuration items \(CIs\) are validated and automatically generate certification tasks for assigned reviewers.

You can use certification policies to:

-   Periodically validate key attributes of CIs.
-   Assign certification tasks to individuals or groups.
-   Track and manage certification progress from a central workspace.

For example, you can create a policy that certifies IP Address, MAC Address, and Serial Number for all Control Systems located in Site A of a manufacturing plant.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **Management**.

2.  From the Management page, navigate to **Management tools** &gt; **Data Manager** &gt; **Policies**.

3.  Select **Create a new policy** and enter the following information for each parameter:
