# Configure the Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD

Use the guided setup for Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD to lead you through the integration steps.

## Before you begin

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The [CMDB CI Class Models app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models.md), which is automatically installed.
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.
-   Review that **View** access is enabled in Claroty CTD for the following user permissions to collect data from Claroty CTD to ServiceNow:
    -   Visibility
    -   Investigation
-   The Industrial Core plugin. You must activate this plugin.

    The Industrial Core plugin is required to access the class mappings table for the Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD. For more information about the Industrial Core plugin, see [Industrial Core plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-manager/industrial-core-plugin.md).


Role required: admin

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD, then don’t migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the application is set to Service Graph Connector Integration for Claroty CTD by using the application picker.

    For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connector Claroty CTD** &gt; **Guided Setup**.

3.  On the Getting started page, select **Get Started**.

4.  To configure a MID Server, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Configure MID server task.

    2.  Select **Mark as complete** once you complete the MID Server configuration.

5.  To set up the connections records, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Configure Connections task.

    2.  Select **Configure**.

    3.  Open the Claroty CTD API record in the Connections table.

    4.  In the **Connection URL** field, enter the name of the URL for your Claroty CTD Enterprise Management Console \(EMC\).

        For example, [https://192.168.1.100](https://192.168.1.100).

    5.  If you're using a MID Server, select the **Use MID Server** check box in the record.

        **Note:** If you're not using a MID Server, go to step 5g.

    6.  From the Advanced MID Server Configuration related list, select a MID Server and a MID Selection.

    7.  Select **Update**.

    8.  Repeat steps 5a to 5h to update the **Claroty CTD EMC Base Auth** record.

6.  To set up the credentials records, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Configure Credentials task.

    2.  Select **Configure**.

    3.  Open the Claroty CTD EMC Base Auth record in the Credentials table.

    4.  In the **User name** field, enter the user name that you used to log in to the Claroty CTD EMC.

    5.  In the **Password** field, enter the password that you used to log in to the Claroty CTD EMC.

    6.  Select **Update**.

7.  To test the connection, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Test/Validate Connection task.

    2.  Select the **Test Connection** UI action from the related links section on the data source record for sensors.

        After completing the connection test, view the results. You must perform the suggested troubleshooting steps until the test result returns **Success**.

    3.  Check that the connection manager has a valid certificate.

        A valid certificate must be installed for a production environment. For a non-production or proof of concept \(POC\) instance, you can configure the system properties to enable the integration to work when the connection manager doesn’t have a valid certificate. The following table lists the system properties that you can configure for a non-production environment.

<table id="table_scq_mjj_kyb"><thead><tr><th>
