# Configure the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender for IoT \(On-premises Management Console\)

Use the Guided Setup for the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender for IoT \(On-premises Management Console\) to lead you through the integration steps.

## Before you begin

Dependencies and requirements:

-   The [Integration Commons for CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/integration-commons-for-cmdb.md) store app, which is automatically installed.
-   The [CMDB CI Class Models app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models.md), which is automatically installed.
-   The ITOM Discovery License plugin \(com.snc.itom.discovery.license\). You must activate this plugin.
-   ITOM Licensing plugin \(com.snc.itom.license\). For more information, see [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md).
-   The Datastream Action plugin \(com.glide.hub.action\_type.datastream\), which is automatically installed.

Role required: admin

**Note:** If you have an earlier version of the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender for IoT \(On-premises Management Console\), then don’t migrate data from the old connector. You must uninstall the previous version and run the new integration.

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that the application scope is set to the Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Defender for IoT \(On-premises Management Console\) application by using the application picker.

    For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connector Microsoft D4IoT** &gt; **Guided Setup**.

3.  On the Getting started page, select **Get Started**.

4.  To configure a MID Server, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Configure MID server task.

    2.  Select **Mark as complete** once you complete the MID Server configuration linked in the description.

5.  To update the Connection and Credentials Alias record, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Connections and Credentials task.

    2.  Select **Configure**.

    3.  Open the default record **Microsoft D4IoT Base API**.

    4.  From the Connections related list, select **New** to create a new HTTP\(s\) Connection record.

    5.  In the **Connection URL** field, enter the name for the URL of your Microsoft Defender for IoT Central Manager.

        For example, `https://192.168.1.100`.

    6.  If you are using a MID Server, select all of the following:

        -   **Use MID Server** box
        -   **MID Server** from the Advanced MID Server Configuration related list
        -   **MID Selection** from the list
    7.  In the **Credential** field, select the search icon to open the Credentials records list.

    8.  Select **New** to create a new record.

    9.  Select the **API Key Credentials** type.

    10. In the **API Key** field, enter a name and the API Key provided by your Microsoft Defender for IoT management console.

    11. Select **Submit** to create the credential record.

        To create an API Key in the Microsoft Defender for IoT management console, refer to Microsoft product documentation: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis).

    12. On the Connection form, select **Submit** to finish creating the Connection record.

6.  To test the connection, complete the following:

    1.  In the Setup Connections and Credentials section, select the Test/Validate Connection task.

    2.  Select the **Test Connection** UI action from the related links section on the data source record for sensors.

        After completing the connection test, view the results. You must perform the suggested troubleshooting steps until the test result returns **Success**.

    3.  Check that the connection manager has a valid certificate.

        A valid certificate must be installed for a production environment. For a non-production or proof of concept \(POC\) instance, you can configure the system properties to enable the integration to work when the connection manager doesn’t have a valid certificate. The following table lists the system properties that you can configure for a non-production environment.

<table id="table_scq_mjj_kyb"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>

Value

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

com.glide.communications.httpclient.verify\_hostname

</td><td>

Set to **false**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

com.glide.communications.httpclient.verify\_revoked\_certificate

</td><td>

Set to **false**.If you need to add this system property, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

com.glide.communications.trustmanager\_trust\_all

</td><td>

Set to **true**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    4.  Check the MID security policy.

        In the intranet record, verify that the columns in the following table show the specified values.

        |Column|Value|
        |------|-----|
        |Certificate chain check|**false**|
        |Hostname check|**false**|
        |Revocation check|**false**|

        For more information, see [MID Server certificate check policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-security-checks.md).

        The connection shows that it is set correctly when the progress window shows the Completion code **Success**, and the number of records processed shows as the same number of sensors in the connection manager.

7.  To configure the system properties, complete the following:

    1.  In the Configure System Properties section, select **Configure**.

    2.  Configure the following system properties.

<table id="table_bt3_df4_lzb"><thead><tr><th>
