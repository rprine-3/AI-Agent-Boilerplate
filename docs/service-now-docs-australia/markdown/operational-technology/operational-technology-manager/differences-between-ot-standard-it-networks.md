# Differences between OT and standard IT networks

There are differences in how the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) handles the devices located in Operational Technology networks and those in standard Information Technology \(IT\) networks.

Configuration items \(CIs\) managed under Information Technology Operations Management \(ITOM\) are classified as type IT in the CMDB. They exist in Levels 4 and 5 of the Purdue Model, or at the Enterprise level.

Devices managed under the OT data model exist in Levels 0 to 3.5 of the Purdue Model, and there are two primary components of OT devices:

1.  A CI class record. This can be an IT or an OT class CI.
2.  An OT device details record. This describes the OT device type \(function\) and other OT-specific attributes.

**Note:** For more information about the OT data model and extension classes, see [Operational Technology \(OT\) extension classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models-operation-technology.md).

The following graphic depicts these differences.
