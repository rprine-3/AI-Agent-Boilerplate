# Managing Validations

Validation enables you to review and manage the imported data in the staging table.

Validations to be executed:

-   Missing correlation id \(Correlation id\)
-   Missing parent correlation id in case the type is Control module \(Control module parent id\)
-   Missing serial number \(Serial number\)
-   Missing transformed name \(Transformed name\)
-   Missing MAC Address \(validation is executed on column MAC Address 1\)
-   Missing type \(Type\)
-   Missing rack number \(Rack number\)
-   Missing slot number \(Slot number\)
-   Equipment model entity path does not exist \(Equipment model entity path\)
-   Site name provided is invalid \(Site name\)
-   Validate duplicates on transformed name \(Transformed name\)

    **Note:** This validation is skipped for control modules.

-   Validate duplicates on MAC Address \(check on all MAC Address 1 columns\)
-   Validate duplicates on Serial number column \(Serial number\)
-   Validate duplicates on Correlation id column \(Correlation id\)
-   Validate duplicates on rack and slot numbers

    **Note:** This validation is only for control modules.

-   Validate Has Module and Control module Parent ID

    **Note:** This validation is only for PLCs and control modules.

-   Validate Invalid types - Compare against the default Excel type to OT device type mapping through the **sn\_otsm\_sgc.SGOTAssetImportExtensionPoint** extension point implementation.

    If you have additional mappings, create an extension point implementation for the base system **sn\_otsm\_sgc.SGOTAssetImportExtensionPoint** extension point.
