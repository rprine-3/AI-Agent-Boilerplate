# Prepare your Pre-import OT Worksheet Entry Review tool for Service Graph Connector import

Prepare your spreadsheet by positioning your existing data in the correct columns is crucial to the success of your upload.

## Before you begin

Role required: ot\_excel\_import\_user

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Fill the following columns in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

    **Note:** Column names cannot be changed. Extra columns can be added to the staging table. For more information about adding a new custom field mapping in the staging table, see [Add a custom field mapping in the staging table for Service Graph Connector for Microsoft Excel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-manager/add-new-column-mappings-excel-service-graph.md).

    Refer to the following tables for guidance while filling in the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet contains many columns. The examples and field descriptions are split into multiple sections.

    -   Filling in columns A through K
    -   Filling in columns L through Y
    -   Filling in columns Z through AI
    -   Filling in columns AJ through AT
    -   Filling in columns AU through BD
    -   Filling in columns BE through BR
    -   Filling in columns BS to BW
    -   Filling in columns 1 to 8
