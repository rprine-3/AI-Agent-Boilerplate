# View and edit device to device connections

View and edit device-to-device connections for your Operational Technology \(OT\) devices using the Device to Device Connections list in the Industrial Workspace.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure you have the Industrial Core \[sn\_ot\_core\] plugin installed.
-   Role required:

    |Role|Description|
    |----|-----------|
    |cmdb\_ot\_viewer|Required to read or view device to device connections.|
    |cmdb\_ot\_editor, cmdb\_ot\_isa\_editor|Required to edit, create, or delete device to device connections.|


## About this task

The Device to Device Connections uses the `OTNetworkUtils` script include for the OT device look-up logic. The look-up logic identifies the corresponding Source and Destination CIs based on IP addresses, sites, and managed networks.

The Device to Device Connections list shows fields from both the OT Device Network Connection \[sn\_ot\_device\_network\_connection\] table and the CI relationships \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace**.

2.  Select the **List** \(\[Omitted image "icon-list.png"\] Alt text: List icon\) icon.

3.  Under the **OT Network** module, select the **Device to Device Connections** list.

4.  If needed, edit the following fields by selecting the checkbox next to an device to device connection and clicking **Edit**.

<table id="table_ydg_5sp_sfc"><thead><tr><th>

To edit the Last Communication Time stamp, perform the following actions.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Instance Scan** &gt; **Table Cleanup**.
2.  In the sn\_ot\_device\_network\_connection record, edit the **Age in seconds** field as needed. The default is `7,776,000`.

</table>5.  Select **Save**.


## Result

To view a device-to-device connection for an OT device, you can access the Device to Device Connections related list in the OT device record.
