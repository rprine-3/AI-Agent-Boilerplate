# Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for Operational Technology \(OT\) Service Management

Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for Operational Technology \(OT\) Service Management determine how and when each skill is used. Configure inputs to identify the data a skill uses, or configure triggers to initiate skill actions.

## ServiceNow Otto for OT Service Management skill input overview

Depending on the selected skill, you can configure the inputs or triggers. These settings determine how and when a skill is used. An input identifies the data used for a skill, such as the table and fields used to generate an incident summary. A trigger initiates an action, such as when the system generates OT resolution notes.

## OT incident summarization skill

The OT incident summarization skill includes the inputs that identify the table and fields that are used when an OT incident summary is generated.

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).
