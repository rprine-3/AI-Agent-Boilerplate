# Install Operational Technology Incident Management

You can install the Operational Technology Incident Management application \(sn\_ot\_inc\_mgmt\) if you have the admin role. The application installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Operational Technology Incident Management requires the following plugins. Ensure that these plugins are activated before you install Operational Technology Incident Management.
    -   **Required ServiceNow plugins**
        -   **CMDB CI Class Models \(sn\_cmdb\_ci\_class\)**

            The CMDB CI Class Models store app adds class models that extend the CMDB class hierarchy, including class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and dependent relationships. For more information, see [CMDB CI Class Models store app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models.md).

        -   **ISA Equipment Model \(sn\_isa\_model\)**

            The data model for ISA-95 equipment model entities and templates. For more information, see [ISA-95 equipment model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/isa-95-equipment-model.md).

-   Operational Technology Incident Management requires either one or both of the following ServiceNow Store applications. Ensure that at least one of these applications is installed before you install Operational Technology Incident Management.
    -   **Required ServiceNow Store applications**
        -   **Operational Technology Manager**

            The Operational Technology Manager application creates the foundational data and relationships that enables your enterprise to use the ServiceNow® Operational Technology solution. Operational Technology Manager supports the use of the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\), Service Graph Connectors, and Discovery applications in the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [Configuring the Operational Technology Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-manager/configuring-operational-technology-manager.md).

        -   **Industrial Process Manager**

            The Industrial Process Manager application creates the ISA-95 Equipment Model data foundation that is required for the ServiceNow® Industrial solution, enabling you to create your own version of the equipment models in each of your industrial sites. For more information, see [Configuring the Industrial Process Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/configuring-manufacturing-process-mgr.md).
