3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the assignment group.|
    |Manager|Group manager or lead.|
    |Type|Category for this group. In the **Select target record** field, search for **OT** to add it to the type field.|
    |Group email|Group email distribution list or the email address of the point of contact.|
    |Parent|Other group that the group is a member of.|
    |Description|Description of the assignment group.|

4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result
