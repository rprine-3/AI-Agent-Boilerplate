# Configure ServiceNow Otto for Operational Technology \(OT\) Service Management

If you have the admin role, you can configure the ServiceNow Otto for Operational Technology \(OT\) Service Management application so that teams can use the generative AI capabilities in the Industrial Workspace for their OT incidents.

## About this task

Use the AI Admin Hub console to configure ServiceNow Otto for OT Service Management. The console helps you install plugins and configure generative AI skills. For more information, see [Overview tab in AI Admin Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configuring-now-assist.md).

You can also set up AI Enhanced Recommended Actions for OTSM to use with ServiceNow Otto for OT Service Management. For more information, see [Set up AI Enhanced Recommended Actions for Operational Technology Service Management \(OTSM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/set-up-ai-enhanced-ra-otsm.md).

**Important:** Some generative AI skills, AI agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

The following table lists the features and skills that you can access from the AI Admin Hub console.
