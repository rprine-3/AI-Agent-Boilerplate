For more information, see [Edit an Appliance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/edit-an-appliance.md).

## Search by type

You can search for a type of appliance by entering the type in the Search field. Or you can open the Filter and select by the available labels. For example, if you want to view just the Collectors, you can type Collector in the Search field. You can also check the box next to Type in the drop-down Search menu.

Then choose Collector. The Appliances list now shows only the current Collectors.

## Using Appliances in Queries

The Discovery Sensor for OT executes the query to discovery assets and creates the OT environment inventory. The OT Discovery Collector is used to discover assets within segments of the OT network where a Sensor can't reach. It is deployed deep within the network zones in your OT environment.

When you create an Auto Query in the Console, you can choose specific Appliances in the Assets section. When choosing Assets for the query, you can assign the Target to all appliances, specific appliances, or auto targeting. If you select **Specific Appliances**, you can select the appliances you want from a provided list. One restriction is that you must select at least one Sensor from the list as well.\[Omitted image "use-appliances-create-auto-query.png"\] Alt text: Select Assets and Targets
