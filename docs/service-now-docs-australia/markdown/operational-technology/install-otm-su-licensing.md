# Install ITOM SU Licensing

Install or update the ServiceNow® ITOM SU Licensing \[sn\_itom\_licensing\] to ensure you use the latest licensing functionality. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

-   Review the [ITOM SU Licensing](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/4cce117e53b9301046dfddeeff7b12eb) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.

You receive notifications when updates for this application are available on ServiceNow Store.

The following items are installed with ITOM SU Licensing:
