# Remove a lost Sensor

Remove a Sensor that no longer functions or is otherwise reported as having a lost connection from the Discovery Console for OT.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Appliances** page.

2.  From the list, under the Name column, select the Sensor that you want to remove.

    **Danger**

    Removing Sensors in the OT environment may require working in environments with dangerous voltages, moving parts, and other safety hazards. Sensors should only be removed by persons with proper electrical and workplace safety training.

3.  The Sensor record opens for the selected appliance.

4.  In the record, select the Action button.

5.  From the menu, select **Remove Device from Console**.

    **Note:** The **Remove Device from Console** option is only available in the drop-down if the Device Status is **Connection Lost**.

6.  If the select Sensor is associated to a Site, a warning prompt opens.

    Removing a Sensor that is associated to a Site can't be undone.

7.  If you still intend to remove the Sensor, select **Continue**.

8.  Select the **Remove Sensor** button to complete the removal.


## Result

The Sensor is no longer displayed on the Discovery Sensor for OT list page. Existing network connections associated with the Sensor remain in the system for historical purposes.

**Important:** If you remove a lost Sensor from the Console, it may still be powered on and operating at its installed location. Verify that the Sensor is properly powered down and removed from the field after removing them from the Console. If a lost Sensor is found to be operational after having been removed and must be reinstalled on the network, you must contact the Technical Support team for assistance in reconfiguring the Sensor.
