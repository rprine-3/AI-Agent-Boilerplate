# Managing change requests across sites

You can view, create, or edit the change requests that belong to your site or other sites by using the Operational Technology Change Management application. By viewing the change requests from other sites, you can implement similar changes at your site.

## Change requests across sites overview

If you have the sn\_ot\_change\_write role, you can do the following tasks:

-   View and edit the Operational Technology \(OT\) change requests that are assigned to you or the change requests that belong to your site.
-   Create the OT change requests.
-   View the OT change requests that belong to the other sites.

The main benefit of having the sn\_ot\_change\_write role is that you have read-only visibility of changes across sites. Viewing other changes across sites can help you implement similar changes at your site.

**Note:** You can only edit OT change requests belonging to sites you have access to. Learn more about additional roles required for managing cross-site OT change requests in the following sections.
