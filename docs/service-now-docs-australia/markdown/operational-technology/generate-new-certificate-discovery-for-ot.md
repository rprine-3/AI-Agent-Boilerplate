# Generate a certificate

Generate a certificate to use with the Discovery Console for OT or upload your own certificates. This certificate allows the Console to boot up.

## Before you begin

**Note:** If you choose to do so, you can create your own certificate if it is required by your company's policies.

Role required: admin

## About this task

After the Discovery Console for OT is installed, there are default, preloaded certificates that power up the Console. However, following this initial boot, it's recommended that you use the Console to generate a new Certificate Authority \(CA\). This task describes your options for generating the Console CA.
