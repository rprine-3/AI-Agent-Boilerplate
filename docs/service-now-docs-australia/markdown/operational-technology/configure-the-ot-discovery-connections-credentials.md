# Configure the OT Discovery connections &amp; credentials

Configure the Service Graph Connector for ServiceNow Operational Technology \(OT\) Discovery authentication credentials and configuration used to connect to the ServiceNow OT Discovery devices.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** It's recommended that you switch to the application scope toService Graph Connector for ServiceNow Operational Technology \(OT\) Discovery.

## Procedure

1.  Confirm that the application scope is set to the Service Graph Connector for ServiceNow Operational Technology \(OT\) Discovery by using the application picker.

2.  Under **Configure the connection** section only configuring the MID Server is optional.

    **Note:** The MID Server is required when the console can't be reached from the internet. If the console is reachable to the ServiceNow instance then MID Server is not needed.

3.  Download and install the MID Server on the host machine, test the connection, and then validate the MID Server.

    Configure the MID Server using the MID Server Guided Setup.

    The MID Server access is a secure proxy between the ServiceNow Instance and the Console, allowing ServiceNow to schedule jobs and make REST calls into the environment to pull various pieces of information such as Assets, installed software, and so on. Without the MID Server, ServiceNow can't initiate direct communication if the Discovery Console is not reachable from the ServiceNow Instance

4.  Use the MID Server certificate check policies link to review the policies.

    **Note:** Enable/Disable the required security policies for the MID Server based on the network configuration.

5.  Next to the **Configure the OT Discovery Connection &amp; Credentials** task, select **Configure**.

    **Note:** Depending on your ServiceNow version, you're directed to Workflow Studio or the Workflow Studio Connections list. The Outbound connections are listed in alphabetical order.

6.  Navigate to or search for the OT Discovery Connections record.

7.  You can view and edit connections by selecting **View Details**.

    OT Discovery is the default connection.

8.  On the OT Discovery connection page, select **Configure**.

    The **Create Connection** window opens. To create a connection, select **Add Connection**.
