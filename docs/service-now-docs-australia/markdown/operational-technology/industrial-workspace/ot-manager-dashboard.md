# Operational Technology Visibility dashboard

The Operational Technology \(OT\) Visibility dashboard helps you manage your OT device in a centralized location. The OT Visibility dashboard lets you the access your OT device data.

## OT Visibility dashboard overview

The OT Visibility dashboard is a centralized location in the Industrial Workspace. You can use this dashboard to review your Operational Technology Manager and Industrial Process Manager data. You can also use it to review or edit the detailed information for the OT devices and equipment model entities in your OT network.

With the OT Visibility dashboard, you can achieve the following:

-   Understand what OT device information changed in your OT network in the past week.
-   View the progress of an OT device inventory through an industrial facility.
-   Analyze your OT devices in meaningful ways. For example, you can gain insights into how many of your production devices map to your production processes.

**Dashboard contents**

To access the OT device data in the OT Visibility dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace**, select the Dashboard Library \(\[Omitted image "dashboards-icon.png"\] Alt text: Dashboards icon\) icon, and then select the **Operational Technology Visibility**. To access the key performance indicators \(KPI\) graph for any tile that is described in the following table, select the number count or chart component in the tile.

The following table describes the OT device data that you can see on the different tiles on the dashboard.
