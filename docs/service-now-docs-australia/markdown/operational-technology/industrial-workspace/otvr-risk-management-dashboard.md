-   Vulnerability risk table for OT devices with no site assigned

|Table|Description|

|Vulnerability risk table for no site assigned OT devices|Displays the risk scores and count of vulnerable items for OT devices that aren’t assigned to any site|

You can view all the VIT records created for an entity by selecting the displayed number of VITs. Additionally, you can select a VIT record and view its details.
