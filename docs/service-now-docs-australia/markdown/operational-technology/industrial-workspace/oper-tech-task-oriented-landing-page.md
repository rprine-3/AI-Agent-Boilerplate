# Operational Technology Action-Oriented Landing Page

You can use the Operational Technology \(OT\) Action-Oriented Landing Page to track critical tasks related to your OT network.

## OT Action-Oriented Landing Page overview

The OT Action-Oriented Landing Page helps users, such as OT engineers, view tasks assigned to them, their site, or their group. The landing page calls out important actions that must be prioritized for the signed-in user and includes an overview of existing OT incidents, OT change requests, OT remediation tasks, OT vulnerable items, and other tasks.

The landing page provides a detailed and role-based view of the daily tasks and important actions. Each task in the **Important Action** section shows tasks sorted by their **Opened** date by default. If the task is critical, then it shows up in the **Important Action** section.

To access the OT Action-Oriented Landing Page, navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace**, select the Home \(\[Omitted image "home-icon.png"\] Alt text: Home icon in the Industrial Workspace.\) icon.

## Landing page contents

The following sections describe the content that you can view in the OT Action-Oriented Landing Page.

**Important actions**

The Important actions section contains OT tasks or actions that are considered critical and must be addressed as soon as possible. By default, the tasks are organized by their **Opened** date with the most recently created critical task assigned to the signed in user shown first.

The tasks shown in this section are the most critical tasks pulled from the **Overview** section that you can act on. Task criticality is determined by the following criteria:

-   Their priority is critical
-   The task is a remediation task and its risk rating is critical

The tasks included in this section are organized in the following ways:

-   All tasks directly assigned to the signed in user are shown first.
-   Tasks assigned to a user's group that are also not assigned to any user are shown after.
-   Tasks that aren't assigned to a group or user but are assigned to a site the signed in user has access to are shown last.

**Overview**

The Overview section contains an overview of OT incidents, change requests, remediation tasks, vulnerable items, and other tasks assigned to you, your group, or your site.

You can use the following filters to view the records shown based on the **Assigned to**, **Assignment group**, and **Site** fields on the records:

-   **Your work**

    Records assigned to you.

-   **Your group's work**

    Records assigned to your group or groups.

-   **Your site's work**

    Records assigned to your site or sites.


The following table describes the tiles in the Overview section.
