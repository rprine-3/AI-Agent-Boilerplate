# NLQ Genius Results used in the Industrial Workspace

The Industrial Workspace leverages Natural Language Query \(NLQ\) Genius Results for each search.

## NLQ Genius Results overview

Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) tables cannot be indexed by AI Search. The Industrial Workspace search is configured to show NLQ Genius Results for each search, which can be used to search CMDB tables. NLQ Genius Results use NLQ processing to surface relevant results from tables that match your search query.

For more information about NLQ Genius Results, see [NLQ Genius Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/genius-result-nlq-ais.md).

## Searching OT CIs

You can search Operational Technology \(OT\) configuration items \(CIs\) by specifying the table and column, leveraging the NLQ Genius Results.

The following table contains examples for searching different information for a PLC. If there are additional columns you need to search, you can follow this general pattern.

|Information type|Search input|
|----------------|------------|
|Searching for a PLC by name|`PLC Name <insert name>`|
|Searching for a PLC by model ID|`PLC Model ID <insert model ID>`|
|Searching for a PLC by description|`PLC Description <insert description>`|
|Searching for a PLC by manufacturer|`PLC Manufacturer <insert manufacturer>`|
