# Delete obsolete and expired hardware vulnerability assessments

Set up automatic deletion of obsolete or expired assessment records.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Configure the age of obsolete or expired assessments to be cleaned.

-   Obsolete assessments: Invalid assessments, which have been ignored or the associated vulnerable items \(VITs\) are closed for more than two years.
-   Expired assessments: If you update the firmware version of a device, the existing assessments based on the previous firmware version become invalid and are considered as expired assessments. You can delete expired assessments, which are older than a month. However, you must perform new vulnerability assessments for the devices with an updated firmware version.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Data Management** &gt; **Data Management Policies**.

2.  Search for and select the **sn\_vul\_analyst\_firmware\_vulnerability\_assessment** policy.

3.  Select the **Active** check box and configure clean-up rules according to your requirement.

    Configure the age in clean-up rules 1, 2, and 3, after which the obsolete and expired assessments are deleted:

    -   Rule 1: Delete firmware vulnerabilities assessment whose VIT is closed since 2 years\(based on last update date on VIT associated\).
    -   Rule 2: Delete firmware vulnerabilities assessment which are ignored since 2 years \(based on created date\).
    -   Rule 3: Delete firmware vulnerabilities assessment which are expired since 1 month \(based on last update date\).
4.  Select **Update**.
