# Industrial Workspace homepage destination rules

Depending on your assigned roles, you're redirected to different pages in the Industrial Workspace with homepage destination rules. This helps you access the data that you need more quickly and efficiently.

## Homepage destination rules overview

Each destination rule redirects different OT users to different pages on the Industrial Workspace based on their assigned role or roles. Some roles may not have access to the data on one page, so redirecting users to a page where data is available to view helps them better navigate the Industrial Workspace. For example, users with only the Operational Technology Editor \[cmdb\_ot\_editor\] role can't view data on the OT Action-Oriented Landing Page, so they only see the an empty landing page. Instead, they're redirected to the Industrial Workspace Lists, where they can view the applicable OT device data.
