# Populating your Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with equipment model data

Create and populate a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with your existing ISA equipment model data. Positioning your existing data in the correct columns is crucial to the success of your upload.

To create a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that properly populates the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) in the ServiceNow AI Platform, do the following actions:

1.  Prepare your spreadsheet for upload by using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that is attached to the data source record. To locate an empty template, do the following actions:

    1.  Navigate to **Equipment Model - ISA** &gt; **Import Equip. Model - Data Source**
    2.  Click **Import Equipment Model – Data Source - v2.xlsx**
    **Note:** Alternately, to download the **Import Equipment Model – Data Source - v2.xlsx** spreadsheet, see the [Microsoft Excel spreadsheets required for the ISA Equipment Model Excel Service Graph Connector \[KB0966600\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0966600) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

2.  Download the attached Import Equipment Model – Data Source - v2.xlsx spreadsheet to learn more about the template and its worksheets:

    **Note:** If you're an ISA SGC user upgrading from v1 to v2, see the section named **Upgrading from v1 to v2** below.

    |Worksheet name|Purpose|
    |--------------|-------|
    |Blank template for data import|Populates your Equipment Model data for import. You can view detailed examples in the remainder of this topic.|
    |Data Column Descriptions|Provides descriptions of the data columns on the spreadsheet, similar to the information found in this topic.|
    |Sample Data for Import|Provides an example of an equipment model for import in the spreadsheet. You can view these examples in the remainder of this topic.|

3.  After populating the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, save it in a known location for easy access when you run the Integration Hub ETL function.

    **Note:** Column names cannot be changed. You can add additional columns to support additional fields to uniquely identify owners, as designated in the **sn\_isa\_model.user\_search\_matching\_attribute** system property.


## Populating the spreadsheet

You can import data from multiple sites in a single spreadsheet. The example image shows data for two sites: ATL and CTL.
