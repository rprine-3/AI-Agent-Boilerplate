# Map the upstream production processes for the selected equipment model entity

Use the upstream process to review upstream production processes for the selected equipment model entity. You can also create and map a new upstream production process for the equipment model entity.

## Before you begin

Role required: cmdb\_ot\_isa\_editor, cmdb\_ot\_isa\_viewer, cmdb\_ot\_isa\_admin

## About this task

Users with an assigned cmdb\_ot\_isa\_admin role can view equipment model entities for any site. However, users with an assigned cmdb\_ot\_isa\_editor role can only access those sites that an administrator has granted access to for specific users. To learn more about granting site access, see [Assign or remove equipment model site access for non-administrators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/create-user-criteria-for-equipment-model-entity-site-users.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace Admin** &gt; **Industrial Process Manager** &gt; **Equipment Model Manager**.

2.  In the **Equipment model view for** field, select the site that you want to view equipment model information for.

    You can search for a site by typing in the site name or its short code.

3.  In the selector pane, expand the equipment model hierarchy and then click the entity that you want to view.

4.  To view the upstream production processes for the equipment model entity, click **Upstream Process**.

5.  Review the upstream production processes for the equipment model, or map a new one.
