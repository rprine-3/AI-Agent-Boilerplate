If you have the required entitlement and the Administrator \[admin\] role, you can install the Industrial Process Manager application and the related plugins.
-   **[Industrial Workspace Admin application menu and Guided Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/manufacturing-app-menu-guided-setup.md)**  
After you install the application and related plugins, you can use the Industrial Workspace Admin application menu to access the related Operational Technology Manager, Industrial Process Manager, Operational Technology Incident Management, Operational Technology Vulnerability Response, Operational Technology Change Management, Operational Technology Knowledge Management, and Operational Technology Request Management functions.
-   **[Assign Industrial Process Manager user roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/assign-manufacturing-process-manager-roles.md)**  
Assign roles to your users so that you can control their access to the features, capabilities, and data in the Industrial Process Manager application.
-   **[View and edit OT system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/view-and-edit-ot-system-properties.md)**  
View and edit all of the Operational Technology \(OT\) related system properties for different applications.
-   **[Defining equipment model templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/defining-equipment-model-templates.md)**  
Create templates that you can assign to the equipment model entities that you created in the ServiceNow AI Platform. You can use these templates to characterize an equipment model or structure the data that describes your physical industrial facility by grouping similar types of equipment model entities.
-   **[Importing equipment model data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/importing-isa95-equipment-model-etl.md)**  
The scheduled import function enables you to import your existing equipment model data from a populated Microsoft Excel flat-file spreadsheet. You can use it to import your ISA-95 Equipment Model data to the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).
-   **[Assign or remove equipment model site access for non-administrators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/create-user-criteria-for-equipment-model-entity-site-users.md)**  
Assign or remove equipment model site access for non-administrators. You can create the user criteria to determine whether certain users can access the equipment model entities for specific sites.
-   **[Managing an equipment model entity schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/managing-equipment-entity-schedules.md)**  
You can manage an equipment model entity schedule with the Industrial Process Manager application. By using a schedule, you can track several maintenance tasks for one equipment model entity.
