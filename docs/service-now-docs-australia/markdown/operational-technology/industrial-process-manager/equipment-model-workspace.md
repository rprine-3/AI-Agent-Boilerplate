# Review and update the equipment model details

Review and update the details for an equipment model that you imported into the ServiceNow AI Platform so that you can make sure that the information is correct. You can also manually create a new equipment model entity and then add details to it.

## Before you begin

Import equipment model data to the ServiceNow AI Platform. To learn more, see [Importing equipment model data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/importing-isa95-equipment-model-etl.md).

Role required: cmdb\_ot\_isa\_viewer, cmdb\_ot\_isa\_editor, cmdb\_ot\_isa\_admin.

## About this task

If you have an assigned cmdb\_ot\_isa\_viewer role, you can only view equipment model entities. If you have any of the other assigned cmdb\_ot\_isa roles, you can also edit equipment model entities.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace Admin** &gt; **Industrial Process Manager** &gt; **Equipment Model Manager**.

2.  In the **Equipment model view for** field, select the site that you want to view the equipment model information for.

    You can search for a site by typing in the site name or its short code.

3.  Review an existing equipment model entity, or create one.
