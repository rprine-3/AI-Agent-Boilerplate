# Automated Mapping Across Zone-based IP Network Groups

Automate mapping of Operational Technology \(OT\) devices to the production process using the Automated Mapping Across Zone-based IP Network Groups \(AMAZING\) feature.​

When OT managers experience vulnerabilities or must manage workflow involving OT devices, the context of how the OT device connects to the production process it automates is critical to prioritizing work. ​ ​Automatic mapping of OT devices to ISA equipment model entities enables the view of device-to-process relationships​.

**Note:** Only one subnet range according to site is supported. Two different sites can have the same subnet; for example, 192.168.101.0/24. But multiple subnets of the same range are **not** supported for the same site. It is recommended that you use manual mapping in this scenario.

## Key benefits

-   Upload and store OT subnets from authoritative sources \(such as NetDB or Firewalls\) as records in a ServiceNow ​ instance.
-   Automate assignment of OT devices to ISA entity using IP addresses and OT subnet.
-   Minimize issues with reuse of private IP address ranges across multiple sites​.
-   Use discovered subnets in copy-paste networks to help uniquely identify OT devices for mapping.

Industrial networks use subnets to divide the private IP address space with a single subnet often aligned to a part of the production process, or the equipment model entity. For example, a canning line runs on a 192.168.101.0/24 network in which all the equipment was programmed by the integrator. The IPs used by the control systems, or OT devices, are often hard-coded into the automation software used to run the line. If the subnet maps to the canning line in the Atlanta site, a manager can automatically map a detected PLC with IP 192.168.101.66 to the canning line.

The mapping feature relates each subnet to an equipment model entity, enabling you to automatically map OT devices to the subnets associated with the equipment model entity based on the IP address that was reported upon import from an OT-certified integration or ServiceNow®'s [IT Discovery for Operational Technology \(OT\) Networks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/discovery-for-operational-technology.md).​

## Types of mapping

</table>## Using discovered subnets to uniquely identify devices

Copy-paste networks can make it difficult to uniquely identify OT devices and correctly map them to their equipment model entities. At some sites the same IP subnet range may be used for multiple equipment model entities, which can result in ambiguity about where to map your OT device. To more accurately map an OT device to its equipment model entity, you can configure the discovered subnet to identify the unique device and which equipment model entity it should be mapped to.

By using discovered subnets with the AMAZING feature, you can uniquely identify OT devices in a copy-paste network. The logic is as follows:

1.  When OT device data is populated from a Service Graph Connector, the subnet and managed network must be populated in the IP Address \[cmdb\_ci\_ip\_address\] table using the **Netmask** and **Network partition identifier** fields. The **Network partition identifier** field is important to the mapping process because it's always unique to an OT device.
2.  The **Discovered subnet** and **Managed network** fields must also be populated in the OT device data for mapping to continue.

The AMAZING feature retrieves all configuration items \(CIs\) associated with a particular site. The IP address details, including the **Netmask** and **Network partition ID** fields, are obtained. Using the IP address details, the feature determines the discovered subnet then checks if the selected subnet and the managed network match the discovered subnet. If a match is found, the **Automated by :: Automates** relationship is established between the CI and the equipment model entity to effectively map the OT device to the correct entity.

The discovered subnets live in the OT Discovered Subnets \[sn\_ot\_discovered\_subnet\] table available with the Industrial Core. This table leverages the following attributes to help refine OT device mapping accuracy:

-   CIDR
-   Discovered Managed Network
-   Site

For more information about Industrial Core, see [Industrial Core plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-manager/industrial-core-plugin.md).

You can also manually create a discovered subnet. For more information, see the [Create an OT discovered subnet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/create-ot-discovered-subnet.md).

</table>## Plugins

Enabling the mapping feature requires the following plugins:

-   [Operational Technology Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-manager/operational-technology-manager.md)
