# View all mapped OT devices

View a list of all the Operational Technology \(OT\) devices that are mapped to an equipment model entity.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ot\_amazing\_write or sn\_ot\_amazing\_admin

## About this task

When you open a parent record in the CI Relationships table, you can view the Mapped OT Devices related list. The related list is a rolled up view that shows all the devices mapped with children ISA equipment model entities after you open the parent ISA equipment model entity. It contains the records that represent a mapping between an equipment model entity and a device.

## Procedure

1.  To view the mapped OT devices in the Industrial Workspace, complete the following actions.

    1.  Navigate to the Industrial Workspace.
    2.  Select the Equipment model \(\[Omitted image "equip-model-manager-button.png"\] Alt text: Equipment model icon in the Industrial Workspace to access the Equipment Model Manager\) icon.
    3.  Open the equipment model entity that you want to view the mapped devices for.
    4.  Select the **Mapped OT Devices** tab.

        **Note:** The **Mapped Equipment Model Entity** column notes the equipment model entity that the device is mapped to. You can map a device to more than one equipment model entity.

2.  To view the mapped OT devices on the ServiceNow AI Platform, navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace Admin** &gt; **Industrial Process Manager** &gt; **Mapped OT Devices**.

    This list contains all the devices that are mapped with different equipment model entities. The **Automates by :: Automates** CI relationship is applied to the parent and child entities.

    In this list, you can use the **Mapped Equipment Model Entity** column to identify the equipment model entity the device is mapped to. For more information on how to add a column to a list, see [Personalize a list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_PersonalLists.md).
