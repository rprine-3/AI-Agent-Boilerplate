# Create an entity for a new equipment model

Create an entity for a new equipment model. You do this task when you want to manually create a new equipment model entity directly in the ServiceNow AI Platform rather than import the equipment model data from an external source.

## Before you begin

Role required: cmdb\_ot\_isa\_editor, cmdb\_ot\_isa\_admin.

## About this task

Users with an assigned cmdb\_ot\_isa\_admin role can view equipment model entities for any site. However, users with an assigned cmdb\_ot\_isa\_editor role can only access those sites that an administrator has granted access to for specific users. To learn more about granting site access, see [Assign or remove equipment model site access for non-administrators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/industrial-process-manager/create-user-criteria-for-equipment-model-entity-site-users.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace Admin** &gt; **Industrial Process Manager** &gt; **Equipment Model Manager**.

2.  In the **Equipment model view for** field, select the site that you want to view the equipment model information for.

    You can search for a site by typing in the site name or its short code.

3.  Select **Create new entity**.

4.  In the **Create new entity** window, search for and select the parent entity.

    **Note:** You can search the parent entity by short code or name.
