# View all OT devices by managed network

View your Operational Technology \(OT\) devices by managed network on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Before you begin

Role required: cmdb\_ot\_isa\_viewer and cmdb\_ot\_viewer

## About this task

The All OT Devices by Managed Network list on the ServiceNow AI Platform is a database view with data populated from the following tables.

-   OT Entity \[cmdb\_ot\_entity\]
-   Configuration Items \[cmdb\_ci\]
-   Configuration Item Relationships \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\]
-   Allocated IP Address \[cmdb\_ci\_allocated\_ip\_address\]
-   IP Network Subnet \[cmdb\_ci\_ip\_network\_subnet\]
-   Managed Network \[cmdb\_ci\_managed\_network\]

Using the All OT Devices by Managed Network list can help you understand the relationship between OT devices and their network.
