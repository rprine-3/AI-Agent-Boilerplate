# Service Graph Connector for ServiceNow OT Discovery Guided Setup

Use the Guided Setup for the Service Graph Connector for ServiceNow OT Discovery to lead you through the installation, connection, configuration, and integration steps for the OT Discovery environment.

When ready, in stall the Console first, install the Sensor after that and, finally, install the Collector. For more information, see [Air-gapped networks and OT Discovery installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/air-gapped-networks-installation.md).

10. Return to the previous page and select **Mark as complete**.

11. Go back to the Service Graph Connector Guided Setup page.

12. The next section is **Configure table permissions**.

    **Note:** Setting the table permissions allows you to have multiple connections across multiple consoles. This depends on your deployment choice of the Discovery Console for OT.
