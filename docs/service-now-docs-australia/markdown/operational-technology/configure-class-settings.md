# Configure classification settings in SGC Central

In SGC Central, you can configure the Service Graph Connector for ServiceNow OT Discovery classifications settings to define how OT Discovery categories are mapped to the CMDB classes.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  When you select Continue in the Configure and test connections step, the Configure classification settings step opens.

2.  Review the classification settings.

    **Note:** The OT Discovery classification settings define how OT Discovery categories are mapped to the target ServiceNow Instance CMDB classes. It also defines how they are configured to additional settings based on classification, such as the configuration item \(CI\) naming strategy and whether to permit OS classification. The default recommended classification settings are provided by the application, which you can then configure for your needs.
