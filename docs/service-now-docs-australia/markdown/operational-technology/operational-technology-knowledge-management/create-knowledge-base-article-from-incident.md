# Create a knowledge article from an OT incident record

Create a knowledge article to record and save information that is related to an Operational Technology \(OT\) incident and its resolution.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ot\_incident\_write

For more information, see [Create an OT knowledge base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-knowledge-management/configure-ot-knowledge-base.md).

## About this task

Creating a knowledge article directly from an incident record helps to make sure that the knowledge article is linked to the correct incident for contextual information. The knowledge article can also help your team resolve similar incidents in the future when they include the correct procedures, challenges, and solutions.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Industrial Workspace**.

2.  In the list view under the OT Incident module, open one of the available lists.

3.  Select the OT incident record that you want to create a knowledge article for.

4.  Select the **More actions** icon \(\[Omitted image "more-actions.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\) to expand the menu.

5.  Select **Create Knowledge**.

    **Note:** You must set the incident record's state to **Resolved** to see the **Create Knowledge** button.
