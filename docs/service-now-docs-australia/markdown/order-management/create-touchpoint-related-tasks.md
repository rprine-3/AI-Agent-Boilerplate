# Create a related task from a touchpoint

Create tasks directly from a touchpoint record to assign follow-up actions such as researching customer backgrounds, track post-interaction commitments, and coordinate stakeholders without having to leave the touchpoint workspace. Tasks are automatically linked to the touchpoint so all related activity stays connected.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_crm\_touchpoint.touchpoint\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:.

3.  Navigate to **Touchpoints** &gt; **All Touchpoints**.

4.  Open the touchpoint record you want to work with.

5.  Navigate to the tab related to the entity type.

    For example, if Opportunity is the associated entity, then the name of the tab would be Opportunity Tasks. However, if the associated entity is Account or Contact, then the tab name is Task.

6.  Select **New**.

7.  On the create new task form, fill in the fields.

    For more information about the form fields for the CRM entities, refer to the corresponding topic.

    |CRM entity|Form field descriptions|

    |**Lead**|[Create new lead task form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/create-lead-task-form.md)|
    |**Opportunity**|[Create new opportunity task form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/create-opportunity-task-form.md)|

8.  Select **Save**.


## Result

A task record is created against the CRM entity and touchpoint record. You can view the corresponding task from the respective module. For example, to view opportunity task, navigate to **Opportunity** &gt; **Opportunity Tasks** list menu. You can also access it from the **Opportunity Tasks** tab from the touchpoint record.
