</table>## Customer Engagement Sequences workflow

The following illustration describes the tasks involved in configuring and using Customer Engagement Sequences.

\[Omitted image "customer-engagement-sequences-workflow-landing.svg"\] Alt text: Infographic showing how to create sequences and complete outreach using Customer Engagement Sequences. For details, refer to the list of tasks that follows.

1.  As a sequence writer, create a customer engagement sequence such as a lead-nurturing sequence from the CRM Workspace.
2.  Define the sequence parameters:
    -   Single or multi-trigger conditions \(for example, when a new lead is created\)
    -   Sequence steps \(for example, call, follow-up, email\)
    -   Delay between steps \(for example, wait three days between two call attempts\)
    -   Exit conditions \(for example, lead conversion or disqualification\)
3.  Test and activate the sequence.
4.  Every record that meets the trigger condition is added to the sequence, and a sequence task associated with the record is created. For example, when a new lead record is created in the system, the sequence is run, and it generates a sequence task.
5.  As a sequence executor, view the assigned sequence task and complete the series of predefined activities that are part of it. For example:
    -   Day 1: Call the prospect
    -   Day 4: Make a follow-up call and use a questionnaire to gather more information
6.  The sequence task moves to closed state when all sequence steps have been completed or the predefined exit condition is met.
7.  Business stakeholders with sequence reader role can view the sequences in Workflow Studio to suggest process improvements to the SDMs and share high-performing sequences with other sales teams situated in different territories.
