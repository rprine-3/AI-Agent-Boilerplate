# Create product offering relationship groups

Use relationship groups to organize child offer options or relationships into logical groups and set up cardinality rules at the group level in Sales Customer Relationship Management. Groups of product offerings then appear on the product configurator.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_prd\_pm\_product\_catalog\_admin and sn\_prd\_pm\_product\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

Create product offering relationship groups to organize product bundles into groups in the product configurator.

For example, an internet and OTT Bundle Product Offering is configured to have three product offering relationship groups: modem group, internet group, and the plan streaming channel group.

Bundled product offerings can be other bundles or individual product offerings.

Assign child product offerings in a bundle to the product offering relationship group, which presents the options in logical groups on the product configurator to the agent. The following example shows how product offering groups appear in the product configurator.
