# Order types in Sales Customer Relationship Management

Customer orders and service orders are the two main type of sales orders in ServiceNow Order Management. Learn about their differences and how to select an appropriate order type for your use case.

Use customer orders for ordering products or services. Use service orders for the activation of new services or for the post-sales requests for the services that were activated for and delivered to customers at earlier dates. By using this process, you ensure that service orders are correct and handled efficiently throughout the entire fulfillment process. The following table compares customer and service orders and lists the differences between the two.

</table>## Differences between the pre- and post-approval service orders

Like customer orders, captured service orders also have an ID with a prefix of ORD\(nnn\). The **Order Category** field in the order forms indicates if the order is for a **Product** \(a customer order\) or a **Service** \(a service order\). These labels enable you to identify the type of order.

When you approve a captured service order for fulfillment, the post-approval decomposition process generates actionable service orders and resource orders. You may see a single service order, multiple service orders, and resource orders that are associated with your approved service order.

-   Service orders with a prefix of SO\(nnn\) are referred to as domain orders. These orders, and their related resource orders, with a prefix of RO\(nnn\), must be fulfilled to complete the service order line items on the captured service orders.
-   The resource order manages the resources required to fulfill the services that the customer is requesting.
-   These domain orders manage the fulfillment of the requested service orders.

## Order types for service orders

The following are the two key fulfillment actions for service orders:

-   Deliver: Involves providing the ordered items to the customer once the order is ready.
-   Qualify: Validates whether a service or product can be fulfilled before actual execution.

Service qualification request orders with fulfillment type as Qualify can only be created in the ServiceNow Order Management system using APIs from external qualification request systems. When you capture an order using Order Management, the orders are created with the fulfillment type as Deliver.
