# Add subscription pricing to an order

Add contract pricing to an order or order line items including start and end dates in Order Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent

## About this task

Subscription pricing is a pricing model where customers pay a recurring fee for products or services, typically at regular intervals such as monthly or annually.

In an order, you can set the contract start date and end date, or you can enter a term and the contract end date is automatically calculated.

Subscription pricing can be added at the order header level or at the order line item level.

See [Subscription revenue metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/som-subscription-pricing.md) for more information about how contract pricing works.
