# Configure quote document generation

The Generate PDF Document feature generates a PDF document of the current quote based on the selected template. After the document is generated, it is available in the **Attachments** section of the Contextual Side Panel \(CSP\). To enable this feature, an administrator configures a custom integration and a custom event that initiate the document generation process.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Before you configure the document generation feature, complete the following instance setup:

1.  Activate the Quote Experience plugin \(App ID: sn\_quote\_mgmt\_adv\).
2.  Submit a support ticket requesting to enable the **Document Generation** tenant setting.
3.  When the tenant setting is enabled, export and import the transaction blueprint.

You must also create a document template before you configure this feature. Document templates are created and managed outside CPQ Administration. For instructions, see [Configure quote PDF documents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/quote-management-configure-pdf-documents.md).

## About this task

The document generation feature uses the following system fields to determine the template and signers for the generated document.

|Type|Display name|Variable name|
|----|------------|-------------|
|Field|Document Template|`txn.docGen.template`|
|Field|Document External Signer|`txn.docGen.externalSigner`|
|Field|Document Internal Signer|`txn.docGen.internalSigner`|

To configure the feature, update the system fields, create a custom integration and a custom event in the blueprint, and then deploy the blueprint. Complete the following phases in order.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CPQ Administration** &gt; **Transaction**.

2.  On the blueprint, select **Fields**.

3.  For each system field listed in the preceding table, set the **Default Access** to **Editable**.

4.  Add each system field to the transaction layout.

5.  Create a custom integration.

    For more information, see [Quote transaction integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/quote-tm-integrations.md)

6.  Configure the following integration settings.

    |Setting|Value|
    |-------|-----|
    |HTTP Method|`POST`|
    |Additional Path|`/api/sn_quote_mgmt_adv/v1/quotes/{{txn.id}}/documents`|
    |Timeout|`5000`|
    |Line Item Details to Include|None|
    |Async|Disabled|
    |Headers|Not applicable|

7.  Leave the **Request Transformation** unconfigured.

    No request transformation is required for this integration.

8.  For **Connection to Endpoint**, select **serviceNowJwtConnection**.

9.  Leave the **Response Transformation** unconfigured.

    No response transformation is required for this integration.

10. Create a custom event.

11. In the event properties, set **Event Access** to **Active**.

12. Associate the integration you created with the event.

13. Add a button to the layout to trigger the event.

    1.  Enable the event button.

    2.  From the **Event** picklist, select the event you created in Phase 3.

14. In **Views**, adjust the access to the event for each stage.

15. Select **Save**.

16. Select **Deploy** to deploy the blueprint.


## Result

When a user selects the generate-document button on a quote, the integration generates a PDF document from the selected template and attaches it to the quote. The document is available in the **Attachments** section of the Contextual Side Panel \(CSP\).
