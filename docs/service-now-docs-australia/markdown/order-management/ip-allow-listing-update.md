# IP allow-listing update

To better support our growing needs and increase capacity, we have expanded the pool of outbound addresses used for requests from CPQ.

**Important:** This change is relevant only if you use allow-listing to control which external systems can communicate with your integration servers. If you rely on allow-listing, it is important to update your configuration to include the new addresses listed below. This will help ensure that your integration calls from CPQ continue to function smoothly and without interruption.

-   **Inbound production \(prod01.ServiceNow CPQ.io\)**
    -   35.224.151.71
    -   34.83.141.224
-   **Outbound production \(prod01.ServiceNow CPQ.io\)**
