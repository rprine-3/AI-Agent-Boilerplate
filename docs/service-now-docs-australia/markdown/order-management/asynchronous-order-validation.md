# Validating your orders through asynchronous order processing

You can validate your orders before the order records are created in the customer order table during asynchronous order processing in the ServiceNow® Order Management application.

You configure two system properties to validate your orders in asynchronous order processing. The **create\_product\_order\_validations\_async** system property for product orders and the **create\_service\_order\_validations\_async** system property for service orders control the validation in the asynchronous processing of orders before the orders are inserted into the Inbound Queue \[sn\_tmt\_core\_inbound\_queue\] table. The default values of these properties are set to True.

By default, when a scheduled job picks up the record from the Inbound Queue \[sn\_tmt\_core\_inbound\_queue\] table, no validation occurs and the order and the order line items are created.

To enable validation through a scheduled job, you can override the **enableValidationViaScheduleJob** property to return true. By default, this method returns false.

The following table lists all the system properties that are required for validation.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.create\_product\_order\_validations\_async|Enable or disable the validations before inserting the product order records into the Inbound Queue \[sn\_tmt\_core\_inbound\_queue\] table.​|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.create\_product\_order\_validations\_sync|Enable or disable the validations before inserting the product order records into the Customer Order \[sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm\_order\]table.|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.create\_service\_order\_validations\_async|Enable or disable the validations before inserting the service order records into the Inbound Queue \[sn\_tmt\_core\_inbound\_queue\] table.​|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.create\_service\_order\_validations\_sync|Enable or disable the validations before inserting the service order records into the Customer Order \[sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm\_order\] table.|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.glide.mutex.script.maxspins|Maximum number of times for a thread to try to acquire a lock. The default value is 100.|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.glide.mutex.script.spinwait|Time to wait between lock attempts, in ms. The default value is 100 ms.|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.limit|Number of records \(batch size\) to return from the inbound queue \[sn\_tmt\_core\_inbound\_queue\] table for processing. The default value is 100.|
|sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.schedule.max.runtime|Maximum time up to which the scheduled job runs, in ms. The default value is 900000 ms.|
