# Create and publish a cost book

Create a cost book that defines the unit costs for products and services in Sales Customer Relationship Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_csm\_pricing\_pricelist\_administrator, sn\_csm\_pricing\_pricelist\_manager

## About this task

You can create cost books that define the unit costs for a set of products and a specified currency. However, only one cost book per given currency is allowed.

You can create multiple cost books for a given currency, but the first cost book that you create for a particular currency is automatically set as the default cost book. If you don’t want the first cost book as the default, deselect the **Default** option. When you're creating a default cost book, the start date must be either the current date or a date earlier than the current date.

## Procedure

1.  In the CRM Workspace, select the **List** view.

2.  Navigate to **Prices** &gt; **Cost Books**.

3.  In the Prices - Cost Books list, select **New**.

4.  In the Details tab, fill in the fields.
