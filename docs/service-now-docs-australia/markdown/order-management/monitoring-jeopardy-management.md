# Monitoring order jeopardy

Order managers and agents can monitor jeopardy-enabled fulfillment tasks. When a task enters jeopardy, managers can take action to ensure the fulfillment workflow isn’t delayed.

When Jeopardy Management is added to fulfillment task flows, Jeopardy Management tracks the time to complete tasks and creates a predictive assessment of the risk level to the fulfillment plan. If a task is taking longer than the defined time, jeopardy alerts are shared.

The following table describes where you can view the jeopardy status.
