# Create a product offering recommendation

Create product offering recommendations that can be used by your sales agents to upsell or cross-sell additional products in quotes.

## Before you begin

Review the product offerings that your sales agents can add to quotes, then determine the complementary and supplementary products that can be recommended to upsell or cross-sell additional products for those products. The source product offerings and also the recommended product offerings must be published in the product catalog.
