# Approve an approval request for a quote

Review and approve or reject a quote advanced approval request that is routed to you as part of an advanced approval workflow.

## Before you begin

Advanced Approval Management must be installed to approve a quote advanced approval request.

Role required: sn\_adv\_appr\_mgmt.approval\_request\_approver

## About this task

You can approve a quote advanced approval request from several locations:

-   A quote.
-   Your approval entry on the quote.
-   My Approvals.
-   Approval notification email.
-   My Tasks in Now Mobile.

This task describes how to approve a request directly from a quote.

If your administrator has configured reminder schedules, you receive automated notifications when your approval steps are pending. If an approval step has been escalated, the step card displays the escalated approver in the **Remaining by** section and removes all other remaining approvers, so you know who is responsible for the next action. Your administrator configures reminder and escalation settings.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**

2.  Select the \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:List icon.

3.  Navigate to **Quotes** &gt; **All**.

4.  Select the quote that contains the advanced approval request.

5.  Select the **Approvals** tab.

6.  Locate the approval step assigned to you.

7.  From your approval box, select the **ellipsis** menu, then select **Approve** or **Reject**.

    1.  If you select **Approve**, then enter comments \(if needed\) and select **Approve** to confirm.

    2.  If you select **Reject**, then enter a comment explaining the reason for rejection and select **Reject** to confirm.


## Result

If approved, your decision is recorded for the quote approval step, and the approval workflow continues based on the configured sequencing.

If rejected, the approval request is marked as rejected and the quote is returned for further review or updates, based on the configured approval process.
