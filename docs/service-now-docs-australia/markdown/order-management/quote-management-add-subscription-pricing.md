# Add subscription pricing to a quote

Add subscription pricing to a quote or quote line items including start and end dates in Quote Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sales\_agent

## About this task

Subscription pricing is a pricing model where customers pay a recurring fee for products or services, typically at regular intervals such as monthly or annually.

In a quote, you can set the subscription pricing start date and end date, or you can enter a term and the subscription end date is automatically calculated.

Subscription pricing can be added at the quote header level or at the quote line item level.

See [Subscription revenue metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/som-subscription-pricing.md) for more information about how subscription pricing works.
