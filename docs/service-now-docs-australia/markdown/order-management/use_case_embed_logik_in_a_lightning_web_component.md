# Use case: Embed CPQ UI in a Lightning Web Component

Learn how to embed CPQ in a LWC in a Salesforce org.

You can embed CPQ in a Lightning Web Component \(LWC\) in a Salesforce org. This eliminates the need to directly navigate to CPQ through a particular product or the CPQ custom URL.

## Steps for Embedding

1.  Download the base LWC package [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLtv1xUCzXwk-kbDvr9tWTMR4Xuky4Rn/view?usp=sharing), and unzip.
2.  Within an integrated development environment \(IDE—in this example, VSCode\), or on the command line:
    1.  Connect to your Salesforce org using the Salesforce CLI or Salesforce Extensions for the IDE.

    2.  Open the folder and publish to org using Salesforce CLI or the extensions in your IDE. In VSCode, this means right- clicking the folder in the VSCode explorer and clicking Deploy Source to Org.

        **Note:** To complete this step, you must be connected to the org.

3.  Go into the Salesforce page where you want to embed CPQ.
4.  On the Setup menu, click Edit Page.

    If you are passing the configuration URL as a parameter, include a Runtime Token in the URL \(for example,`?rt=xxxxxxxxxxxx`\)
