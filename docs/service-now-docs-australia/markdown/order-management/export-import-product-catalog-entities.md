# Exporting and importing product catalog entities

As a product catalog admin, you can both export and import product catalog entities between ServiceNow instances. For example, you can promote catalog entities from a non-production instance to a production instance. Each process involves a separate set of steps.

## Managing product catalog entities

The first step before exporting product catalog entities is adding the **Code** field values to product catalog entities. The **Code** field value is used by the system to determine whether an entity is to be inserted or updated in the target instance.

You then choose the product catalog entities to be exported and run the export process.

After you export your product catalog entities, certain base entities must be imported first to your target instance, such as characteristics, characteristic options, template, and Unit of Measure \(UOM\), since they're referenced by product offerings, product specifications, and service specifications. For this reason, import certain product catalog entities to your target instance in the following order:

1.  Import the exported base entities.
2.  Import the product offering catalog if you're exporting product offerings.
3.  Import product offerings and product specifications.

## Export and import process

Follow these steps to export and import product catalog entities.
