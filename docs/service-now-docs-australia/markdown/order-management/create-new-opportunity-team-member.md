# Add a new opportunity team member

Create an opportunity team member for a structured collaboration among multiple users.

## Before you begin

Role required: opportunity\_writer

**Note:** Users who aren’t assigned the sales\_agents or sales\_managers roles, might require access to specific opportunities when they’re added to an opportunity team. Such users must be assigned the sales\_restricted\_agent role. The opportunity role assigned to the user then determines the scope and level of access granted for the associated opportunity.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **List** view \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: and select **Opportunity - All**.

2.  From the **Opportunity List** window, select the opportunity you want to work with and select the **Team** tab.

3.  Select **New** to add a new opportunity team member or select an existing opportunity team member to make changes.

4.  Fill in the fields in the Opportunity Team Member form.
