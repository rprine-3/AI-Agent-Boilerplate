# Dispute a specific line item on an invoice against your account using the Business Portal

Challenge discrepancies in invoiced quantity, part number, billing location, or shipping location for a single invoice line item via the Business Portal using the playbook experience.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.customer

## About this task

This task describes how to create an invoice case using the playbook experience in the Business Portal. The playbook experience enables you to dispute various invoice discrepancies depending on the scope you select, including quantity, part number, billing location, and shipping location issues.

Creating invoice cases using the ServiceNow Otto panel limits disputes to quantity issues only. For more information, see [Dispute invoice issues using ServiceNow Otto Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/dispute-invoice-issues-now-assist.md).

        All fields become read-only after once you select **Next** and go to the Add and specify changes page.

    3.  Select **Next**.

        An invoice case is created with its State as Draft.

        Invoice case lines are created corresponding to the invoice records.

    3.  Select the invoice case lines that you want to edit and select **Edit**.

        Select a single invoice case line to make specific changes to a specific invoice. Select multiple invoice case lines to make the same changes for all invoices.

        **Note:**

        If you no longer want to change an invoice case line item, select it, select the drop-down button next to **Edit**, and select **Delete** to remove it from the list of items to be modified.

    4.  Modify any or all of the values in the Edit item dialog box.

        |Disputed quantity|The quantity you believe should have been invoiced instead of the amount shown in Invoiced quantity.|

        |Disputed billing location|The correct billing location if the Invoiced billing location is incorrect.|
