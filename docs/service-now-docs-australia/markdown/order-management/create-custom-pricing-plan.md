# Create a configurable pricing plan

Create a configurable pricing plan by copying the default pricing plan provided in Pricing Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_csm\_pricing\_pricelist\_administrator, sn\_csm\_pricing\_pricelist\_manager

## Procedure

1.  In the CRM Workspace, select the **List** view.

2.  Navigate to **Pricing** &gt; **Pricing Plans**.

3.  Select the default pricing plan and select **Copy**.

    The copy of the default pricing plan opens in a new tab in the Draft state.

4.  Provide the pricing plan details:

    1.  Enter the **Name** of the pricing plan.

    2.  If you want price adjustments to be applied after price overrides, select the **Apply adjustments after price override** option.

        If you select this option, after the system applies a price override, any remaining pricing steps are run. If you don't select this option, any pricing steps scheduled after the price override is applied are not run.

    3.  Enter a new **Description** for the custom pricing plan.

5.  Select **Save**.

    The configurable pricing plan is created with the **Name** that you provided.
