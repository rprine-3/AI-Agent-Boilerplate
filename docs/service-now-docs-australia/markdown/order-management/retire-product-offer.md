## Procedure

2.  Navigate to the published product offering or service specification to be retired.

    -   To retire a product offering, navigate to **Offerings** &gt; **Product Offerings** and select the product offering to be retired.
    -   To retire a service specification, navigate to **Specifications** &gt; **Service specifications** and select the service specification to be retired.
