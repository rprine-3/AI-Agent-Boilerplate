# Override the shopping cart total when a null-priced item is included

To avoid displaying an incorrect total price, show a custom string when a bill of materials includes an item with a null price.

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

## About this task

When a BOM contains null-priced items, the total price may be incorrect. When this is the case, the administrator can define a string to display in place of the BOM total.

## Procedure

1.  In the layout editor, open the product list properties.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-layout-custom-message-gear-icon.png"\] Alt text: Product list

2.  In the properties dialog, set **Override display of Total for incomplete pricing** to true, and enter the string to display in the total's place.
