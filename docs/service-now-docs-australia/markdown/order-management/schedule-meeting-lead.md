# Schedule a meeting from a lead

Schedule a client meeting directly from a lead record to associate it with the lead.

## Before you begin

Verify that the Meetings plugin \(sn\_meeting\_mgmt\) is activated.

The lead must be in a non-closed state.

Role required: sn\_meeting\_mgmt.meeting\_creator

## About this task

When you schedule a meeting from a lead, the system automatically associates the meeting with that lead. The meeting then appears in the lead **Meetings** tab.

## Procedure

1.  In the CRM Workspace, select the **List** \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: view.

2.  Navigate to **Leads** &gt; **All** and open the lead record.

3.  In the lead header, select **Create** &gt; **Meeting**.

    The **Meeting** option appears only when you have permission to create meetings. The option is hidden when the lead is in a closed state.

4.  Complete the meeting form.

    The meeting form includes tabs for occurrences, participants, and summary. The meeting is automatically associated with the lead.

5.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The meeting is created and linked to the lead. It appears in the **Meetings** tab of the lead record and in the **Upcoming meetings** section of the Priority Activity panel.

## What to do next

To view all meetings for the lead, select the **Meetings** tab.

**Note:** The **Meetings** tab displays both meetings linked directly to the lead and meetings linked to the lead's touchpoints.
