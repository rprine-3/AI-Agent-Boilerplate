# Transaction-level system fields

Reference for the system-provided fields at the transaction \(header\) level in Quote Experience, including variable names, descriptions, who can modify each field, and default values.

## Field naming conventions

Quote Experience uses a consistent prefix convention for field variable names.

-   System-generated header-level fields use the prefix `txn.` followed by the field name — for example, `txn.id`.
-   Custom header-level fields created by administrators use the prefix `txn.custom.` followed by the field name — for example, `txn.custom.quoteName`.

For line-level field naming conventions, see [Transaction line-level system fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/quote-tm-line-level-system-fields.md).

## Modifiable by

The **Modifiable by** column in the field tables uses the following values.

-   **System**

    The field value is set only by the application. Users cannot edit system-modifiable fields on the quote layout, and administrators cannot set field values using determination rules.

-   **User**

    Any user with the appropriate permissions can update the field value. Determination rule actions can also modify user-modifiable fields.
