# Customer order states

Use the State fields on the customer order management forms to determine the current processing state for the customer order and to perform certain types of customer order actions, such as canceling a customer order.

## Customer Order form states

Use the **State** field on the customer order form to determine the current processing state for the order, including all of its associated line items. You can also use it to perform certain types of order actions, such as canceling an order. To learn more, see [Managing post-fulfillment order changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/managing-orders.md). The following flowchart illustrates how customer and service order state processing works.
