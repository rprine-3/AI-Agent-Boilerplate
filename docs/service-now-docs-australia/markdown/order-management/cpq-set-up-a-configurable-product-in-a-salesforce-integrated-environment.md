# Set up a configurable product in a Salesforce-integrated environment

Configure a Salesforce product to use external configuration with ServiceNow blueprints when using current Salesforce Managed Package installations.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

If your CPQ SF Managed Package was installed in June 2022 or later, follow these steps to associate a configurable product with a blueprint.

**Note:** If your CPQ SF Managed Package was installed before June 2022, see [Set up a configurable product in legacy Salesforce environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/cpq-set-up-a-configurable-product-in-a-salesforce-integrated-environment-older-managed-package.md).

## Procedure

1.  On the Salesforce Products tab, locate the Product2 record to connect to a CPQ configuration experience \(blueprint\).

2.  Associate the Product with a Price Book entry.

    The amount can be $0.00, but a value must be entered.

3.  Set the product to **Active** and **Enabled**, then select **Save**.

4.  On the SFDC Products tab, select the list view to CPQ View.

5.  Locate the Product Name of the Product2 record created in step 3, then select the **Click Here** link under View CPQ Setup column.

6.  Select **Associate Blueprint**.

7.  Select the desired blueprint, then select **Save**.
