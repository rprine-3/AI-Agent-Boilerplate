# Add a schedule call activity to a telesales workflow sequence

Add a schedule call activity in your sequences to support telesales workflows.

## Before you begin

Review feature support information in [Compatibility information for Customer Engagement Sequences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/compatibility-matrix-upgrade-info.md).

To support the ability for your agents to initiate outbound calls from the sequence task, your instance must be integrated with platforms such as Amazon Connect. The Omnichannel Callback application \(sn\_omni\_callback\) must also be installed. For more information, see [Install Omnichannel Callback](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/install-omnichannel-callback.md).

Delegated developer roles must be assigned to designated users. For more information, see [Grant delegated developer permissions for managing sequences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/grant-delegated-developer-permissions.md).

Role required: sn\_crm\_sequence.admin, sn\_crm\_sequence.writer
