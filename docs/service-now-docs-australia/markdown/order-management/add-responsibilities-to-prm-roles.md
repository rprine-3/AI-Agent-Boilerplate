# Add responsibilities to PRM roles

A responsibility describes a role or function that supports a user. Use responsibility definitions to create relationships between any two partner entities.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_prm.enterprise\_rel\_manager, sn\_prm.external\_partner\_associate, or sn\_prm.external\_partner\_manager

## About this task

Related party configurations define the title of a relationship between an entity and an organization or a user. These configurations also enable linking related party types with responsibility definitions to grant access as needed.

|Type|Default Responsibility|
|----|----------------------|
|Enterprise Partner Relationship Manager \[sn\_prm.enterprise\_partner\_rel\_manager\]|Location Relationship Manager \[sn\_bus\_loc.location\_relationship\_manager\]|
|External Partner Associate \[sn\_prm.external\_partner\_associate\]|Location Contributor \[sn\_customerservice.service\_organization\_contributor\]|
|External Partner Manager \[sn\_prm.external\_partner\_manager\]|Location Manager Contributor \[sn\_customerservice.svc\_location\_manager\_contributor\]|

**Note:** The default responsibilities are automatically installed with the Business Location plugin \(com.snc.business\_location\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Partner Relationship Management** &gt; **Channel Partner**.
