Run the scheduled job called **Scheduled job to populate product\_offering\_categories glide list for product offerings** only if you've upgraded from a release before the Australia release.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled jobs**.

2.  In the **Search** field, enter **Scheduled job to populate product\_offering\_categories glide list for product offerings**.

3.  Select **Execute Now** to run the scheduled job.


## What to do next

Run the scheduled job to index the tables, publish the stop word dictionary, and publish search profiles.
