# Diagnose and resolve an order task

As a customer service agent, review, diagnose, and resolve, and close an order task for the service-related issue experienced by the customer.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

To enable the display of the **Diagnose** tab and **Run diagnostics** in the conceptual panel, **Test and turn up** must be selected in the request type.

The decision table enables the Test and turn up to configure the trigger for any request definition. This default feature is shipped only for Test and turn up task.

## About this task

The order task progresses through several stages from start to closure. It begins with a customer service agent reviewing and verifying the problem. Next is the diagnosis, where system-specified tests are executed to identify the root cause. After the tests, the agent moves to the repair, creating a task to fix the identified issue. The agent follows the instructions in the repair task to address the problem areas. Once the repair is complete, the task is retested to confirm that the issue is resolved. Finally, the order is moved to the next step toward delivery based on the customer's feedback.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon.

3.  Navigate to **Order Tasks** &gt; **All**.

    The decision table can be configured to control the visibility of the Diagnose and Run Diagnostics contextual panel tabs. For more information about decision tables, see [Decision Tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/decision-table.md).

    10. In the diagnose tab, expand the **Test results** and review the results of the tests conducted in the previous step, checking whether each test is passed or failed.

        The failed tests indicate that the issues causing the order task to be identified and need repair.
