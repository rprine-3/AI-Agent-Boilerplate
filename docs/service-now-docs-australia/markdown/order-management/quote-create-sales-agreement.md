# Enable a sales agreement in a quote

Agents can enable a sales agreement for a quote. Once enabled in Quote Management, sales agreements are generated that show the product and service lines and other relevant details for the quote.

## Before you begin

Role required: pricelist\_manager and sales\_manager

## About this task

A sales agreement is a document that outlines the terms and conditions of a sale between a seller and a buyer.

The agreement specifies the details of the transaction including the goods or services being sold, the price, the quantities, delivery terms, and any other relevant conditions, for a specific period.

Sales agreements filter the product catalog according to the agreement.

## Procedure

1.  In the CRM Workspace, select the **List** \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: view.

2.  Navigate to **Quote** &gt; **All-Quotes** and select **New**.

3.  Add quote details to the quote and select **Enable sales agreement quote**.

    When the **Enable sales agreement quote** is selected, the quote is set on a sales agreement workflow. See [Using Sales Agreement Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/sales-agreement-mgmt-using.md) for more information.

4.  Fill in the **Sales agreement start date** and **Sales agreement end date**.

5.  Select **Save**.

6.  Use the **Catalog** tab to add quote line items to the quote.

    See [Add products to a quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/quote-management-catalog-tab.md) for more information.

7.  Make other updates to the quote.

8.  Once the quote is ready, select **Submit for approval**.

9.  When the quote is at an **Approved** state, change the quote to **Completed** by either updating the **State** field or selecting the context menu \[Omitted image "icon-three-dots.png"\] Alt text: and choosing **Mark as complete**.

    The quote is saved to a **Completed** state and the **Create sales agreement** button appears in the quote details form.

10. Select **Create sales agreement**.

    A sales agreement is created. The message displays the sales agreement number.

11. Select the sales agreement message to open the sales agreement.
