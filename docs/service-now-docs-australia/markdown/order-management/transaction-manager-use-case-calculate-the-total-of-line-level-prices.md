# ServiceNow Quote Experience use case: Calculate the total of line-level prices

ServiceNow Quote Experience can include a determination rule that calculates the sum of line-level net prices so that it can be stored in a header-level field.

In CPQ ServiceNow Quote Experience, you can use a determination rule to calculate the sum of line-level total net prices and store the result in a header-level field. This is particularly useful when multiple fields need to be aggregated from line items to the transaction header.

## Example Rule Configuration

-   Rule Action Type: Determination Rule
-   Trigger Point: After line-level updates \(that is, when line items are added, removed, or updated\)
-   Scope: Transaction Header

## Steps to create and use the rule

1.  Ensure that there is a header-level field.

    Alternatively, you can create a custom field \(for example, txn.custom.totalList\) in the Associated Field section where the sum is to be stored.

2.  Create a header level rule with the appropriate condition for which the rule will be executed.
3.  Set the action type to determination.
4.  In **Use this value**, set **Advanced** to true, and write an advanced script to calculate the fields.

    For example, calculate the sum aggregate of the list price of every line item. To calculate the total list price, we use the `sumField` function to calculate all the line-level list prices into a single field.

5.  Save and activate the rule so it applies in real time during the transaction life cycle.
6.  To test the rule, create a transaction and add line items with varying net prices.

    Verify that the sum of the line-level net prices is correctly calculated and displayed in the header-level field.


## More examples

Here are two more examples of line-level calculations stored in a header-level field.

-   Overall Discount Amount

    Advanced Script:

    `return txn.line.functions.sumField(txn.line.custom.listUnitPrice) - txn.line.functions.sumField(txn.line.pricing.extendedNet);`

-   Total Net

    Advanced Script:

    `return txn.line.functions.sumField(txn.line.pricing.extendedNet);`
