# Tracking order tasks and associated projects

With the SPM integration, project managers and fulfillment agents or managers can track projects in Strategic Portfolio Management that have associated order tasks in Order Management.

## Tracking projects for planned order tasks in SPM

As a project manager, you can review and update projects that have been created for tracking planned order tasks using the Project Portfolio Management application in SPM. When fulfillment managers and agents update or complete order tasks, Order Management automatically synchronizes project states between SPM and order line items, task and domain order states, and project task and order task states as fulfillment managers and agents complete order tasks.

A project manager has the it\_project\_manager role for tracking and updating projects.

As a fulfillment agent or manager, you can view the relationship between a project and order line item, project tasks, and order task in the Configurable Workspace.
