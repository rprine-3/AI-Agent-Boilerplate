# Matrix Loader CSV fields and field options upload and export

Use the Matrix Loader to bulk create, edit, and export fields, field options, and product pickers in CPQ. Define data in CSV files with supported columns and formats, then upload or download them for faster configuration management and environment migration.

## CSV fields upload

All field types can be added and edited via the Matrix Loader. This section assumes the reader will work in a spreadsheet file \(Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or similar\), then export the result to a CSV file for upload to the Matrix Loader. This topic outlines the columns and data that the Matrix Loader accepts in the field upload.

</table>**Note:** When a field has defined values, the default value must conform to one of the defined values. For example:

-   Valid Boolean field default values are TRUE and FALSE.
-   If a number field has minValue or maxValue defined, the specified default value must conform to the definition.
-   The default value of a single pickListField must match an option value defined for the field. This option value can be defined in a field option CSV file that is processed by the Matrix Loader in the same batch as the field CSV file.
-   Text field values are limited to 2000 characters.

The order of columns is not fixed. For convenience, admins can rearrange the columns in their spreadsheet and the resulting CSV file.

The fields upload explainer file shows the variety of fields and field parameters accepted by the Matrix Loader. Cells with gray backgrounds denote that the cell is not relevant to the context of the row. To download the explainer file, in the Matrix Loader, click the Fields link in the Sample Files section.

**Note:** This fileʼs content is not intended to be uploaded to a environment as is. Instead, use the format examples to build an upload file that meets the requirements of your current project, export it to CSV format, and upload it to your environment by using the Matrix Loader.

Just as fields added via the Admin UI must be associated with one or more blueprints, so must fields that are added in bulk via the Matrix Loader. For instructions, see [Associate a field with a blueprint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/cpq-associate-field-with-a-blueprint.md).

## CSV fields export

For convenience, admins can export a CSV file of fields and field options defined in the environment via the following steps:

1.  In the Admin navigation pane, click **Fields**.

    You see a list of all defined fields.

2.  \(Optional\) Enter a search string and press &lt;enter&gt; to narrow the list of fields.
3.  Click **Export**. A message temporarily appears at the bottom of the page.
4.  Click the notification center in the lower left corner.

5.  Click **Download** to download the CSV file.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-matrix-loader-csv-export-ready.png"\] Alt text: Notifications screen


The resulting ZIP file contains the fields CSV file and the field options CSV file.

## CSV field options upload

The field options upload defines pickListField options and attribution. This section assumes the reader will work in a spreadsheet file \(Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or similar\), then download/export the result to a CSV file for upload to the Matrix Loader. The following outlines the columns and data the Matrix Loader accepts in the field option upload.

</table>The fields upload explainer file shows the variety of field options and field option parameters accepted by the Matrix Loader. Cells with gray backgrounds denote that the cell is not relevant to the context of the row. To download the explainer file, in the Matrix Loader, click the Fields link in the Sample Files section.

**Note:** This fileʼs content is not intended to be uploaded to a environment as is. Instead, use the format examples to build an upload file that meets the requirements of your current project, export it to CSV format, and upload it to your environment by using the Matrix Loader.

## Field options CSV export

Field options are exported in the same motion used to export fields from CPQ. For instructions, see the "CSV fields Export" section above.

## CSV upload: product picker

This section outlines the steps to create a product picker named "My product picker", which will include the following products/options:

-   Option1/Product1 - Product One
-   Option2/Product2 - Product Two
-   Option3/Product3 - Product Three

To create a product picker, follow these steps.

1.  Extract a sample CSV file for fields from the Matrix Loader.

    This CSV file should contain the field information required for creating a product picker. Ensure that you add an extra line at the top of the sample file specifying the field type as product picker \(this field type may not be present in the sample file\).

    \[Omitted image "cpq-matrix-loader-csv-upload-fields-sample.png"\] Alt text: CSV file

2.  Extract a sample CSV file for field options from the Matrix Loader.

    This CSV file should contain the product names that will be displayed in the end-user UI for the fields created in the previous step.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-matrix-loader-csv-export-field-options-sample.png"\] Alt text: CSV file

3.  Create a new .yaml file.

    This file should include the fields contained in the product picker, as defined in the CSV file in Step 1. The .yaml file will be used to link the two CSV files during the upload process in the Matrix Loader. Without it, the product picker will not be created.

    Example .yaml Syntax:

    ```
    ---
    - variableName: myProductPicker
    	fields:
    	- variableName: myProductPicker.value
    		target: ProductId
    	- variableName: myProductPicker.select
    	- variableName: myProductPicker.quantity
    		target: ProductQuantity
    ```

4.  Upload files to the Matrix Loader: Compress the two .csv files and the .yaml file from the previous steps into a zipped folder. Then, go to the Matrix Loader, upload the zipped folder, click **Import**, and then click **Continue**.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-matrix-loader-import-files-dialog.png"\] Alt text: Matrix Loader

5.  Validate in UI: The newly created product picker should be available in the CPQ Admin fields as shown below.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-matrix-loader-product-picker-setup.png"\] Alt text: Product Picker


## CSV export: product picker

To export a product picker, click fields in CPQ Admin. Click **Product Pickers**, select the product picker to export, and then click **Export**.
