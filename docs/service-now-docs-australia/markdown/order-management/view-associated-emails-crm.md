# Track emails linked from Microsoft Outlook

View emails that have been linked to CRM records using the Microsoft Outlook directly from the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace.

## Before you begin

Email promotion must be configured before you can view the associated emails on the Emails tab of the Lead, Opportunity, Accounts, or Contacts record. For more information, see [Configure email promotion rules for Activity Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/promote-crm-outlook-emails.md).

The User Mailbox Integration plugin \(com.glide.email.user\_mailbox.integration\) must be installed on your ServiceNow instance to enable agents to send emails from the touchpoint record. For setup instructions, see [Personal corporate mailbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/personal-corporate-mailbox.md).
