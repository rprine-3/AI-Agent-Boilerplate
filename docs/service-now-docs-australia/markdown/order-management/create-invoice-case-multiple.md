# Dispute multiple invoices against your account using the Business Portal

Challenge discrepancies in billing or shipping locations that affect multiple invoices via the Business Portal using the playbook experience.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice.customer

## About this task

This task describes how to create an invoice case using the playbook experience in the Business Portal. The playbook experience enables you to dispute various invoice discrepancies depending on the scope you select. For multiple invoices, you can report billing location and shipping location issues.

Creating invoice cases using the ServiceNow Otto panel limits disputes to quantity issues only. For more information, see [Dispute invoice issues using ServiceNow Otto Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/dispute-invoice-issues-now-assist.md).

        If you no longer want to change an invoice case line item, select it, select the drop-down button next to **Edit** and select **Delete** to remove it from the list of items to be modified.

    4.  Modify the billing or shipping location, or both, on the Edit item dialog box.
