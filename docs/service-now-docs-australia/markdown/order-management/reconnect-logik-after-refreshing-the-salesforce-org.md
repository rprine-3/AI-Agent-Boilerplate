# Reconnect CPQ after refreshing the Salesforce org

Reconnect the CPQ environment to a new or refreshed SFDC org.

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

## Procedure

1.  Submit a support case through the support site.

    Open a ticket by using the [ServiceNow Support portal](https://support.servicenow.com). For step-by-step instructions, see [Create a case on Now Support for CPQ Customers](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=d67d3e71475d7a90f64de825126d4326&id=kb_article_view).

    Provide the new org ID, the My Domain URL, and the custom URL of the CPQ environment. The custom URL will have the form `https://<tenant>.<sector>.cpq`.

2.  If a CPQ user exists on the org, send a password reset request for the user.

3.  If no CPQ user exists on the org, create a user.


## Result

You will be notified when the migration of the CPQ environment to the new org is complete.

If CPQ has confirmed the migration is complete but you are unable to give a user access to the org, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the CPQ Tenant: Setup &gt; Custom Settings &gt; Click Manage next to the CPQ Tenant.
2.  Edit or confirm that the Administration URL is set to the custom URL of your CPQ environment: `https://<tenant>.<sector>.cpq`.
3.  Navigate to Installed Packages &gt; Find Salesforce CPQ &gt; Configure &gt; Additional Settings, and update the Salesforce CPQ External Configurator URL to your CPQ URL followed by `/ui/configure: https://<tenant>.<sector>.cpq/ui/configure`.
