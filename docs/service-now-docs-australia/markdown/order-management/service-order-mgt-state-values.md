# Service order states

Use the State fields on the Order Management forms to determine the current processing state for the service order and to perform certain types of order actions, such as canceling an external service order.

The following flowchart illustrates how customer and service order state processing works.

\[Omitted image "add-order-states.svg"\] Alt text: Infographic showing the customer order and service order processing workflow. For the text description, refer to the Service Order form states section.

## Service Order form states

Use the **State** field on the Service Order form to determine the current processing state for the service order, including all of its associated line items. You can also use it to perform certain types of order actions, such as canceling a service order.

To learn more, see [Service Order Open API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/service-order-open-api.md).
