# Enable the CPQ Configurator

Use the **sn\_prd\_pm.enable\_advanced\_configuration** system property to turn on the CPQ Configurator, an interface for adding customizable products to Sales Customer Relationship Management transactions.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

If you have been using the configurator for Sales Customer Relationship Management, but you want to use the CPQ Configurator instead, set the **sn\_prd\_pm.enable\_advanced\_configuration** property to true. The CPQ Configurator is installed with the CPQ Integration application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**, and in the filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Open the **sn\_prd\_pm.enable\_advanced\_configuration** system property.

3.  In the **Value** field, enter `true` to turn on the Configurator.

4.  Select **Update**.

    The Configurator is displayed when:

    -   Agents are adding configurable products to opportunities, quotes, orders, sold products, and contracts.
    -   Customers are using the Business Portal for self-service features requiring configurable product selections.
    -   Product catalog admins are generating or updating blueprints for configurable products.
