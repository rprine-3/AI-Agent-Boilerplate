# Choosing a project template task when duplicates exist

As an admin, when you're configuring the decision rules for domain orders and order tasks, you may find that there are multiple project template tasks with the same Short description. It may be difficult to determine the correct project template task to select.

For example, the following decision table for Project Oversight for Domain Order shows two options with the same name for the project template task: Product Order for SD-WAN Security. This project template task has the same **Short description** for two different project template tasks, one for SD-WAN Package and the other for SD-WAN Customer Product Bundle.

You can determine the appropriate project template task by finding and verifying the sys\_id of the project template task to be used. For more information, see [Verify the sys\_id of a project task template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/find-sysid-proj-template-task.md).
