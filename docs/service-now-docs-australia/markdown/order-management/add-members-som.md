# Add members to a territory

Add territory members with their appropriate responsibility to get access to the CRM entities belonging to the territory.

## Before you begin

Role required: sales territory admin, sales territory manager

## About this task

-   A territory comprises a team, where different members play different roles.​
-   A member can belong to one or more territories, where they can play different/same roles.​
-   A member can have different roles in the same territory.​ Their membership and role grant them access and permission to the CRM entities. The access is driven by the responsibility framework, for additional information see [Create a responsibility definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/t_CreateAResponsibilityDefinition.md).
-   Only active members during their membership period get access to the CRM entities.
