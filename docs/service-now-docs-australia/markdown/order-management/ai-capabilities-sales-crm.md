# AI capabilities in Sales CRM

Sales CRM includes generative and agentic AI capabilities that helps you automate sales workflows and enables sales teams to work more efficiently within your CRM environment.

## AI plugins for Sales CRM

ServiceNow AI Platform and the following ServiceNow Otto plugins together provide AI capabilities for Sales CRM workflows:

-   ServiceNow Otto for Sales Automation \(sn\_som\_gen\_ai\)
-   ServiceNow Otto for Configure, Price, Quote \(CPQ\) \(sn\_som\_gen\_ai\_cpq\)
-   ServiceNow Otto for Order Management \(sn\_som\_gen\_ai\_om\)

These plugins are included in the existing Sales CRM products, bringing AI-powered automation through three licensing tiers each reflecting a different level of automation maturity:

-   Foundation: Default AI assistance for simple sales processes.
-   Advanced: Agentic workflows and multi-step automation.
-   Prime: Custom AI agent development.

Each ServiceNow Otto plugin packages the individual AI plugins and required dependencies.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## AI limitations

This application uses artificial intelligence \(AI\) and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study that generate predictions based on patterns in data. As a result, this application may not always produce accurate, complete, or appropriate information. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this application has been fully trained or tested for your use case. To mitigate these issues, it is your responsibility to test and evaluate your use of this application for accuracy, harm, and appropriateness for your use case, employ human oversight of output, and refrain from relying solely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making purposes. This is especially important if you choose to deploy this application in areas with consequential impacts such as healthcare, finance, legal, employment, security, or infrastructure. You agree to abide by [ServiceNow’s AI Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.servicenow.com/ai-acceptable-use-policy.html), which may be updated by ServiceNow.

## Data processing

This application requires data to be transferred from ServiceNow customers' individual instances to a centralized ServiceNow environment, which may be located in a different data center region from the one where your instance is, and potentially to a third-party cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure. This data is handled per ServiceNow's internal policies and procedures, including our policies available through our [CORE Compliance Portal](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0564067).

## Data collection

ServiceNow collects and uses the inputs, outputs, and edits to outputs of this application to develop and improve ServiceNow technologies including ServiceNow models and AI products.
