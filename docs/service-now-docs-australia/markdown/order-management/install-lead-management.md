# Install Lead Management

If you have the admin role, you can install the Lead Management application. The application includes the demo data and installations that are related to ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).

Depending on your entitlements, you may have to install demo data after installation. Demo data comprises the sample records that describe application features for the common use cases.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The following items are installed with Lead Management:

-   Plugins
-   Store applications
-   Roles
-   Tables

For more information on viewing components that are installed with an application, see [Find components installed with an application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/find-components.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the Lead Management application \(sn\_quote\_mgmt\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the application by its name or ID. If you can't find the application, request it from the ServiceNow Store.

    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    Dependent plugins and applications appear if they’re installed, or are currently installed, or must be installed. If any plugins or applications require installation, you must install them before you can install Lead Management.

4.  If you want to install demo data, do one of the following depending on your entitlements.
