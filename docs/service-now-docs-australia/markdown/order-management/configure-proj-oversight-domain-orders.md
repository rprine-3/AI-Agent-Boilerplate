# Configure project oversight for domain orders

Specify the conditions and decision rules that qualify domain orders for project oversight. You also specify the project template task used by Order Management to create the project for domain orders.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use the Project Management Oversight for Domain Order Decision Builder to add or change the conditions and decision rules that a domain order must meet to be tracked as a project. For example, if you want projects to be created for domain orders for a particular product, you can add a condition column for **Specification**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Decision Management** &gt; **Decision Builder**.

2.  Select the **Project Management Oversight for Domain Order** decision table.

    The Domain Order item is displayed in the **Inputs** and the **Project Template Task** column in the **Results**.

3.  Add a condition that a domain order must match.

    1.  Select **Add Condition column**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_uky_vvw_zxb"><thead><tr><th>

For condition columns with the input type of Reference, specifies whether the condition column evaluates the reference record or a field on the reference table.To evaluate a particular field, select **Field** and choose a field from the Domain Order table, such as **Specification** \(Domain Order.specification\) to specify a product.

</table>    3.  Select **Save**.

    4.  Repeat steps 3a through 3c for each condition to be added.

4.  Enter a decision rule by selecting **Add new decision row**.

    1.  Select the **Add** action and enter the conditions and project template task to be used.

        **Note:** If there are duplicate project template tasks that have the same **Short description**, it may be difficult to identify and select the appropriate project template tasks. For details on differentiating between similar project template tasks, see [Choosing a project template task when duplicates exist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/Determining-correct-project-task-template.md).

    2.  Select **Save**.

    3.  Repeat steps 4a through 4c for each decision rule to be added.


## Result

The system uses the specified project template task to create projects for domain orders that match the conditions and decision rules defined in the Project Oversight for Domain Order decision table.
