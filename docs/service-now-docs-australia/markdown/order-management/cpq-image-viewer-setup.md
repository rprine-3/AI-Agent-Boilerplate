## General guidelines

Ensure that the image sizes are the same for all images in a viewer. If they do not match, the thumbnails and featured image will not align properly.

Add images in the order you want them to display. Images will display from the Image Viewer settings from top to bottom. The name of the field does not affect the display order.

Use images with a high enough resolution to properly fill the window. Low resolution images will be expanded in size to fit the window and will not look good when select as the featured image.

For optimal performance, avoid large or high resolution images since that will impact the render time for the image viewer.

## Image Viewer display

On a layout with a field that includes an image view, a user can hover over an image to see the expand icon.

\[Omitted image "cpq-image-viewer-display-1.png"\] Alt text: Products screen

Once clicked, the image view will open in a dialog box.

\[Omitted image "cpq-image-viewer-display-2.png"\] Alt text: Image viewer display

A user can move between images with the arrow buttons or by clicking the thumbnails below the feature image. This carousel displays any label and alt text if provided. A user can close the dialog box by clicking outside it or by clicking **X** in the top right.
