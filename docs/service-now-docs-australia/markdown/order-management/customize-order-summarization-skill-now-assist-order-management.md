# Customize an order summarization skill in ServiceNow Otto for Order Management

Configure the ServiceNow Otto for Order Management application so that your order agent and fulfillment agent can use the generative AI skills in the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace and Business Portal.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Microsoft Azure, Amazon bedrock, Now LLM, Now LLM LTS, and Google Cloud vertex AI are currently the providers for this ServiceNow Otto application's skills.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **AI Skills**.

2.  In the **Customer** workflow group, view the skills for the ServiceNow Otto for Order Management under Sales CRM.

3.  Copy the order summarization skill for customization.

    1.  Make a copy of an active skill by selecting either **Order Summarization \(Order Capture\)** or **Order Summarization \(Order Fulfillment\)**.

        **Note:** Only one version of a skill can be active at a time for each skill. If you create and activate a copy of the skill, any previously activated version of the skill is deactivated.

    2.  Select the More actions icon \[Omitted image "more-options.png"\] Alt text: for the skill, and create a copy that you can customize by selecting **Make a copy**.

        The copy that you make is listed in the All section.

    3.  On the copied skill, select **Activate skill** to open and modify it.

        A guided setup leads you through configuring General details, View order input, Customize prompt output, Define Availability, Define access, select display, and Review and activate of the skill to be customized.

4.  In the General details step, fill in the fields.

    1.  Enter a name and description for the skill.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

    **Note:** The **More details on the skills** fields are read-only.

5.  Configure the base input table fields and related lists for the different input templates \(Product Order Capture or Service Order Capture\) for the skill.

    **Note:** The **Choose base table** field is ready-only.

    Each skill relies on a base input table and input fields with descriptions to provide context for all the Now LLM Service to generate a response.

    Select only those related tables that are offered as the base system as part of the input data.

    1.  Select **+New base input field** and configure the base input table fields for each input template \(Product Order Capture or Service Order Capture\).

        Add multiple base input fields, as necessary.

        The following table lists the base input table fields and descriptions.

<table id="table_c53_vp5_dbc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Base input field

</td><td>

Field in the base input table whose value this skill uses in its response.

 For example, `Number`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field description

</td><td>

Description of the base input field value.

 For example, `Order number`.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    2.  For each input template, configure the rule conditions by using the condition builder to filter the data.

        The rule conditions determine when the input template is used. By default, the record state determines the input template that all Now LLM Service use.

        You can build the condition out further by selecting **New condition set** and configuring additional parameters.

    3.  Configure the additional input data sources by selecting **New data source** for each input template, as needed.

        Adding input data source, like the related tables, provides more context to all Now LLM Service in a related list.

        You can also add the rule conditions to these additional data sources.

        The selection of the related table fields has a direct impact on the quality of the corresponding prompt header.

    4.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

6.  Customize the prompt output.

    Review and test the default prompt provided. The prompt is fixed and can’t be customized directly within this step or from the AI Admin Hub screen.

    To customize or create prompts, select **Edit prompt in AI Skill Kit**. You are redirected to the AI Skill Kit, where you can manage prompt configurations for the skill. For more information, see [AI Skill Kit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skill-kit-landing.md).

    1.  For each input template \(Product Order Capture or Service Order Capture\), select a record in the Test output section and test the prompt response output format by selecting **Run Test**.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

7.  Use the Define availability section to define how the skill is available to users.

    1.  Configure the skill to be available to users, or select the conditions that must be met before the skill is available.

        Selecting **Customize skill availability** displays a condition builder to filter the data further.

        Select **New condition set** to configure additional conditions, as needed.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

8.  Specify which users can access the skill in the Define access section.

    By selecting specific roles, you're controlling who can use the skill. The roles that you choose will also be available in the **Select display** step.

    Default and Custom roles:

    -   If no changes are made, the default role sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent automatically appears in **User access - Access Control List \(ACL\)**.
    -   Apply role restrictions when the skill is invoked by selecting **Roles** and defining which data and resources \(for example, tables\) the user can access in the **Role restrictions to skill** field.

        **Note:** If you add a role in the **Define Access** step, you must manually select it in the **Select Display** field to make it active.

9.  Configure the **In-product desktop** field to display the order summarization for Order Management.

    1.  Display Now Assist skills on the forms and workspaces by selecting the **In-product desktop** field.

        For the skills that appear in-product, select the arrow to identify the roles that can use the skill.

    2.  Select **Save and continue** to go to the next step.

10. Review and activate the skill.

    Review your choices and select **Activate** to complete the skill customization.

    Select **Summarize** in an order to generate the order summary.
