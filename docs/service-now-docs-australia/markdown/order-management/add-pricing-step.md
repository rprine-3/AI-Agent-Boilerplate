# Add or change a pricing plan step

Add a pricing plan step to a configurable pricing plan that applies either a pricing matrix or a custom adjustment using the pricing extension point. You can also change certain items in an existing step, such as the sequence or type of matrix used, as well as specify conditions for running the step.

## Before you begin

[Create a configurable pricing plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/create-custom-pricing-plan.md).

Role required: sn\_csm\_pricing.pricelist\_administrator or sn\_csm\_pricing.pricelist\_manager

## About this task

You can add or change a pricing plan step only when the configurable pricing plan is in the Draft state.

**Note:** The following steps in all pricing plans are fixed and can't be changed:

-   Initialize Pricing Context
-   Fetch Base Cost
-   Fetch Base List Price
-   Apply Attribute Adjustments

## Procedure

1.  In the CRM Workspace, select the **List** \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: view.

2.  Navigate to **Pricing** &gt; **Pricing Plans**.

3.  Select the configurable pricing plan to which steps are being added or changed.

4.  In the pricing plan, select the Pricing Plan Steps tab.

    -   To add a step, select **New**.
    -   To change a step, select the step number to be updated. If you need to delete a pricing adjustment step, see [Delete a pricing plan step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/delete-pricing-plan-step.md).
5.  Fill in or change certain fields in the form.
