## Salesforce setup

Refer to these Salesforce Trailheads modules and documentation:

-   Postman: [Quick Start: Connect Postman to Salesforce](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-connect-postman-to-salesforce)
-   Submit for Approval: [Salesforce Developers: Submit a Record for Approval](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_process_approvals_submit.htm)

An approval process in Salesforce automates record approval workflows in an organization. It defines:

-   Approval Steps: The sequence of steps and approvers for a record, for example, sending a time-off request to an employee’s manager for approval.
-   Actions: Automated actions based on the approval outcome, such as updating records if approved or sending notifications if rejected.

This streamlines the approval process and ensures consistency.

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-1.png"\] Alt text: Workflow

1.  Go to Setup, click **Approval Processes**, and select the transaction record.
2.  In **Manage Approval Processes For**, select **Opportunity**.
3.  Click **Create New Approval Process**.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-2.png"\] Alt text: Create New Approval Process

4.  Ensure that the **Add the Submit for Approval and Approval History** option is checked.

    You can specify conditions, if applicable, in the Entry-Specific Criteria section.

5.  Choose **Automatically assign approvers** and set it to anyone with the SysAdmin role.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-rt-flow-3.png"\] Alt text: Automatically assign approvers

6.  Create a custom picklist field in the transaction record by navigating to Setup, clicking **Object Manager**, and then clicking **Transaction**. Ensure that the field is not set as a multi-select picklist.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-4.png"\] Alt text: Transaction

7.  Give the picklist field three values to distinguish between Pending Approval, Approved, and Rejected.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-5.png"\] Alt text: New custom field

8.  Add the custom field to the Transaction Layout.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-6.png"\] Alt text: Layout

    If you skipped the previous step, you can add the field to the Transaction Layout like so:

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-7.png"\] Alt text: Layout

9.  Go back to the approval process, click **Initial Submission Actions**, click **Add New**, and then select **Field Update**. Configure it with the required values.
10. To ensure that the relevant fields are updated based on the outcome of the approval process, repeat step 9 for the Approval Actions and Rejection Actions sections. The following screenshot shows the final rejection option.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integration-get-retrieve-opp-8.png"\] Alt text: Transaction

    If you included email alerts along with field updates, the approval process should resemble the following:

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-9.png"\] Alt text: Approval process

    If the final approval process has only field updates, it should resemble the following:

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-10.png"\] Alt text: Approvalprocess

11. Click **Activate**.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-11.png"\] Alt text: Activate

12. To ensure that CORS includes the URL, in the Setup search bar, search for `CORS`, or go to Setup, click **Security**, and then click **CORS**. Verify that these are included in the CORS:

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-sf-setup-12.png"\] Alt text: Security


## ServiceNow Quote Experience setup integrations

Create two integrations for an event that will be used to submit the record for approval through ServiceNow Quote Experience.

**Note:** If you want to test these calls in Postman, the endpoint is the my Salesforce URL: `<https://logik-1e-dev-ed.develop.my.salesforce.com/>`.

1.  Receive the Salesforce record ID: Fetch the right Salesforce record ID using the UUID. This integration is used for filling in the custom field for the integration above.

    -   Connection: Salesforce
    -   GET

        Additional path: `/services/data/v62.0/query/?q=SELECT Id, CreatedDate, LGK__TransactionUUID__c FROM LGK__Transaction__c WHERE LGK__TransactionUUID__c = '{{http://txn.id/}}'ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC`

    Response Transformation:

    ```
    {
      "fields": [
        {
          "variableName": "txn.custom.sfRecordID",
          "value": {{#each records}}{{#if @first}}"{{this.Id}}"{{/if}}{{/each}}
        },
        {
          "variableName": "txn.custom.opportunityName",
          "value": {{#each records}}{{#if @first}}"{{this.LGK__OpportunityId__r.Name}}"{{/if}}{{/each}}
        },
        {
          "variableName": "txn.custom.accountName",
          "value": {{#each records}}{{#if @first}}"{{this.LGK__AccountId__r.Name}}"{{/if}}{{/each}}
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    UPDATED QUERY USE THIS:

    ```
    /services/data/v62.0/query/?q=SELECT Id, CreatedDate,LGK__OpportunityId__c,LGK__OpportunityId__r.Name, LGK__AccountId__r.Name, LGK__AccountId__c,LGK__TransactionUUID__c FROM LGK__Transaction__c WHERE LGK__TransactionUUID__c ='{{txn.id}}'ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
    ```

    **contextActorId** refers to the system Admin Record ID in Salesforce. It can be obtained by navigating to Setup and clicking **Users**, and then copying the ID from the URL of the user page.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-integrations-1.png"\] Alt text: Integrations

2.  Submit for approval.
    -   Connection: Salesforce
    -   POST

        Additional path: `/services/data/v62.0/process/approvals`

        \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-integrations-2.png"\] Alt text: Approval process


Request Transformation:

```
{
  "requests" : [{
  "actionType": "Submit",
  "contextId": "{{txn.custom.sfRecordID}}",
  "nextApproverIds": [],
  "comments":"The line item has a discount percentage of {{txn.custom.overallDealDiscount}}%",
  "contextActorId": "005bm000003SKtJ", -- SF Record ID of user highlighted above
  "processDefinitionNameOrId" : "TM_SF_Approval", --should be the unique name fro process definition detail highlighted above
  "skipEntryCriteria": "true"}]
}
```

Make sure that the transform template has these values correctly:

## ServiceNow Quote Experience setup creating events

Slack Approvals Integration is implemented through headless event API calls. In this approach, we’ll use these headless API calls in a record-triggered flow and perform the callout through Apex actions.

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-create-events-1.png"\] Alt text: Create events

Note that the two integrations created in the previous step are designed to work in sequence. The first integration receives the Salesforce record ID, and the second integration submits it for approval. Alternatively, the process of receiving the Salesforce ID can occur on the Open Transaction action by adding the necessary configuration at that stage.

Create two additional events that will move the stage either forward for approval or backward for revision. Be sure to note their respective variable names for use in the API callout configuration.

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-create-events-2.png"\] Alt text: Transition stages

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-create-events-3.png"\] Alt text: Decline

## Add the Submit for approval option to ServiceNow Quote Experience

The button events can be added to the default\_draft layout using the following JSON format:

```
{
  "type": "button",
  "event": "submitForApproval",
  "label": "Revise",
  "columnOrder": 2,
  "variableName": "revise"
},
```

Make sure to add the custom field to the `draft fields: []` section; it’s not necessary to include it in the layout.

```
{
  "type": "ReadOnlyText",
  "label": "SF Record ID",
  "variableName": "txn.custom.sfRecordID"
},
```

## Record-triggered flow

To set up the VS code environment, install the VS Code extensions from this document: [Sales Engineering Team Member Setup](https://logikio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SE/pages/1340342294)

1.  Following the [Trailheads approval process](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/business_process_automation), create a picklist record on the **LGK\_\_Transaction\_\_C** object that has the current approval state of the transaction, and ensure the process updates the record based on approval, rejection, and pending approval.

    The following image shows a custom field that triggers the record-triggered field: the **Approval\_Status\_\_C** field that you made when you created the approval process.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-rt-flow-1.png"\] Alt text: Approval process

    The following image shows what the flow will look like when it's complete.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-rt-flow-2.png"\] Alt text: Workflow

2.  In the Start block, click **Edit**.

    Trigger on the **LGK\_\_Transaction\_\_C** object based on the custom field, ensuring that a UUID is not null. Also make sure to click **Run Asynchronously** and **Only when a record is updated to meet**.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-rt-flow-3.png"\] Alt text: Configure trigger

3.  Add a decision block, and create outcomes for when the custom field you created is approved or rejected.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-rt-flow-4.png"\] Alt text: Decision block


## Apex Code

Although this Apex Class was deployed through VS code, it could also be deployed in Salesforce. The first step is the create a new Project with manifest.

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-apex-code-1.png"\] Alt text: Menu

Next, create an Apex class \(in the blue box\) as well as a manifest.xml file \(in the green box\) to go into the respective files in the project directory.

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-apex-code-2.png"\] Alt text: Package.xml option in the menu

Apex code:

```
global with sharing class TransactionManagerFlow {
    global class FlowInput {
        @InvocableVariable(label='Triggering Record' required=true)
        global LGK__Transaction__c triggeringRecord;
    }
    // Handle logic for Rejected status
    @InvocableMethod(label='Logik.io Transaction callout from Salesforce' description='Makes callout to transition Logik.io transaction stage.')
    global static void handleApprovalStatus(FlowInput[] requestInputs) {
        System.debug('Handling Rejected status for Record: ' + requestInputs[0].triggeringRecord.Id);
        LGK__ConfigurationTenant__c customSettings = LGK__ConfigurationTenant__c.getInstance();
        String updatedRuntimeToken = '_gdyi0w0oGu1bNk3PO5exhUGqDFcZQVLIw';
        System.debug(updatedRuntimeToken);
        String endpoint = 'https://se-txn-sandbox.test02.logik.io';
        for (FlowInput eachTxn : requestInputs) {
            // Make the API request to transfer a transaction from 'new' stage to 'rejected' stage
            // (compare with snippet from ApprovalProcessHandler.makeApiCall)
            String uuid = eachTxn.triggeringRecord.LGK__TransactionUUID__c;
            Http http = new Http();
            HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
            request.setHeader('Origin', endpoint);
            if (eachTxn.triggeringRecord.Approval_Status__c == 'Rejected') {    
                request.setEndpoint(endpoint + '/api/t/' + String.valueOf(uuid) + '/events/revise'); // Example endpoint
                System.debug('Endpoint set for rejection' + request.getEndpoint());
            } else if (eachTxn.triggeringRecord.Approval_Status__c == 'Approved') {
                request.setEndpoint(endpoint + '/api/t/' + String.valueOf(uuid) + '/events/proceedToApproved'); // Example endpoint
                System.debug('Endpoint set for approval' + request.getEndpoint());
            }
            request.setMethod('POST');
            request.setHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + updatedRuntimeToken);
            request.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
            request.setBody('{}');  // Convert to JSON if inputs are needed
            System.debug(request);
            if (!Test.isRunningTest()) {
                HttpResponse response = http.send(request);
                if (response.getStatusCode() != 200) {
                    System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, 'Error transitioning transaction: ' + response.getStatusCode());
                    System.debug(LoggingLevel.ERROR, response.getBody());
                } else {
                    System.debug('Rejected API Call Failed: ' + response.getStatusCode() + ' - ' + response.getBody());
                }
            } else {
                eachTxn.triggeringRecord.LGK__TransactionUUID__c = 'testUUID';
            }
        }
    }
}

```

XML:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
    <types>
        <members>TransactionManagerFlow</members>
        <name>ApexClass</name>
    </types>
    <version>61.0</version>
</Package>
```

Next, if you’re not logged into the org you want to deploy to, do so with the `sf org login web` command, which takes you to login.salesforce.com.

When you’ve authorized CLI, the result should resemble the following:

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-apex-code-3.png"\] Alt text: Script

**Note:** If you’re logged into multiple orgs through CLI, use this command to switch:

`sf config set target-org=<username>`

When you’re logged in, execute this command:

`sf project deploy start --manifest manifest/package.xml`

\[Omitted image "cpq-txn-mgr-integrate-SF-approvals-apex-code-4.png"\] Alt text: Deployments

Add the Apex actions after the decision blocks, and make sure your flow looks similar to the one provided in the screenshot. \(Look for a name that matches the label parameter in the invocable method.\)

Finally, activate the flow and test.

## Testing

After the record-triggered flow and the ServiceNow Quote Experience blueprint are created, you may find this SOQL query helpful for debugging your approvals process in Salesforce.
