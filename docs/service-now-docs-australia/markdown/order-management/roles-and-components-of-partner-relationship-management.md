# Roles and components of Partner Relationship Management

The Partner Relationship Management application uses roles to manage access, identify users, and establish relationships between enterprises and channel partners.

The PRM plugin \(com.snc.partner\_relationship\_management\) comes with a set of functional and granular roles, each with varying levels of access to raise and address queries.

The PRM application provides access and permissions to users part of both the enterprise and the channel partner ecosystem.

## Functional and granular roles

Functional roles help provide authorized related parties access to enterprise and channel partner members. A granular model helps to protect data by granting the required level of access to the relevant enterprise or channel partner entities. With this functionality, each role is associated with a set of privileges or responsibilities that determine users’ access to certain information.

You can set granular policies that authorize individuals to do their jobs efficiently and effectively, which helps to improve the customer experience.
