    To learn more about the fields on this form, see [Deal registration table fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/deal-registration-table-fields.md).

5.  On the **Deal registration type** screen, select the preferred deal registration type.

    The deal registration types are listed based on the channel partner and partner programs selected in the Partner Program deal type relationship \(sn\_prm\_dr\_pp\_deal\_type\) table.

6.  On the **Customer information** screen, select an existing account or create an account or consumer.

    To create an account, select **Can't find account details?** and fill in the fields. To learn more about the fields, see [Deal registration table fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/deal-registration-table-fields.md).

7.  On the **Product offerings** screen, select the list of product offerings that the customer is interested in.

    This is an optional step and can be skipped.

8.  On the **Additional information** screen, provide a description of the deal registration.

    You can also add attachments to support additional information.

9.  Select **Review** to review all the details and select **Submit**.

    As an agent you can update the status of the field on the **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**. To learn more, see [Update deal registration record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/update-deal-registration-record.md).


## Result

A deal registration is created with an associated account, a channel partner, and a partner program. The state of the deal registration is **Submitted**. Multiple deal lines with an associated product offering are also created. You can also view the list of all deal registrations, along with the deals in **Draft** and **Approved** states on the Partner portal home page.

**Note:** Select **Actions** from the details page to edit or delete the deal registration. You can only delete deal registrations that are in the **Draft** state.
