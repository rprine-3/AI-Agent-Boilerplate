# Create an event

Create a custom event in ServiceNow Quote Experience to trigger rule groupings, integrations, and stage transitions based on business-specific requirements in CPQ.

## Before you begin

Any rule groupings or integrations to assign to the event must exist before creating the event.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CPQ Administration** &gt; **Transaction** &gt; **Events**.

2.  Select **+ New Event**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the new field.

    The variable name is set in camel case from the name you enter. For example, entering `Total of Manufacturing Lines` produces the variable name **totalOfManufacturingLines**. To use a custom variable name, select the pencil icon to the right of the **Variable Name** field.

4.  Select the event level and then select **Save**.

    -   Select **Transaction** for a header-level event that appears as a button at the top of the quote.
    -   Select **Transaction Line** for a line-level event that appears on individual lines in the quote lines grid.
    The event editor opens. By default, new events have their event access set to **No Access**.

5.  Select **Edit Event Access**, change the access level to **Active**, and select **Done**.

6.  In the **Actions** area, select **+ Add New Action** and choose either a rule grouping or an integration to assign to the event.

    Multiple rule groupings and integrations can be assigned to the same event.

    When pricing is enabled, you can attach the **Reprice** action to an event so that the event recalculates pricing when it runs. Default triggers such as **upsertLines** ship with the **Reprice** action already attached; you can disable these triggers per event if you don't want automatic repricing. For more information, see [Transaction events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/quote-tm-events.md).

7.  To configure the event to transition the quote to another stage, enable the **Transition** toggle and set the transition direction \(forward or backward in the stage sequence\).

8.  Select **Save**.

    The new event appears in the events list at the transaction or transaction line level, depending on the level chosen.


## What to do next

Add the event to the quote layout to make it available as a button to users. For more information, see [Create a quote transaction layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/quote-tm-create-layout.md).
