# Build a needs decision tree

Define the decision tree question nodes, decision paths, and guidance for each decision path using Decision Tree Builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_prd\_pm.product\_catalog\_manager, sn\_prd\_pm.product\_catalog\_admin

## About this task

As you build your decision tree, for example after adding a decision node or a path, you save and close the decision tree record. To continue working on the tree, navigate to the Decision Trees list, select the decision tree record, and open it in Decision Tree Builder, as described in steps 1 through 3 of this procedure.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Product Catalog Management** &gt; **Needs** &gt; **Decision Trees**.

2.  Select the decision tree from the list.

3.  Select **Open in Builder**.

4.  In Decision Tree Builder, define the start node:

    1.  Select **New node**

    2.  In the **Node name** field, enter a name for the start node.

    3.  In the **Reference table** field, select the Product Offering Recommendation table.

    4.  Enter the question for the agent to answer.

        You can make the question mandatory by selecting the **Required question** field and enter more details in the **Additional details** field.

    5.  Select the type of answer for your question.

        For a description of the answer types, see [Answer types for questions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/type-of-answer.md).

    6.  Add more questions.
