# Configuring product pricing

Use the Pricing Management application to create the price lists and price list lines, define pricing adjustments, and manage other features that control pricing for product offerings. Product pricing is used by your sales and order agents when creating opportunities, quotes, and sales orders in Sales Customer Relationship Management.

## Pricing configuration overview

As a pricing administrator or pricing manager, you complete various configuration tasks and work with your product catalog administrator and product catalog manager to set up the pricing for products and services sold by your organization. The following example workflow shows the pricing configuration tasks and how they fit within [product catalog and product offering configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/som-managing-product-catalogs.md). You can also work with your administrator to extend certain pricing features, such as setting up pricing extension points to access pricing information from external sources.

Starting with the May 2024 release of Sales Customer Relationship Management applications, you can use the CRM Workspace to configure product pricing.

**Note:** Check your entitlements to determine if you have access to these features.
