# Create a product offering family

Create a product offering family for products with similar or common features that have multiple variations. You can apply common rules or attributes for product offerings at the product offering family level instead of applying them individually to each product offering.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_prd\_pm. product\_catalog\_admin or sn\_prd\_pm.product\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

A product offering family is a hierarchical classification of product offerings, like a category tree. Product families can have parent-child relationships \(multi-level tree\). You can define parent-child relationships, where each node in the family tree can have a parent, forming a multi-level hierarchy. With a product family you can aggregate sales data by family, such as total revenue across sub-family products, as a rollup dimension for sales forecasting.

For example, a product offering family hierarchy could be Hardware &gt; Computers &gt; Laptops. After you create product offering families, you assign a product offering to a product offering family when you create a product offering.

**Note:** A product offering family can't be its own ancestor or descendant. If you select a parent family that would create a circular hierarchy, the save is blocked with an error.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:.

3.  Navigate to **Offerings** &gt; **Product Offering Families**.

4.  Select **New**.

    Fill-in the form.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Number|System-assigned number for the product offering family.|
    |Name|Product offering family name|
    |Description|Short description of the product offering family.|
    |Parent family|If the product offering family that you're creating is a child of an existing product offering family, select the parent product offering family.|

5.  Select **Save**.

    The product offering family is available for use and can be selected when you create a product offering.
