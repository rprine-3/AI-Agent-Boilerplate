# Subscription revenue metrics

Subscription pricing is a pricing model where customers pay a recurring fee for products or services, usually at regular intervals such as monthly or annually. In Sales Customer Relationship Management, various subscription revenue amounts are calculated automatically for opportunities and quotes.

Subscription revenue amounts are metrics that help sales agents and sales managers track and analyze the revenue impact of sales deals. Sales agents and managers can view these system-calculated revenue amounts in the pricing details for opportunities and quotes, both at the header and line levels. These revenue amounts, such as monthly recurring revenue \(MRR\) or annual recurring revenue \(ARR\), are useful for monitoring sales performance, forecasting subscription revenue, and providing relevant subscription amounts when agents engage with customers.

## Subscription pricing metrics

In subscription pricing, common metrics for assessing subscription-based revenue include the following values and items:

-   **Monthly Recurring Revenue \(MRR\)**

    The total revenue generated from recurring subscriptions or contracts on a monthly basis. It helps sales agents and managers assess the stability and growth of subscription-based revenue streams.

-   **Annual Recurring Revenue \(ARR\)**

    The annual revenue generated from recurring subscriptions or contracts. It provides insights into the predictable revenue stream that can be expected from existing customers over a year.

-   **Annual Contract Value \(ACV\)**

    The total value of a contract on an annual basis. It highlights the annual revenue impact of a deal and facilitates comparison with other contracts or revenue streams.

-   **Total Contract Value \(TCV\)**

    The total value of a contract over its entire duration, including recurring and one-time charges. It provides visibility into the overall value of a deal and its impact on the organization's financial performance.

-   **Term**

    The duration or period of a subscription or contract, in months, such as 10 months or 24 months. In Opportunity Management, agents can enter a Term value before adding line items. In Quote Management, when agents enter a Term value and the contract start date, the system uses the term value and start date to auto-calculate the contract end date. If an agent changes the contract end date, the system recalculates the Term value.

    For products with monthly periodicity, the per-day price \(pro-rate multiplier\) is based on the Unit list price/number of days in the month. For a product with annual periodicity, the per-day price \(prp-rate multiplier\) that is multiplied against the decimal fields is the Unit price/365 days or 366 days if the year is a leap year.


## How subscription pricing revenues are calculated

Product offers for products and services contain basic pricing information, such as list price and pricing method \(either one-time or recurring periodicity\). When agents add product lines to opportunities and quotes, the system uses basic pricing information and product line details to auto-calculate the various revenue subscription values. These values are calculated and displayed in both the header pricing details and line pricing details.

For example, when an agent adds an opportunity line, the system calculates the Cumulative Monthly Recurring Revenue \(MRR\) amount using the unit net price and quantity of the product. The system then sums up the cumulative revenue to the parent line in the opportunity and displays the cumulative MRR in the pricing details of the opportunity header.

When agents use the configuration UI to add customizable products to quotes, the configurator interface displays the calculated subtotal values such as the Cumulative Monthly Recurring price for the root product offer of the line item.

The following tables describe the subscription pricing revenue amounts for opportunities and quotes and how they're calculated.
