# Create a service specification for a remote catalog item

Create a service specification on a Service Exchange provider instance. When you publish the service specification, a remote record producer creates the remote catalog item for the service specification.

## Before you begin

Define the characteristics, characteristic options, and specification categories before you create a service specification.

Role required: sn\_prd\_pm.product\_catalog\_admin or sn\_prd\_pm.product\_catalog\_manager

## About this task

When you create a service specification for a service request, use the **Distribution channel** field to set the channel to Service Exchange. When the service specification is published, a remote record producer is created for the specification.

## Procedure

1.  In the CRM Workspace, select the **List** \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: view.

2.  Navigate to **Specifications** &gt; **Service specifications** and select **New**.

    On the Details tab, fill in the form.

<table id="table_p3t_cxq_4nb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Number

</td><td>

Auto-generated ID for the service specification.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the service specification.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Version

</td><td>

Version number that is assigned to a specification: -   When you create the initial version, 1 appears in this field, and can't be changed.
-   When you create subsequent versions of the specification, the next incremental number appears in this field after you select **Create New Version**. For example, 4 appears in this field if 3 was the previous version number.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Display name

</td><td>

Display name that appears for the specification when this version of the specification is in effect. -   When you create the initial, or base version of the specification \(for example, version 1\), you must enter free-form text, which is usually the name of the specification, into the field.
-   When you create versions of the specification, a system-assigned concatenation of the specification name and its current version number appears, but can be overwritten. For example, SD-WAN Edge Device v2 appears in this field when:
    -   SD-WAN Edge Device is the name of the specification.
    -   Version 2 is the current version of the specification.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Specification category that the service specification belongs to.-   If the selected category that belongs to 5G services doesn't have any matching slice templates, the system checks for existing templates.
-   If the selected category has multiple templates mapped to it, the systems chooses the latest published template to the specification.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Type of service specification: -   **Customer Facing**

Customers can create a ticket or a case for the service. When you select this type, the **Distribution channel** field is displayed to specify how the service is provided, for example web.

**Note:** Only Customer Facing Service specifications are eligible for remote catalog creation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sub type

</td><td>

Sub-type of the specification. Choose **Slice** to define 5G network service specifications.**Note:**

-   When you select Slice as the sub type, the templates are automatically selected based on the mapping of templates with the specification categories of service specifications in the decision table.
-   If you select None as the sub type, you can manually specify a template.


</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Template

</td><td>

Templates that you've defined if you're using 5G services.**Note:** When you change a template, it deletes all the specification characteristics that are marked as true and are associated with the old template and re-associates the specification characteristics as per the new template that you've selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>
