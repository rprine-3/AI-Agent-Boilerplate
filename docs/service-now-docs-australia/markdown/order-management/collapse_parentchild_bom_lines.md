# Collapse parent or child BOM lines

You can configure child products to hide under their parent products unless expanded.

## Default behavior

When product actions are set with a defined parent/child relationship, by default, child products are indented as in the following:

\[Omitted image "cpq-bom-indent.png"\] Alt text: parent/child relationship

## Collapsible behavior

This behavior can be overridden by adding `{“hierarchyColumn”: “<productListColumnVariableName>”}` to the value column of the productList element in the layout editor or in the layout CSV file.

## Result

\[Omitted image "cpq-bom-enable-collapse-result.png"\] Alt text: Result

Admins can change where the collapse arrow appears by defining a different product list column as the hierarchy column \(`“hierarchyColumn”`\). For example, using `quantity` in the CSV snippet above results in the following:
