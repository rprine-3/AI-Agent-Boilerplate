# Entity configuration and mapping

Use the Entity Configuration tables and forms to configure and map an entity that defines a structure and transfers the data from the source entity to the target entity.

## Mapping and configuration

Create the configurations and mappings for the entities by using the Entity Configuration tables.

## Entity Configuration tables

The entity configuration tables provide you with the information for the fields on the entity configuration form.

</table>Each field on the entity configuration form gathers the information from one entity configuration table. The following table has the information about the fields, their descriptions, and the entity tables that the data is populated from.

**Note:** The Lead to Cash Entity Definition and Lead to Cash Entity Attributes are related lists on the Entity Configuration form.

</table>## Entity mappings

With entity mappings, you can map the source and target tables to transfer the data between the entities that depend on the available entity configurations. The entity mapping tables provide the information for the fields on the entity mapping forms.

|Table|Name|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|Lead to Cash Entity Mapping|sn\_l2c\_core\_entity\_mapping|Defines and maps the lead-to-cash entity mappings.|
|Lead to Cash Entity Table Mapping|sn\_l2c\_core\_entity\_table\_mapping|Defines and manages the mappings for the different tables that are associated with the lead-to-cash entities.|
|Lead to Cash Entity Attribute Mapping|sn\_l2c\_core\_entity\_attribute\_mapping|Defines and manages the attributes and their mappings with the corresponding lead-to-cash entity.|

The entity mapping form enables you to map the entities with their corresponding tables and attributes.

**Note:** The Lead to Cash Entity Table Mapping and Lead to Cash Entity Attribute Mapping are related lists on the Entity Mapping form.
