# Advanced Approval Management

The Advanced Approval Management application enables you to define workflows for approving Sales Customer Relationship Management entities, such as customer quotes, in your sales organization.

## Advanced Approval Management overview

Sales agents use workflows created by approval admins in Advanced Approval Management to preview and submit approval requests for entities such as quotes. Authorized approvers review approval requests to verify that the items meet legal guidelines and company pricing policies. They can either approve or reject requests. These workflows provide oversight of the approval process, which helps prevent financial errors and delays in approvals, particularly for high-value or high-risk deals. During the approval process, sales agents and approvers receive notifications informing them of the approval status and approval tasks.

## Advanced Approval Management workflow

This section describes the tasks involved in configuring and using Advanced Approval Management.

1.  As an approval rule admin or writer, create an approval configuration for a Sales Customer Relationship Management entity, such as quotes.
2.  Build approval workflows by creating:
    -   Conditions that trigger the rules in the workflow
    -   Approval rules that control the steps in the workflow
    -   Approval chains for organizing workflow steps and the type of approval work
    -   Approval users and groups \(approvers and approver groups\)
3.  As a requester \(sales rep\), create and preview an approval request, then submit the request. The approval engine routes the approval request to authorized approvers.
4.  As a requester, monitor and track the approval process using the advanced approval interface.
5.  As an approver, review and either accept or reject an approval request based on conditions and rules.
6.  As a requester, update rejected requests and resubmit the requests.
7.  As a requester, when the request is approved, proceed with the transaction.
