# Configuring product offerings and catalogs

Create product offerings and the associated product catalogs that can be used by Sales Customer Relationship Management agents for pre-sales activities, order capture, and post-sales engagement.

As a product catalog administrator or catalog manager, you complete various configuration tasks to create the product catalogs and offerings for products and services sold by your organization. You also work with your pricing administrator, who sets the pricing for your product offerings. For more information on pricing, see [Configuring product pricing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/som-managing-product-pricing.md).

The following workflow example shows a typical series of steps for setting up catalogs and product offerings, including the pricing configuration tasks performed by your pricing administrator. Some steps may be optional in your organization, and other steps, such as setting up product relationships between catalog entities, may occur in a slightly different sequence.

**Note:** Review your entitlements to see the product offering options available to you.

## Overview of product offering and catalog configuration

Starting with the May 2024 release of Sales Customer Relationship Management applications, you can use the CRM Workspace to configure product offering catalogs, product offerings, and product offering relationships.

The following table identifies the configuration tasks for setting up the various features available in Product Catalog Management.
