# Customer self-service for Sales Customer Relationship Management

Support your business-to-business \(B2B\) customers by enabling self-service capabilities through the Business Portal to create and manage orders, invoices, and requests for quotes.

## Business Portal overview

The Business Portal is a self‑service, customer‑facing web interface in Sales Customer Relationship Management that enables B2B customers to discover products, configure offerings, and place orders directly through a secure, web‑based experience. The portal complements internal sales workflows, enabling your customers to engage with the sales process independently while remaining fully integrated with core CRM data and processes. The Business Portal, which is based on Customer Service Management, streamlines order placement, reduces dependency on manual sales interactions, and accelerates revenue generation. It also provides integrated access to knowledge articles, community forums, service catalogs, and chatbots.

## Business Portal benefits

The Business Portal provides benefits for administrators and B2B customers. Administrators can easily manage and administer the portal and install plugins to enable new features. The following table lists the benefits for B2B customers.

</table>## Generative and agentic AI applications for enabling customer self-service

The ServiceNow Otto for Order Management includes the following applications that enable business-to-business \(B2B\) customers to submit order and invoice cases autonomously in simple conversational format from the Business Portal.

-   **Manage Order Operations**

    The Manage Order Operations application \(com.sn\_ord\_ops\_aias\) includes the following AI agents:

    -   Manage order operations AI agent: Enables B2B customers to submit order cases autonomously from the Business Portal using natural language.
    -   Order exception AI voice agent: Enables B2B customers to submit order cases using voice calls.
-   **Manage Invoice Operations**

    The Manage Invoice Operations application \(com.sn\_inv\_ops\_aias\) includes the following AI agents and agentic workflow:

    -   Invoice dispute intake assistant AI agent: Enables B2B customers to submit invoice dispute cases autonomously from the Business Portal using natural language.
    -   Invoice dispute AI voice agent: Enables customers to submit invoice dispute cases using voice calls.
    -   Invoice dispute assist agentic workflow: Enables finance agents to validate and resolve invoice disputes using a guided experience from the Now Assist panel in the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace. Internally, it uses the invoice dispute support assistant AI agent to validate invoice information, trigger API calls to check quantity discrepancies and provide resolutions.

## Business Portal and sales agents

Sales agents don’t directly use the Business Portal, but work on orders, order cases, invoice cases, and RFQs submitted through the Business Portal from the CRM Workspace. Depending on the process for orders, order cases, invoice cases, and RFQs, the agents work on their assignments and work with the customers to provide resolution. For example, reviewing RFQs, converting RFQs to quotes, applying price adjustments, and returning the quote to the customer for approval.
