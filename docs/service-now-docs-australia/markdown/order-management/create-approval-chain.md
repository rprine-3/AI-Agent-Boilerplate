# Create approval chains

Optionally create approval chains that control the sequence in which two or more approval rules \(steps\) are run.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_adv\_appr\_mgmt.approval\_rule\_admin, sn\_adv\_appr\_mgmt.approval\_rule\_writer

## About this task

Use chains to control the execution of approval steps that are run based on the approval rule order:

-   Within a chain, steps run sequentially.
-   Across chains, chains can run sequentially or in parallel, based on the chain order value. Chains with the same order value run in parallel.
-   If you don't define chains, approval rules run in parallel.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:.

3.  Navigate to **Advanced Approvals** &gt; **Approval Chain**.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  Enter the **Name** of the approval chain.

6.  Enter the **Order** in which the approval chain is to be run.

    For example, entering 1 as the **Order** indicates that this chain is run first in the approval workflow sequence.

7.  Select the **Approval configuration** that identifies the Sales Customer Relationship Management entity for the approval workflows, such as Quote.
