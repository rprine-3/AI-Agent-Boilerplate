# Configuring location-based product transactions

In Sales Customer Relationship Management, agents can create opportunities, quotes, and orders tailored to customer location. These transactions are called location-based product transactions.

When the product offerings and services available to customers vary based on location, your agents can use a location filter in the product catalog UI to select a service location and view only the products and services appropriate for that location. Agents can then add the appropriate products to an opportunity, quote, or order. Agents can also copy products and services from one location to another within the same transaction, which eliminates the need to create another opportunity, quote, or order for each location.

## How location-based transactions work

-   **Admin and product catalog admin configuration**

    Admins activate location-based transactions by enabling the **sn\_sales\_common.enable\_location\_based\_transactions** system property.

    Product catalog admins use the product eligibility rule entity filters to identify eligible and ineligible product entities \(catalogs, categories, and product offerings\). They also set up decision rules in product eligibility matrices, to specify the context variables, such as billing state or the service location variables \(introduced in the November 2024 release\), for controlling the display of eligible catalogs, categories, or product offerings.

    In the following example of the Product Offering Catalog Eligibility matrix, a rule entity filter for ineligible catalogs and the context variable, service state, are used to filter the product catalog displayed.

-   **Agent experience for location-based transactions**

    When agents specify a service location, the product catalog UI displays the eligible catalog, categories, or offerings for that location, depending on the product eligibility entities configured. When they select a simple or fixed product, the line item is created automatically for the specified location. If they select a configurable product, they use the product configurator to customize the product options. A line item is created automatically when they save the product configuration.

    Your agents can then copy line items to another location in the same transaction \(opportunity, quote, or order\). They can indicate that only eligible line items be copied to the specified location.
