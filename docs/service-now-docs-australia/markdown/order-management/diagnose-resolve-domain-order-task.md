# Diagnose and resolve a domain order

As a customer service agent, review, diagnose, and resolve, and close a domain order for the service-related issue experienced by the customer.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

To enable the display of the **Diagnose** tab and **Run diagnostics** in the conceptual panel, the **Test and Turn up** must be selected in the **Stage**.

The decision table enables the Test and turn up to configure the trigger for any request definition. This out-of-the-box feature is shipped only for Test and turn up task.

## About this task

The domain order progresses through several stages from start to closure. It begins with a customer service agent reviewing and verifying the problem. Next is the diagnosis stage, where system-specified tests are executed to identify the root cause. After the tests, the agent moves to the repair, creating a task to fix the identified issue. The agent follows the instructions in the repair task to address the problem areas. Once the repair is complete, the task is retested to confirm that the issue is resolved. Finally, the order is moved to the next step toward delivery based on the customer's feedback.

This task is applicable for product order, services, and resources.

2.  Select the List icon.
