# Transaction Converse

With Transaction Converse, you can use natural language to manage line items in transactions and quotes. Add, update, and delete items quickly and intuitively with conversational commands, even in complex transactions with many line items.

The new Transaction Converse feature in ServiceNow Quote Experience simplifies and accelerates the way users manage line items in transactions and quotes. Using natural language to interact add, delete, and update line items makes dealing with complex transactions with numerous line items easier.

## Key features

-   Conversational line item management

    Transaction Converse lets users perform actions such as adding, updating, or deleting line items by typing or speaking their requests. For example, when a user tells the system to "discount laptop by 25%" or "add rear camera to the quote," the feature identifies the relevant items and columns, previews the intended changes, and asks for confirmation before the changes are applied.

-   Bulk and targeted actions

    The feature excels at handling bulk changes across many line items, making it particularly valuable for transactions or quotes with hundreds of line items. Instead of manually searching and editing each line, users can issue a single command, and Transaction Converse efficiently processes the request.

-   Controls that keep users informed and involved

    Transaction Converse is designed with robust feedback mechanisms. Before any changes are finalized, users can preview which line items and columns are affected, ensuring transparency and control.

-   Intelligent prompt handling and clarification

    If a user’s request is vague or ambiguous \(for example, "take care of the expired licenses"\), the feature intelligently prompts for clarification or offers possible interpretations. For example, Transaction Converse might suggest which items would be updated or deleted based on context and fuzzy matching. Transaction Converse uses reinforcement learning with human feedback to adapt to the particular language and needs of each organization. Over time, the model becomes more attuned to the way users phrase requests and to the unique characteristics of their product catalogs, personalizing the feature for each customer and making it increasingly effective.

-   Bulk update via file upload

    Users can upload files to quickly add products and update price and quantity.

    -   If the uploaded file includes non-configurable products that are not currently in the transaction, the products are added to the transaction with their corresponding prices and quantities. \(Configurable products cannot be added at this time.\)
    -   If the uploaded file includes products that are already in the transaction, their prices and quantities are updated to match the file. Both configurable and non-configurable products can be updated in this way.
    -   Products that are in the transaction but not in the uploaded file are not updated and remain unchanged.
    Transaction Converse supports comma-separated value \(.csv\) files and Excel format \(.xlsx\) files for upload.

-   Easy activation

    Transaction Converse can be enabled on request for customers using ServiceNow Quote Experience Interested customers can file a support ticket, and the team will assist with activation and collect feedback to guide future enhancements.
