# Enable the manage order operations agent on Business Portal

Activate and associate the manage order operations agent on the Business Portal so that your customers can use this AI agent to submit order cases autonomously using ServiceNow Otto.

## Before you begin

Activate and enable a chat assistant such as ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent to use in the Business Portal. For more information, see [Configuring assistants overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/configure-now-assist-va.md).

AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aia.md).
