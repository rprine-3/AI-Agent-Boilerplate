# Add products or services to an order in Order Management

Add order lines for products or service orders using the product catalog and product configurator in Order Management.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Check your entitlements to see if the product configurator is available.

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_agent, sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.service\_agent

## About this task

The product catalog displays tiles that contain product information. Simple products have an **Add** button that adds the product with no options available to the order.

Products with options have a **Customize** button that opens the product configurator, which lets you select product options.

When the  product configurator opens you can select from the available options for the product or service. The product configurator consists of three columns.

-   The product hierarchy displays product catalog items and child products associated with the product.
-   The option selection displays any available options for the product, service, order lines, and order tasks.
-   The Current Selection displays the selected products options and the pricing.

Depending on your configuration, you'd either see a CPQ Configurator or product configurator. To learn more about these, see [Using the CPQ Configurator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/using-servicenowcpq.md) and [Using the Configurator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/using-som-product-configurator.md).

As you configure your product, use the following options:

<table id="table_pqy_fcs_tgc"><thead><tr><th>
