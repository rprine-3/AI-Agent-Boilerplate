# Verify the sys\_id of a project task template

Determine if you're using the correct project task template for domain orders or order tasks by checking the sys\_id of the project template task.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**, and in the filter enter `project_template_task.list`.

2.  Select the record for the project template task to be verified.

    For example, in the Project Template Task record for Product Order for SD-WAN Security, which belongs to the SD-WAN Package project template, the sys\_id is 183910354fcd2110c5ff2624b2ce0b49.

3.  Check the value of the sys\_id in the associated Decisions table entry.

    1.  Navigate to **All** and in the filter, enter `sys_decision_question.list`.

    2.  In the Decisions \[sys\_decision\_question\] table, locate the record of the corresponding decision table entry, for example Project Management Oversight for Domain Order.

    3.  In the record for the project template task, select the **Answer** column.

    The resulting record for the **Answer** field opens.

4.  In the resulting record for the Decision Table Multiple Result, view the XML output by right-clicking the header bar of the record and selecting **Show XML**.

5.  Review the XML and locate the sys\_id value in the file.

    The sys\_id value should match the sys\_id of the project template task determined in Step 1. If the sys\_id doesn't match, proceed to the next step.

6.  In the Decision Table Multiple Result record, select the **u\_project\_template\_task** and check the XML view of another project template task to verify the sys\_id of the project task template.
