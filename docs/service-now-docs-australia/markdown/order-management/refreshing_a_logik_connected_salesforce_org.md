# Refreshing a CPQ connected Salesforce org

Refreshing a Salesforce org severs the database sync between CPQ and Salesforce. To get things working again, take these steps after the refresh.

When a CPQ connected Salesforce org is refreshed, the database sync between CPQ and Salesforce will be temporarily broken. This is because a refresh automatically changes many pieces of the Salesforce org, including the Salesforce org ID, product IDs, and user names.

These ID changes are used for many integration points between the two systems, such as the Refresh Token User Runtime APIs that depend on a User ID, the product, the Pricebook, Pricebook entry sync, and the user access set up for the CPQ Admin.

To complete the CPQ side of the refresh, create a support case by using the [ServiceNow Support portal](https://support.servicenow.com). For step-by-step instructions, see [Create a case on Now Support for CPQ Customers](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=d67d3e71475d7a90f64de825126d4326&id=kb_article_view).

When you submit the support case, provide the following information:

-   The current CPQ Environment URL
-   The date the refresh will be performed
-   What you'd like to do with the connected CPQ environment's existing data:
    -   Retain its data \(a repoint\)
    -   Start from scratch \(decommission and create a new environment\)
-   The new SFDC org ID \(if unknown at the time, simply give TBD\)
-   The SFDC My Domain URL \(if changed\)
-   The SFDC Usernames for users that will need CPQ Admin access
-   Whether you want to change the CPQ environment host name, and if so, what it should be
-   The provisioning username with the email address and system administrator privileges.

Once the environment is refreshed, you will need to:

-   Send the new SFDC org ID
-   Navigate to Salesforce Setup &gt; Custom Settings &gt; Manage CPQ tenant and modify the CPQ URLs.

    Navigate to SFDC &gt; Setup &gt; Custom Settings &gt; Manage CPQ Tenant &gt; Edit, and change the Runtime Configuration URL and Administration URL.

-   If using Salesforce CPQ, change the external configurator URL.

    Navigate to SFDC &gt; Setup &gt; Installed Packages &gt; Configure Salesforce CPQ &gt; Additional Settings, and change the external configurator URL to the new site with `/ui/configure` appended to the end.

-   Submit a new refresh token user name with system administrator permissions.

    Navigate to CPQ Admin &gt; Settings, and delete or reset Refresh Token Username.

-   If using any Runtime APIs in SFDC, create new Runtime Clients.

    Navigate to CPQ Admin &gt; Runtime Clients, and create the new clients.
