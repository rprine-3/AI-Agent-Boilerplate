# Configuring CPQ for SalesForce RLM

Install and configure the Salesforce Revenue Lifecycle Management package for CPQ \(v0.3 or later\).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:

Salesforce \(SF\) environment:

-   Your Salesforce environment has Revenue Lifecycle Management \(RLM\) license\(s\) provisioned.
-   The setup steps described in [Salesforce RLM documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.revenue_lifecycle_management_get_started.htm&type=5) are complete:
    -   Enable RLM features in your SF org
    -   [Enable Product Configurator](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.product_configurator_enable_product_configurator.htm&type=5)
    -   Set up your user permissions set licenses and permission set groups for Admin user

Note that Salesforce Development states that its RLM and CPQ apps are incompatible. Therefore, follow these steps:

-   Uninstall the CPQ app, if it is installed.
-   Uninstall any Salesforce CPQ for CPQ package that may be installed on the Salesforce environment.
-   If the CPQ environment previously had a Salesforce Subscription Management for CPQ package installed on it, this must be uninstalled. Some Subscription Management package elements conflict with the elements installed by the Salesforce Revenue Lifecycle Management for CPQ package.

CPQ base package: Salesforce for CPQ Base package v2.2, or greater installed.

## Set up CPQ Configuration for SalesForce RLM

This guide walks you through the installation and setup of the Salesforce Revenue Lifecycle Management package for CPQ v0.3 or later. \(This guide does not discuss NGP setup. It will be added in a later version.\)

As the current package is unmanaged, you will be required to uninstall v0.3 to install future releases of this package.

## Salesforce Transaction Line Editor Setup

A Lightning Web Component is available to perform configure/reconfigure and view the Quote Line Items in their bundled/hierarchical view. To add this component to the layout:

3.  From left menu, drag Transaction Line Editor component onto the layout.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-transaction-line-editor.png"\] Alt text: Transaction components

4.  Save and Activate.

## Salesforce Product Configuration Flows Setup

Instead of assigning a Configurator at the org level, a new object determines which configurator to launch per product.

1.  Search for and open the sObject, "Product Configuration Flow"
2.  Create a new Config Flow record and set the Flow Identifier as "RLMConfiguratorScreen". If you're only using one configurator, make this the Default as well.

If there are multiple config flows being used, the flow can be assigned to individual products or product classifications through the Related records.

## Salesforce Product Discovery Setup

Configure from Quote: With Product Discovery, products can be configured before being added as a quote line.

1.  App Launcher → Sales → Quotes → open a quote.
2.  Press the gear icon on the top-right corner of the page and select "Edit Object".
3.  Go to Page Layouts; for the layouts being used, add the “Browse Catalog” action to the layout and save.

\[Omitted image "cpq-edit-object.png"\] Alt text: Setup menu

Configure from account is not currently supported. In the future, the user will be able to configure without reference to a quote. For instance, this could be used to launch product discovery from the account page.

1.  From a Catalog page, open the Admin gears and click “Edit Page”.
2.  Under Components, search for and add the "Product List Page Component" onto the page.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-logik-config-for-sf-rlm-46.png"\] Alt text: Product list components

3.  Save, and if needed, Activate and assign as default.

## CPQ Webhook Setup

1.  If Webhooks are not enabled on your CPQ environment, create a Support case and request Webhooks be turned on in the environment.

    To create a support case, use the [ServiceNow Support portal](https://support.servicenow.com). For step-by-step instructions, see [Create a case on Now Support for CPQ Customers](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=d67d3e71475d7a90f64de825126d4326&id=kb_article_view).

2.  When Webhooks are enabled, navigate to CPQ Admin Home → Utilities → Webhooks, and create a new Webhook with the following settings:

    -   Integration Type: Salesforce
    -   Async: false
    -   Content: Either "All" or "BOM and System Fields"
    -   BOM Types: "sales" \(others can optionally be added, but "sales" is required\)
    \[Omitted image "cpq-webhook-setup.png"\] Alt text: Webhook screen


## CPQ Product Selling Models Setup

In a product action, pricing fields for Revenue Lifecycle Management can be set, similar to extended info. These are available in both simple and advanced product actions.

Example of simple product action setup:

\[Omitted image "cpq-product-selling-models-setup.png"\] Alt text: Product selling models setup

Available pricing map \(ProductList.pricing\) fields are:

-   productSellingModelId
-   startDate
-   endDate

Assuming Product Selling Models have been created in Salesforce, the productSellingModelId can be found in a subpage of Utilities and will automatically be suggested in the simple product action UI.

Example productSellingModelId based on this image would be "Term\_Defined\_TermDefined\_1\_Months\_2023\_03\_02"

## Salesforce: Enable Context Service

1.  Setup → Feature Settings → Context Service → Context Service Settings: Set “Context Definitions” to "On"
2.  Refresh the page. If you donʼt see the next step, wait 10 seconds and try again.

    If you still donʼt see the next step, wait 20 seconds and try again. This is an asynchronous process.

3.  Setup → Feature Settings → Context Service → Context Definitions: Confirm that under “Standard Definitions”, the “Sales Transaction Context” is present and is “Active”.
    1.  Open dropdown menu for "SalesTransactionContext\_\_stdctx" and press 'Extend'.
    2.  Populate the new Context Definition and Save.
    3.  Go to the Custom Definitions tab. Open the dropdown menu for the newly created Context Definition and press 'Activate'.

    At this point, your BRE Qualification Rules should be setup correctly. To end, we will simulate the configuration to verify that it is working correctly.

31. In the Expression Set Editor, click the “Simulate button”
32. Select “Advanced” for the input and populate the ProductId field with your Cisco Server Rack NX44 product ID

    Leave the IsQualified and Reason fields as empty strings.

33. Click “Simulate”

Inspect the Output JSON to see if your product returns. "IsQualified" will be "null" and "Reason" will be an empty string.

## Salesforce: Pricing Procedure

1.  App Launcher → search for and open "Pricing Procedures" → open the "Revenue Management Default Pricing Procedure" → open the active Pricing Procedure and deactivate it.
2.  Return to the Revenue Management Default Pricing Procedure. Edit it.

    Change the Context Definition to the custom definition that was extended from "SalesTransactionContext\_\_stdctx". Save.

3.  Reactivate the Pricing Procedure Version.

## Troubleshooting

Issue: The CPQ blueprint was loaded into the RLM org, but no products show in the product catalog during quoting.

Diagnosis: This could mean that there's an issue with the Product Discovery settings \(see the [Salesforce: Enable Context Service](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10MqNVlW4X5ikoLvYTH3NeBhQO7mDq6rUUt3bsP428Ig/edit#heading%3Dh.t6hdyrii25c4) section and beyond\).

-   Setup → Feature Settings → Decision Tables. Open both the ProductQualification and Price Book Entries tables and perform the 'Refresh' action on each.
-   If the refresh doesn't solved the problem, view the following Salesforce documentation:
    -   [RLM Product](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.qocal_product_discovery_setup.htm&type=5)
    -   [Discovery Setup](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.qocal_product_discovery_setup.htm&type=5)

Issue: At runtime, the user receives the following error in RLM: `System.IllegalArgumentException: Looks like you don't have access to the place quote service. Salesforce Customer Support can help with that`

Diagnosis: This is a permission set issue. Make sure that the following three RLM permission sets are assigned to the integration user that facilitates the CPQ integration.

-   Product Catalog Management Designer
-   ProductAndPriceConfiguration API
-   Product Catalog Management Viewer
