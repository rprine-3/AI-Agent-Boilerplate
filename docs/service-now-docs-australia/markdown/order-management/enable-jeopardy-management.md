# Configure the Order Jeopardy Enablement Policy

Add Jeopardy Management workflows to product and service specifications using the Order Jeopardy Enablement Policy in Workflow Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Use Workflow Studio to define which product, service, or resource specification is jeopardy-enabled.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Select **Order Jeopardy Enablement Policy**.

3.  In the **Specification** column under the **Conditions** section, select a product or service specification to link to Jeopardy Management.

4.  In the **results** column, set the **Jeopardy Enabled** field to **True**.\[Omitted image "jm-enablement-policy.png"\] Alt text: Order Jeopardy Enablement Policy in Workflow Studio.

    **Note:** Entries in this decision table are for top-level product or service specifications. In a single order, customers can purchase multiple top-level products or services. However, if any one of the products or services isn’t jeopardy-enabled, the entire order is treated as a non-jeopardy-enabled order.

5.  Select **Save**.

    The product specification workflow is jeopardy-enabled. Jeopardy logic begins when the specification workflow starts.
