## What to do next

For complex orders, capture technical details. For more information, see [Capture order enrichment details for complex fulfillment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/capture-order-enrichment-details.md).

If order enrichment tasks don't apply, move to order approval. For more information, see [Approving or rejecting orders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/approving-rejecting-orders-som.md).
