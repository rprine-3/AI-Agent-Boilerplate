# Customizing the currency display in the shopping cart

Configure how currency values appear in the CPQ shopping cart. You can choose to display amounts with the ISO code \(USD 25.99\), currency symbol, or plain numbers.

Administrators can customize how currencies are displayed in the CPQ shopping cart.

The CPQ shopping cart displays amounts according to the Currency ISO Code partner field passed from the Salesforce.com \(SFDC\) quote. Unless SFDC is customized in this area, the quoteʼs currency will determine the ISO currency code for CPQ. If no ISO currency code is provided, CPQ defaults to USD.

## Shopping cart currency display options

By default, the shopping cart displays the ISO code to the left of the currency amount.

However, the currency symbol can be displayed instead.
