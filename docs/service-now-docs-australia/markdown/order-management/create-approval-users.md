## About this task

An approval user is a [user of your instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateAUser.md) as defined in the User \[sys\_user\] table. An approval user can be a dynamic approver, who can approve requests based on certain conditions that you set. For example, a dynamic user could be a user tied to a particular territory or a manager based on your organization's hierarchy.
