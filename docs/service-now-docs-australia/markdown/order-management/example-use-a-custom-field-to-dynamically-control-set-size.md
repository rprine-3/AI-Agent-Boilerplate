# Example: Use a custom field to dynamically control set size

This example demonstrates how to hide a standard field and replace it with a custom field.

## About this task

This article demonstrates how to hide the Size field \(shown below\) on a layout and replace it with a different field. A rule populates the value from the new field into the hidden field.

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

## Procedure

1.  In the layout wizard, turn off the Show Size Field setting.

    Although the set size field still exists, it no longer appears in the layout. For more information about sets and layouts, see [Using sets in layouts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/layouts-sets.md).

2.  Create your replacement number field and add it to the layout.

    You can change the display type as desired. In the example below, we created a number field using a slider.

    The final task is to create a rule to take the value from the new field and enter it into the \(hidden\) Size field.

3.  Create a rule, set your conditions, and create a Determination Action.

    In the rule action:

    -   Define your original Set Size field as the field in which the value will be injected.
    -   Select **Advanced**.
    -   Click **Edit Advanced Function** and input a single line of code that returns the value of your new field.
    For example, assume that the new field has a value of numberOfHardDrives. As seen in the image below, our line of code would simply be:

    ```
    return cfg.numberOfHardDrives;
    ```

4.  Deploy and test your updated blueprint.

    When you modify the values of the field that you created, the size of the Set should be updated accordingly.
