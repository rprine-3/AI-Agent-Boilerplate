# Inbound Request

Track the status of Sales CRM workflows and enable agents to track the status of any synchronous and asynchronous flows. It also supports processing dependent records sequentially to make sure that the data stays accurate and consistent.

## Inbound request table

Add a record to the modified Inbound Request table \[sn\_tmt\_core\_inbound\_queue\].

The following fields have been added to enhance the Inbound Request table:

-   Requested flow
-   Account
-   Contact
-   Consumer
-   Response payload
-   Source record ids
-   Status
-   Run in the background
-   Initiated by
-   Domain
-   Execute after
-   Request configuration
-   Job id

</table>**Note:** The **requested\_flow** and **response\_payload** fields aren’t visible to agents.

Use the **Requested flow &lt;is not empty&gt;** to filter out records using the Lead to Cash core APIs. The Inbound Request table \[sn\_tmt\_core\_inbound\_queue\] provides the status and other details related to the request. For example, while creating an order through a quote record, a confirmation message with the order header number.

**Note:** The flow designer **SOM Request Processor** is deprecated. Requests are directed to the flow designer IBQ Request Processor.

</table>## Archival policies

Archive the records in the Inbound Request table and determine when to clean up records on the table after a certain number of days. You can implement a different retention period for successful and failed requests.

|Archival rule|Time period|
|-------------|-----------|
|Successful requests|10 days|
|Failed requests|30 days|
