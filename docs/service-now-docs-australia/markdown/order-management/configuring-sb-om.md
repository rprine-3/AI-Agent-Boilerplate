# Configuring Service Exchange Order Management for Providers

Configure the Service Exchange Order Management for Providers application, which enables providers to use Order Management to create and fulfill product orders over Service Exchange. Providers publish the product offerings and service specifications as remote catalog items so that consumers can order from the Service Catalog on their own instance.

## Configuration overview

Follow these tasks to set up the Service Exchange Order Management for Providers application, which uses Order Management to create product offerings and service specification and publish them ServiceNow in your provider instance as remote record producers. Service Exchange admins can then activate these remote record producers to make the products and services available from the Service Catalog on consumer instances.
