# Return Merchandise Authorization case user journey

The Return Merchandise Authorization \(RMA\) user journey describes the steps a customer and support agent take when handling a sales return cases.

The RMA user journey starts when a customer reports an issue. The agent then manages the request through a clear four-stage process:

1.  Initiate the case
2.  Review the details and entitlements
3.  Resolve the issue
4.  Close the case

This approach confirms that every request is handled smoothly, with clear communication and a focus on effective resolution.
