# Configuring product offer eligibility

You can filter the product catalog, offering categories, and product offerings dynamically, to display only the appropriate catalog, categories, and offerings for which a customer is eligible. Your agents see this filtered product information when they're creating opportunities, quotes, and orders.

## Product offer eligibility overview

As a product catalog admin or manager, you create the business rules that filter the product catalogs, offering categories, and product offerings to display only the eligible products for customers when agents are creating quotes or orders. Filtering the products helps agents sell the correct products to customers. The filters are based on decision rules that you set in the following product eligibility matrices:

-   **Product Offering Catalog Eligibility**: Define the eligibility rules to be applied to product offering catalogs. For example, you can use this matrix to filter sales catalogs based on customer location, such as country, state, or city.
-   **Product Offering Category Eligibility**: Define the eligibility rules to be applied to product offering categories.
-   **Product Offering Eligibility**: Define the eligibility rules to be applied to product offerings.

These matrices are frameworks for setting the conditions and the context variables that control the catalogs, product categories, and product offerings displayed. You can use system-defined context variables provided with Product Catalog Management and Pricing Management, or you can work with your admin to develop your own custom context variables, such as marketing segment or sales channel, to be used in the eligibility matrices.
