# Manage opportunity records using an MCP client

Retrieve, update, create, and delete opportunity records and related CRM data from an MCP client using plain language.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

All changes go through the same server-side business rules, validation scripts, and access controls that apply on the standard form. Every create, update, or delete action requires explicit confirmation before the agent commits.

## Procedure

1.  Connect through your MCP client.

    For information on how to connect to an MCP server from an MCP client, refer [Connecting to an MCP server from an MCP client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/connect-mcp-server-client.md)

2.  Type a natural language prompt for the operation you want to perform.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Provide any additional information the agent asks for.

    **Note:**

    -   For create operations, the agent asks for missing mandatory fields one at a time.
    -   For update operations, it resolves ambiguous record references by asking you to select from a list.
    -   Field-type validations run before any change is committed; if a value is invalid, the agent returns an error and suggests a correction.
4.  For create, update, and delete operations: review the confirmation card and confirm to commit.

    **Note:** The confirmation card shows what will change before anything is saved or deleted. For update operations, it shows the old and new value for each field. Retrieve operations return results directly without a confirmation step.

    The agent performs the operation and returns the result. For create operations, it returns the record name and a link. For delete operations, it confirms the record was removed. If you don't have the required access, the agent returns a permission denied message.
