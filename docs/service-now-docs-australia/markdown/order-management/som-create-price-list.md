# Create and publish a price list

Create a price list that defines the pricing for products and services in Sales Customer Relationship Management.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_csm\_pricing\_pricelist\_administrator, sn\_csm\_pricing\_pricelist\_manager

## About this task

You can create various types of price lists for your organization, such as price lists that are based on a standard currency or price lists that are based on a particular customer account. The first price list that you create for a specified currency is automatically set as the default price list. When you're creating a default price list, the start date must be either the current date or a date earlier than the current date. If you don’t want the price list as the default, deselect the **Default** option.
