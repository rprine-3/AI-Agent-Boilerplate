# Setting conditions for enabling email access in Lead-to-Cash Process Management

Sales process managers must be granted access to compose emails for the sales entity records that are monitored in a sales process record.

Sales process managers can compose and send emails related to a sales process record by default. Enable sales process managers to compose emails for the related sales entities by setting the value of the **email\_client** dictionary attribute to **true** and using either of the following methods:

-   Grant the sales process manager write access to the child entity. For more information, see [Enable the email client for a table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/enable-email-client.md).
-   Set the value of the **glide.email\_client.check\_write\_access** system property to **false** to override checking whether the user has write access to the child entity.

    **Note:** The **glide.email\_client.check\_write\_access** system property isn’t supported on Xanadu and Yokohama Glide versions. If you’re using these Glide versions, then you must grant your users write access to the child entity.
