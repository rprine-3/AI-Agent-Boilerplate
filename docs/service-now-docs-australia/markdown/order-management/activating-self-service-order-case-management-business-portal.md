# Making self-service order and invoice case management available on the Business Portal

Install the necessary applications based on the self-service order and invoice case management options that you want to offer customers on the Business Portal.

**Note:** For information about activating the Business Portal itself, see [Enable the Business Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/order-management-enable-business-portal.md)

## Case management applications

The following apps must be installed from the ServiceNow Store to enable your customers to create and view order cases from the Business Portal:

-   Order Case Self Service \[sn\_ord\_case\_ss\]
-   Order Case Playbook \[sn\_ord\_case\_pb\]

These plugins have the following dependencies:

-   Customer Service Portal \[com.snc.customer\_service\_portal\]
-   Order Operations Case Management \[sn\_order\_case\]
-   Playbooks for Customer Service Management \[sn\_csm\_playbook\]

If your customers need to only view order cases in the Business Portal, you don't need to install the Order Case Playbook \[sn\_ord\_case\_pb\] and Playbooks for Customer Service Management \[sn\_csm\_playbook\] plugins.

## Invoice and invoice case management applications

The following apps must be installed from the ServiceNow Store to enable your customers to manage invoices and invoice cases from the Business Portal:

-   Invoice Self-Service \[sn\_invoice\_ss\]
-   Invoice Case Self-Service \[sn\_invoice\_case\_ss\]
-   Invoice Case Playbook \[sn\_inv\_case\_pb\]

These plugins have the following dependencies:

-   Customer Service Portal \[com.snc.customer\_service\_portal\]
-   Invoice Operations Case Management \[sn\_csm\_invoice\]
-   Playbooks for Customer Service Management \[sn\_csm\_playbook\]

If your customers only need to view invoice cases in the Business Portal, you don’t need to install the Invoice Case Playbook \[com.sn\_inv\_case\_pb\] and the Playbooks for Customer Service Management \[sn\_csm\_playbook\] plugins.
