# Configure the invoice dispute resolution extension point

Implement the invoice case resolution extension point to enable the invoice dispute intake assistant AI agent to resolve a validated quantity dispute by issuing a credit note or placing an order for the disputed quantity.

## Before you begin

The application scope must be set to Manage Invoice Operations. You can change the application scope using the application picker \[Omitted image "globe-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: in the Unified Navigation bar.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The demo data for the Manage Invoice Operations application includes a sample implementation called invoiceCaseResolutionEP as part of the sn\_inv\_ops\_aias.invoiceCaseResolutionEP extension point. To enable real-world resolution of validated invoice disputes, such as issuing credit notes or placing orders through your external systems, replace the demo implementation with your own custom logic.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the ServiceNow instance.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

3.  Search for the sn\_inv\_ops\_aias.invoiceCaseResolutionEP scripted extension point in the **API Name** field.

4.  View the sample script included in the demo data by selecting **sn\_inv\_ops\_aias.invoiceCaseResolutionEP**.

5.  Create your own implementation of the extension point by selecting the **Create implementation** related link.

6.  On the Script Include form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the Script Include form fields, see [Script includes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).

7.  Override the processInvoiceDisputeResolution function to implement your resolution logic for validated invoice quantity disputes.

    -   **processInvoiceDisputeResolution**

        Placeholder function meant to be overridden. Use this placeholder to implement the logic to resolve a validated invoice quantity dispute by processing the customer's preferred resolution option, such as issuing a credit note or placing an order for the disputed quantity.

        Input:

        ```
        {
            "invoiceCase": <Invoice case number of the invoice case record>,
            "resolutionOption": <String value representing the resolution option selected by the customer>,
            "conversationSummary": <Optional. String containing the summarized transcript of the complete conversation.>
        }
        ```

        Output:

        ```
        {
            "hasResolved": <Boolean; true if the resolution was processed successfully, false if the resolution failed>,
            "creditNote": <String containing the generated credit note number>,
            "orderNumber": <String containing the generated order number>
        }
        ```

8.  Select **Update**.

9.  Validate your implementation by submitting an invoice dispute from the Business Portal and selecting a resolution option using the ServiceNow Otto Virtual Agent.
