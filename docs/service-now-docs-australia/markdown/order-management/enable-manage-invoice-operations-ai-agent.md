# Configure AI-assisted invoice dispute intake on the Business Portal

Activate and associate the invoice dispute intake assistant AI agent on the Business Portal so that your customers can submit invoice cases autonomously using ServiceNow Otto Virtual Agent.

## Before you begin

AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aia.md).

Activate and enable a chat assistant such as ServiceNow Otto in Virtual Agent to use in the Business Portal. For more information, see [Configuring assistants overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/configure-now-assist-va.md).
