# Send an email from a touchpoint

Send emails to customers and stakeholders directly from a touchpoint record without having to leave the workspace. Emails are stored in the CRM system so other agents, managers, and customer success managers have full context about interactions with the customer or account.

## Before you begin

The User Mailbox Integration plugin \(com.glide.email.user\_mailbox.integration\) must be installed on your ServiceNow instance to enable agents to send emails from the touchpoint record. For setup instructions, see [Personal corporate mailbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/personal-corporate-mailbox.md).

Role required: sn\_crm\_touchpoint.touchpoint\_writer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:.

4.  Open the touchpoint record you want to work with.

5.  Select **Compose Email**.

    1.  In the **To** field, enter the recipient's email address.

    2.  In the **CC** or **BCC** fields, enter the name of recipients.

    3.  Review the text in the **Subject** field and change it if necessary.

            Toolbar options are available to format the text.

    5.  Add attachments to your email by selecting the Attach file icon \[Omitted image "attachments-icon.png"\] Alt text: and selecting the file.

7.  Either save the email as a draft or send it right away.

    -   To save the email as a draft to send later, close the form.

        The draft is automatically saved and accessible from the **Draft Emails** tab.
