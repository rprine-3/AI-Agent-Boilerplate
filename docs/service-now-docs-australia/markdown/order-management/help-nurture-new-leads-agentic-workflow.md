# Nurturing leads using agentic workflow

Use the Help nurture new leads agentic workflow to process the entire lead record process.

## Help nurture new leads agentic workflow overview

The Help nurture new leads agentic workflow works with a team of AI agents to assist you with managing the life cycle of leads, either independently or under supervision. You can use the agentic workflow to do the following:

-   Proactively engage with initial leads
-   Book an appointment or demo to get the lead closer to qualification
-   Identify opt-outs and disinterest for lead disqualification

To modify the Help nurture new leads agentic workflow [duplicate it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements. You can activate the agentic workflow template by making triggers active and setting the display settings to include the ServiceNow Otto panel.

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

## Prerequisites to use an agentic workflow

The prerequisites to use an agentic workflow are as follows:

-   Make sure that the ServiceNow Otto panel is turned on.
-   Set up the work schedule for sales agents:
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agent schedule** &gt; **Work schedule**.
    -   Create a work schedule for sales agents.
-   Duplicate the agentic workflow and activate the triggers.

**Important:** By default, all agent workflow and AI agent records are read-only.

To run the AI agents autonomously, you must first [duplicate the agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate all agents within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically. The triggers for each agentic workflow must be unique. If you prefer to invoke it manually, activating the trigger isn’t necessary.

There might be AI agents installed on your instance that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available to you, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).

</table>## Activating the agentic workflow

Activating duplicated workflow

1.  Navigate to the Help nurture new leads agentic workflow and duplicate it. The workflow also duplicates any triggers associated with that agentic workflow.
2.  Navigate to the duplicated workflow and activate the trigger \(the lead record is created or updated\).

    **Note:** You can activate the triggers associated with the workflow.


Activating external triggers

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Policy** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Inbound actions**. There are 2 inbound actions that must be activated:
    -   Activate the **Trigger agentic workflow for lead** inbound action.
    -   Activate the **Trigger agentic workflow for lead task** inbound action.
2.  Navigate to the SalesAIAgentsConstants script and change the value of HELP\_NURTURE\_NEW\_LEAD\_FLOW\_ID property to the sys\_id of the duplicated agentic workflow.


Nurturing a lead

To nurture a lead, perform the following steps:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio**.
2.  Review the information in the Describe and connect screen, make the necessary updates to ensure that the use case adapts to your requirements, and then select **Save and Continue**.
3.  In the Define trigger screen, activate the triggers that adapt to your requirements, or create your own triggers, and then select **Save and Continue**.
4.  In the Select display screen, perform the following steps:
    1.  Select where you want the use case output to be displayed.
    2.  Use the arrow next to it to add roles that can access the use case.

        **Note:** The sales\_agent is the default role for the use case.

    3.  Select **Save and test**.

The agent executes the testing in AI Agent Studio for the use case.

In the ServiceNow Otto panel, the agent receives a notification as soon as the interaction is generated, which enables them to follow the on-screen instructions and complete the task.
