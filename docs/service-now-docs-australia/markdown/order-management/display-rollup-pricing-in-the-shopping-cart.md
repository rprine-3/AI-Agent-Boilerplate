# Show rollup pricing in the shopping cart

Configure the shopping cart to display the sum of the child items as the price of the parent item.

## Before you begin

Role required: Admin

## About this task

When a bill of materials \(BOM\) is represented with hierarchy, such as a parent-child relationship, you may prefer to total the prices of the child items and display them on the parent line as a sum. CPQ rollup pricing totals direct child and parent extended list values. Rollup pricing delivers the sum of all child line prices to the shopping cart, including the price of the parent, and displays it at the parent line.

To view a script that illustrates how a hierarchical bill of materials might be generated, see [Adv Product Action with Product List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmVwr1NTJyFLWM0RJB4wUWcA7fI-Jg4iikv9Cji3OVI/edit?usp=sharing).

The following example shows four child products rolling up to their related parent products.

The next example shows a 2-tier roll-up, with a child product \(child1B and child 2B\) rolling up to a parent \(parent B\) and that parent rolling up to the parent product \(parent A\) in addition to the remaining child products \(child 1A and child 2A\).

2.  Name the rule, and click **Save**.

3.  Set your condition and create your product actions.

    -   Start with a parent product and set the parent product ID, quantity, price, type, BOM type, and unique identifier.

        For parent products, the type should be set to Component. For child products, the type should be set to Accessory.

    -   Add the unique identifier to the parent product field of any products that you want rolled up into the parent product.

4.  To display the rolled-up price in your cart, add `rollUpPrice` to your shopping cart in the layout editor, or define the `productlistcolumn` type in your layout CSV with the variable name `rollUpPrice`.
