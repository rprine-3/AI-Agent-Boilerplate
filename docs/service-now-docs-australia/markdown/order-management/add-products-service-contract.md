# Add a sold product or install base item to a customer contract

Add the sold products or the install base items covered to customer contracts, contract lines, or entitlements.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_manager

## About this task

Sold products are products and components that have been sold to an account or a consumer and can have multiple contracts. An install base item is an instance of sold product that has been provisioned for an account or consumer.

Associating sold products or install base items to a Customer Contracts and Entitlements entity helps keep a track of the products or install base items that are serviced to a customer under that entity.

A sold product or an install base item can be added to a Customer Contracts and Entitlements entity in the Draft, Active, or Suspended states.

**Note:** If an entity is deleted, the related sold product or install base item covered is also deleted.
