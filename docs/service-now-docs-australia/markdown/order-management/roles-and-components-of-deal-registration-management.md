# Roles and components of Deal Registration Management

The Deal Registration Management application \(com.snc.deal\_registration\_management\) uses roles to provide access to information, identify internal and external users, and maintain data security.

The Deal Registration Management application \(com.snc.deal\_registration\_management\) comes with a set of functional roles, each with varying levels of access to deals and their line items.

## Functional and granular roles

Functional roles help provide authorized partners to maintain data and records in the deal registration table. A granular model helps to protect data by granting the required level of access to the relevant enterprise or channel partner entities. With this functionality, each role is associated with a set of privileges that determine users’ access to certain information.

You can assign granular policies that authorize individuals to do their jobs efficiently and effectively, which helps to improve customer experience.

## Roles and descriptions

Functional roles are a set of granular roles that are required to perform a function that requires access to multiple entities. The following table lists the functional roles for Deal Registration Management.
