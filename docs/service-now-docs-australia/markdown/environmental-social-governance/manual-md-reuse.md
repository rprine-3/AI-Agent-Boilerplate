Basic details

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the manual metric definition. For example, `Number of incidents`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option to mark the manual metric definition as active.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Brief description of the manual metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Category of the metrics data. The choices are as follows:-   **Qualitative**: Qualitative data is intangible and non-numerical in nature. It’s defined by the characteristics of a process or business activity.
-   **Quantitative**: Quantitative data is tangible and numerical in nature. It’s defined by the numbers or key performance indicators.

**Note:** This fields **Nature**, **Direction**, **Precision**, and **Unit** are only displayed only when the category of the manual metric definition is **Quantitative**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Calendar

</td><td>

Calendar to use for metric aggregation. Only the configured calendar options are available for selection. This field is automatically set to **Standard Calendar**. **Note:** Standard calendar refers to the Gregorian calendar.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregation method

</td><td>

Method used to calculate the metric data for all the entities. For example, if you have a metric that you want to measure for multiple entities such as people, departments, or regions, you might want to know how to calculate the scores for each entity into a single score that represents the overall performance. Your choice of aggregation method depends on your goal of metric collection. For example, if you’re interested in overall performance and want to account for differences in scale or size between entities, the sum or average may be more appropriate. If you’re interested in identifying the best-performing entity, the maximum may be more appropriate, while if you’re interested in identifying the worst-performing entity, the minimum may be more appropriate. The aggregation happens across time periods based on the frequency defined in the metric definition. If the frequency is monthly, the calculation takes place every month. The four choices for aggregation methods are as follows:-   **Sum**: The metric data for all entities are added together to create a single score.
-   **Average**: The metric data for all entities are averaged to create a single score.
-   **Maximum**: The highest metric data among all entities is used as the single score.
-   **Minimum**: The lowest metric data among all entities is used as the single score.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unit

</td><td>

Unit for the manual metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Precision

</td><td>

Number of decimal places after the decimal point on a score. This field is automatically set to **0**.

 When the Precision is set to 0, the result is rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, if a metric definition with Precision 0 calculates the values 7 + \(5 / 2\), the result rounds up to 10.

 When the Precision is set to greater than 0, the result is rounded to the nearest decimal point for the given precision. For example, Precision 1 rounds a result of 4.45 as 4.5.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Frequency

</td><td>

Frequency at which the metric definition should collect the scores. The choices are as follows:-   **Daily**
-   **Weekly**
-   **Monthly**
-   **Quarterly**
-   **Semi-annually**
-   **Annually**

</td></tr><tr><td>

First run date

</td><td>

Start date of the metric definition execution for the collection of data according to the frequency.

Data owner assignment type

</td><td>

Type of the data owner assignment for the metrics within the metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **Simple**

The system assigns the specified Data owner or Data owner group to the Metric.

-   **Advanced**

The system assigns a Data owner based on the assignment configuration. ESG admins \[sn\_esg.admin\] or Risk admins \[sn\_risk.admin\] can set assignment configurations to dynamically assign data owners. For more information on creating assignment configurations see, [Create an assignment configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/create-assign-config-mmd.md) and [Assignment Configuration New Record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/assignment-configuration-new-record.md).

**Note:** This is available if you have the GRC: Approver Configurator application installed. For more information see, [Using Approver Configurator for setting up approvals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/approval-configuration.md).

Nature of the manual metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **None**: If you don’t want any change in the metric direction, select this option.
-   **Leading** \(Predictive\) Metric: Is predictive and helps anticipate future outcomes. In this case, the company may use a leading metric related to GHG emissions, such as the amount of energy consumed per production unit. By tracking energy consumption, the company can predict its future GHG emissions based on the energy sources used and the efficiency of its production processes. This leading metric enables the company to proactively identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions to reduce emissions.
-   **Lagging** \(Measures Impact\) Metric: Measures the impact of past actions or events. In the example, a lagging metric related to GHG emissions could be the total emissions produced by the company in a given year. This metric provides an assessment of the company's historical sustainability impact. By monitoring this metric over time, the company can evaluate the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts and identify areas where further improvements are needed. Lagging metrics help measure the outcomes of past actions and inform future strategies.
-   **Current** metric: Monitors ongoing processes and identifies real-time improvement areas. For GHG emissions, a current metric could be the emissions intensity, which measures the emissions generated per unit of production. By tracking emissions intensity, the company can identify specific areas within its operations that contribute to higher emissions. This metric helps the company identify real-time improvement opportunities, such as optimizing energy usage, implementing energy-efficient technologies, or adopting renewable energy sources.
