# Activate carbon calculations agentic workflow

Configure and activate the carbon calculation workflow that uses AI agents and tools. It automates the creation of calculated metric definition \(CMD\) records and formulas for Scope 3 carbon emissions.

## Before you begin

Install the ServiceNow Otto for Operational Sustainability plugin \(sn\_esg\_gen\_ai\).

Attach the Calculation Guidance document to the relevant record in the Emission Calculation Guidelines table. For further details, refer to [Attaching calculation guidance document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/attaching-calculation-guidance-document.md).

Role required: sn\_nowassist\_admin.nsa\_admin

## About this task

**Important:** This workflow is active by default. All fields are read-only except for the Triggers and Channels and status sections. To modify other fields, clone the workflow. Currently, you can't edit agent prompts or provide feedback for training.

If you have the user sn\_esg\_gen\_ai.cmd\_agent\_user role, you can get carbon calculations agentic workflow in the Now Assist panel.

This workflow uses an agentic approach to guide operational sustainability teams through carbon calculations, confirming accurate Scope 3 emissions reporting. It leverages conversational AI agents and integrated tools to select methodologies, map metrics, and validate emission factors for transparency and compliance. The process requires user interaction and runs under helper agent roles with ACL-based security to maintain oversight and efficiency.

**Note:** You can add or remove AI agents from this workflow by making a copy and customizing it. For more information, about copying agentic workflows, see [Duplicate an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md).

You can perform the following actions on Now Assist workflows if you have the sn\_generative\_ai.nsa\_admin role:

-   [Duplicate an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md)
-   [Modify an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/modify-aia-use-case.md)
-   [Delete an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/delete-aia-use-case.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Overview**.

2.  Select **Generate calculations for metrics** from the Recent agentic workflows and AI agents activity section.

3.  Under the **Define key requirements**, scroll to the section **Add AI agents that can perform these steps** and activate the agents **Calculation operand AI agent CMD** and **Calculation creation AI agent**.

4.  To activate the **Calculation operand AI agent CMD** agent, refer to [Activate calculation operand AI agent CMD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/activate-calculation-operand-ai-agent-cmd.md).

5.  To activate the **Calculation creation AI agent**, refer to [Activate calculation creation AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/activate-calculation-creation-ai-agent.md).

6.  On the **Generate calculations for metrics** page, perform the following steps:

    1.  Under the **Define security controls** section, review the details in **Define user access** and **Define data access** subsections, and select **Continue**.

    2.  Under the **Add Triggers** section, review the details and select **Continue**.

    3.  Under the **Select a UI display** section, set the display as active.

    4.  Select **Save and test**.

    5.  On the **Test Details**, enter the prompt in the **Task** field.

    6.  Select **Continue to Test Chat Response** to initiate the testing of the agentic workflow.


## What to do next

Use the **Testing** playground to [test your new agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-aia-use-case.md) using example utterances.

Verify that the executive summary and recommendations are generated. If activation fails, check roles and skill configuration.

Once you’ve confirmed the workflow is functioning as expected, begin by selecting the ServiceNow Otto action menu and entering your prompt.

If you have not already set up the ServiceNow Otto panel, for more information see, [Activate the ServiceNow Otto panel standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-now-assist-panel.md).

-   **[Activate calculation creation AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/activate-calculation-creation-ai-agent.md)**  
The calculation creation AI agent creates a calculated metric definition record using the formula passed in the input.
-   **[Activate calculation operand AI agent CMD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/activate-calculation-operand-ai-agent-cmd.md)**  
The calculation operand AI agent CMD identifies and retrieves relevant metric definitions and emission factors from existing sources. It then replaces generic references in the input formula with precise metric definition and emission factor names.
-   **[Attaching calculation guidance document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/attaching-calculation-guidance-document.md)**  
Attach the Calculation Guidance PDF to the designated emission calculation guidelines table record to enable the carbon calculations agentic workflow. The agent relies on this document to extract calculation methods, formulas, and category details for automated metric definition creation.
