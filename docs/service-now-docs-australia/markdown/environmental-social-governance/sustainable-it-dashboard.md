# Sustainable IT dashboard

The Sustainable IT dashboard displays a variety of information to easily gauge the sustainability impact of the IT assets of an organization.

The Sustainable IT dashboard displays data for Hardware assets, datacenters, and your organization's IT footprint on the world map. Datacenters refer to the facilities that house the IT infrastructure. All these tabs are explained in the following sections.

**Note:** To view the **Hardware assets** tab and the **Data centers** tab on the dashboard, you must activate the Hardware Asset Management \(sn\_hamp\) plugin. Additionally, to activate the **IT footprint map** tab, you must activate the Geo Map component \(sn\_geo\_map\) plugin. For more information on the required Geo Map component, see the [Understanding Google Maps APIs in geo-map component \[KB1588661\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1588661) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

## IT footprint map

The first tab on the Sustainable IT dashboard showcases a global map depicting the carbon footprint of your datacenters, office buildings, and so on, highlighting your most energy-efficient facilities. The data displayed is determined by the configuration that you configure on the map marker. For more information, refer to [Configure a map marker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/configure-map-markers.md). When you hover over the icons on the map, you can view the classification of the configured marker's efficiency, the metric name, the entity name, and the most recent metric data available. You can configure any of the metric definitions that are provided along with the Sustainable IT plugin. Only those metric definitions that are grouped under Sustainable IT are available for selection. For example, you can use the following the metric definitions:

-   **Carbon intensity for office locations**
-   **DCiE by data center**

    **Note:** DCiE stands for datacenter infrastructure efficiency.


For more information on how you can filter the metric definitions that are grouped under Sustainable IT, refer to [Filter Sustainable IT metric definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/filter-sustainable-it-metric-definitions.md).

When you move the cursor over the icon, a popover is displayed. On the popover, you can select the entity name and a side panel opens that shows the metrics related to the selected entity of the following metric definitions.

-   PUE by Data Center
-   WUE by Data Center
