</table>## Scheduled jobs

The scheduled jobs installed with the GRC: Metrics application run automatically at a specific time or schedule. Scheduled jobs can be set up to perform a wide variety of tasks such as running reports or data exports on a regular schedule.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Aggregate metric definitions|This job is executed every 30 minutes. It pulls all types of metric definitions data which are active and have the state as **Pending**. It updates the "state" and "value" for each metric definitions data based on the aggregation of its corresponding metric data for that period.|
|CMD validity check|This job is executed once everyday at 12AM. For Each calculated metric definition, it updates the "status" to valid/invalid and the "notes" based on its duplicate child metric definitions and child metrics.|
|Execute calculated metric definitions|This job is executed for each calculated metric definition for both the entity level as well as the metric data definition level and updates with the calculated value.|
|Execute metrics|This job is executed daily once at 4:30PM. This executes for each metric definition and its metrics that create metric data and the metric data task if it does not exists for that period.|
|Generate metric data by entity|This job runs daily to do entity hierarchy rollup for all the metric definitions.|
|Generate time dimensions|This job runs on first day of every year and creates time dimensions for that year.|

|sn\_grc\_metric.all\_words|Is used to replace all comma separated defined string in value to 'All' while importing metric data using Metric Integration.|\(blank\), blank, na, all, empty, \(empty\)|
|com.glide.event\_manager.grc\_metrics\_queue.even.load.distribution.enabled|Is used to distribute the events in the 'grc\_metric\_queue' queue equally between two worker threads.|500|
|com.glide.event\_manager.grc\_metrics\_queue.claim\_limit|Defines the maximum number of events that one worker thread can claim from the event queue.|true|
