# Integrating Operational Sustainability Management with Socialsuite

Socialsuite is a platform for conducting materiality assessments. You can import material topics from Socialsuite into your ServiceNow instance and manage them in the Operational Sustainability Management application.

The integration supports both double materiality and single materiality assessments. Double materiality assesses both impact and financial materiality. Single materiality assesses either impact or financial materiality. Assessments comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive \(CSRD\), European Sustainability Reporting Standards \(ESRS\), Global Reporting Initiative \(GRI\), and International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\).

## Assessment data

The integration imports the following data from Socialsuite:

-   Material topics
-   Impact materiality scores
-   Financial materiality scores

## Integration workflow

1.  Conduct materiality assessments in Socialsuite.
2.  Sync the assessment results to your ServiceNow instance.

    For more information, see [Sync material topics from Socialsuite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/sync-material-topics-from-socialsuite.md).

    The imported material topics appear in your ServiceNow instance in workflow states based on their status in Socialsuite. For details about how Socialsuite states map to the ServiceNow instance states, see [Material topic workflow and states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/material-topic-workflow-and-states.md).

3.  Associate the material topics with goals and targets.
