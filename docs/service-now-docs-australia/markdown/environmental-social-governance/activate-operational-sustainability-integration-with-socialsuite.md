# Activate Operational Sustainability Integration with Socialsuite

You can activate the Operational Sustainability Integration with Socialsuite plugin \(sn\_osm\_ma\) for Operational Sustainability Management if you have the admin role. The plugin enables you to import materiality assessment results from Socialsuite for reporting and compliance.

## Before you begin

Operational Sustainability Management requires a separate subscription from the rest of the ServiceNow AI Platform.

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. When you purchase a subscription, certain plugins are activated automatically. If a paid plugin isn't activated automatically, you can manually activate it from the All Applications list in your instance.

**Note:**

Before purchasing a subscription, you can evaluate the feature on a non-production instance without charge by requesting it from the Now Support Service Catalog.

Role required: admin
