# Edit Operational Sustainability Management dashboards

You can edit dashboard and dashboard tab information in the in-line editor. If the dashboard has been shared, any changes you make are applied globally.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esg.data\_owner, sn\_esg.metrics\_manager

## About this task

You can edit the details of the dashboards you have created. When you edit the content of dashboards created in the technical editor, you’re redirected to UI Builder.

**Important:** By default, dashboards are subject to edit lock. Only one person at a time can have the same dashboard in edit mode. If you’re viewing a locked dashboard, you aren’t able to make edits even with edit permissions. You’ll see the locking user's initials next to the **Refresh** and **View dashboard details** icons. Hover on the initials to see the user's name, company, and roles.

The **More actions** menu includes the option to clear the edit lock. Use this option with caution.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Workspace** &gt; **Analytics dashboard**.

2.  Select the Analytics dashboard icon \[Omitted image "dashboard-icon.png"\] Alt text: and then select the dashboard you want to edit.

3.  Perform any of the following actions.
