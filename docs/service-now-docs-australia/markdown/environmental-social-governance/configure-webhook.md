# Generate Webhook URL

Define a Webhook registry for generating the Webhook URL. Urjanet uses the Webhook URL to send real time data to the Operational Sustainability Management application when an Urjanet statement data is either generated or modified.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esg.admin

## About this task

A statement in Urjanet refers to a bill. Whenever a new statement is generated in Urjanet, using the defined Webhook, the Operational Sustainability Management application is notified about the new statement generation and the data is fetched into the Operational Sustainability Management application without any manual intervention.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Urjanet** &gt; **Webhook Registry**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the registry.|
    |Path|Resource path of the Scripted REST API to be used for inbound Urjanet API calls. This field is automatically set to **api/sn\_esg\_urjanet/webhook**.|

4.  Select **Submit**.

5.  Open the record that you created and select **Generate Webhook URL**.

6.  To copy the Webhook URL, select and hold \(or right-click\) the information message that appears on the screen and select **Copy Link Address**.\[Omitted image "webhook-url.png"\] Alt text: Copying the Webhook URL.
