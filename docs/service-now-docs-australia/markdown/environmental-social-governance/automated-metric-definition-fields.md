Option to mark the automated metric definition as active. When enabled, the metric definition becomes active and ready for use.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Brief description of the automated metric definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unit

</td><td>

Unit for the automated metric definition. You can define the units in which the data is shown.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Aggregation method

</td><td>

The Aggregation method refers to the method used to calculate the metric data for all the entities. For example, if you have a metric that you want to measure for multiple entities such as people, departments, or regions, you might want to know how to calculate the data for each entity into a single score that represents the overall performance. Your choice of aggregation method depends on your goal of metric collection. For example, if you are interested in overall performance and want to account for differences in scale or size between entities, the sum or average may be more appropriate. If you are interested in identifying the best-performing entity, the maximum may be more appropriate, while if you are interested in identifying the worst-performing entity, the minimum may be more appropriate. The aggregation happens across time periods based on the frequency defined in the metric definition. If the frequency is monthly, the calculation will take place every month. The four choices for aggregation methods are as follows:-   **Sum**: The metric data for all entities are added together to create a single score.
-   **Average**: The metric data for all entities are averaged to create a single score.
-   **Maximum**: The highest metric data among all entities is used as the single score.
-   **Minimum**: The lowest metric data among all entities is used as the single score.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Class

</td><td>

Class to which the metric definition belongs. The choices are as follows:-   **KPI**: Indicates how well the risk exposure is managed against objectives. Use this option to add entities and additional entities to the metric definition.
-   **KRI**: Indicates the amount of exposure to a given risk or set of risks. Use this option to add risks and risk statements to the metric definition. This option is available if the Advanced Risk plugin is activated.
-   **KCI**: Indicates the effectiveness of any controls that have been implemented to reduce or mitigate a given risk exposure. Use this option to add controls and control objectives to the metric definition. This option is available if the Policy and Compliance Management plugin is activated.

**Important:** This field appears only when the metric definition is created from the IRM suite of applications. It does not appear for Operational Sustainability Management.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Precision

</td><td>

Number of decimal places after the decimal point on a score.

 When an indicator has a Precision of 0, the indicator rounds the result to the nearest whole number. For example, if an indicator with Precision 0 calculates the values 7 + \(5 / 2\), the indicator rounds the result up to 10.

 When an indicator has a Precision greater than 0, the indicator rounds to the nearest decimal point for the given precision. For example, an indicator with Precision 1 rounds a result of 4.45 as 4.5.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Nature

</td><td>

Nature of the automated metric definition. The choices are as follows:-   **None**: If you don’t want any change in the metric direction, select this option.
-   **Leading** \(Predictive\) Metric: Is predictive and helps anticipate future outcomes. In this case, the company may use a leading metric related to GHG emissions, such as the amount of energy consumed per production unit. By tracking energy consumption, the company can predict its future GHG emissions based on the energy sources used and the efficiency of its production processes. This leading metric enables the company to proactively identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions to reduce emissions.
-   **Lagging** \(Measures Impact\) Metric: Measures the impact of past actions or events. In our example, a lagging metric related to GHG emissions could be the total emissions produced by the company in a given year. This metric provides an assessment of the company's historical sustainability impact. By monitoring this metric over time, the company can evaluate the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts and identify areas where further improvements are needed. Lagging metrics help measure the outcomes of past actions and inform future strategies.
-   **Current** metric: Monitors ongoing processes and identifies real-time improvement areas. For GHG emissions, a current metric could be the emissions intensity, which measures the emissions generated per unit of production. By tracking emissions intensity, the company can identify specific areas within its operations that contribute to higher emissions. This metric helps the company identify real-time improvement opportunities, such as optimizing energy usage, implementing energy-efficient technologies, or adopting renewable energy sources.
