# Create a narrative disclosure on local system

Create an Operational Sustainability Management narrative disclosure for your organization and store it on your local system. After you create a disclosure, you can download the document, edit it, add metrics to it, and upload it back into the Operational Sustainability Management instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esg.reporting\_disclosure\_manager or sn\_esg.admin

## About this task

When you create a disclosure, you can specify if you want to save the disclosure on your local system or on some remote storage such as Microsoft OneDrive. The disclosure that is created serves as the primary document. This procedure provides the instructions for creating a narrative disclosure on local storage.

**Note:** After you create a disclosure, you must not use Ctrl+A and delete to delete the content in the Disclosure document. If this is done, the metrics associated with the document would not be deleted and will be tracked. Ensure that the custom properties Document ID and Disclosure Number are not updated or deleted after the disclosure document is created.
