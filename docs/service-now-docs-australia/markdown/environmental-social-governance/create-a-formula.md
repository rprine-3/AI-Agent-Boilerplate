# Create a formula

Build your own formula using either entities or metric definitions.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esg.program\_manager

sn\_risk.user \(for Risk users\).

## About this task

When creating a formula, you can utilize functions like maximum, minimum, or average, as well as operators such as +, -, /, or \* to define the method of computation. To build a formula successfully, it’s important that at least one metric definition operand or an entity operand is present.

**Note:** The formula can be built using all browsers except Safari.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations depending on which application you're using for creating the formula.

    -   **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Workspace** &gt; **Metrics** &gt; **Calculated metric definitions**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Risk Management** &gt; **Risk Workspace** &gt; **Metrics** &gt; **Calculated metric definitions**.
2.  Open the metric definition for which you want to build a formula and select **Build formula** &gt; **Formula builder**.

3.  In the formula text field, type \\ to start building your formula.

4.  To build the formula either at the metric definition level or the entity level, perform the following steps.

    1.  To build a formula at the metric definition level, select two metric definitions or metrics, and an operator between them.

        For example, you can select GHG emissions from employee commuting + Data Center emissions \(market-based\) to calculate a sum.

    2.  To build a formula at the entity level, select two metric definitions or emission factors, and an operator between them.

5.  To copy, reset, or preview the formula, do the following.

    1.  To copy the formula, select **Copy**.

    2.  To reset the formula to its initial state, select **Reset**.

    3.  To view the formula without any identifiers in a neat format, select **Preview**.

6.  To save the formula, select **Save formula**.

7.  To execute the formula, select **Execute**.

    It’s important to save the formula before you execute it.

8.  On the formula builder page, select **Need help?** to receive guidance on the necessary steps to build the formula.
