sn\_esg.metric\_approval

</td><td>

Enables ESG administrators to define either the simple approval flow or the advanced approval flow for all the metrics and metric definitions. **Note:** This property is available only when the sn\_grc\_appr plugin is activated and must be set while configuring the Operational Sustainability Management application.

 The choices are as follows:-   **Simple**: By choosing this option, the Approval section will be enabled both on the manual metric definition form and within the metrics. Using this section, you can designate approvers directly on the metric definition form.
-   **Advanced**: When you choose this option, the Approval section will be unavailable on the manual metric definition form and the metric form. Instead, approval can be configured by setting the approval conditions, tables, and approvers in the GRC: Approver Configurator application. This application also allows you to define multiple levels of approvals. For more information see, [Using Approver Configurator for setting up approvals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/approval-configuration.md).

</table>## Scheduled jobs

The following scheduled jobs are installed with the Operational Sustainability Management application.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Generate ESG goals summary|This job executes daily at 12 AM. This job clears all existing goals summary and creates new goal summaries for all active goals classified as "environmental,social,governance".|
|Generate ESG disclosure summary|This job is executes daily once at 12AM. This job deletes existing summary and creates disclosure summary for all types of disclosure like goals,citations,metrics.|
|Calculate ESG license count|This Job executes daily at 11:00 PM. It calculates the license based on active data in base metric definition where domain area is ESG.|
|Generate ESG goals activity summary|This job executes periodically for every 12 hours. This job deletes the existing goal activity summary and creates new goal activity summary for all goals classified on "environmental, social, governance".|
