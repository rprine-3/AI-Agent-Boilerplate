# Copy a threshold

You can copy existing thresholds to create similar threshold configurations for the same metric or metric definition.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esg.admin, sn\_esg.program\_manager, or sn\_esg.metrics\_manager

## About this task

Copying a threshold duplicates all threshold parameters including type, color, valid dates, conditions, and actions.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Workspace** &gt; **Metrics**.

2.  Open the metric that contains the threshold you want to copy.

3.  Select **Copy**.

    Review the pre-filled threshold information in the Metric Threshold form and modify the threshold fields as needed. For example, you can change the name, color, valid dates, or actions.

4.  Select **Save**.

    -   The system validates the copied threshold configuration. If any validation errors occur \(such as duplicate colors\), you must resolve them before saving.
    -   Copied thresholds are created as inactive by default. To activate the copied threshold, select the Active checkbox before saving.

## Result

A new threshold is created for the metric with the configuration from the original threshold. You can now modify either threshold independently.
