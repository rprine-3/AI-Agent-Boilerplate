# View the calculation breakdown in a formula tree

View a structured and visual representation of the entire calculation chain.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esg.admin, sn\_esg.metric\_manager, sn\_esg.program\_manager, sn\_esg.reporting\_disclosure\_manager

sn\_risk.user \(for Risk users\).

## About this task

A formula tree provides transparency by displaying the detailed breakdown of how values are calculated, including all the operands and operations. This is especially helpful for auditing data and debugging.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to one of the following locations depending on which application you're using.

    -   **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Workspace** &gt; **Metrics** &gt; **Calculated metric definitions**.
    -   **All** &gt; **Risk Management** &gt; **Risk Workspace** &gt; **Metrics** &gt; **Calculated metric definitions**.
2.  Open the metric definition for which you want to view formula tree data for and select **Calculated Metric Data**.

3.  Select the calculated metric data record that you want and then select **Show formula tree**.

    You can view a visual representation of the entire calculation chain. The formula, associated metric definitions, sub formulas, functions, and so on, are shown.

    **Note:** If you’re seeing an empty page, it's because the formula tree or formula operands are currently empty and are being updated asynchronously. If you’re seeing an error page, it's due to errors in the formula operands that must be corrected.
