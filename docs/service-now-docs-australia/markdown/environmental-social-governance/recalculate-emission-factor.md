# Recalculate emission factor

When an emission factor value is updated, you can recalculate the emission factor to initiate the system to automatically recalculate the data for all linked calculated metric definitions \(CMD\), using the new value for dates within the emission factor's validity period. This ensures that metrics data remains consistent and accurate, reflecting the latest changes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_esg.program\_manager, sn\_esg.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Workspace** &gt; **Lists** &gt; **Emission Factor Library** &gt; **Factor**.

2.  Open the emission factor that is updated and for which you want to recalculate the data.

3.  Select **Recalculate**.

    -   CMDs are automatically re-executed every 24 hours, updating emission factor values for all linked definitions.
    -   For immediate updates, you can manually execute a CMD by opening it and execute it.
