# Create related list groupings

Simplify the groupings of related lists on a record page and customize them to your specific needs, assigning meaningful names in the process. This configuration enhances readability and user experience when interacting with the forms.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or sn\_grc\_workspace.record\_view\_admin

## About this task

On a form there can be numerous related lists that can occasionally result in a cluttered view. To streamline the display, you have the option to select and configure the related lists you want to see on the form. By default, the ability to configure the related lists is given for the following tables:

-   Calculated metric definition table
-   Goal table
-   Manual and automated metric definition table

While you can select any table and configure the related lists for that table, as an example, this procedure describes how you can create groupings for the Goal configuration table. Apart from the related lists, you can also specify a UX page that you want to display under a group.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Record View Configurations**.

2.  Select **Operational Sustainability Workspace configuration**.

3.  In the Table configurations related list, select **Goal configuration**.

4.  In the Group configurations related list, select **New**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_bwh_s1s_zxb"><thead><tr><th>
