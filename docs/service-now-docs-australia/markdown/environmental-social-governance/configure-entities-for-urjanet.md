# Create an entity mapping for Urjanet

Create entity mappings for Urjanet because the Operational Sustainability Integration with Urjanet considers each Urjanet account meter as an entity.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you activate the sn\_esg\_urjanet plugin.

Role required: sn\_esg.admin

## About this task

Before starting with the integration, if you do not have entity mappings, you can create entity mappings so that the Urjanet account meter data can be mapped to an entity. The Operational Sustainability Integration with Urjanet considers the Urjanet account meters as entities. This procedure is optional.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Operational Sustainability Management** &gt; **Urjanet** &gt; **Entity Mapping**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

-   **Review required**: Use this option if the administrator must fill some fields in the entity record.

 This field is automatically set to **No review required**. You must change the state to **Reviewed** after you provide the information.
