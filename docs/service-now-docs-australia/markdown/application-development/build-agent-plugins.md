# Build Agent plugins

Plugins are required for Build Agent, and vary by version.

Build Agent is available in both ServiceNow Studio and the ServiceNow IDE.

**Note:** The trial app was formerly called "Build Agent" and has been renamed to "Build Agent \(Trial\)."

## Plugins for Build Agent \(Trial/Free\)

Build Agent is available as a trial app on a freemium model. To install Build Agent \(Trial\), visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://www.servicenow.com/products/vibe-coding.html#benefits).

The following plugins are required:

1.  `sn_glider`: the only required plugin for Build Agent in the Australia EA \(Australia patch 0\) version
2.  `sn_build_agent`: required for Australia starting with Patch 1

## Plugins for Build Agent \(Premium\)

If you exceed the free interaction limit, you must wait 30 days for a reset, or install the paid version of Build Agent.

1.  For Australia starting with Patch 1, the `sn_now_creator` plugin is required, which contains the `sn_build_agent_pro` plugin.
2.  For the Australia EA \(Australia patch 0\) version, you must manually update ServiceNow Studio and the Unified Developer Core \(UDC\) in the ServiceNow Store before installing ServiceNow Otto for Creator.
