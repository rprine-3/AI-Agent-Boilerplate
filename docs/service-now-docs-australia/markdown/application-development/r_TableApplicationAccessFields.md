Can read

</td><td>

Select the check box to allow script objects from other application scopes to read records stored in this table. This option offers runtime protection.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Can write

</td><td>

Select the check box to allow script objects from other application scopes to modify records stored in this table. This option offers runtime protection. For example, a script in another application can modify a field value on this table. This option is available only when the **Can read** check box is selected.

 Clear the check box to prevent script objects from other application scopes from modifying data stored in this table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Can delete
