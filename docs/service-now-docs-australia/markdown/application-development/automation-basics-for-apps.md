# Automation basics for apps

Automation is central to ServiceNow application development and is a core strength of the ServiceNow AI Platform. Automation enables developers to build applications that reduce manual work, enforce consistency, and respond intelligently to business events.

## What is automation in ServiceNow?

Automation in ServiceNow executes business processes, tasks, and application logic without manual intervention. Automations can be triggered as a response to system events, user actions, or scheduled intervals.

The most effective ServiceNow applications use automation strategically, identifying repetitive tasks, bottlenecks, and manual processes that benefit most from automation. The goal is to create intelligent applications that handle routine work automatically while escalating complex issues to humans when needed, creating a balance between automation efficiency and human judgment.

## Benefits of automation

-   **Efficiency**: Automation eliminates repetitive manual tasks, allowing users to focus on higher-value work. What might take hours manually can happen in seconds automatically.
-   **Consistency**: Automated processes follow the same rules every time, reducing human error and ensuring conformance with policies and procedures.
-   **Scalability**: As your organization grows, automated applications can handle increased volume without proportionally increasing staff.
-   **Real-time response**: Automation can react instantly to events, triggering immediate actions like escalations, assignments, or remediation steps.
-   **Audit and Compliance**: Automated workflows create clear audit trails and ensure that required steps and approvals aren't skipped.

## Key automation capabilities in ServiceNow

|Automation|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|Business rules|Rules that execute automatically when records are queried, inserted, updated, or deleted. They can calculate field values, validate data, create related records, send notifications, or trigger integrations. For example, when an incident's priority changes to "Critical," a business rule might automatically assign it to a senior technician and notify management.|
|Workflows and Workflow Studio|Visual, no-code/low-code tools for building complex, multi-step automated processes. Workflows handle approvals, task assignments, parallel processing, and conditional logic. Workflow Studio offers a more intuitive interface and better integration capabilities. You might use flows to automate employee onboarding, handling everything from account creation to equipment ordering to training assignment.|
|Playbook|Interactive, step-by-step guides embedded directly into ServiceNow records \(like incidents, problems, change requests, or custom tables\). They present users with a sequence of activities, decisions, and tasks that adapt based on the record's context and the user's choices. Think of them as dynamic checklists that intelligently guide users through complex processes.|
|Scheduled jobs|Jobs that run automation on a recurring schedule rather than in response to record changes. Common uses include nightly data cleanup, regular report generation, SLA monitoring, or batch processing of records that meet certain criteria.|
|Event Management and notifications|Events can be triggered by various system activities, and notifications automatically alert users via email, SMS, or in-platform messages based on conditions you define. This keeps stakeholders informed without manual intervention.|
|UI policies and data policies|Automate the user experience by dynamically showing/hiding fields, making fields mandatory, or setting field values based on conditions. UI policies work on forms, while data policies enforce rules regardless of how data is entered.|
|Script includes and scheduled script executions|Reusable server-side JavaScript functions that can be called by other scripts, providing centralized business logic. These support modular, maintainable automation.|
|Integration Hub and Integration Hub actions|Automate connections between ServiceNow and external systems, enabling data synchronization, API calls, and cross-platform workflows without custom coding.|

## What happens to data input into an automation?

When data enters a ServiceNow automation, it is processed according to your defined business logic. The automation examines the data, transforms it as needed, and routes it to appropriate destinations—whether that's creating or updating records in ServiceNow tables, triggering notifications, or integrating with external systems via APIs.

Throughout this process, the automation orchestrates coordinated actions that move data efficiently through your workflows without manual intervention. It logs execution details and stores the processed data in a structured format, making it accessible for reporting and future use. Essentially, the automation acts as an intelligent engine that handles repetitive data processing and routing tasks, allowing your teams to focus on higher-value work while ensuring data flows correctly through your business processes.

Several things happen when an automation receives data.

1.  **Processing and transformation**: The automation evaluates and transforms the raw input data according to your business rules, applying validations, calculations, or formatting to make it usable.
2.  **Routing and decision making**: Based on the attributes of the data, attributes, the automation determines the correct path forward, directing it through conditional logic to ensure it follows the appropriate workflow branch.
3.  **Action execution**: The automation performs defined actions such as creating or updating records, sending notifications, triggering integrations, or executing scripts based on the processed data.
4.  **Storage and logging**: The data and automation results are stored in ServiceNow tables and execution logs are created, providing an audit trail and making the information available for reporting and future reference.

## Using AI to build automations

Many of the automation capabilities that ServiceNow offers can also be used with AI. These AI capabilities transform Workflow Data Fabric from a simple data integration layer into an intelligent automation engine that can understand, reason about, and act on enterprise data autonomously.
