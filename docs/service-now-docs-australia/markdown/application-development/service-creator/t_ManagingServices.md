# Manage a service

Using the Service Creator, department managers can request a new service category, designate editors and service fulfillers for that category, and create and publish services.

## Before you begin

Role required: none.

## About this task

Editors create and modify services. Service fulfillers complete the tasks generated from service requests.

A service category request involves assigning a service category manager, which is typically the department manager who makes the request. After the request is submitted, a catalog administrator approves the request to publish the service category. When the category is published, the service category manager can assign service category editors and service fulfillers, and create services to offer in the service catalog.

To request a new service category:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Service Catalog**.

2.  Select the **Departmental Services** category.

    The Departmental Services category is part of the demo data available with service creator. If this category does not exist, a catalog administrator must add the Service Category Request catalog item to an existing category.

3.  Select the **Service Category Request** item.

4.  Change the default values, as necessary \(see table\).

5.  Click **Submit**.
