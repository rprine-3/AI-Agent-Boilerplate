# Service Creator

Service creator enables a department to offer custom services through the service catalog, such as the HR department offering tuition reimbursement for further education.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Service Creator is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Build and edit apps in Creator Studio instead. For more information, see [Building apps with Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/building-apps-with-creator-studio.md).

Each published service has an associated record producer catalog item. Users designated as managers and editors create and design these catalog items. End users can request services by ordering the catalog item.

All services belong to a published service category, which has an associated application and modules. When a user orders the catalog item for a service, the ServiceNow system creates a new task record within the application for that service category. Users designated as service fulfillers for the department complete these tasks to fulfill the service request.
