# Installed with Service Creator

Several types of components are installed with Service Creator.

Demo data is available with Service Creator. The demo data provides the Departmental Services service catalog category.

Creating a new service category also creates [components for that service category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/service-creator/r_CompsCreatedWithNewSvcCategs.md).
