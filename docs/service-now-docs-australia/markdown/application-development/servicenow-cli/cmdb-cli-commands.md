# Commands installed with CMDB Application CLI and API

Commands and command groups available to the ServiceNow CLI when the app-cmdb-api-cli plugin is installed.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

To script critical operations which support automation across the enterprise, you can leverage APIs or run command line operations that the CMDB Application CLI and API store app provide instead of using the user interface. The CMDB Application CLI and API store app provides a robust framework which consolidates all the APIs that are related to application services and the command lines that let you access the interface to those APIs.

CMDB Application CLI and API commands enable the following tasks:

-   Registering and creating an application service and establishing upstream relationships
-   Getting details of a given application service and its upstream relationships
-   Connecting higher level constructs such as business applications and business service offerings
-   Populating an application service with a given population type
-   Changing the state of an application service

For the REST API solution, see [SG Services API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/sg_services-api.md).

## Convert Application Service

Converts a manual or empty type application service to a calculated application service. During conversion, the application service record moves into the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_calculated\] table with the newly assigned class.

Command group:

-   Parent group: service-graph
-   Child group: app-service

-   **Roles required**

    app\_service\_admin

    If using a service mapping related service, the user must have the required roles for that service mapping related service.

-   **Command structure for Mac OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service convert --data '{JSON}'
    ```

-   **Command structure for Windows OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service convert --data "{JSON}"
    ```

-   **Arguments**

    This command passes a JSON object using the **data** parameter.

    The following properties for identifying a CI take precedence as follows:

    1.  sys\_id – If sys\_id, the system only uses the sys\_id and ignores any additional values.
    2.  number – If provided without the sys\_id, the system only uses the number and ignores any additional values.
    3.  &lt;IRE field name&gt; – The system only uses these values if the sys\_id or number are not provided.

    ```

-   **Example on Windows OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service convert --data "{"name":"Test Register","environment":"Test","version":"1.0","levels":8}"
    ```

-   **Return value**

      "result": {
      "status": "success"
      }
    }
    ```


## Create Application Service Relationship

Constructs upstream relations such as business applications, business service offerings, and other application services. Running this command creates a relationship, taking input with a single parent and a corresponding child object.

Command group:

-   Parent group: service-graph

-   **Roles required**

    app\_service\_admin

    If using a service mapping related service, the user must have the required roles for that service mapping related service.

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service create-relationship --data '{JSON}'
    ```

-   **Command structure for Windows OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service create-relationship --data "{JSON}"
    ```

-   **Arguments**

    This command passes a JSON object using the **data** parameter.

    The following properties for identifying a CI take precedence as follows:

    1.  sys\_id – If sys\_id, the system only uses the sys\_id and ignores any additional values.
    2.  number – If provided without the sys\_id, the system only uses the number and ignores any additional values.
    3.  &lt;IRE field name&gt; – The system only uses these values if the sys\_id or number are not provided.

## Populate Application Service

Populates an application service with a service population method.

Command group:

-   Parent group: service-graph
-   Child group: app-service

-   **Roles required**

    app\_service\_admin

    If using a service mapping related service, the user must have the required roles for that service mapping related service.

-   **Command structure for Mac OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service populate --data '{JSON}'
    ```

-   **Command structure for Windows OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service populate --data "{JSON}"
    ```

-   **Arguments**

    This command passes a JSON object using the **data** parameter.

    The following properties for identifying a CI take precedence as follows:

    1.  sys\_id – If sys\_id, the system only uses the sys\_id and ignores any additional values.
    2.  number – If provided without the sys\_id, the system only uses the number and ignores any additional values.
    3.  &lt;IRE field name&gt; – The system only uses these values if the sys\_id or number are not provided.

## Register Application Service

Creates an application service, tags and constructs upstream relationships such as business applications, business service offerings, and other application services.

Command group:

-   Parent group: service-graph
-   Child group: app-service

-   **Roles required**

    app\_service\_admin

    If using a service mapping related service, the user must have the required roles for that service mapping related service.

-   **Command structure for Mac OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service register --data '{JSON}'
    ```

-   **Command structure for Windows OS**

    ```
    snc service-graph app-service register --data "{JSON}"
    ```

-   **Arguments**

    This command passes a JSON object using the **data** parameter.

    The following properties for identifying a CI take precedence as follows:

    1.  sys\_id – If sys\_id, the system only uses the sys\_id and ignores any additional values.
    2.  number – If provided without the sys\_id, the system only uses the number and ignores any additional values.
    3.  &lt;IRE field name&gt; – The system only uses these values if the sys\_id or number are not provided.
