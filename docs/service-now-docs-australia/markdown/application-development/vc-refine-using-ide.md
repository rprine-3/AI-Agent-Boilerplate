# Agentic development app refinement in the ServiceNow IDE

The ServiceNow IDE provides a VS Code, file-based editing experience with syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time installing to your instance. Use this approach to harden generated, scaffolded apps into production-grade solutions.

If you prefer to do local development with the ServiceNow SDK and a command line interface \(CLI\), the ServiceNow IDE also works with the ServiceNow SDK via Git for collaborative workflows, for example for offline iteration.

If you're an experienced ServiceNow developer who's familiar with agentic development, ServiceNow IDE is a suitable starting point for refining your app development.

For full documentation on using the ServiceNow IDE, see [ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/servicenow-ide-landing.md).

## Agentic development workflow in the ServiceNow IDE

To refine your app in the ServiceNow IDE, follow these steps:

1.  Create a workspace. Use Build Agent to create or edit application metadata. For more information, see [ServiceNow Otto for Creator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/now-assist-for-creator/now-assist-for-creator-landing.md).
2.  Create an app.
    -   Use Build Agent to create the app.
    -   You can choose to edit an existing app.
3.  Inspect the code in the File Explorer.
    -   Review business rules, script includes, and flow logic.
    -   Apply general guidelines for performance and security.
4.  Inspect the metadata objects and adjust the data model.
    -   Launch the ServiceNow IDE and load the app created by ServiceNow Otto or Build Agent.
    -   The ServiceNow IDE Metadata Explorer displays all generated metadata, including tables, scripts, forms, flows, UI components, and ACLs.
    -   Verify field types, choice lists, default values, and relationships.
    -   Confirm indexes and unique keys are set appropriately for your use case.
5.  Refine client-side behavior and user experience.
    -   Review client scripts, UI policies, and page layouts.
    -   Adjust data bindings, events, and conditional rendering for clarity and accessibility.
    -   If you need to make changes, use Build Agent.
6.  Validate security and roles.
    -   Review ACLs to confirm that the correct roles and conditions are applied.
    -   Tighten permissions and remove any overly permissive logic introduced during scaffolding.
7.  Use Build Agent to generate and run Automated Test Framework. For more information, see [Test what you built](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-testing.md).
8.  Move to local development with the ServiceNow SDK for deeper refactoring.
    -   Use the ServiceNow SDK command line interface \(CLI\) for build, deploy, and fetch operations, version control, and CI integration.
    -   Use the Source Control extension within the ServiceNow IDE to move changes between local versions and the ServiceNow IDE. For more information, see [Using source control in the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/using-source-control-servicenow-ide.md).

## General guidelines for the ServiceNow IDE

1.  Structure first, micro-optimize second: Lock down tables, relationships, and ACLs before polishing scripts.
2.  Use AI where it helps: Keep the Build Agent panel handy to draft snippets or explain legacy code, then review and harden the output manually in the ServiceNow IDE.
3.  Prefer declarative where possible: Reduce custom code by using platform configuration \(UI Policies, Flow Designer, conditions\) for maintainability.
4.  Automate validation early: Use Build Agent to create ATF tests for critical paths \(create/read/update/delete, role-based access, approvals\) before making broad changes.
5.  Version and promote safely: When you transition to packaging and deployment, align IDE work with update-set or pipeline practices so your changes can be promoted cleanly across environments.

## ServiceNow Fluent and agentic development

ServiceNow Fluent is a development framework and SDK for ServiceNow that connects traditional coding with agentic workflow automation.

With ServiceNow Fluent, you can:

-   Build complex workflows and applications using familiar code editors \(like VS Code or the ServiceNow IDE\)
-   Get real-time feedback, including TypeScript type checking and code validation
-   Use descriptive, declarative language to define ServiceNow application metadata
-   Seamlessly connect to ServiceNow instances for instant deployment and testing
-   Use your Git provider of choice as the authoritative source of truth for your code

ServiceNow Fluent works with agentic development and Build Agent. You can generate an app or flow using conversational prompts, then refine, extend, and harden it using the ServiceNow Fluent code-centric tools. Both pro-code and low-code developers can collaborate and iterate, using the strengths of agentic and modern development.

**Important:** Build Agent only creates metadata supported by ServiceNow® Fluent. For more information, see [ServiceNow Fluent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-fluent.md). For the latest API reference, see [https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/](https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/)

## When to choose the ServiceNow IDE or ServiceNow Studio

1.  ServiceNow IDE: Best for file‑centric, code‑heavy edits, rapid iteration, and pairing with the ServiceNow SDK for local dev/CI. Suitable for developers familiar with the ServiceNow AI Platform.
2.  ServiceNow Studio: Best for metadata‑centric review \(tables, ACLs, roles\) and cross‑scope editing with a visual overview of app artifacts; keeps Now Assist in‑context for conversational adjustments. Suitable for developers with various levels of experience on the ServiceNow AI Platform.
