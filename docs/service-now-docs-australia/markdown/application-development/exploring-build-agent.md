# Exploring Build Agent

Build Agent enables developers to create, edit, and deploy full-stack ServiceNow® applications to update sets that encompass both user interface and back-end components.

As of Australia Patch 5, ServiceNow Otto is the new AI experience brand. This change is reflected in the name of ServiceNow products, including Build Agent. Your product entitlements remain unchanged. Check your entitlements to determine your access to specific features.

## Build Agent overview

Build Agent is an AI tool designed for developers within ServiceNow Studio and the ServiceNow Integrated Development Environment \(ServiceNow IDE\). Build Agent acts as an autonomous AI agent capable of independently generating a complete ServiceNow® scoped or global application. For example, a global scope app that uses tables such as incident, problem, and change.

## Migrating to Build Agent from App Engine Studio

If you currently build applications in App Engine Studio \(AES\), you can migrate to Build Agent when your development needs grow beyond what AES supports. For example, when you need custom scripting, global scope applications, or the ability to modify base system applications. Existing app artifacts like tables, flows, workspaces, and ACLs are already accessible in ServiceNow Studio, so migration is primarily a workflow adjustment rather than a conversion process. For more information, see [Migrating to Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-migrating-to-build-agent.md).

## Conversational interface

Using the chat panel within ServiceNow Studio or the ServiceNow IDE, you can interact with Build Agent through an easy-to-use multi-turn conversation interface. You can also ask it general questions about developing on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

All you have to do is describe an application in natural language, and the agent can then automatically create it. Build Agent generates the necessary code, organizes files clearly, and manages both the core logic and user interface components of the application.

Build Agent can understand natural language prompts, autonomously generate full-stack applications, oversee the entire build process, respond to feedback, deploy applications to update sets, and more.

Build Agent is enabled by default to create apps with AI, for example in ServiceNow Studio. To use other ServiceNow Otto products, such as the app generation skill, disable Build Agent. For example, using the setting in your ServiceNow Studio preferences. For more information, see [Use the app generation skill to generate apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/sns-app-gen-use-app-gen-skill.md).

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## Where to use Build Agent

You can use Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio, including the ServiceNow IDE. For detailed instructions on using Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio, see [Accessing Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/access-build-agent.md) and [Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/build-agent-in-servicenow-studio.md).

You can also use Build Agent in Developer Sandboxes, which provides a controlled baseline configuration for isolated, parallel development. For more information, see [Exploring Developer Sandboxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/exploring-sandboxes.md).

## Providing context with file uploads

You can upload supported file types, such as images, code, and documents, to provide more context about application design and functionality. For more information, see [Supported file types for Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ba-supported-file-types.md).

## Extended capabilities

While creating and updating applications is the primary use case for Build Agent, its capabilities extend beyond that. It can perform various code-related tasks, such as rewriting tables, explaining code, validating and enhancing existing applications, fixing application errors, and more. For instance, Build Agent can use the Run Query tool to query a specific table within your instance and return the top five records or derive specific insights.

To use Build Agent as part of an end-to-end development practice that includes Git, the ServiceNow SDK, ReleaseOps, and CI/CD pipelines, see the [SDLC on ServiceNow guide](https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/guides/sdlc-guide) in the ServiceNow SDK documentation.

## Playbook Designer support

You can use Build Agent to author Playbook Designer artifacts. As of Australia Patch 6, including runtime permissions, activity definitions, and Agentic activity field configuration. Playbook records are consolidated into a single XML update set file for consistent deployment across instances. For more information, see [Exploring Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md).

## ServiceNow Fluent and modern web frameworks

Build Agent generates code in ServiceNow Fluent, the domain-specific language for developing on the ServiceNow AI Platform. Build Agent can also incorporate modern web frameworks, such as React, when building custom user experiences.

**Important:** Build Agent only creates metadata supported by ServiceNow® Fluent. For more information, see [ServiceNow Fluent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-fluent.md). For the latest API reference, see [https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/](https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/)

## Build Agent \(Trial\) app overview

Build Agent is available as a trial app on a freemium model. To install Build Agent \(Trial\), visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://www.servicenow.com/products/vibe-coding.html#benefits).

After you install the Build Agent \(Trial\) app, your instance receives 100 free user interactions for 30 days at no additional charge. The free interactions enable you to explore Build Agent features at no additional cost.

If you exceed the free interaction limit, you must wait 30 days for a reset, or install the paid version of Build Agent.

## Automatic upgrades

Qualifying instances receive automatic upgrades when a new version of Build Agent is published to the ServiceNow Store. For more information, see [Install Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/install-build-agent.md).

## Localization and Build Agent

Build Agent incorporates the ServiceNow AI Platform localization, so you can use it in any supported language. For more information, see [Localization Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/localization-framework-landing.md).

## How prompts are counted

Prompts are counted each time you submit a message to Build Agent. If Build Agent asks a clarifying question and you respond, that response counts as a prompt. Approving a plan that Build Agent presents does not count as a prompt. To get the most value from each prompt, draft your message in a text editor before you submit it.

For more information on prompting, see [Example prompts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-example-prompts.md).

## What apps are in ServiceNow

A ServiceNow app is a package that performs a specific task for a specified group of users. Think of an app as a container with a set of rules around who can access and edit it. For example, ServiceNow apps can include an API, a table, a workspace, a form, a flow, or any combination of those things.

## Enhance applications with agentic experiences

You can enhance your applications with agentic experiences by using Build Agent.

Build Agent enables you to create agentic workflows, agents, and skills for your custom applications. Additionally, Build Agent recommends in-app agents tailored to specific use cases.

For more information, see [Create agentic workflows, agents, and skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/create-custom-ai-agent.md).
