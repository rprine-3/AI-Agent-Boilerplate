# Example denying all runtime access to a table

You can prevent script API and web service calls from other application scopes.

Typically, this is to prevent any other application from creating or modifying data in the table. Denying access requires setting the following value in the table record.

|Field|Value|
|-----|-----|
|**Accessible from**|This application scope only|
|**Can read**|Disabled|
|**Can create**|Disabled|
|**Can update**|Disabled|
|**Can delete**|Disabled|
|**Allow access to this table via web services**|Disabled|
