# Update a master data record

Submit an update request for an existing master data record.

## Before you begin

-   Requestor access to the domain is required.
-   The record must already exist in the system, either approved from an earlier create request or preloaded from your ERP system.
-   Only records that have been approved are available for update.

Role required: An MDM Orchestrator requestor role. \(For more information, see [Roles used in App Engine ERP Rapid Deployment Packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/aes-erp-rdp-components-installed.md).\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MDM Orchestrator** &gt; **MDM Requestor Portal**.

2.  Select **+ Create New Request**.

3.  If you have access to more than one domain, select a domain.

    The domains available depend on your role. You may not see all of these domains. If you only have access to one domain, go to the next step.

    -   **Customer**

        Customer accounts for sales.

    -   **Business Partner**

        Supplier, vendor, or partner organizations.

    -   **Material**

        Inventory items, SKUs, or products.

    -   **Cost Center**

        Financial cost-allocation entities.

    -   **Location**

        Physical or geographic sites.

    -   **Bill of Materials**

        Product component hierarchies.

4.  Select **Update Record**.

5.  Select **Proceed**.

6.  Search for the record to change.

    Use the lookup interface to search by a record parameter, such as customer name, copy code, or distribution status.

7.  Find the record to edit and in the **Action** column select **Update**.

8.  Modify the record information.

    The system tracks each change so that approvers see the old and new values.

9.  When finished, select **Submit request**.


## Result

The request flows through the enrichment, governance, and approval stages.
