# Attach an update set to an existing deployment request

If you want to attach multiple update sets to a deployment request, you can attach an update set to an existing deployment request on the **Deploy an update set** form.

## Before you begin

Role required: developer or release\_admin

## Procedure

1.  On the **Deploy an update set** form, select the **Deployment request** field, then select the deployment request that you want to attach the changes to from the list.

    **Note:** You can only select deployment requests that are in the draft state.

2.  Select **Submit** to create your deployment request.

    Your update set is attached to the existing deployment request. You can make additional changes to the deployment request as needed, such as adding additional update sets to the request.

3.  When you're ready to submit your deployment request through the pipeline, select the **Ready to assess** button.

    **Warning:** When you select **Ready to assess**, assessment of the deployment request begins immediately, and making additional changes to the deployment request isn't recommended. Only select **Ready to assess** when you're ready to deploy your changes to the pipeline.

    When you have selected **Ready to assess**, ReleaseOps automatically begins assessing your deployment request. You can see how the assessment is running and any issues that the assessment encountered in the **Activity** section of the deployment request form. Once your deployment request has passed the assessment checks, your deployment request will be moved into the pipeline that your organization has configured.
