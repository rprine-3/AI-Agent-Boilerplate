# Create a release

Specify the details for your release, including the target instance that the changes will be deployed to and when the release should occur.

## Before you begin

Role required: release\_admin

## Procedure

1.  On your production instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **ReleaseOps** &gt; **Releases**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the new release form, select the **Destination environment** field, then select your target destination instance from the list.

    Typically, the target destination instance is your production instance. However, some organizations might have different target destination instances, depending on their pipeline. For more information about the pipeline environments, see [Pipelines in ReleaseOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/releaseops/releaseops-pipeline-environments.md).

4.  Select the **Pipeline** field, then select the pipeline that you want the release to use.

5.  Enter a short description for the release in the **Short description** field.

6.  Enter a description for the release in the **Description** field.

7.  Set a freeze date for the release.

    A freeze date is the date by which all changes for the release must be submitted via deployment requests and ready for deployment. Any changes that aren’t ready for deployment are deferred at the time of the freeze date.

    1.  Select the Select freeze date and time icon \[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-calendar-days.png"\] Alt text:.

    2.  Select the Previous month icon \[Omitted image "releaseops-previous-month-icon.png"\] or Next month icon \[Omitted image "releaseops-next-month-icon.png"\] to locate the month and year for your intended freeze date.

    3.  Select your freeze date by selecting the date.

        \[Omitted image "releaseops-select-freeze-date.png"\] Alt text: Select the Select freeze date and time icon and choose your freeze date from the calendar pop-up to set your freeze date.

    4.  Set the time for the freeze date by entering a time in the **Time** fields.

    5.  Select the Enter icon \[Omitted image "releaseops-save-enter-icon.png"\] Alt text:.

8.  Set a release date for the release.

    A release date is the date by which the changes that apply to the release are deployed to the target destination instance, typically the production instance.

    **Note:** If your release is associated with a change request, the **Release date** field is automatically populated by the scheduled date in the change request.

    1.  Select the Select release date and time icon \[Omitted image "inline-data-vis-96px-calendar-days.png"\] Alt text:.

    2.  Select the Previous month icon \[Omitted image "releaseops-previous-month-icon.png"\] or Next month icon \[Omitted image "releaseops-next-month-icon.png"\] to locate the month and year for your intended release date.

    3.  Select the date for your release date by selecting the date.

    4.  Set the time for the release date by entering a time in the **Time** fields.
