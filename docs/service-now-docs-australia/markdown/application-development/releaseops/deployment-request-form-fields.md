Create a deployment request for the update sets to be deployed to target instances.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Release

</td><td>

The release that the deployment request is associated with. A deployment request can only be attached to one release. **Note:** Deployment requests are deferred if they aren't in the Ready for Deployment state at the freeze date. If the deployment request is deferred, a new release must be associated with the deployment request to reset its state back to Draft and successfully deploy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

The state of the deployment request, which is changed throughout the release process. See [Deployment request states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/releaseops/deployment-request-states.md).

On demand

</td><td>

Indicates if the deployment request should be released on demand, instead of scheduled.When On demand is selected, ReleaseOps creates a dedicated release that can only have this one deployment request attached.

An optional association with a configuration item can be selected. This association doesn’t impact the behavior of ReleaseOps.
