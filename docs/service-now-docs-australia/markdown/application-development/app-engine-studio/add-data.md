# Create a data model for your application

Create a data model in App Engine Studio \(AES\) for your application by creating the tables that will house your application data. Create data tables that will be used in your application by creating the table from scratch, uploading a spreadsheetor PDF, or by using an existing table as a template. You can also create and schedule data imports by mapping a spreadsheet to an existing table in your application.

Creating a data model and populating data into user interfaces are crucial starting points for any new application. Users may provide data, such as their name and phone number, when they fill in a form, and other users may refer to data as they fulfill a request.

In App Engine Studio, application data is stored in table format. When users update application data, they create a row or change an existing row in the table \(each row is also known as a data record\). You can create tables from existing ServiceNow AI Platform tables, from a spreadsheetor PDF, or customize a completely new table for your application to store records in.

The data records stored in your application may come from several sources. One table might store data records entered by users who are using your application, another might be populated via the import and mapping of data from a spreadsheet or through a script that updates data records with data from another ServiceNow AI Platform table.

## Application templates and data

Application templates automatically add data to your application. If you use a template to create your application, you can edit the tables that were added or add different tables.

## Forms

When you add data to your app, any associated form views display in the **Experience** section of your app. To edit the form, select it in the **Experience** section. Form views can be edited in the **Forms** tab of Table Builder. For more information, see [Forms in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/form-view-configuration.md).

## Table extension

There are several tables that your organization may already be using in other applications. For example, your organization may be using the Configuration item \[cmdb\_ci\] table for an application that houses configuration data. You can create a table for your application by extending any of these existing tables.

Table extension allows a table to share fields and records with a parent table. You might extend a table if you expect users to fill in similar fields across different form views in an application. For example, to create a ticketing type of table, you might extend the Task \[task\] table. The Task table includes fields that are standard for most work tickets, such as **Number** and **Assigned to**.

Many organizations create extensible standardized tables for their citizen developers to use when designing their apps. This enables the developers to standardize the way data is utilized across multiple applications within the organization.

To make a table in your application extensible, select **Make extensible** during table creation. After extending an existing table, you can further customize the new table by adding more columns.

The following table provides a list of commonly extended tables in the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information on commonly extended tables and models for extension, see [Table extension and classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-extension-and-classes.md).
