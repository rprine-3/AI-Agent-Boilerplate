# Build a new role for your application

Create a custom role for your application in App Engine Studio \(AES\).

**Note:** If you are an admin, be sure to elevate your role.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  In your application, next to Security, select the add icon \(\[Omitted image "plus-icon.png"\] Alt text: Add icon\).

5.  Enter a name and description for your role, and then select **Continue**.

    **Tip:** For consistency with existing role names, enter a role name that is all lower-case and uses underscores instead of spaces. For example, for an office art requester role, you would enter `office_art_requester`.

6.  For each table in your application, select one or more access controls for your role.

    -   **Create**

        Users with the role can create new records on the data table.

    -   **Read**

        Users with the role can read the data that is stored in the table.

    -   **Write**

        Users with the role can update existing records in the table.

    -   **Delete**

        Users with the role can delete table records.

7.  Select the **Experience** tab, and then select the experiences that users with the role can access.

8.  Select **Continue**, and then select **Done** on the summary screen.
