# Add a record producer

A record producer enables users to create task-based records, such as an incident record, in apps you create in App Engine Studio \(AES\) without creating a request. It enables a better end-user experience by standardizing requests using a simplified form.

## Before you begin

Create a data table that the record producer will add a new record to when a user fills out the form. For more information, [Create a data model for your application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/add-data.md).

Role required: sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user or delegated\_developer. For more information, see [Delegate developers using AES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-app-dev-workflow.md).

## About this task

A record producer is a simplified type of catalog item that displays a form for users to fill out. The completed and submitted form inserts a new data record in a selected custom target table that you set up. This type of catalog item enables users to create task-based records, such as an incident record \(without any of the more complex functionality that comes with using a standard catalog item, such as creating requests\). Use a record producer when you want the service catalog form to create a simplified type of record that isn't a request \(for example, a task record such as an incident, change, or enhancement, etc.\). When you add a record producer, you create a basic version of the record producer. You must then continue editing it in Catalog Builder before it's ready to deploy.

**Note:** If you created an application using a template, a record producer may already be added to your application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  In your application, next to Experience, select **Add**.

4.  Select **Record Producer** and select **Begin**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name for the record producer.|
    |Short description|Brief overview of the record producer.|

6.  Select **Edit record producer**.

7.  In Catalog Builder, specify the required information.

    After completing each step, select **Save**.

Questions for the record producer.From the **Insert new question** list, you can include additional question sets, questions, deactivated questions, single-column container, two-column container, and line break. For information on creating a question and supported question types, see [Create a question for a catalog item in Catalog Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/create-question-cat-builder.md).

 You can also add dynamic form behavior for a question. For information on adding dynamic form behavior, see [Edit a question in Catalog Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/edit-question-cat-builder.md).

 **Note:**

-   The questions within a question set can't be edited. The question sets can be reordered by dragging and dropping them.
-   Question sets specified in the template can't be removed, while the ones added by the user can be removed.
-   Removal of question sets simply removes the association with the item and doesn't delete the question set.
-   A single-column question set can be added to a single-column or a two-column container. A two-column question set can't be added to a container.
