A document approval app enables your users to quickly create and use document approval workflows. Document owners and submitters can upload documents needing approvals and check the progress on those approvals. Designated approvers can approve, reject, or return documents with comments.

Admins can use the document approval application to create different workflows for different document types.

This app template is an ideal way to quickly and efficiently make your internal workflows for processing documents. Document owners and submitters can upload a document needing approval to a portal using simple upload functionality that automatically sends submissions through a unique workflow. Once a document has been received, submitters follow the progress of their documents while designated users approve, reject, or return their document for edits. Both submitters and approvers use comments to add notes and feedback to the submission, which is stored in the system for future reference. To give this app even more variety, admins can create unlimited workflows that are customized for each document type and user that allows for multiple stages and approvers depending on what the document category requires.
