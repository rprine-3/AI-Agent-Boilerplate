# Collaborate with other developers

In App Engine Studio \(AES\), you can add or remove users and groups to be collaborators on an application.

Users have varying levels of permissions for actions on the Collaboration feature. At a high level:

<table id="table_lyw_dms_5qb"><thead><tr><th>

Users with these permissions

</th><th>

Can perform these actions

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Manage Collaborators delegated development permission to the application

</td><td>

Can:

-   See a list of collaborators and their descriptors
-   Search for users or groups
-   Select or change the collaboration descriptor for a user or group \(but users can't change customized users or groups\)
-   Add collaborators by sending invitations
-   Remove users or groups \(but users can't remove customized users or groups\)

 Can't:

-   Customize permissions for a user or group
-   Deploy via update sets

-   Remove users or groups
-   Customize permissions for a user or group

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Administrators

</td><td>

Admins must elevate to a security\_admin role to work with collaboration features. For more information, see [Elevated privilege roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_ElevatedPrivilege.md).

Administrators can:

-   See a list of collaborators and their descriptors
-   Show/hide members of a group
-   Search for users or groups
-   Select or change the collaboration descriptor for a user or group \(includes changing customized users or groups and changing the owner\)
-   Add collaborators by sending invitations
-   Remove users or groups \(includes removing customized users and groups and removing the owner even if there is only one owner\)
-   Customize permissions for a user or group

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:** You should create collaboration descriptors in addition to Owner and Editor in the global scope. If you want collaboration descriptors to appear and be used in AES, you should also set them to `standard = TRUE`. AES doesn't support collaboration descriptors that are created in custom scopes, and non-standard collaboration descriptors don't render in AES.

When you add a user or group, a collaboration task is generated and an approval flow kicks off. To find all collaboration tasks, navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **Collaboration** &gt; **Collaboration Tasks**. The collaboration task provides information on which application a developer is being added to, and what permissions are granted. Approvers sometimes need to review these task records before they add developers to the application.

If you're an admin, you can modify the Collaboration Request flow. The base system Collaboration Request flow handles collaboration requests as follows:

-   If the user has AES or delegated developer permissions and isn't new to the platform, the collaboration request approval record is auto-approved.
-   If the user does not have AES or delegated developer permissions and is new to the platform, approval is required.

If you're an admin, you can modify the collaboration descriptors that developers use to assign delegated development permissions. The base table provides Owner and Editor collaboration descriptors. By default, Owners have the manage collaborator delegated development permission set, and Editors have the invite collaborator delegated development permission set.

**Note:** If you’re using source control to collaborate with other developers, only changes that have been checked in are available to other developers. For example, if an admin creates a new flow for an app that’s linked to Git, the new flow won’t be available in the app for other AES users until the admin checks the flow into Git.

## Add a user or group to collaboration

Give users or groups permission to collaborate with other developers in App Engine Studio \(AES\) using the Collaboration feature.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin, manage collaborator delegated development role, or invite collaborator delegated development role

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  Select the Manage collaborators \[Omitted image "aes-manage-collaborators-purple.png"\] Alt text: Manage Collaborators button button.

    \[Omitted image "aes-add-collaborator-purple.png"\] Alt text: Add collaborators in App Engine Studio

4.  To add another user or group as a collaborator, enter the user name or group name in the **Invite people by name or group** field.

5.  Search for a specific user or group by entering the first few characters of the name.

    A drop-down list with matching user names and groups appears where you can select the user or group you want to add. If a user or group appears in the drop-down list but you can't select it, it's already been added as a collaborator and can't be re-selected.

6.  Select the collaboration descriptor for the user or group that you're adding.

    For a list of collaboration permissions, see [Delegated development and collaboration permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-collaboration-feature-overview.md).

    **Note:** Users with Invite Collaborators permissions can't do this, and will default to the Editor option.

    Only App Collaboration Descriptors that are defined in the global scope and have the standard option selected appear in the list.

7.  Select **Send**.

    -   If the user has AES or delegated developer permissions and is new to the platform, the user is listed under the pending requests section and approval is required. After the request is approved, both the requester and the user receive an email indicating that the user has been added to the application. \[Omitted image "aes-approval-email-purple.png"\] Alt text: Collaboration approval email example
    -   If the user has AES or delegated developer permissions and is not new to the platform, the collaboration request is auto-approved. Both the requester and the user receive an email indicating that the user has been added to the application.
    **Note:** If a valid controller has been configured on the instance from which the collaboration request originated, a collaboration request task is created on the controller instance. If the originating instance isn't configured on the controller, work notes are automatically added to the request record indicating that the instance must be configured before approval is granted. If the originating instance is the controller or a valid controller has not been configured, the collaboration request task is created on the requesting instance. For more information, see [Configure your controller instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/config-controller-instance.md).


## Change collaborator permissions

Change the permissions that are assigned to a collaborator or create a custom collaboration permission to enable what people can do in App Engine Studio \(AES\).

### Before you begin

Role required: admin or manage collaborator delegated development role

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  Select the Manage collaborators \[Omitted image "aes-manage-collaborators-purple.png"\] Alt text: Manage Collaborators button button.

4.  For the user or group you want to change, select a different collaborator descriptor from the drop-down list.\[Omitted image "aes-collaborator-set-permissions-purple.png"\] Alt text: Select a new collaboration descriptor for this user

    Customized users and groups are not editable by non-admins.

5.  Admin only: Create custom collaboration permissions for specific users in an application.

    1.  In AES, select **Customize Permissions** from the drop-down list across from the user's name.

    2.  Select or clear delegated development permissions for the user or group.

        For a list of collaboration permissions, see [Delegated development and collaboration permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-collaboration-feature-overview.md).

    If the selection matches that of another standard Collaboration descriptor, the system will provide a prompt before proceeding. For details on each delegated development permission, see [Delegate development and deployment permissions to personnel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-and-deployment/t_AddADeveloper.md).

6.  Select **Save**.
