# Use a PDF to create data tables

Create tables from a PDF form using the PDF extractor tool in App Engine Studio.

**Note:** This feature is only available if your licensing entitles you to "exclusive low code capability" and you have Table Builder for App Engine installed. Contact your Solutions consultant for more information.

## Overview of creating tables from PDFs

The PDF extractor in App Engine Studio allows you to upload a PDF and then extract table fields for use in a custom app. This streamlines the process of building application data tables from pre-existing PDF forms because you no longer need to manually type in field labels.

**Note:** Ensure that you are mindful about recreating any tables that may already exist on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For example, with a PDF containing user demographic data, determine whether you want to reference existing user data tables rather than creating new tables from the PDF.

## General navigation

The following table contains a list of some of the other basic navigational elements within the PDF extractor tool.

### Before you begin

**Note:** This feature is only available if your licensing entitles you to "exclusive low code capability" and you have Table Builder for App Engine installed. Contact your Solutions consultant for more information.

Role required: admin, sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user, or delegated\_developer

### Procedure

1.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   Follow the steps outlined in the previous procedure to upload a PDF \(see [Create a table from a PDF form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/pdf-extractor.md)\).
    -   If you have already uploaded the PDF, select the **Open pdf extractor** element on the **Forms** or **Table** tab in Table Builder to launch the PDF extractor tool.
    The PDF form displays.

2.  Review the PDF.

    Use any of the navigational controls in the PDF pane to navigate to where you'd like to begin adding fields. See [General navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/pdf-extractor.md).

3.  Click **Select** to enter text selection mode.

4.  In the PDF, click on a field or text phrase to highlight it to use it as the basis for a new field.

    \[Omitted image "pdf-to-table-add-fields.png"\] Alt text: Add fields from PDF

5.  Edit the extracted text in the **Field Label** as needed for the new field you are going to add.

6.  Choose a **Field type**.

    Field type refers to the type of data that the new column will store. For example, to store plain text in the column, select **String**. To understand the basic field properties, see [Add and customize a field in a table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreatingNewFields.md).

    Depending on the type that you select, you may need to fill in additional fields to further define the table column. For example, with Reference field types, search for and select the appropriate data table to reference.

    1.  If you have chosen to create a choice field, perform the following actions to populate options for the choice field.

        1.  Choose a **Choice Type** from the menu. This controls whether or not the list will have None as an option.
        2.  Click in the **Choices** field, and then enter text manually or select text on the PDF to automatically extract it.
        3.  Click **Add** to add your choice to the list.
        \[Omitted image "pdf-add-choice-field.png"\] Alt text: Adding a choice field.

    2.  Repeat the previous steps until all choices have been added for your choice field.

7.  Select the **Table** where you want to add the new field.

    Multiple options may appear if you have added reference tables. The original table is selected by default.

8.  Select **Add field** to add the field to the list of fields in the table on the right.

    **Note:** Any fields you add to the table on the right remain highlighted in green in the PDF to remind you that you have created a related field from them. If you delete a field from the tables on the right, the extracted text will no longer be highlighted.

9.  Repeat the steps above until you have added all the fields you want to add from the PDF.

    **Note:** You can also add fields manually by clicking **+Add new field** in the table on the right and entering details directly similar to how you add fields on the **Table** tab of Table Builder.

10. Review the fields in your table and edit as necessary.

</table>11. Select **Save**.


### What to do next

To open your data table in Table Builder, select **Open data table and form** above the displayed tables. For more information on editing your data tables in Table Builder, see [Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/tb-landing-page.md).

To add a reference table, see [Add a reference table from a PDF form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/pdf-extractor.md).

## Add a reference table from a PDF form

Move fields into a new referenced data table using the PDF extractor in App Engine Studio.

### Before you begin

**Note:** This feature is only available if your licensing entitles you to "exclusive low code capability" and you have Table Builder for App Engine installed. Contact your Solutions consultant for more information.

Role required: admin, sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user, or delegated\_developer

### About this task

You may decide that you want to add some of the form information into separate tables that are referenced from the original table and can be referenced by other tables. For example, if you work for an insurance company, you may want to create separate data tables for bills, claims, and policies that can be referenced as separate data tables even though the information is extracted from a single PDF form.

You can add a reference field, and then create the corresponding reference data table directly from the PDF extractor in App Engine Studio.

**Note:** Before you create any new reference tables for your app, it's a good practice to verify that you are not accidentally recreating any tables that already exist on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

### Procedure

1.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   Follow the steps outlined in the previous procedure to upload a PDF \(see [Create a table from a PDF form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/pdf-extractor.md)\).
    -   If you have already uploaded the PDF, select the **Open pdf extractor** element on the **Forms** or **Table** tab in Table Builder to launch the PDF extractor tool.
    The PDF form displays.

2.  Select **Add reference table** in the right side panel to add a reference table to your table.

3.  Enter the following properties for your reference table.

    |Column header property|Description|
    |----------------------|-----------|
    |Table label|Unique label for the reference table.|
    |Table name|Database name for the reference table.|
    |Make extensible|Option to allow other tables to share data from this table. For more information on table extension, see [Table extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/add-data.md).|
    |Auto number|Option to track table records with a unique number. If you select this option, define the **Prefix**, **Starting number**, and **Number of digits**.|

    Next, you will add a reference field to the original table you are editing. This creates the connection between the tables \(e.g., "Seller info"\).

4.  Select the **Table label** of the table where you want to add your reference field in \(the original table is selected by default\).

    The original table should be selected by default in the **Table label** field.

5.  Enter a **Reference field label** for this new reference field \(e.g., "Seller information"\).

6.  Select fields from your original table to add them to your new reference table.

    These fields are related to the reference field you added to the current table.

    \[Omitted image "pdf-to-table-add-reference-table.png"\] Alt text: Add a reference table.

7.  Select **Add reference table**.

    The reference table appears below and contains the fields that you selected that were in the original table.

8.  Review and edit the fields and table properties as necessary.
