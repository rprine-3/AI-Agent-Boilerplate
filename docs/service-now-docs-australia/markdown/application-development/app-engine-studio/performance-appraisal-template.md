# Performance Review template

Build an application in App Engine Studio \(AES\) using the Performance Review template to automate scheduling, notifications, and feedback for performance reviews.

To use the Performance Review template, install this application from the ServiceNow Store.

\[Omitted image "template-performance-review.png"\] Alt text: Performance Review template

A performance review app automates the process of scheduling annual or quarterly reviews, reviewing employee performance, and providing manager feedback. The app displays report information by default and lets managers view, update, and request employee performance reviews.

Employees can complete their self-evaluation, monitor the status, and confirm evaluations via a web portal. The app will automatically notify employees and managers to submit their evaluations.

Managers can request an update to the self-evaluations, submit manager-evaluations, confirm evaluations, and monitor the status of their team's submissions via a portal.

The HR/admin role can select an annual, bi-annual, or quarterly review process schedule and edit both the self-evaluation and manager-evaluation templates. HR/admins can monitor the status of all evaluations by department, organization, or manager.

You can improve this template by incorporating the following features:

-   Add continuous option as a review process
-   Use Playbook to manage review schedules
-   Include HR review/escalation process for both self-reviews and manager reviews
-   Add peer reviews process
-   Add goal setting or objectives and key results \(OKRs\)
-   Add integration with HR software
-   Add skill set assessment metrics
-   Add performance improvement plan \(PIP\) process/individual development plans
-   Include compensation info/annual performance review \(APR\)
