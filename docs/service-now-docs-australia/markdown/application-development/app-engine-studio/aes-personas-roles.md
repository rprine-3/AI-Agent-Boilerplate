# Configure AES personas and roles

The responsibilities of your staff are controlled by roles assigned to each member. Personas aren’t explicitly part of App Engine Studio \(AES\) but administrators assign roles to give team members permission to configure or use AES.

-   **Low-code/citizen developer**

    Low-code/citizen developers are tech savvy and interested in creating apps. Though they might not have formal coding or app development training, citizen developers can submit ideas for new apps and, if approved, build them using AES.

-   **App Engine Studio admin**

    App Engine Studio admins manage all processes related to app development in AES. They review new app ideas, manage app development and deployment, and manage collaborators, usually in the App Engine Management Center.

-   **App template admin**

    The app template admin makes sure that the right people have access to appropriate predefined and custom templates for app development in App Engine Studio.

-   **App template author**

    The app template author creates and edits custom app templates in App Engine Studio and can share them with other users or groups.

-   **Security admin**

    The security admin creates and modifies roles and access control lists for apps. This role is set on the platform level, and it is required for making updates to roles in App Engine Studio.

-   **System administrator**

    The system administrator has access to all system features, functions, and data, regardless of security constraints. Grant this privilege carefully. If you have sensitive information, such as HR records, that you must protect, create a custom admin role for that area and train a person who is authorized to see those records to act as the administrator.

-   **Professional ServiceNow developer**

    Professional ServiceNow developers can work in App Engine Studio, usually as collaborators with citizen developers. Because of their coding knowledge and development background, though, they're more likely to build and customize apps on the ServiceNow AI Platform, using more complex building tools.

AES admin

</td><td>

sn\_app\_eng\_studio.admin

</td><td>

Granular admin role that provides access to App Engine Studio and enables administrative access to AES tables. Can be combined with other granular admin roles or delegated development for additional permissions. For more information about granular admin roles, see [Platform security granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platsec-granular-roles.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Collaboration request admin

</td><td>

sn\_collab\_request.collaboration\_request\_admin

Granular admin role that provides administrative access to collaboration tables.

</td></tr><tr><td>

AES Table Builder Wizard admin

</td><td>

sn\_table\_bldr\_wzd.table\_bldr\_wzd\_admin

</td><td>

Granular admin role that provides access to manage permissions during table creation in AES.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Important:** Granular admin roles cannot manage tables that depend on ServiceNow AI Platform tables, such as the Experience Visibility Control table \(sn\_udc\_experience\_visibility\_control\) or Preferred Tables \(sn\_preferred\_table\). To manage such tables, additional granular admin roles are necessary. For more information, see [Platform security granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/platsec-granular-roles.md).
