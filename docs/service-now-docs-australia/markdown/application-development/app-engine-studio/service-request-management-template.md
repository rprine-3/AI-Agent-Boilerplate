## Personas in the Service Request Management template

This template contains several important roles that correspond to individuals or groups who may use the app in some way. The following information describes how each persona may interact with the application you build. For more information on the permissions each role contains, see the Security section.

-   **Requester**

    You are a person who has a request.

    Problem: You need a service or a physical item to complete your responsibilities. You want to know that your request is in progress and reassurance that it is making progress. If you have questions or your request has changed, you want the ability to communicate that to those working on the request.

    App objective: Empower employees by guiding them through the process, including what information is required. Make the approval process transparent, and keep them updated on the status and outcome of their request.

-   **Fulfiller**

    You are a person or team who must complete a task in a timely manner.

    Problem: You only want to be assigned a task when it is ready to be fulfilled, meaning after required approvals or dependent tasks \(if relevant\) are closed. You need to ensure that requests are closed in a timely fashion, especially in adherence with SLAs.

    App objective: Direct the fulfiller's attention to the tasks assigned to them and their team. Empower them by providing the information they need such as request information and SLA.

-   **Fulfiller's manager**

    You are the manager of the fulfillment team, and you can fulfill tasks.

    Problem: You need to ensure tasks are being efficiently closed by your team. You want to spot bottlenecks such as popular service requests creating a backlog of tasks, a fulfiller who is under-performing, or late approvals blocking fulfillers from completing their tasks on time.

    App objective: Direct the fullfiller's manager to tasks that need immediate attention so SLAs are met. Clearly show what their team is working on so they can re-prioritize work as needed.

-   **Service owner**

    You are the owner of the services within the app.

    Problem: You need to analyze how services are performing and identify which services need attention. You need information that will help you recommend improvements to the process, if necessary.

    App objective: Provide aggregate information that indicates each service's performance, measured by resolution and response time.

-   **Approver**

    You are the gatekeeper and can respond to or reject requests, saving time for fulfillers.

    Problem: You must review requests before they are assigned to a fulfillment team to ensure the ticket is appropriate.

    App objective: Direct the approver's attention to the requests that require their approval. Empower them by providing the information they need such as request and SLA information.
