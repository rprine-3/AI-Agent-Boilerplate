# Identifying and fixing app template creation errors

Learn how to identify and fix your app when unsupported features or metadata stop the template creation process in App Engine Studio \(AES\).

## Unsupported features

Sometimes items in a source application from which you created a custom template aren’t supported in the template. You must remove unsupported items before you can create a template from the application.

When an error happens during the template creation process, an error message is displayed.

You can identify which elements of your application are causing it to fail the template creation process by selecting **View all errors**, which displays the Scan Failure \[sys\_app\_scan\_failure\] table. For more information about the errors in the table and their cause, see [Template creation errors in the Scan Failure table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/understanding-app-template-creation-errors.md).

## Template creation errors in the Scan Failure table

Errors that occurred during the creation of a custom template that are displayed in the Scan Failure \[sys\_app\_scan\_failure\] table and their cause.

### Error messages
