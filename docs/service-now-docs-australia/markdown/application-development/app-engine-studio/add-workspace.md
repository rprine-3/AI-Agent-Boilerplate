# Add a workspace

Create a workspace using Workspace Builder in App Engine Studio \(AES\). Workspaces provide agents, case managers, help desk professionals, and managers with tools to help answer customer questions and resolve customer problems.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user or delegated\_developer. For more information, see [Delegate developers using AES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-app-dev-workflow.md).

## About this task

Workspaces are primarily used for request and fulfillment processes, such as a service desk to manage tickets.

When you add a workspace you're creating a basic version of it, which you must then continue editing in Workspace Builder before it's ready to deploy. For more complex customizations, edit the workspace in UI Builder.

If you create a workspace from an App Engine Studio workspace experience template, you can edit the home page, lists, and record pages in Workspace Builder. However, if you create the workspace using an application template, you must edit some of its pages and objects in UI Builder.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  In your application, next to Experience, select **Add**.

4.  Select **Workspace**, and then select **Begin**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_wrp_z3h_14b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the workspace that appears to users. By default, the workspace shares the same name as your application.**Tip:** Use a name that uniquely identifies the workspace from other experiences. For example, `Office art requests workspace`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Description of the workspace.

</td></tr><tr><td>

URL

</td><td>

Unique web address of the workspace. By default, the workspace URL is based on the application name, but you can edit it.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Roles

</td><td>

User roles to limit who can access the workspace. -   You must specify at least one role to grant access to the workspace.
-   To use a custom role for your workspace, you must create one in **Security** first.
 For more information, see [Add application security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/add-security.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Select **Continue** to define data for your workspace.

7.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Primary Table|Data table that workspace users view or update.|
    |Secondary Tables|Additional data tables that workspace users view and update.|

    **Note:** You can select only tables with default views. You can select from two sections: Tables that are already available in your app, and all tables outside the app scope.

    Workspace Builder automatically generates a record page for the table you select.

8.  Select **Continue**, and then select Done.

    After you create the workspace in AES, you must edit it in Workspace Builder by adding or configuring components on each page.

9.  Next to the workspace you created, select the additional actions icon \(\[Omitted image "additional-actions-icon-purple.png"\] Alt text: Additional actions icon\) and then select **Edit**.

    You can also select the bar that lists the workspace in the Experience section of your app.

    \[Omitted image "wb-edit-worspace-experience-purple.png"\] Alt text: Select to edit a workspace

10. Edit your workspace home page in the In-line editor by selecting **Preview**.

    1.  On your workspace home page, select **Edit**.

        If you don't see **Edit**, you may not have the permissions needed to edit the workspace home page.

    2.  If the workspace is missing an Access Control List \(ACL\), enter the roles that should have access in the Add user roles to continue modal and select the **Add roles** button.

        For more information, see [Configure workspace settings in Workspace Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/workspace-builder/configure-workspace-settings.md) and [Access Control Lists \(ACLs\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/access-control-rules.md).

    3.  Adjust the home page elements and widgets by resizing, reorganizing, or reconfiguring them.

        Editing your workspace home page works similarly to editing a dashboard on your workspace. For more information, see [Edit Platform Analytics dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/edit-db-in-ac.md).

        **Note:** If the workspace was created before Tokyo, you must edit it in UI Builder. See [UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-overview.md) for more information.

        If you created the workspace that contains a technical dashboard, Workspace Builder prompts you to **Open in UI Builder** when you try to edit the workspace.

    4.  Select **Add new element** to add items to your workspace home page.

    5.  Select **Exit Editing Mode** to stop editing in the In-line editor.

11. Edit the workspace in Workspace Builder. For more information, see [Edit a workspace in Workspace Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/workspace-builder/configure-workspace-builder.md).

    You can also add more record pages to the workspace, if needed.

    **Note:** The default workspace record pages are read-only and can't be edited. To change the content of each record page, create a page variant and edit the variant.
