# Add a standard catalog item

Add a standard catalog item to your application in App Engine Studio \(AES\) so users can submit requests for services and offerings.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user or delegated\_developer. For more information, see [Delegate developers using AES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-app-dev-workflow.md).

## About this task

A standard catalog item displays a form that users can fill in to create requests, such as a form to request an item or service. Standard catalog items make use of the Request table and produce a request record. In addition, generated request items are linked with a workflow, a catalog task, and any related approvals. Using standard catalog items, users can add multiple items to a cart and generate a request for each requested item. Use a catalog item when you want the service catalog form to generate a request, complete with a workflow, approvals, tasks, etc. When you add a standard catalog item, you're creating a standard version of the catalog item, which you must then continue editing in Catalog Builder before it's ready to deploy.

**Note:** If you created an application using a template, a standard catalog item may already be added to your application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  In your application, next to Experience, select **Add**.

4.  Select **Standard catalog item** and select **Begin**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.
