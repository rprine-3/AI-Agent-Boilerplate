# Add a mobile experience

Add a mobile experience, or interface, to enable users to access your application from a ServiceNow native mobile app.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user or delegated\_developer. For more information, see [Delegate developers using AES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-app-dev-workflow.md).

## About this task

When you add a mobile experience, you're creating a basic version of the mobile app, which you must then continue editing in Mobile App Builder before it's ready to deploy.

Use Mobile App Builder to build and manage screens and records that make up workflows within the mobile apps that you build with AES. For example, you can add a webpage or a list that appears as a tab on a phone app.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  In your application, next to Experience, select **Add**.

4.  Select **Mobile experience**, and then select **Get started**.

5.  Select the kind of mobile experience that you want to add and select **Continue.**

    -   Mobile Agent
    -   Now Mobile
    For more information about the mobile experience options and important considerations when choosing a mobile experience, see [Design considerations for mobile apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-design-consideration.md).

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>9.  To add a list page to the mobile experience, do the following:

    1.  Select the table that will appear as a list on the screen.

        After you select a data table, some of its contents appear on the page.

    2.  To make the table conditional, select **Set conditions for this table** and define the conditions that must be met for the data to appear using the condition builder.

        For more information, see [Condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md).

    3.  Select **Continue**.

    4.  Specify attributes for the data extracted from the table and select **Continue**.

        |Screen label|Brief label to describe the list screen.|

10. To add a webpage to the mobile experience, do the following:

    1.  Specify the attributes for the table data and select **Continue**.

        |Field|Description|
