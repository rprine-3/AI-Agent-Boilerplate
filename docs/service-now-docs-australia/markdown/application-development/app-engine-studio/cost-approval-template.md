# Expense Pre-Approval template

Build an application in App Engine Studio \(AES\) using the Expense Pre-Approval template to create, track, and manage planned expenses in your organization.

To use the Expense Pre-Approval template, install this application from the ServiceNow Store.

Employees can easily submit their planned expenses for multiple levels of approval using the Expense Pre-Approval application. Managers can then review every submitted request. Approved requests are assigned to the budget review group, which can approve or reject the request. The employee receives a notification with the final status of the request.

To ensure compliance and improved financial planning, admins can customize the existing flow and levels of approval using decision tables. For more information, see [Exploring decision tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/decision-designer-overview.md).
