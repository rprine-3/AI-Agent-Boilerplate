# Choosing between record producers and catalog items

Both the record producer and standard catalog item in App Engine Studio \(AES\) create experiences where users can submit requests through a service portal. However, record producers are more extensible, and enable users to create a record in any table.

## Consider the level of customization

Record producers allow for more customization, making the most of the App Engine tools to build experiences from scratch.

Catalog items represent services or items a user can request. The catalog of all items is called the Service Catalog, and is part of Service Catalog Management.

## Comparison of record producers and standard catalog items

</td></tr><tr><td>

Development model

</td><td>

Process is as follows:1.  Set up a business-focused data model.
2.  Define the kind of experience your users will leverage.
3.  Define the automation or business logic.
4.  Define the user roles that will use the app.

</td><td>

Catalog items heavily rely on the request fulfillment process for fulfilling items defined in Service Catalog, a central, accurate, and consistent source of data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reporting

</td><td>

Easier to create dashboards with a purpose-built data model.

</td><td>

Requires creating database views and scripting to gather variables into other tables to configure specific reports.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Scalability

</td><td>

Business-focused app makes it easier to find resources and make app changes in a low-code environment.

</td><td>

Typically part of a Service Catalog Management operation with a dedicated team managing each catalog.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security
