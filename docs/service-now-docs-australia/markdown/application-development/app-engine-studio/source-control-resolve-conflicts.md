# Resolve conflicts

App developers can select the app file version to use when applying remote or stashed changes in App Engine Studio \(AES\).

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin
-   Link an application to source control
-   Apply a stashed change

## About this task

Conflicts occur when there are multiple change versions of the same application file: one set of changes in the remote or stashed version and another set of changes in the local version. App Engine Studio requires developers to resolve conflicts before applying remote or stashed changes.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  From the My Apps page, open your application.

3.  Pull from a repository or stash local changes.

    If the system identifies a conflict, it displays the Resolve Conflicts dialog.

4.  Select how to resolve the conflict.
