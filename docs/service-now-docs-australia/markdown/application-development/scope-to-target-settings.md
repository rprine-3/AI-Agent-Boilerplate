# Scope-to-target settings

Allow or deny access of all application resources in a source scope to a specific application resource \(business rule, table, script include, or event\) in a target scope.

This setting combination is a many-to-one relationship. For example, you can specify that all application resources in source Scope A can access a script include in target Scope B. \[Omitted image "Rcap-scope-to-target.png"\] Alt text: Restricted caller access scope to target setting
