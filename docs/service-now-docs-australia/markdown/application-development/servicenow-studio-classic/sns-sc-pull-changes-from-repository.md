**Discard local changes**

6.  Select **Pull from repository**.


## Result

The following operations occur:

-   The ServiceNow AI Platform fetches the most recent changes from the remote repository.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform applies the remote changes to the instance.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform identifies any change conflicts requiring resolution.

If there are conflicts, the system displays the **Resolve Conflicts** window.

Delta loading is enabled by default in sys\_properties so your data is not removed. Disable this feature if you want data automatically deleted.
