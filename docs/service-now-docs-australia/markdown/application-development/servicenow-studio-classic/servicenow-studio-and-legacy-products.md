# ServiceNow Studio and legacy products

If you previously used Guided Application Creator or the legacy Studio product to develop apps, use ServiceNow Studio to continue your app development. ServiceNow Studio replaces both products with a unified development environment on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Deprecated applications

Guided Application Creator \(GAC\) and legacy Studio are both deprecated as of the November 2024 release.

No additional configuration is required to switch to ServiceNow Studio. Apps created in both legacy products are compatible with ServiceNow Studio.

**Note:** GAC permissions for app creation are not supported in ServiceNow Studio in the November 2024 release. If you have GAC permissions and want to create an app, create the app in legacy Studio, then open and edit the app in ServiceNow Studio. Contact your company admin for more information.

Both Guided Application Creator \(GAC\) and legacy Studio are supported until a future release.

## What does ServiceNow Studio improve over legacy products?

ServiceNow Studio provides a unified environment where you can find, organize, and edit your work using a consistent navigation structure and metadata taxonomy. Every development tool you need is accessible in one place, so you can switch between tools without leaving ServiceNow Studio. When your app is ready to deploy, manage the deployment using update sets or pipelines. ServiceNow Studio also includes native support for ServiceNow Otto, providing access to generative AI capabilities and low-code development tools.

As of version 29.2.11, ServiceNow IDE capabilities have been integrated into ServiceNow Studio. For more information, see [Building apps in source code in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/building-apps-in-source-code-sn-studio.md).

## ServiceNow Studio and changed functionality

In the record for each app created on the ServiceNow AI Platform, there is an option to allow the app to be edited in legacy Studio. However, this option does not apply to the new ServiceNow Studio. Any global, scoped, or custom app you have permission to edit can be edited in ServiceNow Studio.

The **Can Edit Application in Studio** option on each app record does not apply to the new ServiceNow Studio.

## How do GAC roles work in ServiceNow Studio?

Some features in ServiceNow Studio become available only after you create a scoped application. If you are new to ServiceNow Studio, the Search bar and **Create** &gt; **App/File** options may not be visible initially. This is expected behavior.

To get started, select **Create** and create your scoped app. On the App details page, select **Create** to create metadata files and associate them to your app.

After you create your application, return to the ServiceNow Studio home page and refresh the browser. The Search bar and **Create** &gt; **App/File** options are now available for scoped application development. For more information about roles, see [Assign a role to a user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AssignARoleToAUser.md).
