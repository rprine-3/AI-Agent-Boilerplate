# Turn on the app generation skill

Install the ServiceNow Otto for Creator application so that you can get started with creating an application for your organization.

## Before you begin

Starting with the Australia release, app generation is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported. Build Agent provides the latest experience for this functionality. For more information, see [Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent.md).

Install ServiceNow Otto for Creator on your instance before turning on the skill. For more information, see [Install ServiceNow Otto for Creator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/now-assist-for-creator/install-now-assist-for-creator.md).

Enable the ServiceNow Otto® panel before completing these steps. For more information, see [Activate the ServiceNow Otto panel standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-now-assist-panel.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **Skills**.

2.  In the workflow list, select **Creator**.

3.  Find the app generation card using either the search bar or by selecting the next page icon.

## What to do next

-   Set app generation as your preference for creating AI-assisted applications in the ServiceNow Studio user preferences menu. For more information, see [Use the app generation skill to generate apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/sns-app-gen-use-app-gen-skill.md).
-   Grant the now\_assist\_panel\_user role and either the admin or sn\_g\_app\_creator.app\_creator role to each user that you want to create and edit applications using app generation.
-   Users that only need to edit \(not create\) applications using app generation can be granted the delegated\_developer, now\_assist\_panel\_user, and now.assist.creator roles. For more information, see [Delegated development and deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-and-deployment/c_DelegatedDevelopment.md).
