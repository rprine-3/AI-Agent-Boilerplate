# Move application files in a Git repository

Move application files linked to source control to any folder in the repository from ServiceNow Studio to store supporting content, such as automated tests, alongside the applications they support.

## Before you begin

[Link an app to source control in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/link-app-to-source-control.md)

Role required: Source control credentials with write access

## About this task

Linking an application to source control generates a properties text file called `sn_source_control.properties` at the root level of the repository. The properties file specifies the folder containing the application files. The integration tracks changes to these application files by generating a `checksum.txt` file. When the checksum matches, the integration skips the validation and sanitization process. When the checksum does not match, the integration validates and sanitizes the application files as part of the source control operation. The integration ignores all repository content outside the application path.

**Note:** Set system properties **glide.source\_control.checksum\_required** to enable optional checksum validations and sanitizations and **glide.source\_control.checksum\_quick\_install** to bypass sanitization steps on checksum matches. For more information, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the source control repository linked to the application.

2.  Create the destination folder for the application files.

    For example, create the folders `src/app`.

3.  Move the folder containing the application files to the destination folder.

    For example, move the folder `demo_my_app` to `src/app`.

4.  Navigate to the root level of the repository.

5.  Open the `sn_source_control.properties` text file in a text editor.

6.  For the `path=` property, enter the folder path where the application files were moved.

    For example, enter `path=src/app`.

7.  Save the properties file.

    The source control integration reads the updated path and directs subsequent operations to the new folder location.
