# Source control integration in ServiceNow Studio

Link your application to a Git source control repository in ServiceNow Studio to save, manage, and share multiple versions of a global or scoped application from a non-production instance.

## Metadata source control

Metadata source control processes changes in the metadata of your application. Linking an application to source control enables all application developers on a non-production instance to:

-   Import applications from a Git repository.
-   Pull and apply remote changes from a Git repository.
-   Commit all local changes on the instance to a Git repository.
-   Create tags to permanently link to a specific version of an application.
-   Create branches to maintain multiple versions of an application at the same time.

## What are the integration requirements?

To link an application to source control:

-   You must have the admin role.
-   The non-production instance must have network access to the Git repository.
-   Each application must be in its own Git repository.
-   The repository user credentials must grant read and write access.

**Note:** All application developers on the instance share a single set of credentials per repository.

## What can you do with source control in ServiceNow Studio?

After linking an application to source control, you can use ServiceNow Studio to manage the repository. From ServiceNow Studio, you can:

-   Edit the application repository credentials.
-   Commit all local changes on the instance.
-   Apply remote changes from the repository.
-   Create a branch.
-   Switch branches.
-   Import an application from a remote repository.

Source control integration does not support managing applications on a production instance. To manage applications on a production instance, use the application repository, an update set, or ServiceNow Studio. For more information, see [Application sharing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_SharingApplications.md).

## What can you do with source control from a Git repository?

The ServiceNow AI Platform offers limited support for modifying linked application files outside of an instance. From Git, developers can:

-   Move application files to a different Git directory structure.
-   Edit application files outside of ServiceNow Studio.

The system generates a properties text file called `sn_source_control.properties` at the root level of the repository. To move application files to a different Git directory structure, set the **path** parameter to specify the subfolder path containing the application files. For example, to move your application to the `src/app` subfolder, set the **path** to `path=src/app`.

The system generates a `checksum.txt` file in the Git repository to determine if any application files have been changed outside of ServiceNow Studio. When the checksum value from the file matches the current checksum value, the integration skips the validation and sanitization process. When the checksum values do not match, the integration validates and sanitizes the application files as part of the source control operation. The sanitization process:

-   Creates upgrade log entries for each sanitization action taken.
-   Removes unsupported folders and files from the repository.
-   Aborts all source control operations when a system application file fails XML schema validation. For example, if a database dictionary record fails XML schema validation, the system aborts all operations.
-   Skips the current source control operation when a non-system application file fails XML schema validation.

The Git integration sanitizes only content within the application path listed in the `sn_source_control.properties` file. Repository content outside the application path is ignored.

## How do I connect through a MID Server?

Use an existing MID Server to connect to a source control repository. Connecting an application through a MID Server enables access to repositories behind a firewall.
