# ServiceNow Studio Navigator panel taxonomy

Reference each metadata file type and its corresponding primary table in the File categories tab of the ServiceNow Studio Navigator panel.

**Note:** Any additional extensions of the sys\_metadata table are automatically included in the Navigator panel in the appropriate section.

For each file category, the following sections list the available file types and their corresponding primary table. For more information about navigating to a file's primary table, see [Navigate directly to a table in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/qs-navigate-directly-to-table.md).

Metadata-specific admin roles are existing roles on the ServiceNow AI Platform that provide developers with admin access to a specific metadata type. For example, a script include admin allows a developer to create, read, update, or delete any script include on the ServiceNow AI Platform and perform development on script includes in ServiceNow Studio. For more information, see [ServiceNow Studio personas and roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/sn-studio-personas-roles.md).

## AI files

AI files provide ways to use generative AI to enhance user productivity through conversation and proactive experiences.

**Important:** AI options in the ServiceNow Studio file taxonomy are only available if the AI components have been installed and configured.

Agentic Workflow

</td><td>

Agentic workflows are a business problem that you want to solve. In AI Agent Studio, you must define an agentic workflow and connect it with an AI agent to get a resolution plan.

</table>## Automation files

Automations manage recurring tasks with fewer steps, reducing human input and effort. For example, configure an email notification to send automatically when a record is approved. Add automations such as actions, flows, and other automatic tasks to streamline how apps work.
