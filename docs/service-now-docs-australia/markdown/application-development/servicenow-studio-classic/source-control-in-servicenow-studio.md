# Metadata source control in ServiceNow Studio

Use metadata source control in ServiceNow Studio to manage app versions, commit changes, and collaborate with other developers through a linked Git repository.

After an admin links an app to source control, all application developers on a non-production instance can perform the following actions:

-   Import applications from a Git repository.
-   Pull and apply remote changes from a Git repository.
-   Commit all local changes on the instance to a Git repository.
-   Create tags to permanently link to a specific version of an application.
-   Create branches to maintain multiple versions of an application at the same time.

For more information, see [Link an app to source control in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/link-app-to-source-control.md).

**Note:** When using source control to collaborate with other developers, only changes that have been checked in are available to other developers. For example, if an admin creates a new flow for an app linked to Git, the flow is not available to other users until the admin checks it into Git.
