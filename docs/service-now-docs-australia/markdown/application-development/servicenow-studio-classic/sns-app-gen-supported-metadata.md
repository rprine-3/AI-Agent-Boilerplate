# App generation supported metadata

App generation creates seven metadata types, including tables, roles, and record producers. Use this reference to understand what each metadata type does and how app generation uses it.

When you generate an application, app generation creates the following metadata types.

<table id="table_skd_wwj_w1c"><thead><tr><th>

[Access control list \(ACL\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/exploring-access-control-list.md)

</td><td>

ACLs manage role-based access control for the application:-   Rules that define role access to resources and permitted operations
-   ACLs that can be applied at the field or table level

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

sys\_hub\_flow

</td><td>

Flows automate a repeatable, multi-step process.

-   Records contain fields that store data for the application
-   Each record corresponds to a table row, and each field on a record corresponds to a table column

</td></tr><tr><td>
