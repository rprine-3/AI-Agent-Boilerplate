# ServiceNow Studio supported file types using code search

Reference the file types that ServiceNow Studio supports when using code search to locate scripts and metadata across an instance.

Code search in ServiceNow Studio uses the default code search group. The following table lists the file types supported by the default ServiceNow Studio code search.

**Tip:** To expand the list of supported file types, an administrator can create a new code search group that includes additional file types. For more information, see [Expand code search tables](https://developer.servicenow.com/connect.do#!/share/contents/3024956_expand_code_search_tables?v=1&t=PRODUCT_DETAILS).

**Note:** File types must extend the sys\_metadata table to be searchable in code search. Other file types, such as scheduled items \(sys\_trigger records\), are not searchable in ServiceNow Studio.
