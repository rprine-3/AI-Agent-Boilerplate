# Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio

Use Build Agent, an autonomous AI agent, to create and update applications in ServiceNow Studio through conversational interaction.

For full documentation on Build Agent, see [Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent.md). To learn how to develop an application using Build Agent, see [ServiceNow Studio and Build Agent tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/sns-ba-tutorial-landing.md).

## How does the Build Agent workflow work?

Use Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio by following these steps.

1.  The Build Agent chat interface opens automatically during a new ServiceNow Studio session. If it is not open, select the ServiceNow Otto icon \[Omitted image "icon-otto-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text: or select **Open Build Agent** from the lower right corner status bar.
2.  Prompt Build Agent to create or update an application.
3.  Refine the application through conversational interaction, providing feedback and requesting changes.
4.  Roll back changes at any point using checkpoints created by Build Agent.
5.  Deploy the app through update sets, pipelines, or the Application Repository.
6.  Reopen the conversation at any time to make further updates.

For more information, see [Agentic ServiceNow AI Platform development with Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/vc-build-agent-landing.md).

## What can Build Agent do in ServiceNow Studio?

Use Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio to complete the following tasks.

-   Create an app or app file.
-   Update an app or app file.
-   Summarize the contents of an app.
-   Track conversation updates with the conversation change log.
-   Roll back conversations and changes to a checkpoint.
-   Roll back an entire conversation.

Deploy apps created using Build Agent using update sets, pipelines, or the Application Repository — the same process as any other app.
