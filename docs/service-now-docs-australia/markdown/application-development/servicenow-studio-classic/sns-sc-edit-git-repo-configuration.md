Whether or not to use a MID Server connection, which enables access to repositories behind a firewall.**Note:** If you have no MID Server name, select a new one from the drop-down list. If you select a new MID Server, apply the change in the **Source control** menu before performing any further source control operations to avoid errors.

The committer email address, taken from the sys\_user record when available. If a committer's sys\_user record email field is empty, the system generates an alternate email address \(username@instancename.service-now.com\).

</td></tr><tr><td>
