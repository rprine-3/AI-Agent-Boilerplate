# ServiceNow Studio personas and roles

Admins, delegated developers, and users with Guided Application Creator roles can access and develop in ServiceNow Studio. Each role has different capabilities and permissions.

## What can each role do in ServiceNow Studio?

Admins and delegated developers have different capabilities in ServiceNow Studio. Admins can delegate users to work on specific apps and app files by assigning delegated\_developer permissions.
