# Add tabbed content to UI Builder pages

Use the Tabs component to add tabbed content to pages in UI Builder.

Create additional navigation on your UI Builder page by adding a Tabs component to your page. Use the Tabs component to nest components within tabs on your page. Tabs can be configured as either horizontal tabs at the top of the content, or as vertical tabs on the left or right side of the content.

Tabs can be organized in the configuration panel to reorder how they are displayed on the UI Builder page. Add custom labels and icons to tabs to provide unique visual identifiers for navigating across tabs. These changes can be viewed in real-time as you edit the Tabs component.

You can add one of the following types of tabs to your UI Builder page:

-   Empty container tab
-   [Repeater](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-glossary.md) tab
-   Related list tab
-   Page collection tabs

The tabs component supports any combination of static tabs, repeated tabs, related list tabs, and page collection tabs. Alternatively, you can still use the Viewport tab mode to add a series of viewports.

If your page is displaying a user record, then creating a related list tab adds all four of these related lists as tabs on your page. You can preview the page to see the related lists that were added. A record controller is required to create related list tabs.
