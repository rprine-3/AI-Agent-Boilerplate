# Change the navigation and menu settings in your UI Builder workspace experience

Select pages for side navigation in your UI Builder workspace experience. From any page in the workspace experience, users can navigate to the pages you selected.

## Before you begin

This task has the following prerequisites:

-   You have an existing workspace experience on UI Builder. For more information, see [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md).
-   This workspace experience was created with the Workspace App Shell.
-   This workspace experience includes at least two pages.
-   You want users to be able to navigate from a page to other pages that you specify.

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

You can add up to seven pages to your side navigation.

You must be in the correct application scope to edit the experience settings. If you are in a different scope, the experience settings are read-only. To change your application scope, go to the main header, select the application picker \(\[Omitted image "application-picker.png"\] Alt text: Application picker.\), and then select the application scope that you want. For more information about the application scope, see [Learn about security and roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/security-roles.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open your workspace experience in the UI Builder.

3.  Select **Experience settings** in the upper-right.
