# Bind data to UI Builder pages using controllers \(advanced feature\)

Controllers simplify the linking of data and event logic to enable component presets in UI Builder.

Controllers enable page builders to easily connect data and scripts to their pages in UI Builder. A controller is a type of data resource that [component presets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-glossary.md) use to bind data to components. Controllers differ from other data resources in that they contain data and event logic that enables presets for components. A controller brings data from the server to a component, and it brings updated data back to the server based on interactions with the component. For more information about component presets, see [Automatically configure components using presets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/presets.md).

Controllers are added by default when you use a UI Builder page template. You can add controllers to UI Builder pages without a controller within the data resources drawer or by selecting a component preset after adding a component to a page. You can view which controllers are configured on your page by opening the data resources drawer.

## Types of data controllers in UI Builder

-   **Data controllers**

    Data controllers decide what information should be displayed on UI Builder pages. Data controllers use data resources to sync information in real time and update data/tables when a user inputs information. You can manually add data controllers to a page.

-   **UI controllers**

    UI controllers are added to pages when using UI Builder page templates and cannot be added manually.


## Using controllers with presets in UI Builder

You can add multiple controllers to a UI Builder page, but you can't use the same one twice. If you try to use a component preset that needs a controller, UI Builder prompts you to add it.

Not all components work with controllers, but you can easily see which ones do in the component library. If you have a controller configured on your UI Builder page, you can open the component library to view which components have presets. Components with presets available are highlighted in the component library.

## View properties and events in the Controller API

The controller public API defines the output data that a controller provides to a preset. This includes the property values and handled events used by a component when a preset is selected. Property and event information is available to view in UI Builder.

The component property values in a preset can be static values or paths to controller output data. You can use the data resource inspector in UI Builder to display the values from the controller data structure used by a preset. To view the payload carried by an event in the preset, you can look in the event handler picker for that event.

### Viewing properties in the Controller API

You can view preset properties in the UIB data inspector. Knowing the available values helps you understand how a component will behave in your design and helps you identify any properties in the preset you might want to override.

This procedure assumes that you have placed a component with a preset on the page and have configured a controller. For instructions, see [Add a controller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/controllers.md).

The configuration tab displays preset property values as a path to the controller output. The base data path is expressed as `@data.<controller_name>`. The remainder of the path is built using the contents of the categories within the controller data hierarchy. You can use this path to view the current values for the record for which the controller has been configured.

\[Omitted image "controller-api-config-panel.png"\] Alt text: Shows the preset properties expressed as a path to the controller data in the configure panel

1.  To view the data resources for a component, select the data icon in the lower left sidebar.

    \[Omitted image "data-shelf-icon.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing to the data resource icon.

    The three column UIB data inspector appears.

2.  In the first column where the data resources are listed, select the controller whose output you want to view.

    The configuration data for the selected controller appears in the Config tab of the second column. These are the input properties you entered when you configured the controller for the first component with a preset you placed on the page. You can edit these connection values here if you want.

    **Note:** Configuring **-1** for the value in the **Sys ID** field configures the controller for a new record. The controller then generates a full GUID that you can use to store data against the record before it's saved. This allows you to perform actions in a newly created record such as saving attachments.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-user-config.png"\] Alt text: Shows the user configuration for the Record controller in the data resources panel

3.  Select **top level outputs** in the third column.

    This is the parent level of the controller data hierarchy, indicated with the prefix `@data.`, followed by the controller ID. This combination forms the root path to the data. The data contained in the top level outputs are displayed in the adjacent code field and are available for presets and scripts to use. Other properties at that level are some common properties that apply to all records.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-parent-level.png"\] Alt text: Shows the top level parent category for controller data and how it is used to create the first part of the path to specific data

    When the preset maps a component property to controller output, the path to the output is shown instead of the value. Paths are denoted as **@data.&lt;controller id&gt;.&lt;path from top level to output property&gt;** and can be used as the values or as part of formula expressions.

    In this example, the mapping in the preset results in a path to `@data.gform.table`.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-top-level-path.png"\] Alt text: Shows how the path to a controller output value is derived for a preset property value at the top level

4.  To view data below the top level, select the child category indicated by the path in the preset property value.

    The name of the child category appears in the path as `@data.<controller ID>.<category>`. The data from that category is then appended to that path. The root path above the code field indicates the child category being used. In this example, the path to the **View** property in the `form` category is expressed as `@data.gform.form.view`. That preset value displays forms in the **workspace** view.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-second-level-data.png"\] Alt text: Shows how the path to the second level of controller data is appended to the base path for the controller in the data inspector

    In this example, multiple controller output properties are used in a formula expression to build an object.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-formula-example.png"\] Alt text: Shows how to use multiple controller output properties to build a formula for a property in UI Builder

5.  To view a scripted property value, select the lock icon next to the property.

    This puts the property into edit mode and opens a modal for editing the script.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-edit-scripted-value.png"\] Alt text: Shows the edit scripted property value modal with the mapping to the controller data


### Viewing events in the Controller API

You can view handled events mapped to a component by a preset and their payloads in the Events tab in the UI Builder configuration panel. If the data mapping for an event isn't appropriate for your use case, you can add additional data handlers.

**Note:** Data handler mappings provided with the preset are not editable.

1.  Select the Events tab in UI Builder.
2.  To view the mapping for a preset event, select the event tile.

    A modal appears showing the payload properties for the preset event. You can **Disable** the event in this modal.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-view-preset-event.png"\] Alt text: Selected event showing the modal containing preset values for the event

3.  To add an event handler to the event, select **+ Add event handler** under the event tile.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-add-event-handler.png"\] Alt text: Shows the control for adding event handlers to a preset event

    A modal appears, showing a list of available, handled events. You can select any action from the list, including an event handler from one of the controllers listed.

4.  Select an event handler from the list and select **Add**.

    The new handler is listed under the event tile.

    \[Omitted image "controller-api-new-event-handler.png"\] Alt text: Shows the event handler that was selected from the list of available handlers added to the event tile
