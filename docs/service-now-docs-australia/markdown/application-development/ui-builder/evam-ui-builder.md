# Work with the Entity View Action Mapper for UI Builder

With UI Builder, you can use the Entity View Action Mapper \(EVAM\) application to standardize how the data sources in your components are displayed in your cards and lists.

## EVAM Overview

Entity View Action Mapper \(EVAM\) is an application that standardizes how different data sources are displayed in cards and lists. UI Builder uses EVAM data sources to show information in a component as a card grid view or as a list of information. You can add a toggle to your component to let users switch between card grid and list views.

EVAM consists of the following components:

-   Entity \(data source\). Associated data that you intend to display, such as a community post or a user.
-   View. How a card displays data and actions.
-   Actions. Action that it performs on the card. For example, you can activate a user into your system.
-   Map. A process that maps the data source to generic fields that are displayed on the card. You can also associate actions that trigger from the card view.

## EVAM and Multi-table data configuration

The EVAM is an option for users who understand and are comfortable working with JSON. The multi-table data configuration option is an alternative that gives you greater control over the presentation of data, makes it easier to configure the data, and enables you to remain in UI Builder. Use the option that you prefer. For more information, see [Multi-table data configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/multi-source-data-configuration.md).

## EVAM data sources

You add EVAM data sources in UI Builder and bind them to a component.

Add an EVAM definition and other information about the data source. -   Type: Composite.
-   When to evaluate: In the **When to evaluate this data resource**, select **Immediately** to have the EVAM data resource instance evaluated on page load or select **Only when invoked** to use an event handler to evaluate the EVAM data resource.
-   EVAM definition: In the **EVAM Definition** field, add the EVAM definition record that is associated with the data resource.
-   Page cursor: In the **Page Cursor** field, add a page cursor for the EVAM definition.
-   Page size: In the **Page Size** field, add a size for the EVAM pagination.
-   Page number: In the **Page Number** field, add the page number for the EVAM pagination.
-   EVAM Filter Preference: In the **EVAM Filter Preference** field, enter the sys\_ids for the EVAM data filter.

 To add an event handler for when that data fetch is initiated, succeeded, or failed, select **Events**.

 In the **Now Code Editor** section, which is next to the Configuration pane, preview the EVAM definition script.
