# Add a viewport modal to your experience

Add a viewport within a modal in your experience.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

Use viewport modals to embed subpages or other experiences within a modal in your parent page or experience. Viewport modals can be opened via events or scripts. Viewport modals are limited to one subroute per viewport modal. You can create additional viewport modals for extra routes.

**Note:** Legacy viewport modals cannot be upgraded and must be recreated to take advantage of the new functionality.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md) for more information.

3.  Open or create a page.

    If you open an existing page, ensure you are in the same scope as the original page. If not, change the scope before you start editing the page. Application scoping protects applications by identifying and restricting access to application files and data. Administrators set the scope to specify what parts of an application are accessible to other applications. Application scope protects data and application files. See [Learn about security and roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/security-roles.md) for more information on application scope.
