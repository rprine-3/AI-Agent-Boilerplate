# Edit page variant settings

Edit page variant settings to add additional criteria to determine when the page variant displays to users.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Customize page variant settings to set who sees the page variant. You can add and remove audiences as well as edit conditions to determine when a page variant is shown. Conditions can only evaluate the listed parameters. Conditions are based on setting an order and adding a query string that sets the criteria that must be met for the page variant to display. If you have multiple page variants that all have the same conditions, then the variants go by the order setting. The following task shows how to set the variant conditions and order.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open the experience with the page variant that you want to edit.

3.  Expand the page to expose the associated variants.

4.  Next to the page variant that you want to edit, select the Open settings icon \[Omitted image "gear-icon.png"\] Alt text:.
