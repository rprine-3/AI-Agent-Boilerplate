# Use case: Generate modules using ServiceNow Otto

Create and configure application menu modules using natural language

## Scenario

An admin at a logistics company is building a new custom application for managing warehouse operations. The application menu should include multiple modules:

-   A list of active tasks
-   A form for logging new incidents
-   A dashboard for warehouse KPIs
-   A link to an external supplier portal
-   A folder for organizing reporting modules

Configuring each module individually through the standard UI would require navigating multiple forms and configuration screens.

## Problem

Creating and configuring each module in the UI Builder manually can be time-consuming and repetitive, particularly when multiple modules are required simultaneously. Each module type includes its own set of configuration fields, including table names, filters, roles, views, and window settings. As a result, the administrator must fill in these fields individually. When dealing with an application with five or more modules, this process can take considerable time and is prone to configuration errors.

## Solution

Using the Module generation feature, the admin provides a single natural-language prompt that describes all required modules. The AI agent analyzes the prompt, identifies the appropriate module types and key parameters, and generates all modules in a single step. The admin then reviews each generated module, makes any necessary adjustments, and saves the complete application menu.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you install UI generation and that you have the ui\_builder\_admin role. For more information, see [Install UI generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/install-ui-generation.md) and [Grant UI Builder admin role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/grant-ui-builder-admin-role.md).

## Configuration steps

Perform the following steps to generate modules:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.
2.  From the application navigator, select **All**, then select **Create menu**.

    \[Omitted image "ui\_gen\_module\_gen\_create\_menu.png"\] Alt text: The Create menu button \(+\) highlighted in the UI Builder navigation panel.

3.  Enter a name for the application menu \(for example, Warehouse Operations\) and select Create.
4.  On the Add modules page, select **Generate multiple modules at once using Otto**.
5.  Enter the following prompt: `Create a list of active warehouse tasks, a new record form for logging incidents, a KPI dashboard called Warehouse Overview, a URL module linking to https://supplier-portal.example.com with window name Supplier Portal, and a folder called Reports`.
6.  Select **Generate**.

    ServiceNow Otto creates five modules and displays an AI indicator next to each.

7.  Review each module. Select **Accept and Edit** for each module to confirm and adjust configuration fields such as table name, role restrictions, or view settings.
8.  Rearrange modules if needed, then select Done.

## Outcome

The administrator creates and configures a five-module application menu within a single workflow. The resulting modules are immediately ready for use in the application navigator.
