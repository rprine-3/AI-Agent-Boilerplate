# UI interaction toolbox steps

Find details about UI interaction toolbox steps, organized by interaction type, with step descriptions and any available outgoing events. Steps are added to a UI interaction using the toolbox in the UI interaction editor. The available steps depend on the type you selected when you created the UI interaction, whether Generic, Form, or List.

## Available for all interaction types

The following steps are available regardless of whether your UI interaction type is Generic, Form, or List.

Steps that show **None** in the Events column connect directly to the End node or the next step. They execute and do not return a confirmation that they have finished. To continue building the interaction after one of these steps, use an **And** branch.

Steps that show **Success and/or Error** events allow you to define what happens next depending on the outcome, giving you full control over the interaction flow.

When you insert a step before an existing step, the toolbox displays an Unavailable section. This section shows items that cannot be inserted at that location and includes a contextual message that changes depending on why the items are unavailable.

</table>## Form interaction type only

The following steps are only available when the UI interaction type is set to Form. Form interactions require a form controller on the page and provide access to form-specific data and actions.

Field actions modify individual fields on the form. They do not produce success or error events; the step connects directly to the next step or end.

|Step|Description|Events|
|----|-----------|------|
|Add field message|Adds a message below a specified field.|None|
|Clear field message\(s\)|Clears messages from a specified field.|None|
|Clear field messages by type|Clears all field messages of a given type. For example, all info messages.|None|
|Clear field value|Clears the value of a specified field.|None|
|Set field invalid|Sets a field to valid or invalid.|None|
|Set field label|Updates the label of a specified field.|None|
|Set field placeholder value|Sets the placeholder value of a specified field.|None|
|Set field read-only|Sets a specified field to read-only.|None|
|Set field required|Sets a field as required or optional.|None|
|Set field value|Sets the value of a field. Can trigger or bypass dirty state.|None|
|Set field visibility|Shows or hides a specified field.|None|

Form actions operate on the form as a whole and include capabilities such as saving the form, validating the form, or displaying alerts.

|Step|Description|Events|
|----|-----------|------|
|Add form alert|Displays an alert at the top of the form component.|None|
|Clear all form alerts|Removes all alert notifications from the form.|None|
|Clear form alerts by type|Removes form alert notifications of a specified type.|None|
|Execute client script|Runs a client script on the form.|Success, Error|
|Execute UI action|Executes a UI action, client and server side, that has been enabled for Configurable Workspace.|Success, Error|
|Refresh form|Refreshes the form component.|Success|
|Save|Saves the form.|Success|
|Show/hide annotations|Shows or hides annotations on the form.|None|
|Submit form using UI action|Submits the form using a specified UI action.|Success, Error|
|Validate|Validates the form.|Success, Error|

## List interaction type only

The following steps are only available when the UI interaction type is set to List. List interactions require a list controller on the page and provide access to list-specific data and actions.

|Step|Description|Events|
|----|-----------|------|
|Execute client script|Runs a client script on the list.|Success, Error|
|Group by column|Groups the list by a specified column.|None|
|Refresh list|Refreshes the list component.|Success|
|Set query|Updates the encoded query of the list.|None|
|Sort|Sorts the list by a specified column, ascending or descending.|None|
