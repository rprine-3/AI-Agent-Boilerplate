# Add a contextual sidebar

Add a contextual sidebar to a page with UI Builder to display related content using a vertical tab structure.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

You can configure the contextual sidebar in the same way you would configure a tab component. Each vertical tab in the contextual sidebar renders custom content. You can place components in each tab for quick access directly from the page.

For example, a document creation page might have the attachments component on one tab, enabling you to attach files related to the document that you're working on. On another tab, there could be a nested comments component, enabling you to add and view comments related to the document.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Create or open a page or page variant.

    For more information about how to create a page in UI Builder, see [Create a page in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-page.md).
