# Bind an event to a data resource

Assign event handlers within UI Builder to individual data resources on your page. When a data resource successfully fetches new data, it executes an event handler to take a user to the next step in a flow.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

Bind an event to a data resource, to perform data-related actions on your page. For example, you can add a button to reload data to a page if it doesn't load the first time. You can also set up a data resource event to reload data behind the scenes of your page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    For more information, see [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md).

3.  Create or open a page.

    For more information about how to create a page in UI Builder, see [Create a page in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-page.md).

4.  If you do not have any components on your page, add one to your page.

    For more information, see [Add and configure components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/add-components.md).

5.  Add a data resource to your page.

6.  Select a data resource instance.

    The configuration varies depending on which event handler is selected.

-   **[Link an event to another page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/link-component-destination.md)**  
Add a link to the destination event handler within UI Builder so that an event action can open another page. You can also configure the event handler to follow the App Route to the desired page.
