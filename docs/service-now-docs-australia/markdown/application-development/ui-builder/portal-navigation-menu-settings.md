# Change the navigation and menu settings in your portal experience

Change the header, footer, and menu settings for your custom portal experience in UI Builder to fit the needs of your organization.

## Before you begin

This task has the following prerequisites:

-   You have an existing portal experience on UI Builder. For more information, see [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md).
-   This workspace experience contains at least two pages.
-   You want users to be able to navigate from a page to other pages that you specify.

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

Set up the navigation and menu settings in the [app shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-glossary.md) of your portal experience. The app shell is the wrapper of the portal contents. For example, the app shell can show things like the logo of your company, user preferences, the search icon, the configuration icon, and the user menu. You can configure this app shell in the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information about app shells, see [Define UI experiences using app shells](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/app-shells-uibuilder.md).

You must be in the correct application scope to edit experience settings. If you are in a different scope, the experience settings are read-only. To change your application scope, in the main header, select the application picker \(\[Omitted image "application-picker.png"\] Alt text: Application picker\), and then select the application scope. For more information about the application scope, see [Learn about security and roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/security-roles.md).

**Note:** For advanced information about UX page properties, including JSON examples, see [https://www.servicenow.com/community/next-experience-articles/workspace-app-shell-ux-page-properties/ta-p/2331956](https://www.servicenow.com/community/next-experience-articles/workspace-app-shell-ux-page-properties/ta-p/2331956).
