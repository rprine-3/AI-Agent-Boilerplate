# Enhance accessibility with focus management

Set focus on specific elements, ensuring users can interact with them effectively using screen readers.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

Focus management can help users navigate experiences built with UI Builder by directing their attention to specific elements on a page. For example, you can point to a component when closing a modal that updated information on a parent page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Create or open a page or page variant.
