# Using Flexbox layouts in UI Builder

Create a Flexbox layout in UI Builder to build powerful pages so that you can customize with cascading style sheets \(CSS\) and can improve your performance.

You can easily build custom pages with Flexbox layouts in UI Builder. Customizing the layout of your page lets you take full advantage of Flexbox so that you can achieve your overall page design. For more information, see [Organize components in UI Builder pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-layouts.md).

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system in CSS. Flexbox is inherently flexible, which is useful for when you don’t know the size of your content. If you plan to build complex pages, you can customize the layout of your page in the configuration panel styles tab or with CSS. Visit [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) to learn more about Flexbox.

You can change the direction of your content in the layout in the following ways:

-   Row: Rows are organized left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the direction of your browser's default language. Left/right is the case for an English browser.
-   Row-reverse: Rows are organized in the reverse direction of your browser's default language, such as right-to-left or left-to-right.
-   Column: Up/down or down/up
-   Column-reverse: Down/up

-   Justify content: Defines the alignment along the main axis. Choices are as follows:
    -   Flex-start: Items are at the start of the flex direction, similar to left-justified content. This is the default setting.
    -   Flex-end: Items are at the end of the flex direction, similar to right-justified content.
    -   Space-between: Items are distributed evenly.
    -   Space-around: Items are distributed evenly with equal space around them.
    -   Space-evenly: The spacing between items is equal.
-   Align items: Defines how you want your flex content displayed along the cross axis. Choices are as follows:
    -   Stretch: Stretch your content to fill the container. This is the default setting
    -   Flex-start: Place your content at the start of the cross axis.
    -   Flex-end: Place your content at the end of the cross axis.
    -   Center: Center your content in the cross axis.
    -   Base system: Align your content the same as your baseline alignment.
-   Height: Set the height automatically or manually.
-   Width: Set the height of your flexbox items automatically or manually.
-   Margin: Set your minimal distance between flexbox items.
-   Padding: Set the padding for each side of your flexbox items.
