# Using CSS Grid layouts to build a page

Create a CSS Grid layout in UI Builder to build powerful pages so that you can customize with cascading style sheets \(CSS\) and can improve your performance.

CSS Grid is the most powerful layout system in CSS. CSS Grid is built on top of a two-dimensional grid. CSS Grid gives you control over how you create your pages. Use UI Builder to implement a CSS Grid layout using low-code layout configuration properties. For advanced layouts, you can view and edit CSS code to customize your layouts. Visit [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) to learn more about CSS Grid.

For example, you can have a grid with three columns and three rows to make a grid nine cells. You can place components inside these cells or make the component span multiple cells.

Customizing the layout of your page lets you take full advantage of CSS Grid so that you can achieve your overall page design. For more information, see [Organize components in UI Builder pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-layouts.md).

To find out more about CSS layouts within your UI Builder instance, you can find them in the \[sys\_uib\_template\] table.

7.  Add another slot to the layout by copying the CSS code for an existing slot.

8.  Paste the CSS code below the code that you copied and change the **slotName** and **grid-area** to a unique value.

9.  Modify the layout rules to include the new column and template area, as follows:

    \[Omitted image "UIB-layouts-modifyCSS.png"\] Alt text: Modifying the layout rules.

    You can set many different configurations. In this example, there are the two resulting grids from two different grid template areas. The **"grid-template-areas"** property being modified is setting the CSS property of the same name. For more information, see [MDN grid-templates-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas).
