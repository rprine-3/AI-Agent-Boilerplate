# General guidelines UI generation

Use these general guidelines for UI generation to get better experiences.

## Writing prompts

-   **Write clear and specific but concise prompts**

    Describe the table and navigation your users will be working with. For best results, include as much detail as possible.

-   **Experiment with different prompts**

    As you refine and experiment, the Now LLM Service uses this feedback to learn and improve.

    -   Try adding a specific title for your desired experience.
    -   Try including navigation details.
    -   Keep track of your prompts, including any modifications, and instructions for generating prompts to meet your specifications. This tracking enables easy regeneration of past results for comparative analysis.

</table>## Reviewing generated experience

-   **Review experience**

    Implement strict and detailed reviews of the AI-generated experience to determine its accuracy, efficiency, and how well it adheres to your standards.

-   **Test experience**

    Validate the experience by running it against test cases in controlled environments to ensure that it functions according to your requirements.
