# Add modeless dialog to a UI Builder page

Learn how to add a modeless dialog in UI Builder. A modeless dialog is a floating window containing content above a page.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

The following steps walk you through the process of configuring a button to open a modeless dialog containing the Attachments component.

**Note:** The procedure outlined here is just one example of how to use modeless dialogs. There are infinite possibilities. Add and configure modeless dialogs to meet your business needs.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

3.  Open or create a page variant.
