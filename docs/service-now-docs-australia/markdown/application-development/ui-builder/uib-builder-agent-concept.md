# UI Builder Agent

The UI Builder Agent is a ServiceNow Otto AI agent that assists low-code developers working in UI Builder by responding to questions, information requests, and page editing instructions.

The UI Builder Agent is pre-configured and available in AI Agent Studio as part of the UI Generation application. It supports developers as they build and modify pages in UI Builder by providing contextual AI assistance.

The ServiceNow Otto panel displays the UI Builder agent's responses. You can access the ServiceNow Otto panel by selecting the Otto icon in the Next Experience Unified Navigation.

Administrators install the required applications, configure the agent in AI Agent Studio, enable the ServiceNow Otto panel, and activate the default ServiceNow Otto Panel - Platform assistant before developers can interact with the agent.
