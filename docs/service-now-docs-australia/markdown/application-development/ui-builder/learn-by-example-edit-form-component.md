# Customize forms within a form component

Customize your form components by accessing Form Builder in UI Builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can edit form components without leaving UI Builder. Access Form Builder from within a form component on the UI Builder stage. After you save the form, your edits remain, and anyone who views the form sees the modified version. Changes made in Form Builder are reflected on the stage.

## Procedure

1.  Add a form component to your page.

    1.  In the content tree, select **+ Add content**.

    2.  Select **Form**.

2.  On the stage, move your cursor to the form component to display the **Edit Form** button.

    \[Omitted image "edit-form.png"\] Alt text: Edit Form button on the form component

3.  Select the **Edit Form** button.

    Form Builder opens in a full-screen modal.

4.  Move your cursor to individual fields to display additional options.

    \[Omitted image "form-builder-hover.png"\] Alt text: Additional options on a field with callouts indicating the move button, the add buttons, and the delete button.

5.  Insert fields by moving your cursor to the **+** button, which displays the **+ Add** button, then selecting **+ Add**.

    You can also drag additional fields onto the form from the **Fields** column.

    For example, you can add the **Due date** field below the **Configuration item** field, then select **Save** and **Preview** to save and preview the form.

6.  Move a field by dragging the edge of a field to another place in the form and then selecting **Save**.

    For example, select the **State** field and place it below the **Duplicate of** field, then select **Save**.

7.  Delete a field by selecting the **X** button on the field.

8.  Select **Save**.

9.  Close Form Builder to see your edits appear on the stage.
