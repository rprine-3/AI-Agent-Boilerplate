## Install required applications for UI Builder Agent

Install ServiceNow Otto for Creator, UI Generation, and Conversational Studio from Application Manager before configuring the UI Builder Agent.

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

### About this task

Install and update three applications to support the UI Builder Agent before configuring it in AI Agent Studio.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Application Manager**.

    Application Manager opens and displays the search interface for licensed applications and plugins.

2.  In the search field, type `ServiceNow Otto for Creator` and press Enter.

3.  Select the **Installed** tab and verify that ServiceNow Otto for Creator \(`sn_now_creator`\) is listed and shows **Up to date**.

    If the application is not installed, locate it under the **Available for you** tab and install it.

4.  Clear the search field, type `ui generation`, and press Enter.

5.  Select the **Installed** tab and verify that UI Generation \(`sn_ui_generation`\) is installed and shows **Up to date**.

    The UI Generation application must be the Zurich version or later.

6.  Clear the search field, type `Conversational Studio`, and press Enter.

7.  Select the **Installed** tab and verify that Conversational Studio \(`sn_convo_studio`\) is installed and shows **Up to date**.

    If the application is not installed, locate it under the **Available for you** tab and install it.


### Result

All three applications — ServiceNow Otto for Creator, UI Generation, and Conversational Studio — are installed and up to date on your instance.

## Enable UI Builder Agent in AI Agent Studio

Follow the UI Builder Agent setup wizard in AI Agent Studio to review and confirm your agent configuration.

### Before you begin

Verify that you have installed all the required applications. See [Install required applications for UI Builder Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/configure-ui-builder-agent.md).

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

### About this task

The UI Builder Agent comes pre-configured with the UI Generation application. The setup wizard in AI Agent Studio guides you through the process of defining the agent, covering aspects such as its specialty, tools, security controls, triggers, and channels.

**Important:** The UI Builder Agent record is read-only in the Global application scope. When viewing the agent in AI Agent Studio, you will see a banner indicating that the record belongs to the UI Generation application. You can proceed through the wizard without switching scope.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Overview**.

    The AI Agent Studio overview page opens, showing available AI agents and recent agentic workflow activity.

2.  Locate the **UI Builder Agent** card and select it.

    The UI Builder Agent setup wizard opens on the **Define the specialty** step.

3.  Review the agent specialty definition and select **Continue**.

    You don't need to modify the specialty or subsequent configuration steps. The agent comes fully configured.

4.  On the **Add tools and information** step, select **Continue**.

5.  On the **Define user access** step, select **Continue**.

6.  On the **Define data access** step, review the user identity settings and select **Continue**.

    The agent is pre-configured with a **Dynamic user** identity type and the `ui_builder_admin` approved role. The dynamic user setting means the agent derives its data access permissions from the user who initiates the interaction.

7.  On the **Add triggers** step, select **Continue**.

8.  On the **Select channels and status** step, scroll down to **Activation status**, enable **This AI agent is active**, and then select**Test**.

    The system navigates to the Testing tab in AI Agent Studio. An alert banner appears indicating that you must enable the ServiceNow Otto panel before testing.


### Result

The UI Builder Agent setup wizard is complete. The agent configuration is confirmed, and you can enable the ServiceNow Otto panel to proceed with testing and activation.

## Enable the ServiceNow Otto panel

Enable the ServiceNow Otto panel in AI Admin Hub.

### Procedure

1.  On the AI Agent Studio Testing tab alert banner, select the **Edit this setting** link.

    Alternatively, navigate directly to **All** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **Experiences**.

    The ServiceNow Otto panel page opens in AI Admin Hub, showing a summary of the panel and a **Turn on** button.

2.  In the **Turn on** section, select **Turn on**.

    A success dialog appears confirming that the ServiceNow Otto panel is turned on. The dialog shows that generative AI skills in the ServiceNow Otto panel are available. It also provides a link to the Assistants page in CI Admin console for further configuration.

3.  In the success dialog, select the **Assistants page in CI Admin console** link.

    The CI Admin Experience Assistants page opens.


### Result

The ServiceNow Otto panel is enabled on your instance and is available to users based on their designated permissions.
