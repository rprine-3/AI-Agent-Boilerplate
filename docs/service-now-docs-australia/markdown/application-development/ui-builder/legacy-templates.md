# Create a page from a legacy template

Use legacy page templates to reuse a page definition, such as record or list page, for pages in your workspace or portal.

This video shows you how to perform the following procedure.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Select the **Create new page** in the center of the screen.

4.  Scroll down and select **View legacy templates**.

5.  Hover over the template you want to use and select **Use template**.

    \[Omitted image "uib-legacy-template-select.png"\] Alt text: Dashboards selected in the legacy template list.

6.  Enter a unique name for the page in the **Name** field.

7.  Specify a path for your page in the **Path** field. UI Builder generates a default path based on the name that you gave in the earlier step.

    A default path is added based on your page name. You can also create your own path. The path is required and must be unique. The path can include digits \(0-9\), letters \(A-Z, a-z\), and a few special characters \(`"-"`, `"."`, `"_"`, `"~"`\), with the words separated by a forward slash or hyphen. The **URL preview** shows the path of your page.

    **Note:** The application scope defaults to the scope that the user is in within the ServiceNow AI Platform®. For more information about the application scope, see [Learn about security and roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/security-roles.md).

8.  Select a URL page type in the **Type** drop-down list. UI Builder automatically assigns a page type based on the legacy template you select, but you can change this value if needed.

    URL page types help you categorize and find important pages in the Experience view. Pages with a type other than **None** are filtered more effectively in the Experience view.

9.  Select how you want to use the base page template.

    Select **Use the original page \(customization limited\)** if you want to reference the template and its data. Select **Copy contents of the page \(fully customized\)** to copy the contents of the page template. When you reference a page template, your page automatically updates when you upgrade to a new release. If you copy the page template, your page will not update after upgrade.

10. Select **Continue**.

11. Add required parameters to your page URL.

    1.  Click **+ Add**.

    2.  Enter the required parameters for your page.

        A required parameter is a piece of data that your page requires, such as a sys\_id, table, or query. Required parameters are useful for components, because they can bind to the value of the required parameter.

        \[Omitted image "required-parameter-example.png"\] Alt text: Required parameters in UI Builder.

        For more information about required and optional page parameters, see [Adding Page Parameters](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/washingtondc/app_store_learnv2_uibuilder_washingtondc_ui_builder/app_store_learnv2_uibuilder_washingtondc_create_pages_in_ui_builder/UCP_AddingPageParameters_washingtondc) in the ServiceNow Developer website.

12. Add optional pieces of data that you want to add to the URL of your page.

    1.  Click **+ Add**.

    2.  Enter the optional parameters for your page.

        Unlike required parameters, optional parameters are always name and value pairs that work no matter what order that they are provided in.

        \[Omitted image "optional-parameter-example.png"\] Alt text: Optional parameters in UI Builder.

        For more information, see [Manage UI Builder pages and page variants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-pages.md).

13. Select **Looks good**.

14. Enter a name for the page variant.

    The form automatically adds **Default** to the page name.

15. Add one or more audiences for this page.

    If an audience you need is not listed, you can choose the Open audiences in platform link to create one.

16. Declare conditions for when to display the page by either using the provided dropdown menus or writing an encoded query string.

    For more information on writing encoded queries, see [Encoded query strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_EncodedQueryStrings.md).

17. Select **Create** to create your blank page.

    The page you created displays in the **Page** section of your experience. Select **Editor** to start adding components to your page. For more information, see [Customize UI Builder pages using components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-components.md).
