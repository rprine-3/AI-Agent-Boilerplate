# Change the general settings in your portal experience

Change the general settings for your custom portal experience in UI Builder. For example, you can modify the title, description, and path for your portal experience.

## Before you begin

You must be in the correct application scope to edit the experience settings. If you're in a different scope, the experience settings are read-only. To change your application scope, go to the main header, select the application picker \(\[Omitted image "application-picker.png"\] Alt text: Application picker.\), and then select the application scope that you want. For more information about the application scope, see [Learn about security and roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/security-roles.md).

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open a portal experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    For more information, see [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md).

3.  Select **Experience settings** in the UI Builder header.

    \[Omitted image "portal-settings-toggle.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing to the Experience settings link on the experience view page.

4.  Change the title, description, and path of your portal experience.

    -   The title lets everyone know what the workspace is called. Take care when choosing a name for your workspace.
    -   The description lets your users know the details of the workspace.
    -   The path must be unique. The path can include digits \(0-9\), letters \(A-Z, a-z\), and a few special characters \(`"-"`, `"."`, `"_"`, or `"~"`\) with the words separated by a forward slash or hyphen.
    \[Omitted image "experience-portal-settings.png"\] Alt text: UI Builder experience general settings where you have fields for the title, URL path, and landing path.

5.  Select **Advanced settings** to edit the workspace record on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    1.  Update the record in the platform when you are finished.

        When you go back to your workspace experience settings in UI Builder, you see the changes that you made to the general settings.

6.  Click **Save**.


## Result

When you go back to your portal experience settings in UI Builder, you see the changes that you made to the general settings.
