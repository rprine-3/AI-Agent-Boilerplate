# Change the layout of a page created in Quebec or Rome

Add and modify your layout design to change the way your page looks. Choose how components are displayed on a page through Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\) web layout technologies, such as Flexbox and CSS Grid.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

Layouts control what containers and components are available on a page, and where they are. CSS rules apply to them. You can change the layout as follows.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  [Create](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-page.md) or open a page.

4.  Select the **Layout** tab.

5.  Depending on the type of page, do one of the following to select a container to update.

<table id="choicetable_cc5_jsb_dqb"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d255292e139">

Type of page

</th><th align="left" id="d255292e142">

Instruction

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d255292e148">

**Existing page**

</td><td>

Select the container on your page for which you want to change the layout.**Note:** Alternately, you can select the container in the content tree to the left of the main page area. When the page structure is in the structured tree, you can more easily find the container you want to change. If you have many components and containers in the content tree, use the search bar to find a specific container.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d255292e160">

**New page**

</td><td>

In the content tree to the left of the main page area, select the **Body** of your page. **Body** is the root element of the page.

 \[Omitted image "UIB-content-tree-body.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing to body element in the content tree structure.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    If you are starting a new page, you can select the layout at the page level, and later at the container level. If you are not the owner of an existing page, be aware of the impact of changing the layout at the page level.

6.  Change the layout of your container.

    1.  In the Page configuration pane, select the **Layout** tab to select the layout that you want to use.

        You can change the current layout of an existing page into a new one. For example, in a three-column layout, you can click the four-column layout to change the layout.

        You can also set the layout for a container. The following image shows the layout options for the UI Builder.

        \[Omitted image "UIB-layouts.png"\] Alt text: Layout options for UI Builder.

    2.  If you are creating a page, add components to the new areas in your layout.

    3.  Click **Save**.

    4.  View and test your page by selecting \[Omitted image "preview-button.png"\] Alt text: Preview button that opens your page in runtime, which is a preview of how the page looks on a web page..

    For changing an existing page, the following video shows how you can change the container layout from three to four columns, and then add a new component to the fourth column.

    \[Omitted image "UIB-change-layout-video.gif"\] Alt text: Changing the layout of an existing page.

    For setting the layout of a new page, the following video shows you how to set the layout that you want for the page. For example, you can set your page to have two slots or columns. Then, you can add containers to each slot and change the layout for each container. You can also set the layout at the container level after you add containers to your page.

7.  Add components to slots.

    You build your page with containers components. See [Customize UI Builder pages using components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-components.md) for more information.

    You can add components by using any of the following ways.

<table id="choicetable_dzv_llh_wnb"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d255292e310">

To add a component

</th><th align="left" id="d255292e313">

Select the add content \(plus\) icon, select the **Components** tab, and then select a component.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d255292e336">

**Directly from your page \(option 2\)**

</td><td>

On a column layout or component, select the add before \(plus\) or add after \(plus\) icon, and then select a component.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d255292e348">
