# UI Builder tutorial

Learn how to use the basics of UI Builder to create a page called My Tutorial.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

In this UI Builder tutorial, you perform the following tasks to build a [page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-glossary.md) in UI Builder:

-   Start UI Builder.
-   Create a page for your workspace or custom portal experience. For more information about creating pages, see [Create a page in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-page.md).
-   Change the layout of the page to have two columns. For more information, see [Organize components in UI Builder pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-layouts.md).
-   Build your page by adding two container [components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/ui-builder-glossary.md).
-   Rename your container components in the content tree.
-   Add a **Heading** component and a **Button** component to the first container. Add a **data visualization component** to the second container. For more information about components, see [Customize UI Builder pages using components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-components.md).
-   Configure your components as follows:
    -   Link the button to the ServiceNow® website.
    -   Connect the **Data visualization** component to a data source to display task data. For more information about data resources, see [Dynamically expose data in UI Builder pages \(advanced feature\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/data-resources.md).
-   Save your page often.
-   Preview your page to see how it looks in a browser.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

    You can also type `UI Builder` directly in the **Filter navigator**.

2.  From the UI Builder home page, choose an experience you want to work in.

    If you don’t see any experiences listed in which to work, contact your administrator to get access to an experience or create an experience. For more information, see [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md).

3.  Create a page.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    Congratulations! You created your tutorial page! The page is empty of content. You add components to the page to build functionality to it. Components are the building blocks of a page. UI Builder comes with many components ready for you to add to your page. Components can be as simple as a **Heading**, or as complex as a **List**.

4.  Change the layout of the page to a two-column layout.

    For more information about layouts, see [Organize components in UI Builder pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-layouts.md).

<table id="choicetable_hgv_b1x_d4b"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d73774e426">

Do the following

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d73774e513">

**Add a heading component to your left-column container**

</td><td>

You can add components to the page in different ways. For more information on the ways you can add components to your page, see [Table 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-components.md).1.  Select the **+** button in the middle of the left column.
2.  Type `Heading` in the search field.
3.  Select the **Heading** component to add it to your container. A heading component is a way to add text or a title to your page.
4.  Select **Add**.
5.  Select the component name in the configuration panel to see the **Component label** and **Component ID**. You can change these to anything you want, as long as they’re unique.
6.  Select **Apply**.
7.  Configure your **Heading** component. Component authors configure components to expose the appropriate properties required to set up their components.
    -   Set the style to **Header-primary**. The Style changes the class of the heading text, like font, weight, and color. For example, if you select **Header-secondary**, the text is smaller. Different headings sizes are useful if you have two headings and want the second heading smaller that the primary heading.
    -   Enter `My Tutorial` as the heading text in the **Label** field.
    -   Leave the Level as **1**.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d73774e601">

**Add and configure a button component to your left-column container**

</td><td>

Add a **Button** component to your page. Configure the button by changing the text and the way that it looks. Then change what happens when you click the button by adding an event handler for the button. The event handler adds an action to the button to link to the ServiceNow® home page. So when you click the button, the ServiceNow® home page opens in a new tab of your browser. For more information about configuring components, see [Components](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/sandiego/components).

 1.  Select the **+** on the bottom edge of the heading component that we added in the previous section.
2.  Type `Button` in the search field.
3.  Select the **Button** component in the list.

For more information on adding components to your page, see [Table 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-components.md).

4.  Select the component name in the configuration panel to see the **Component label** and **Component ID**. You can change these to anything you want, as long as they’re unique.
5.  Configure the button component as follows.
    -   Enter `Home Page` in the Label field to change the name of your button.
    -   Change the Size to **Large**.
    -   Enter `home` in the **Icon** search field.
    -   Select **Home Outline**.
6.  Add an event handler to configure what action applies to the button.
    -   Select the **Events** tab in the configuration panel.
    -   Under Button clicked, select **+ Add a new event handler**.

\[Omitted image "tutorial-event-handler-add.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing to the + Add event handler link.

    -   Under Inherited event handlers, select **Link to destination**.
    -   Click **Select destination**.
    -   In the **Select destination** screen, select **External URL**.
    -   Type your URL. For this tutorial, type `https://www.servicenow.com` Select **OK**.
    -   Select **Add**.

\[Omitted image "tutorial-button-event.png"\] Alt text: Configured event handler for the button component.

For more information about event handlers, see [Manage actions in UI Builder pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-events.md).

7.  Select **Save**. It is always a good idea to save your page often as you work.
