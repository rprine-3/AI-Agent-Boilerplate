# Add modeless dialog event to a UI Builder page

Learn how to add and configure a modeless dialog event, such as open, close, or minimize in UI Builder. A modeless dialog is a floating window containing content above a page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  Open or create a page variant.

    For more information about how to create a page in UI Builder, see [Create a page in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-page.md).

4.  Add a modeless dialog to the page.

    For more information about how to create a modeless dialog, see [Add modeless dialog to a UI Builder page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/add-modeless-dialog.md).

5.  Add a component to the page, such as a button, to take action on the modeless dialog.

    For more information about how to create a button that interacts with a modeless dialog, see [Add modeless dialog to a UI Builder page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/add-modeless-dialog.md).

6.  Select the button component in the content tree or on the stage.

**Open Modeless Dialog**

</td><td>

Opens a modeless dialog. For example, add a button labeled Compose email and configure the button to open a modeless dialog containing the Email composer \(mini\) component.-   **Heading**: Type a heading for the modeless dialog.

-   **Modeless Dialog Instance ID**: If you select the **Single instance** option, specify the modeless dialog instance ID that should be opened on click. Move your mouse over the field and select the **Bind data** icon. In **Data types** select **Modeless Dialog**. Drag the instanceID pill to the top section and select **Apply**.
-   **When to trigger** \(Advanced option\): Select **Always** to have the component \(in this example, the button\) always open the modeless dialog.
