# Collaborate with other UI Builder developers

UI Builder provides real-time collaboration tools and user presence indicators for more efficient and intuitive UI development.

UI Builder lets you see who is online and working on the same page in an experience.

The avatars of other developers appear in the UI Builder header next to the undo button. A dot on the avatar of the user represents online status.

-   Green dot if the user is currently working on the page
-   No dot if the user is not logged in

\[Omitted image "collaboration-avatar-header.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing to a users avatar in the ui builder header.

A banner will appear asking you to reload the page to view the latest version if changes are made by other users while you are editing a page.

\[Omitted image "collaboration-outdated-banner.png"\] Alt text: Red banner informing the user that the page has been updated and needs to be reloaded to view the latest version.

If you have made changes at the same time as another user you will be prompted to **Overwrite and save** your changes to proceed with previewing the page.

\[Omitted image "collaboration-overwrite.png"\] Alt text: Modal that asks if you want to overwrite and save the changes you made in UI Builder.
