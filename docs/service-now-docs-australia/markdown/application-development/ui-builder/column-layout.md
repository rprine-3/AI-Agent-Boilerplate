# Column layouts

Column layouts are used to design and organize UI Builder pages.

This video shows you how to perform the following procedure.

Column layouts enable you to create useful and visually appealing pages in an experience. A column layout is a type of flexible container that can hold components. Column layouts are simple layouts that are preconfigured, enabling you to design an efficient and attractive page quickly. It's useful to define and set the structure of the page with column layouts before adding components.

Column layouts can have columns of equal or different widths.

\[Omitted image "column-layout-examples.png"\] Alt text: Examples of column layouts available in UI Builder.

You can configure the column layout as a whole and the individual columns within the layout. For example, set a different border width and color for a column layout and for the individual columns within the layout.

**Note:** Currently, hiding/showing columns in a column layout based on conditions isn't supported.

## Configure column layouts

Configure column layouts in UI Builder to add the appropriate number of columns and the look you want on an experience page.

### Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder**.

2.  Open an experience to work in or create an experience by selecting **Create** &gt; **Experience**.

    See [Configure how users interact with your applications in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/work-experiences.md) for more information on creating experiences.

3.  [Create a page in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-page.md) or open a page.

4.  If the page doesn't already contain a column layout, [Add a column layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/column-layout.md).

5.  Add \(up to a maximum of six\) columns using the content tree, the stage, or the configuration panel.

    -   In the content tree, select and hold \(or right-click\) on a column name or select the Menu icon for a column and then select **Add column before** or **Add column after** from the list.

        \[Omitted image "column-add-from-content-tree.png"\] Alt text: Content tree with column menu icon selected showing the options to add a column before or after the selected column.

    -   On the stage, select a single column, select the Menu icon next to the column name, and then select **Add column before** or **Add column after** from the list.

        \[Omitted image "column-add-from-stage.png"\] Alt text: Stage shown with column menu icon selected showing the options to add a column before or after the selected column.

    -   On the stage, select and hold \(or right-click\) on a column and then select **Add column before** or **Add column after** from the list.

        \[Omitted image "column-add-from-stage2.png"\] Alt text: Stage shown with column menu open and black arrows pointing to the options to add a column before or after the selected column.

    -   In the content tree, select a column layout and then on the stage select the + plus icon to add columns to the right side of the column layout.

        \[Omitted image "column-add-from-stage3.png"\] Alt text: Stage shown with a column layout selected and a black arrow pointing to the plus icon for adding additional columns.

    -   In the content tree, select a column layout and then in the configuration panel use the + plus icon next to **Columns** to add columns to the right side of the column layout.

        \[Omitted image "column-add-from-config-panel.png"\] Alt text: Column layout configuration panel with black arrow pointing to the layout columns option.

    **Note:** Columns can be nested inside one another, but this level of complexity isn't often required on pages.

6.  Rename a column by editing the column label from the content tree, the stage, or the configuration panel.

    -   In the content tree, select and hold \(or right-click\) on a column name or select the Menu icon for a column, select **Rename**.
    -   On the stage, select the Menu icon next to a column name, select **Rename**.
    -   In the configuration panel, select the information icon next to the column name.

        \[Omitted image "column-rename.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing to configuration panel column name information icon and pop-up window expanded showing column label field.

    Renaming columns can help you distinguish between different columns on the stage and in the content tree. If you have a complex page with many column layouts and columns, it is useful to rename columns.

7.  To change the width of a column in a layout, select the column layout \(in the content tree or on the stage\), then drag a column divider on the stage left or right to make the column narrower or wider.

    \[Omitted image "uib-resize-columns-video.gif"\] Alt text: Animation showing how to resize a column by dragging the column divider.

    The width percentages at the top of the columns change automatically as you drag the column divider. The percentages add up to 100%. When resizing a column, be aware of how much space the component or components within the column need. For example, list and form components usually don't display well in narrow columns.

8.  Distribute columns in a layout evenly across the horizontal using the content tree, the stage, or the configuration panel.

    -   In the content tree, select and hold \(or right-click\) on a column layout name or select the Menu icon for a column layout, and then select **Distribute columns evenly** from the list.
    -   On the stage, select a column layout, select the Menu icon next to the column layout name, and then select **Distribute columns evenly** from the list.
    -   Select a column layout \(in the content tree or on the stage\) and in the configuration panel select **Distribute columns evenly**.
9.  Reorder columns \(including their contents\) within a column layout using the content tree or the stage.

    -   In the content tree, select the column and drag it to a different position \(a blue horizontal line shows where the column can be dropped\).

        \[Omitted image "column-rearrange-content-tree.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing from column in content tree to new location in the tree denoted with a blue, horizontal line.

    -   On the stage, select a column header, drag the column to a different position, and drop the column into the drop zone defined by a vertical magenta line.

        \[Omitted image "column-rearrange.png"\] Alt text: Arrow pointing from column header on stage to a drop zone denoted by a vertical magenta bar.

    If you reorder the column in the content tree the stage updates, and if you reorder on the stage the content tree updates.

10. Specify the amount of space between columns from the content tree, the stage, or the configuration panel.

    -   In the content tree, select and hold \(or right-click\) on a column layout name or select the Menu icon for a column layout, select **Layout** from the list, and select a size option in **Column gap**.
    -   On the stage, select a column layout, select the Menu icon next to the column layout name, select **Layout** from the list, and select a size option in **Column gap**.
    -   Select a column layout \(in the content tree or on the stage\) and in the configuration panel select a size option in **Column gap**.

        \[Omitted image "column-layout-column-gap.png"\] Alt text: Component panel with column gap field expanded to show options.

11. Select the Tree icon to navigate to a different layer of content, for example, from a column to the parent column layout or a child component.
