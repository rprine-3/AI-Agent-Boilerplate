## About this task

Learn to use Data Binding Generation in ServiceNow® UI Builder with ServiceNow Otto to automatically generate bindings and formulas. These bindings can be applied to any component property, such as labels, text, lists, or buttons, and can include logic, calculations, or data transformations.

## Procedure

1.  Open UI Builder.

2.  Create an experience or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Create an experience for UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-experience.md).

3.  Create a page or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Create a page in UI Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-page.md).

4.  Create a page variant or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Create a page variant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-variant.md).

5.  Open the Page Editor.

6.  Add a data resource or open an existing one.

    For more information, see [Add and configure data resources to a page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/add-data-resources.md).

7.  From the Data Binding popover, select **Get started**.

    \[Omitted image "ui-gen-data-binding-popover.png"\] Alt text: A data binding panel in ServiceNow UI Builder, allowing users to generate and preview formulas or data outputs for page components using natural language prompts.

8.  You can enter your prompt using natural language or select one from the examples.

    **Note:** For example:

    -   Instead of writing `IF(@context.propers.bare,"bare page","not bare page")`, you can enter `If the page is bare, show 'bare page'; otherwise, show 'not bare page’`.
    -   Instead of `LEN([1,2,3]), ")`, you can enter `How many items are in this list?`
    \[Omitted image "ui-gen-data-binding-popover-prompt.png"\] Alt text: A data binding panel in ServiceNow UI Builder, where users enter natural language prompts to generate formulas, preview results, and bind data to page components.

9.  Select the arrow to generate a binding or formula.

10. Review the syntax and output.

11. Select **Accept and Edit**.

    \[Omitted image "ui-gen-data-binding-popover-accept.png"\] Alt text: A data binding panel in UI Builder, where users create a formula for a welcome message, preview formula, and have options to accept, edit, or reject it.

12. Apply or reject the binding.

    -   If you’re happy with the output, select **Apply**.
    -   If you’re unhappy with the output, select **Reject** and start over by entering a new prompt.
13. Preview and test the output.


## Result

Data binding and formula are generated.
