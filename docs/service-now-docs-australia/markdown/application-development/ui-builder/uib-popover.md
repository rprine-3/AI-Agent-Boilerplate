# Create popovers in UI Builder

Use popovers on a UI Builder page to overlay contextual information or functionality to help users complete tasks.

A popover is a small window or dialog box that appears above a UI Builder page and contains additional information, options, or actions related to the content or task at hand. Add components to a popover in the same way you add modals to a page.

You can place popovers anywhere on a UI Builder page where you think additional information helps the users. Popovers are intended to provide small pieces of information or links to related content, so you should limit the amount of information or functionality within a popover because the popover only displays when a user is interacting with it.

You can make popovers visible or hidden with event mapping, such as triggering a popover to appear when selecting a button or pointing to a part of the page. For more information, see [Define map events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/event-mapping.md).
