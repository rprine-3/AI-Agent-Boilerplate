# Code reviews

Team Development administrators can require that pushes undergo code review before accepting pushes.

When code review is enabled, pushing a change to the parent instance triggers the code review workflow. By default, users with the teamdev\_code\_reviewer role receive notifications to review changes and can approve or reject changes. The Team Development Code Reviewers has the teamdev\_code\_reviewer role.

For each change, reviewers can see the following information.

-   Which [remote instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/team-development/t_DefineARemoteInstance.md) the pushed change comes from.
-   Who pushed the change to the parent.
-   What the change is called.
-   When the change was created.
-   Which versions the change includes.

Reviewers must approve or reject a push from the Team Development application.

While changes are being reviewed on the parent instance, a child instance cannot do the following activities involving the parent instance:

-   Push changes to the parent instance.
-   Pull changes from the parent instance.
-   Reconcile changes with the parent instance.
-   Change the parent instance to another instance.
-   Delete the remote instance record for the parent instance.
