# Revert a change

You can undo changes to a customized record by reverting to an older version.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  View a list of version records for an object.

2.  Compare the current version to the older version to ensure that you are reverting the desired changes.

3.  Right-click the older version and select **Revert to this version**.

    A confirmation dialog box appears.

    If reverting to this version results in data loss due to a database schema change, a warning message appears in the dialog box.

4.  Click **OK** to confirm the action.

    -   The current version is marked as a previous version.
    -   A new version record is added that duplicates the version that you selected in the preceding step. This new version is marked as the current version.
    **Note:** You can revert to the most recent baseline version. You cannot revert to an older baseline version.
