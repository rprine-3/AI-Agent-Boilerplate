# Exclusion policies

You can exclude certain files from change tracking by creating an exclusion policy.

When a change matches an exclusion policy, the change does not generate records in the local changes list. The change still generates local version records and Update Set records as normal. See [Creating an Exclusion Policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/team-development/t_CreateAnExclusionPolicy.md).

**Note:** The exclusion policy applies to changes identified during a reconciliation operation. If you create an exclusion policy after a reconciliation, Team Development still tracks the changes until the next reconciliation.
