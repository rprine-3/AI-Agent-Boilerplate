# Version records

The Update Versions `[sys_update_version]` table contains records that represent the state of a customizable object at a particular time.

A customizable record is any object that is tracked by Update Sets, such as business rules or script includes. A new version record is created automatically whenever a user changes a customizable record or changes the application file for the customizable record.

A record represents the version of a base system object as it was delivered in the most recent upgrade. Baseline versions are created only for objects that have been modified by a user, and they are updated each time the system is upgraded.
