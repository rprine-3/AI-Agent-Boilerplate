# Access rights for developers

To use Team Development, application developers must have a set of credentials for each instance in the Team Development hierarchy.

An instance's placement in the [team development hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/team-development/t_SetUpAnInstanceHierarchy.md) determines the credentials it requires.

</table>**Note:** The teamdev\_user role does not grant access to the Team Development application and is not intended for developers to work on local development instances. It is intended to grant developers non-admin access to remote instances such as the parent instance or a peer development instance.
