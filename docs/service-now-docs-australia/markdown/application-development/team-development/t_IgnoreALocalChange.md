# Ignore a local change

Ignoring a local change prevents updates to a record from generating new versions in the Local Changes list.

## Before you begin

Role required: none.

## About this task

An ignored local change always points to the current version for the record. You cannot push ignored records to another instance.

|Action|Result|
|------|------|
|Ignore a record that has a version queued for push|The queued change is deleted|
|Ignore a record that has a version queued for code review|The queued change is deleted|
|Pull changes for an ignored record|Collision|
|Resolve a collision by taking the parent version|There is no longer a local change to ignore|
|Resolve a collision by keeping the local version|The ignored change remains on the local instance|

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Team Development** &gt; **Team Dashboard**.

2.  Filter the Local Changes list to show only the changes that you want to ignore.

    For example, filter the list to show all changes in the Default Update Set.

3.  Click **Ignore All**.

4.  Review the Ignored list to ensure that the correct changes are ignored.

    This step is a recommended best practice.
