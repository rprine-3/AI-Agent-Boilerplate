# Suppress versions

Administrators can configure a table so that it does not track customizations in the Versions `[sys_update_version]` table.

## Before you begin

Role required: none.

## About this task

**Warning:** If you suppress versions for tables, Team Development may work incorrectly, and you may be unable to compare and revert versions of records on the tables.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **sys\_properties.list**.

2.  Create a new property:

    -   Name: glide.update.suppress\_update\_version
    -   Type: string
    -   Value: a comma-separated list of tables. The default value is sys\_user,sys\_import\_set\_row.
