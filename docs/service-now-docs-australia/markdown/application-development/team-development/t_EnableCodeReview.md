# Enable a code review

You can require a code review of all changes pushed to an instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Team Development** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  Select the **Yes** check box for If this property is set to Yes, code review is required before pushing to this instance \(com.snc.teamdev.requires\_codereview\).

3.  Click **Save**.

    Setting this property adds the Code Review Requests module to the application menu and requires all changes pushed to this instance to remain in the Awaiting Code Review stage until someone in the Team Development Code Reviewers group approves them.
