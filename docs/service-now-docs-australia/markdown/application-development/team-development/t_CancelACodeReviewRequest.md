# Cancel a code review request

Developers can cancel any push they submitted that is in the Awaiting Code Review stage.

## Before you begin

Role required: none.

## About this task

Canceling a request sets the push to the **Code Review Request Cancelled** stage on the submitting instance. The submitting instance retains a version history of the push but the parent instance does not.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the instance that pushed the changes.

2.  Navigate to **Team Development** &gt; **Pushes and Pulls**.

3.  Filter for the push you want to cancel.

    **Note:** You cannot cancel a push that has been approved or rejected.

4.  Select the Push or Pull record.

5.  Click **Cancel Code Review**.
