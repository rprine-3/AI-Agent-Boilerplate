# Check the review status of a pushed change

If the parent instance requires pushed changes to undergo code review, changes are placed in the Awaiting Code Review stage.

## Before you begin

Role required: none.

## About this task

If you configure the parent instance to send [notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/team-development/c_CodeReviewNotifications.md), it sends the submitting developer a notification when the pushed changes are approved or rejected. Developers can also manually check the status of their pushed changes from the Pushes and Pulls module on the submitting instance.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the instance that submitted code for review.

2.  Navigate to **Team Development** &gt; **Pushes and Pulls**.

3.  Filter for the push you want to review.

    -   Pushes in the Complete stage are approved and applied to the parent instance.
    -   Pushes in the Collided stage are rejected because of a collision.
    -   Pushes in the Awaiting Code Review stage are awaiting review.
    -   Pushes in the Code Changes Rejected stage are rejected by a reviewer.
    -   Pushes in the Code Review Request Canceled stage are canceled by the submitting developer.
4.  Click the **Reviews** related list to see the following information.

    -   Who submitted a review decision.
    -   What the decision was: either approved or rejected
    -   What comments if any the reviewer provided.
