# Tool comparison for agentic development

Compare ServiceNow development tools to select the right approach for your agentic development needs.

The ServiceNow AI Platform provides multiple tools for agentic development. Each tool serves different use cases, skill levels, and development philosophies. Use this comparison to select the appropriate tool for your project.

## Tool comparison matrix

The following table shows a general comparison of ServiceNow agentic development tools.

</table>## Tool access

The following table shows how to access ServiceNow agentic development tools.

|Tool|Access method|
|----|-------------|
|Build Agent|Chat panel in ServiceNow Studio or ServiceNow IDE|
|ServiceNow Otto for Creator|Embedded in Service Catalog and Workflow Studio|
|ServiceNow SDK|Local VS Code or the ServiceNow IDE with ServiceNow Fluent SDK|

## Performance and scalability considerations

The following table shows performance and scaling considerations for ServiceNow agentic development tools.

|Tool|Best performance for|Limitations|
|----|--------------------|-----------|
|Build Agent|New applications with &lt; 20 tables|Limited support for cross-product integration|
|ServiceNow Studio|Iterative metadata updates; low-code workflows|Does not support complex custom code generation|
|ServiceNow IDE|Complex business rules, script includes, advanced customization|Developer expertise required|
|ServiceNow Otto for Creator|Service Catalog items \(one at a time\)|Creates single Service Catalog items, not full applications|
|ServiceNow SDK|Local development with TypeScript|Limited platform metadata manipulation compared to ServiceNow Studio|
