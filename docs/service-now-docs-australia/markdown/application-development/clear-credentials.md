# Clear instance credentials in Visual Studio Code

Clear the stored credentials of the current project from the system. User credentials \(instance URL, user name, password\) of a project are stored in the operating system credentials vault so that the user does not need to log in each time.

## Before you begin

Role required: none.

## About this task

Once you clear credentials from the current instance, the ServiceNow Extensions for Visual Studio Code extension prompts for authentication the next time you open VS Code. You can continue working in the current session.

**Note:** The password is not stored in the Visual Studio Code settings.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **View** &gt; **Command Palette**.

    You can also use a keyboard shortcut, Control+Shift+P on Windows or Command+Shift+P on MacOS to open the command palette.

2.  Choose **Now: Clear Credentials** from the command palette.

3.  Navigate to **Code** &gt; **Preferences** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Workspace** &gt; **Extensions** &gt; **ServiceNow** to check whether the credentials and the instance URL have been deleted.
