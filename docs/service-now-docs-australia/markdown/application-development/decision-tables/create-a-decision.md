# Create a decision table to resolve complex decisions

Create a decision table to help you resolve a complex decision that depends on multiple factors.

## Before you begin

Role required: decision\_table\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Create or select a table to use for your decision answer records.

    Associate an answer record to each decision on your decision table in later steps. This answer record is returned when that decision is reached based on your inputs. For information on creating a table, see [Create a table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateATable.md).

2.  Verify that one field on the table that you use for your decision records has been set as the display value.

    This field is used as a label when you display decision answers in Workflow Studio.

    You can use an existing table or create a table to use for your decision records.

3.  Create a record on this table to each answer in your decision.

    If you have modified an existing table, you might need to customize the form to show the fields that you have added.

4.  Create a decision table record.

    1.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Decision Tables**, and select **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Name|Descriptive label for this decision.|
        |Application|Application scope of this decision. This field defaults to the current scope.|
        |Answer table|Table that this decision uses for answer records. Select the table that you created in the previous steps.|
        |Accessible From|Option to limit the availability of this decision to the current scope. Select **All application scopes** or **This application scope only**.|

    3.  Right-click the form header and select **Save**.

        The form refreshes with the Decision Inputs and Decisions related lists.

5.  Create decision input records.

    1.  In the Decision Inputs related list, select **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
