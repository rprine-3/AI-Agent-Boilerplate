# Sync the current file between a Visual Studio Code workspace and a ServiceNow instance

Identify conflicting files and merge or overwrite the changes, between the current file in your Visual Studio Code workspace and your instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Click the **Sync** icon \[Omitted image "vscode-sync-current-file.png"\] Alt text: Sync current file icon from the menu on the top-right corner of the Visual Studio Code IDE.

    You can also use a keyboard shortcut Control+Shift+P in Windows and Command+Shift+P in MacOS to open the command palette and choose **Now: Sync Current File** from the list.

    -   If the changes occur either on the server or on the client, the extension synchronizes the file successfully without showing up any errors.
    -   If there are no differences between the local and server versions, then the message **No changes detected** appears on the bottom of the page.
    -   If the same file is modified both on the client and the server, then the system displays the conflicts in a **Conflicting Files** dialog box.
2.  If a conflict list is displayed in a **Conflicting Files** dialog box, check the conflicts.

    -   Compare the **Server** and **Client** version using the **Diff** window, and evaluate the changes.
    -   Override the **Server** or **Client** changes.

3.  Check for the differences in the **Conflicting Files** list.

    \[Omitted image "vscode-opendiff.png"\] Alt text: Conflicting changes display

    A dialog box displays the following options:

    -   Open Diff: Check for the differences between two versions and make the necessary changes.
    -   Mark Resolved: Resolve the differences and sync the versions.
    -   Overwrite Server: Choose if you want to override the server version with the client version.
    -   Overwrite Local: Choose **Override Local** to override the local version with the server version.
4.  Click **Open Diff**.

    You can see two versions of the file with the differences highlighted.

5.  Make changes to the server version from the client version and save the file.

6.  Click **Mark as Resolved** under **Conflicting Files**.

    The changes are successfully synchronized upon the next synchronization. When the changes are merged successfully, the message **Sync completed successfully** appears at the bottom of the page.
