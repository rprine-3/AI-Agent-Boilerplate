ServiceNow IDE and ServiceNow SDK: Build apps in source code.

</td><td>

Source code developers

</td><td>

Develop applications in source code with ServiceNow Fluent, create JavaScript modules, and use third-party libraries. ServiceNow Fluent is a domain-specific programming language for creating application metadata in code. Use Build Agent in ServiceNow IDE to create and update apps in source code with a conversational interaction.The ServiceNow IDE runs Visual Studio Code for the Web on the ServiceNow AI Platform. The ServiceNow SDK runs Visual Studio Code Desktop locally.

</table>## What is low-code development

Low-code development is a new approach to app creation that allows users with limited coding experience to create powerful apps. Low-code development platforms rely on graphical interfaces and configuration instead of manual coding. These new low-code development platforms enable more people to create and deploy apps quickly and efficiently.

## Benefits of low-code development

Low-code app development streamlines the development process to build more apps faster. Low-code solutions require fewer developers, and allow non-developers to build apps. Pre-built templates provide developers a head start building apps. System administrators can manage app development from a single location and collaborate with other developers. Decrease the time that it takes to deploy apps using predefined workflows in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## No-code development tool example

Creator Studio makes creating basic request-fufillment apps easier by dividing their creation into simple steps. You can create forms for users to request catalog items and use form submissions to initiate automated playbooks.

## What is mid-code development

If you're comfortable with the ServiceNow AI Platform and some development tools, use the new [ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/servicenow-studio-landing.md) to access all of the builders and development tools in one place.

## Mid-code development tool example

## What is pro-code development

Pro-code development is used by developers to create complex apps that can't be built with a low-code tool. Traditionally, pro-code development is used to create apps from scratch using custom code to solve a business need. Developers need to have knowledge of coding and how to use programming languages to build apps.

## Benefits of pro-code development

The advantage of pro-code development is being able to create custom apps without the limitation of a tool. You can build custom apps unique to your business needs without limits. Developers can create apps with a custom look and feel to match your company's branding.

## Low-code versus no-code

The terms low-code and no-code tend to get used interchangeably, but they aren't exactly the same thing. While both low-code and no-code solutions provide tools for simplified app development, the differences are worth considering.

-   **Low-code**

    Low-code platforms are designed for professional developers and non-technical business users. They require very little training or experience and use visual-based modeling to streamline the development process. They also allow people with coding experience to dive deeper, coding by hand when needed.

-   **No-code**

    No-code platforms require no development experience, and are designed specifically for citizen developers and business users. No-code solutions open app development up to essentially everyone, but can lead to shadow IT—unsanctioned app development within an organization.
