# Creation restrictions across application scopes

The system restricts the creation of some configuration records when the current application scope does not match the application scope of the configuration record's target table.

Configuration record creation restrictions prevent one application from making unwanted changes to another application's data tables. These restrictions only apply when you create a configuration record whose target table belongs to another application. Configuration records that belong to the same application scope do not have these restrictions.

The system always enforces the following creation restrictions when a developer adds a configuration record belonging to another application scope.
