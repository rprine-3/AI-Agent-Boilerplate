# Find existing apps in Creator Studio

Perhaps you’ve been given permission to work on an app someone else created, or you want to add new items to the catalog in your app. The Creator Studio home page acts as your central hub, listing all the apps people in your company have built using Creator Studio.

## Before you begin

**Summary:** In this topic, you’ll learn how to:

-   Find an app in Creator Studio.
-   Open an existing app.
-   Perform actions on an app without opening it.

**Get permission**

To work on an app, your system administrator has to assign you the role of sn\_creatorstudio.user or sn\_creatorstudio.restricted\_user.

## About this task

**Techy detail:** All the apps listed on the Creator Studio home page have an entry in the Request App Config table \(sn\_creatorstudio\_request\_app\_config\).

**You can use bookmarks for apps too**

In addition to the searching detailed in this topic, you can use bookmarks to save and quickly find the app you're looking for. Check out [Work with bookmarked apps in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/crs-work-with-bookmarked-apps.md) for details.

**Find the app you want to work on**

There could be a lot of apps listed on the Creator Studio home page. Here’s how to find the one you want to work on.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **Creator Studio**.

    The Creator Studio home page appears, which displays the apps most recently created by everyone in your company using Creator Studio.

    \[Omitted image "crs-homepage-all-apps-srch.png"\] Alt text: Creator Studio home page with all apps seen in a card view

2.  Would you prefer to see the apps in a list instead of displayed as cards? Select the view icon \[Omitted image "cs-view-icon.png"\] Alt text: view icon and switch to **List View**.

    \[Omitted image "crs-homepage-all-apps-list-srch.png"\] Alt text: Creator Studio home page with all apps shown in a list

3.  If you know the name of the app you're looking for, start typing it the search bar.

    You must enter at least three characters for Creator Studio to filter the apps on your search criteria.

    **Note:** If you enter text in the search bar, all of the pills \(such as **Your app** and **Bookmarks**\) are also filtered based on the search term.

4.  Narrow down the list of apps displayed by selecting one of the following:

    -   **All apps**: Displays all the apps everyone in your company created using Creator Studio.
    -   **Your apps**: Displays only the apps that you created. \(You own the apps that you create.\)
    -   **Shared with you**: Displays only the apps you didn’t create, but the owner said you could work on.

        For more information about working collaboratively on an app, see [Delegated development and deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-and-deployment/c_DelegatedDevelopment.md).

5.  Sort the list of displayed apps by selecting the drop-down sorting menu and then selecting one of the following options:

    -   **Last accessed**: Lists the displayed apps based on the last time you worked on them; the most recently accessed app appears first in the list.
    -   **Newest**: Lists the apps in the order of their creation date, newest to oldest.
    -   **Oldest**: Lists the apps in the order of their creation date, oldest to newest.
    -   **A-Z** or **Z-A**: Lists the displayed apps alphabetically in the order you choose.
    **Note:** If you've entered text in the search bar, sorting respects the filtered search criteria.

6.  5. Select an app to open it in Creator Studio or select the more actions icon \[Omitted image "cs-more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More options enable you to take action on an app and select one of the following:

    -   **Open in new tab**: Open the app in a different browser tab.
    -   **Open in ServiceNow Studio**: Open the app in ServiceNow Studio to make more advanced edits.

        **Note:** You must have access to ServiceNow Studio for this option to appear. For more information on ServiceNow Studio, see [Using ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/using-servicenow-studio.md).

    -   **Manage collaborators**: If you’re the app owner, you can invite others to work on the app with you. For more information, see [Manage collaborators for an app in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-manage-collaborators.md).
    -   **Copy link**: Send collaborators a link to the app so they can find it.
    -   **Settings**: Update the app’s image and other settings. For more information, see [Edit an app's settings in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-edit-app-settings.md).
7.  Select **Request access** to open an app that you don’t have permission to work on.

    To open an app, you must own it, or the owner must give you permission. For more information about requesting access, see [Ask to work on an app in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-request-join-app.md).
