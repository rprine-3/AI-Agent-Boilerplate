# Hide a form from use in the ServiceNow AI Platform in Creator Studio

Hiding a catalog item for your app's form effectively makes the form inactive. Hidden forms are unavailable in both the app and the catalog it belongs to.

## Before you begin

To hide a form, you must be given permission to work on the app.

## About this task

If a form hasn't been published yet, you can delete it instead of hiding it. See [Delete a form in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/crs-delete-form.md) for details.

You can hide only forms that have already been published. For more information, see [Deploying your Creator Studio app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-publishing-apps.md).

## Procedure

1.  Go to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **Creator Studio** to see all the apps on the Creator Studio home page.

2.  Open the app that contains the form you want to hide.

3.  Select the form that you want to hide in the navigation panel.

    If you have multiple forms, make sure to select the form you're hiding.

6.  De-select the **Make form visible to others** option.

7.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

Your admin must re-deploy the app to hide the inactive form \(catalog item\) on the production instance.
