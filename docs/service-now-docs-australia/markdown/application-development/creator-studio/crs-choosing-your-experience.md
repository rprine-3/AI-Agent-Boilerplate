# Choosing your development experience

If you want to develop apps in a more robust environment than Creator Studio, which was designed for no-code developers, you can select a different experience directly from within Creator Studio.

## A development environment for every level

Use the experience switcher to select from any of the following development environments directly within Creator Studio, without navigating to the **All** menu.

**Important:** No matter what your role is \(including admin and delegated developer roles\), if you have one of the Creator Studio roles, you won't be able to access ServiceNow Studio or ServiceNow IDE.

|Development experience|Level|Description|
|----------------------|-----|-----------|
|Creator Studio|No-code|Enables quick creation of basic applications through an intuitive, guided environment, ideal for beginners or those needing fast results.|
|ServiceNow Studio|Platform developer|Offers a balance of simplicity and power, facilitating the development and management of metadata and integrated builders within a navigable interface.|
|ServiceNow IDE|Pro-code|Provides advanced developers with a professional coding environment, using VS Code for direct metadata editing, suited for intricate and detailed application development.|

Being able to easily switch between development experiences eliminates the fragmentation of development tools, reducing confusion and centralizing development activities across all skill levels.

For example, you can build a basic request app in Creator Studio, and then switch to ServiceNow Studio to add more robust functionality.

For details on switching experiences, see [Change your development experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/crs-change-dev-experience.md).

## Open an app directly in ServiceNow Studio

If you have access to ServiceNow Studio, you can open an app there by selecting the more actions icon on the home page \(\[Omitted image "cs-more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More options enable you to take action on an app\) and choosing to **Open in ServiceNow Studio**.

You can also select the more actions icon \[Omitted image "sn-studio-more-options-icon.png"\] in the navigation panel and then select **Open in ServiceNow Studio**.

## Sharing apps between development experiences

All apps that are made and bookmarked in Creator Studio are bookmarked and available to work on in ServiceNow Studio. However, apps that are made in ServiceNow Studio are not available to work on in Creator Studio.

## Who can access the studios in the experience switcher

The experience switcher can provide access to Creator Studio, ServiceNow Studio, ServiceNow IDE. However, whether you can see and select all of those depends on your role or access level. For more information, see [Administering access to the experience switcher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/crs-experience-switcher-role-access.md).

**Note:** In addition to Creator Studio, you must have access to at least one other product \(ServiceNow Studio or ServiceNow IDE\) to see the experience switcher.

The following describes default role access to the experience switcher:

-   Admins and delegated developers can use the experience switcher because they may need access to any product where they've been delegated to administer or develop an app.
-   Creator Studio users and Creator Studio restricted users don't generally have access to the experience switcher because administrators limit them to a more curated experience.
