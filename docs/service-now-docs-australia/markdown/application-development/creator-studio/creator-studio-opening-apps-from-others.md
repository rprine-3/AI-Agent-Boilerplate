# App compatibility with Creator Studio

You can open apps built in Creator Studio in other ServiceNow products, but only apps built in Creator Studio can be opened in Creator Studio.

## Opening Creator Studio apps in other products

After you build an app in Creator Studio, you can open it in several other products. For example, you could build an app in Creator Studio and then use the **Open in ServiceNow Studio** link from the app on the home page open it in ServiceNow Studio, where you can add more complex flows in the automation.

If you add complex functionality to an app in another builder and then re-open the app in Creator Studio, you'll be warned in the appropriate context. For example, if you add complexity to a playbook that's not supported in Creator Studio, then Creator Studio will display a minimal version of the playbook or activity and instruct you to open it in Workflow Studio.

For more information, see the following products:

-   [ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/servicenow-studio-landing.md)
-   [Catalog Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/catalog-builder.md)

## Opening apps built in other products in Creator Studio

You can't open apps created outside of Creator Studio in Creator Studio. For example, you can't open apps built in ServiceNow Studio in Creator Studio.

However, if you create an app in Creator Studio and then add a form to it from outside of Creator Studio \(for example, from Service Catalog\), then Creator Studio tries to show the outside form.
