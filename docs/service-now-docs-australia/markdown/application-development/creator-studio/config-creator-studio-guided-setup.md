# Configure Creator Studio using Guided Setup

So you've installed Creator Studio on an instance. Now what? You must configure it before users can start building apps.

## Before you begin

Creator Studio must be installed on the instance before you can configure it. Find out more about that in [Installing Creator Studio from the ServiceNow Store](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/installing-creator-studio-from-the-store.md).

To ensure that forms appear correctly for users, the non-production and production instances must have the same Service Catalog and all of its categories.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Guided Setup streamlines configuring Creator Studio, and keeps track of what you have completed, so you can stop and start again where you left off.

In this Guided Setup, you'll configure user access and collaboration settings to control who can do what in Creator Studio.

## Procedure

1.  Let's open Guided Setup. On your instance, select the **All** tab.

    \[Omitted image "cs-all-menu.png"\] Alt text: Interface showing All, Favorites, and History tabs with a Filter field.

2.  In the white text field, enter `App Engine`.

    The list of apps displayed underneath the text box now pertains only to App Engine.

3.  In the list, select **Guided Setup – Shared**, which starts the configuration process.

    The Guided Setup app opens, where you make some basic configurations.

    \[Omitted image "cs-guided-setup.png"\] Alt text: Guided Setup walks you through Creator Studio configuration tasks

4.  Start the setup process by selecting the **Get Started** button.

5.  Select the **Welcome to App Engine Guided Setup​** breadcrumb link to return to the main Guided Setup page.

### What to do next

## Configure the table for Creator Studio apps

Use Guided Setup to change the table that the app saves its requests to.

### About this task

Some general guidelines for changing the table are:

-   If you change an app's table to one that doesn't extend a Request Task-extended table, it could affect automations.
-   If the new table doesn't have the **request\_type** field, the app's automations won't be correctly triggered.

    **Note:** You can change the **Request type** field, which specifies the form, on the Request Task table or a table that extends Request Task. To do so, you must be an admin or have the sn\_creatorstudio.configuration\_admin or sn\_creatorstudio.task\_admin role.

-   The request\_type field for the new table should have the label **Request type**, and it should be a reference to the Record Producer table.
-   If the new table isn’t in the same scope as the app, the scope of the table must allow updates from other scopes.

### Before you begin

Initiate the Guided Setup as described in [Configure Creator Studio using Guided Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/config-creator-studio-guided-setup.md).

The app must already be created before you can change the table for it.

### Before you begin

For more information on changing an app's table, see [Changing the table for an app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-admin-app-table-about.md).

Role required: admin, app configurator \(sn\_creatorstudio.app\_configurator\), or Creator Studio configuration admin \(sn\_creatorstudio.configuration\_admin\). For more information on working with granular roles, see [Granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).

### Procedure

1.  Select the **Configure** button for the Configure the associated table for Creator Studio Service Desk apps section.

    All of the apps built on the instance in Creator Studio appear.

    \[Omitted image "crs-setup-table-list.png"\] Alt text: List of apps in Guided Setup

2.  Select the app that you want to change the table for.

    **Note:** You may need to change the scope that you're in.

3.  Change the table.

    1.  Select into the **Request table** field.

    2.  Search for and select the table that you want to associate the app with.

        \[Omitted image "crs-setup-table-change.png"\] Alt text: Search for and select the table to change to

4.  Select the **Update** button.


### Result

The associated table for an app changes to the new table. Any users currently in Creator Studio may need to refresh their browser to see the change.
