# Deleting forms and questions in Creator Studio

Deleting unpublished forms and questions from Creator Studio removes them completely from the ServiceNow AI Platform.

To delete a form or question, you must have the admin role, or be an owner or editor of the app. For details on owning and editing apps, see [Collaborating with others to build apps in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-collaboration-roles.md).

If a form has been published, you can hide it to make it inactive without deleting it. Check out [Hide a form from use in the ServiceNow AI Platform in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-deactivate-form.md) for more information.

## Deleting forms

Deleting a form completely removes the form's record from the ServiceNow AI Platform, including from Catalog Builder.

**Note:** You can't delete the following items:

-   Forms after they’ve been published
-   Drafts of previously published forms

## Deleting questions from forms

Deleting a question from an unpublished form completely removes the record for the question from the ServiceNow AI Platform, including from Catalog Builder.

However, if you delete a question from a form that has already been published, the record for the question remains in Catalog Builder but is marked as inactive.

To delete a question from a form, select the question and the select the delete icon. You must then confirm the deletion in a modal.

Hiding a catalog item for your app's form effectively makes the form inactive. Hidden forms are unavailable in both the app and the catalog it belongs to.
