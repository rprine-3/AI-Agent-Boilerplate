# Show the AES template

You can make the App Engine Studio \(AES\) template, which is hidden by default, appear for users when they create an app in Creator Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the **All** menu.

2.  Type `sys_properties.list` and press Enter.

3.  Enter **com.glide.creator\_studio.template\_deny\_list** in the **Name** column, and then press Enter.

4.  Clear the entry from the **Value** field.

    If you want to hide any other templates, enter their system values \(sys\_id for each template\) in the **Value** field, separated by commas.
