# Administering notification emails in Creator Studio

Admins can customize existing email notifications and create templates for new email notifications that Creator Studio apps send. For example, you can add branding to notification emails that a request was opened.

Customized email templates can be applied to notifications that are sent when users request something from an app, or the request was changed or closed.

## Ways to customize email notifications

Admins can customize notification emails in two ways:

1.  Using Guided Setup.
2.  Using the \[sysevent\_email\_action\] table. For more information on creating and editing notification emails on the ServiceNow AI Platform, see [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md).

## Scopes for email notifications

The following default email notifications are in the public scope, and can thus be edited by all admins:

1.  Request assigned to me
2.  Request assigned to my group
3.  Request closed
4.  Request opened

**Note:** Depending on your scope, you may need to switch to the Creator Studio Configurations scope to make changes.

In addition to the default emails, you can create custom email notifications that the ServiceNow AI Platform sends when it runs a playbook.
