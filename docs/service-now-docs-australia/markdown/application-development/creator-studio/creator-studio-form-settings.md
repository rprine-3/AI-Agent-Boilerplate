# Creator Studio form settings

You can edit the settings for an app's form in Creator Studio at any time. For example, to change who can access it.

## General form settings

The **General** tab defines the form's basic information and how things appear on it.

<table id="table_shx_2x1_j1c"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Form name

</td><td>

Name of the form. Apps can have multiple forms. If you want to edit the settings for a different form, select that form in the navigation panel.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short description

</td><td>

Brief description of what the form is used for. For example, "Laptop request form."

</td></tr><tr><td>

Image

</td><td>

Image to appear on the form. Select the logo and navigate to a JPG, PNG, or SVG file to upload.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Informative reason why people should use the form. You can include content like videos, images, and links to other sources of information, such as knowledge base articles.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Make form visible to others

</td><td>

Option to have the form available outside of the app, for example, in the specified catalogs.

 You can edit this option only for forms that have been published.

 **Note:** You can also specify whether the form is visible after deployment when you're ready to deploy your app. Find out how in [Request deployment for your app from Creator Studio to production](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-deploy-app-to-prod.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Hide "Add to wish list" option

</td><td>

Option to prevent users from favoriting the form on their wish list. Favoriting a form makes it easier to find.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Hide attachment option

</td><td>

Option to prevent users from adding attachments to the form.**Note:** You can hide the attachment option for the whole form and instead add an attachment question that appears when users provide a specific answer to a question. For more information, see [Available question types in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-form-elements-ref.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mark attachment as mandatory

</td><td>

Option to require attachments on the form. If you select the **Hide attachment option** setting, you can't select this setting.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Uneditable form settings

After you create the app, its **Template** can't be edited. If you want to change it, create a new form using a different catalog template.

## Catalog location form settings

Location settings define where the form appears in a catalog, how it's categorized, and what topics it appears for. You must select the edit icon \[Omitted image "cs-edit-form-location.png"\] Alt text: Edit form location icon to make changes to the catalog and topic settings.

Select the catalog that represents the business area the app will use. For example, you could select a service catalog that contains software and laptop cables for an IT fulfillment app. Expand the caret for each catalog to see its sub-catalogs. Then select as many items in the catalogs as you need.

If you associate the app's form with one or more topics, the form will appear in the relevant, dynamically created topic pages in Employee Center. Find out more about topics in [Associate a catalog item with a taxonomy topic in Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/associate-cat-item-taxonomy-ec.md), and more about taxonomy, which is a categorization method, in [Unified Taxonomy for Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/config-taxonomy.md).

## User access form settings

Select the edit icon \[Omitted image "cs-edit-form-location.png"\] Alt text: Edit form location icon to define access for roles and groups for the following:

-   **Available for**: Search for and select roles and groups that can access the form.
-   **Not available for**: Search for and select roles and groups that can't access the form.
