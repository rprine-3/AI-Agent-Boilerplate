# I've built my app in Creator Studio, now what?

You've added forms and automation to your app, and customized the workspace list configurations. Now what?

## What happens after I submit my app for review?

When you finish creating your app and select to **Submit for review**, your admin gets a deployment request. They then review your app deployment request and move the app to production.

After the app is deployed to production, the forms are available on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Where do I find my app after it's deployed?

After deployment, your app lives as forms in the Service Catalog and categories you specified when creating the forms.

Users can access those forms directly in a Service Catalog, as well as Service Portal and an Employee Center.

If you associate the app's form with one or more topics, the form will appear in the relevant, dynamically created topic pages in Employee Center. Find out more about topics in [Associate a catalog item with a taxonomy topic in Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/associate-cat-item-taxonomy-ec.md), and more about taxonomy, which is a categorization method, in [Unified Taxonomy for Employee Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/config-taxonomy.md).

## Where do fulfillers work on submitted forms?

Fulfillers access the default workspace on the ServiceNow AI Platform by going to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **Request App Workspace**. The Request App Workspace displays a category for each app with filtered lists of records, both default and any extra that you added. Fulfillers then select a record to view the details of the request and make updates as needed.

**Note:** You can't access the Request App Workspace as the owner of an app, though you can access it if you also have an admin or the applicable agent role. The app's agent role is &lt;app scope&gt;.agent, for example, x\_snc\_app\_name.agent.

You can preview and interact with how records appear in the workspace category directly within Creator Studio by navigating to the **List categories** section of the navigation panel and selecting a record.

## Can I continue developing my app in other ServiceNow AI Platform builders?

You can open Creator Studio apps in other builders. For example, open it in ServiceNow Studio to add more experiences or complex automations.An **Open in ServiceNow Studio** link, available from the app's tile on the Creator Studio home page, takes you directly to the app in ServiceNow Studio.

The records that your app creates when a form is completed are not automatically closed, and some notifications are not automatic and must be configured.
