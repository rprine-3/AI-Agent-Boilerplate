# Creator Studio apps and tables

Creator Studio uses catalog templates to streamline the app creation process. Apps use the Request Task table by default, generating a new row for each submitted request, though admins can change the associated table for an app.

**Summary:** After reading this section, you'll understand:

-   The parts that go into building an app
-   Where requests from the apps go
-   How tables are used to store requests

## Parts of building an app

Apps contain one or all of the following parts.

|Functionality|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|Form|When filled out, forms create a record with an associated task or workflow on the ServiceNow AI Platform.|
|Automation|Automation contains playbooks, or automated processes with limited actions that enable users to update records and complete tasks across multiple activities.|
|Workspace list configurations and record details|Workspace configuration that shows requests for the app built in Creator Studio, with standard and customizable filtered lists. Selecting a record in the **List configurations** section displays the record, which you can interact with in Creator Studio, enabling you to see how it will look.|

Your admin can create catalog templates to guide the process of building forms. For more information, see [Working with forms in Creator Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-work-with-forms.md).

## Where requests from the apps go

Every app in Creator Studio automatically creates a table where all opened records go when people use the app. By default, the tables that Creator Studio apps generate extend the Request Task table that comes with Creator Studio, which extends the Task table. Your admin may change the associated app for a table, but it should still extend the Task table.

**Note:**

-   If an app's associated table is changed to one that doesn't extend the Request Task table, automations won't work.
-   You can change the **Request type** field, which specifies the form, on the Request Task table or a table that extends Request Task. To do so, you must be an admin or have the sn\_creatorstudio.configuration\_admin or sn\_creatorstudio.task\_admin role.

[Extending](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-glossary.md) a table means the new table inherits the parent \(extended\) table's columns, as well as its business logic. For more information on Task tables, see [Working with the Task table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_TaskTable.md).

For sys admin eyes only: Every app built in Creator Studio adds a record in the Request App Config table, which contains the table that the app uses. Your admin can change the table for an app, see [Administering an app's associated table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-admin-app-table.md) for more information. The name of the table follows the format of scope\_request, for example, x\_snc\_02\_03\_request.

**Key term:**

-   **Record**

    A record is what the ServiceNow AI Platform generates for each request submitted through your app. Each record corresponds to a row in the app's Request Task or associated table.
