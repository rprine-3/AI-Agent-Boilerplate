</table>## What apps are in ServiceNow

A ServiceNow app is a package that performs a specific task for a specified group of users. Think of an app as a container with a set of rules around who can access and edit it. For example, ServiceNow apps can include an API, a table, a workspace, a form, a flow, or any combination of those things.

A Creator Studio app uses forms and automation to enable users to request something and move the request through the approval process. Creator Studio also enables you to the see the fulfiller's view of the Request App Workspace for the app.

## What you can do after you build an app in Creator Studio

After you build an app in Creator Studio, you can open the app in any other ServiceNow builder so that you can add more advanced functionality without rebuilding from scratch.

For example:

-   Open the app in Workflow Studio to add complex [automations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-glossary.md).
-   Open the app in ServiceNow Studio to add different interfaces.Select **Open in ServiceNow Studio** from the app's tile on the Creator Studio home page to open the app directly.
