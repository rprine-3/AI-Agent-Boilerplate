# Artifacts that Creator Studio generates when users create an app

When a user creates an app in Creator Studio, the ServiceNow AI Platform creates several metadata artifacts, such as tables.

For each app users add in Creator Studio, the following artifacts are added to the ServiceNow AI Platform.

<table id="table_ixk_trh_2bc"><thead><tr><th>

New table that extends from the base Request Task table

</td><td>

-   Name: \[scope\]\_request \(for example, x\_snc\_marketing\_request\)
-   Label: \[App name\] + Requests \(for example, Marketing Request\)

 **Note:** All of the form questions are stored as catalog variables in the app's Request Task table. However, admins can change the associated table for an app, see [Administering an app's associated table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-admin-app-table.md) for more information.
