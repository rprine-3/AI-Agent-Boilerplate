# Change a Creator Studio app's table

Change the table associated with an app if you want one that differs from the default.

## Before you begin

**Note:** You should perform this task only if you did not change the table during Guided Setup. For more information, see [Configure the table for Creator Studio apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/config-creator-studio-guided-setup.md).

The app must already be created before you can change the table for it.

Some general guidelines for changing the table are:

-   If you change an app's table to one that doesn't extend a Request Task-extended table, it could affect automations.
-   If the new table doesn't have the **request\_type** field, the app's automations won't be correctly triggered.

    **Note:** You can change the **Request type** field, which specifies the form, on the Request Task table or a table that extends Request Task. To do so, you must be an admin or have the sn\_creatorstudio.configuration\_admin or sn\_creatorstudio.task\_admin role.

-   The request\_type field for the new table should have the label **Request type**, and it should be a reference to the Record Producer table.
-   If the new table isn’t in the same scope as the app, the scope of the table must allow updates from other scopes.

See [Changing the table for an app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-admin-app-table-about.md) for more information.

Role required: admin, app configurator \(sn\_creatorstudio.app\_configurator\), or Creator Studio configuration admin \(sn\_creatorstudio.configuration\_admin\). For more information on working with granular roles, see [Granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).

## About this task

To ensure that forms and automations work, a general guideline is to change the table to a table that extends the Request Task table.

## Procedure

1.  Open the **All** menu and enter `sn_creatorstudio_request_app_config.list`.

2.  Enter the app name in the search box for the **Name** column and press Enter.

    **Note:** You must enter the first word of the app name, not subsequent words in the app name.

3.  Select the app from the list.

4.  Change the scope to the app's scope or a global scope if you're not in the correct scope.

    You can change the scope in one of the following ways:

    -   Selecting the **here** in the message "To edit the record click here."
    -   Selecting the application scope icon \[Omitted image "icon-scope-changed.png"\] and choosing the appropriate scope.
    For more information on scopes, see [Application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationScope.md).

5.  Enter the name of the table you want the app to write to in the **Request table** field.

    The table should extend the Request Task table and have the **request\_type** field. For more details on what table you can use, see [Requirements for changing the table for an app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-admin-app-table-about.md).

6.  Select **Update** to save your changes.
