# Add a decision to an app's playbook in Creator Studio

Add decisions, which are if/then conditions, to define branches, or different paths of an automation's playbook in Creator Studio.

## Before you begin

To add decisions to a playbook, you must be given permission to work on the app.

## About this task

Each decision should have at least two branches, with each branch representing a possible outcome for the decision. The second branch can be the ELSE branch, which is required. The ELSE branch will be followed when all other conditions on other branches are false. Think of the else branch as the catch-all case for the decision.

2.  Open the app that contains the playbook you want to add a decision to.

3.  Select the form that contains the playbook that you want to add a decision to.

4.  Select the automation that contains the playbook that you want to add a decision to.

</table>9.  Create the conditions for each branch, or possible outcome for the decision on the **Branches** tab of the Decision properties panel.

    1.  Enter a name for the branch in the **Branch label** field.

    2.  Select the **Add condition** button and specify what conditions should be met for the branch to take effect.

        You can use the answer from the associated form to define the conditions for the decision branch. To do so, complete the following steps:

        2.  Select the form's question to use as the condition from the **Question** field.
        3.  Specify the condition **Operator** and the answer's **Value**.
        4.  Select **Apply** when you're done defining the condition.

    3.  Select the **Add new branch** button and add as many branches as needed.
