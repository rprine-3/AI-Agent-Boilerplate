# Change the layout of an app's record in Creator Studio

Adjust how the submitted records that your app generates will look, such as the order in which fields appear.

## Before you begin

To change the layout of an app's submitted record in the fulfiller workspace configuration, you must be given permission to work on the app.

## About this task

All columns of the app's associated table are available as fields on the record page, though you may want to adjust them. For example, you may want to move the **Priority** field to appear more visibly on the record so fulfillers can tell how important the request is. You could then build an automated playbook that runs when the priority changes to high.

**Note:** You can't edit UI policies or make more advanced edits to the form in Creator Studio. To make advanced edits, open the record in Table Builder. For more information, see [Forms in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/form-view-configuration.md).

## Procedure

1.  Go to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **Creator Studio** to see all the apps on the Creator Studio home page.

2.  Open the app that contains the workspace record details that you want to edit.

3.  Select the **Record details** section in the navigation panel.

4.  Make any additional changes to how the record appears, such as moving the fields around.

    Check out [Important Task table fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_ImportantTaskTableFields.md) for a list of the most commonly used fields that you can work with and their definitions.

5.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

After you're done customizing how the app's records will appear, you can check out how they'll look in the Request App Workspace while remaining in Creator Studio. For more information, see [Preview how an app's records appear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/creator-studio/creator-studio-preview-record.md).
