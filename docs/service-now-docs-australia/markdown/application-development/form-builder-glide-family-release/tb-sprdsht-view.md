# Spreadsheet view in Table Builder

Use **Spreadsheet** view in Table Builder to work with your application data records and data structure in a spreadsheet format.

## Overview of the Spreadsheet view

**Spreadsheet** view in Table Builder, enables you to review your application tables and their accompanying data in a familiar spreadsheet format. You can add columns, delete columns, and change column properties as well as review and update individual data records within those columns from a single screen.

## Saving data records in Spreadsheet view

Sometimes errors occur when trying to save data records \( data conflicting with applicable policies or business rules\). When this happens, a warning popup displays along with a filtered list of erroneous data records.

Correct the data in each record individually, or select **Revert record changes** to revert any changes you made to the erroneous records.
