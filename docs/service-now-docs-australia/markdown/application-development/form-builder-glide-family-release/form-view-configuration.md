# Forms in Table Builder

On the **Forms** tab in Table Builder, you can visually create, configure, and customize the different form views for your users using the form editor. The views that you define contain the elements that appear when a user opens that form or list.

## Form View

A form view defines the elements that appear to a user when the user opens a form or list. Each form has a default view, but you may want to create several different form views for different groups of users.

In Table Builder, you can customize multiple views for a form for the different users who input data or view the form. You can also customize the default form view for everyone.

Explore the following major areas when you configure a form or list:

-   Form view selection
-   All form views list
-   Form layout
-   Form fields
-   Form annotations
-   Formatters
-   Embedded lists

## Basic form navigation

The **Forms** tab consists of the following four major areas:

-   Top navigation menu
-   Add form elements panel
-   Form editor
-   Configuration panel

The following table contains a list of some of the other basic navigational elements within the **Forms** tab in Table Builder.

-   Navigate to a filterable, sortable list of all form views by selecting **All form views**. See [All form views list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/form-view-configuration.md).

Changes to the form made in the editor are committed to the selected view.**Note:** The more options button \[Omitted image "ellipses.png"\] Alt text: Ellipses is visible only when forms are accessed through ServiceNow Studio or App Engine Studio and not through ServiceNow AI Platform.

## All form views list

Select **All form views** from the Additional actions menu to the right of the **Forms** tab to browse a filterable list of form view cards \(vertical ellipsis\). This page allows you to create complex filtering and sorting if you have a great deal of form views to navigate.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Form layout \(sections\)

A view is composed of sections that group the data elements that you want displayed.

You can add multiple sections and change the layout of each section into one or two columns. A section is where you can group the data elements that you want to display for a form view. These elements include form fields, annotations, formatters, and embedded lists.

See [Customize your form layout in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/customize-form-layout.md).

## Form fields

When you select a table in Table Builder, the available fields are displayed in the form elements panel. You can create fields for the table or configure the fields and their properties.

By dragging these fields into the form editor, you can then visually arrange these fields on the form view you have selected.

See [Add fields to a form layout in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/add-form-fields.md).

See [Modify field properties in Table Builder form editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/modify-field-properties.md).

## Form annotations

A form annotation is an additional piece of information on a form, such as a line or paragraph of text.

For example, you may want to add instructional text for a particular section on the form. By using Table Builder, you can add a form annotation to the view that displays on-screen instructions on how a user should enter information.

See [Create form annotations in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/create-form-annotations.md).

## Formatters

A **Formatter** is a read-only element in a form that displays additional information about the selected table record. Unlike fields, formatters are not editable.

See [Using formatters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_Formatters.md).

By using Table Builder, you can visually drag any of the displayed formatters onto the form editor and arrange them.

See [Add formatters in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/add-formatters.md).

## Embedded lists

You can use an embedded list to display the data for a selected related list on a form. A related list shows the records in the tables that have relationships to the current record. For example, for a form view that references a Problem table, you might want to display a list of locations that are impacted by a selected problem.

With Table Builder, you can visually drag a list from the **Embedded Lists** tab of the form elements panel onto the form editor, and then arrange them.

By adding an embedded list to a form, you enable your users to view or edit the related list without needing to navigate away from the form. Changes to the data in the list are saved when the user saves the form.

See [Add embedded lists in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/add-embedded-lists-form.md).
