# Accessing Table Builder

You can access Table Builder in several ways.

## Launching Table Builder using naming shortcuts

You can use naming shortcuts to open tables from the app navigator.

Enter `tablename.builder`, `tablename.view`, `tablename.sheet`, or `tablename.flow` in the search to access the table directly. For example, searching `incident.builder` in the search opens field view of the incident table in the Data tab.
