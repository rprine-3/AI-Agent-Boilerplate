# Field configuration in Table Builder

You can configure the basic field properties for any field within Table Builder.

## Field details

The Field details section lets you configure the basic field elements for the selected field in the form editor.

To see field type descriptions and learn more about what field types you can use, see [Field types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_FieldTypes.md).

To understand the basic field properties and learn more about adding and customizing a field in a table, see [Add and customize a field in a table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreatingNewFields.md).

The following table shows field descriptions for the Field details section.

<table id="table_dwm_l2b_fsb"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Option that you can select to make a field active so that form users can view it.

 Deselecting **Active** inactivates a field. When **Active** is not selected, the field will not display in the form editor.

 To reactivate a field, hover to the left of the field column in the **Data** tab and select the Open side panel icon \[\[Omitted image "field-config-icon.png"\] Alt text: Open side panel icon.\]. Select **Active** and save changes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

\(**Deprecated**\). Read only

</td><td>

Option that you can select so that the field is not editable by the form users.

Read-only behavior is controlled by the new **read\_only\_option** choice field, which lets you choose between **Display Read Only** or **Strict Read Only**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mandatory

Option that you can select so that the data that your users enter in the field is required before they can save their changes to the form.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Properties for a field label:-   **Tooltip** property that is displayed when a user points to the field.
-   **Plural** property that indicates if multiple instances of a field exist, your user should enter the plural form of the label \(for example, the plural of cat is cats\)
-   **URL** property that indicates if the field label links to some other location, your user should enter the URL here.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Default value

The default value automatically fills in the field on the empty form for a record. If the field is empty when the user submits the record, the default value fills it in. Specify default values as a constant or use a script to generate them.

To learn how to define a default value for the fields, see [Specify a default field value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_SpecifyingADefaultValue.md).

The following table shows field descriptions for the Default value section.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Use dynamic default|Property that displays the **Dynamic default value** field where you can set the default value that is displayed for the field.|
|Default value|String or number that represents the default value of the field.|
|Dynamic default value|Keywords that can be entered in the search field. Your user can then select a field that contains the desired default value for the field.|

## Function definition

A function field generates a value that is based on the simple computations of other fields and constants.

This section is displayed in the editor when you are creating a field and you select **Function field** in the Advanced properties section.

For information on defining function fields, see [Function field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/platform-support-functions.md).

The following table shows field descriptions for the Function definition section.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Function Definition|Function expression that generates the desired value for the field.|

## Reference

A reference qualifier restricts the records that are available for reference fields.

For information on defining reference fields, see [Reference field type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ReferenceField.md).

The following table shows field descriptions for the Reference section.

<table id="table_frs_n2b_fsb"><thead><tr><th>

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Reference

</td><td>

Data table that the selected field references.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use reference qualifier

</td><td>

Qualifier options:-   **Simple** option that enables your users to build a simple conditional expression. Your user can select the **Edit Conditions** button below the **Reference qualifier** field.
-   **Advanced** option that enables your user to build an advanced conditional expression by using the **Reference qualifier** field. The advanced reference qualifiers enable your user to define an inline encrypted query string or JavaScript \(actual code or the name of an existing script include or business rule\) filter in the **Reference qualifier** field.
-   **Dynamic** option that enables your users to build a conditional expression for the selected reference field by using the **Reference qualifier** field. Dynamic reference qualifiers enable your users to use a dynamic filter to run a query against a reference field to filter the returned data set.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reference qualifier

</td><td>

Referenced qualifier that is based on your user's selection for the **Use reference qualifier** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Edit conditions

</td><td>

Hyperlink to launch a pop-up window where your user can enter a simple conditional expression for the **Reference qualifier** field.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Dependent field

A choice or reference field can be declared dependent on another field on the same table. Dependent fields limit their available values based on the value in the dependent field.

Using dependent fields turns on choices. The available choices for your field rely on the value that a user chooses for the dependent field.

For information on defining field dependencies, see [Make a field dependent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_MakingAFieldDependent.md).

The following table shows field descriptions for the Dependent fields section.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Use dependent field|Field dependency that you can activate for the selected field.|
|Select dependent field|List where you select a different field on the form that can then be used to control which choices that are displayed to users in the form field you are configuring.|

## Choices

A choice list is a type of field that lets the user select from a pre-defined set of choices. You can define the available choices and customize the behavior and appearance of your choice lists. For information about the choice list configuration, see [Choice list field type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ChoiceLists.md).

In the Choices section of the Config panel, select **Use choices**, and then select **Edit** or the **+Add** icon to customize the available choices for the selected field.

The following table shows field descriptions in the Choices section.

<table id="table_l3b_jdx_fsb"><thead><tr><th>

</table>## Attributes

A dictionary attribute alters the behavior of the table or element that the dictionary record describes. You can add or modify the dictionary attributes. For information about dictionary attributes, see [Dictionary attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DictionaryAttributes.md).

In the Attributes section of the Config panel, select **Edit** or **+Add** to customize the available attributes for the selected field.

</table>## Formula

A formula allows you to calculate the value of a column without writing a script. You can use one of the predefined formulas or combine two are more formulas to calculate the column value. For information on the predefined formulas and examples, see [Formulas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/formulas-columns-table-builder.md).

You can use a predefined function and create a formula to calculate the value of a column without writing a script. Use a predefined function or create a nested formula by using the existing predefined functions to calculate the column value type.
