# Table Builder workflow and navigation

You can start using Table Builder to manage your data tables, forms, or flows by reviewing this high-level workflow.

Learn about the high-level actions that you perform when you're using Table Builder.

## Basic workflow

The following table outlines the basic actions that you take when working in Table Builder.

Choosing a table or form to work with

</td><td>

To choose a data table or form to work with, launch Table Builder as instructed in [Accessing Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/accessing-form-builder.md) and choose the table or form to work with.

 **Note:** While using Table Builder in App Engine Studio, the table selected here is chosen when you select a table in your app. However, if Table Builder is launched from UI Builder, you can choose a table to work with from the drop-down list that displays the name of your currently selected table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Selecting a domain and application scope

</td><td>

Select a domain and application scope to work within from Table Builder navigation.

 **Note:** While using Table Builder in App Engine Studio, the application scope selected is the app you're working in. However, if Table Builder is launched from UI Builder, you can choose an application scope to work with from the drop-down list in the top right side of your screen \(e.g., Global\).

 See [Domain separation and Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/form-builder-domain-separation.md) and [Using an application scope with Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/fb-application-scope.md).
