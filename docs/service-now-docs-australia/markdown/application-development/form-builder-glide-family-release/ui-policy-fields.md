# Policies and rules properties in Table Builder

You can configure the basic field policies and rules for any field that you work with in Table Builder.

## UI Policies

The UI Policies section enables you to configure how forms appear based on roles and user input.

To understand the basic field properties, see [Create a UI policy in Table Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/form-builder-glide-family-release/form-builder-policies-rules.md).

The following table shows the field descriptions for the Policy details section when adding or editing a UI policy.

<table id="id_wdg_tvm_lsb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Short description

</td><td>

Short summary of the UI policy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Data table that the policy applies to.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Domain

</td><td>

Domain that the choice resides in.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Sequence for processing, from the lowest number to the highest number. If two policies conflict, the UI policy with the higher number runs.

 For inherited UI policies, the extended \(child\) table's UI policies run first. Then, the base table UI policies run, both from the lowest to the highest specified value.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Status of the UI policy. Only active UI policies are applied.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apply to all views/Apply to view \[Advanced settings\]

</td><td>

Option for specifying whether the UI policy applies to all form views or specific views. For more information on form views, see [View management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/view-management-overview.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

On load \[Advanced settings\]

</td><td>

Option for specifying that the UI policy behavior should be performed OnLoad as well as when the form changes.

 Check or clear the UI policy **On load** check box to control whether it runs every time a form is loaded and conditions are satisfied. In the following example, an administrator does not want an incident to enter the **Awaiting user info** state unless the user provides an explanation to the customer. The administrator creates a UI policy with the following settings:

-   In the When these conditions are met section, adds the condition **\[State\] \[is\] \[Awaiting user info\]** and clears the **On load** check box. The UI policy applies only when the state is changed to **Awaiting user info**.
-   In the UI Policy Actions list, creates a record that makes the **Additional comments** field required when the condition is met.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reverse if false \[Advanced settings\]

</td><td>

Option for specifying that the UI policy action should be reversed when the conditions of its UI policy evaluate to false. When the conditions are true, actions are taken and when they change back to false, the actions are reversed \(undone\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Inherit \[Advanced settings\]

</td><td>

Option for specifying whether extended tables inherit this UI policy.

 When a child table has an inherited UI policy from its parent table, the UI policy on the child table always runs first, regardless of the **Order** of the UI policies. In the following example:

-   A child table has a UI policy with the**Order** value **500** that shows the **Urgency** field when its conditions are met.
-   Its parent table has a UI policy with the same conditions that hides the **Urgency** field. The parent table UI policy has the **Order** value **100**.
-   Although the parent table **Order** field has a lower value, the child UI policy runs first and then the parent UI policy runs. When the conditions are met, the **Urgency** field is hidden.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The following table shows field descriptions for the When these conditions are met section when adding or editing a UI policy.

<table id="id_u1v_svm_lsb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Condition set

</td><td>

Conditions that, if fulfilled, cause the UI policy to be applied. Conditions are built with the condition builder by using logic statements. To set conditions using a script, use a client script instead.

 Conditions are only rechecked if a user manually changes a field on a form. If the change is made by a UI action, context menu action, or through the list editor, it is not evaluated.

**Note:** If the specified field is not on the form, the UI policy performs the action on the variable with the same name.

</td></tr><tr><td>
