</table>## Procedure

1.  Select the ServiceNow \[Omitted image "servicenow-youmoji-icon.png"\] icon in the side panel to open the ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code extension.

2.  Open a net new or extension experience.

3.  If your project doesn't already have an application.js file, at the experience folder root \(not under `src/extensions/`\), add an application.js file.

    **Tip:** Use the nav helper API from `@servicenow/aiux/aiux-components-nav` rather than adjusting the `navLayoutContext` by hand.

4.  Double-click \(or use the keyboard shortcut\) to open the `application.js` file in explorer.

5.  Add the following lines of code to the application.js file with the page name and target path that you want to add.

    **Note:** To add pages to L2, include an `l2Nav: [{icon, title, action}]` array on the L1 page you pass to `addNavItem`. The page accepts \{icon, title, action, l2Nav?, l3Nav?\}.

    |Action|Code to add in application.js|
    |------|-----------------------------|
    |Add pages to L1 sidebar|`addNavItem(item, {source?})`|
    |Set \(replace\) the L3 tab array on any L1 or L2 page by path|`setL3Nav(targetPath, l3Nav)`|
    |Append tabs to an L1 or L2 page, keeping any tabs already present|`appendL3Nav(targetPath, l3Nav)`|

6.  Save the file.

7.  In the **Script Runner** panel, select **Build**.

8.  Verify that the added page appears at the expected navigation level using the **Quick Preview** panel or by deploying to your instance.
