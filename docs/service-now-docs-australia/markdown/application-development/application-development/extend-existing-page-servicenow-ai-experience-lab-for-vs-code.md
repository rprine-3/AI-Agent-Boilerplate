</table>## Procedure

1.  In the ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code extension, open an experience that extends an existing experience.

    For more information about extending existing experiences, see [Extend an existing experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/extending-existing-experience-servicenow-ai-experience-lab-for-vs-code.md).

2.  Access the command palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Command+Shift+P on macOS, or by navigating to **View** &gt; **Command Palette**.

3.  Select **AIUX: Create Page**.

4.  Select **Extend Existing Page**.

5.  Select the page that you want to extend from the list.

    The list of pages that appear is based on the instance that you're connected to and which pages can be extended. Pages that appear with the circle slash icon \[Omitted image "circle-slash-icon.png"\] Alt text:have already been extended.

    After selecting the page that you want to extend, ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code extension loads the folder and page file.


## Result

Your page extension is created. You can now add elements to the page and preview as needed. Certain pages aren't previewable in the ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code extension and must be previewed by deploying to your instance.
