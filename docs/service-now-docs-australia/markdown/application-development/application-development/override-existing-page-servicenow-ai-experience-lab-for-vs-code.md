</table>## Procedure

1.  In the ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code extension, open an experience that extends an existing experience.

    For more information about extending existing experiences, see [Extend an existing experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/extending-existing-experience-servicenow-ai-experience-lab-for-vs-code.md).

2.  Access the command palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Command+Shift+P on macOS, or by navigating to **View** &gt; **Command Palette**.

3.  Select **AIUX: Create Page**.

4.  From the list, select **AIUX: New Page**.

    You can also create pages that extend existing pages. For more information, see [Extend an existing page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/extend-existing-page-servicenow-ai-experience-lab-for-vs-code.md).

5.  Enter the display name for the page you want to override and select the Enter key.

    **Important:** The display name must exactly match the display name for the page you're overriding, in order for the override to be successful. Pages that appear with the circle slash icon \[Omitted image "circle-slash-icon.png"\] Alt text:have already been overridden.

6.  Enter the URL route for the page you want to override and select the Enter key.

    **Important:** The URL route must exactly match the URL route for the page that you're overriding, in order for the override to be successful.

    After entering the URL route, the ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code extension creates the folder and page file using the information you provided.


## Result

Your page is created. You can now add elements to the page and preview as needed.

## What to do next

To complete the override process, you must deploy your changes to your instance. For more information, see [Deploy changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/deploy-changes-servicenow-ai-experience-lab-for-vs-code.md).
