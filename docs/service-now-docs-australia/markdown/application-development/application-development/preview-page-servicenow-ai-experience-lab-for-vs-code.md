# Preview a page

Test that your page appears and functions as intended.

## About this task

Certain pages aren't previewable in the ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code extension and must be previewed by deploying to your instance. To learn about deploying, see [Deploy changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/deploy-changes-servicenow-ai-experience-lab-for-vs-code.md).

</table>## Procedure

1.  Open a ServiceNow Lux Lab for VS Code project in Visual Studio Code.

2.  In the Explorer panel, navigate to the /pages folder.

3.  Select the expand icon for the page that you want to preview.

4.  Right click or select and hold the page.js file that you want to preview and select **AIUX: Launch Preview**.

    A preview of your page appears. You can preview how your page appears on different devices, expand the preview panel, and interact with page elements.


## What to do next

If your page isn't already accessible from other pages, [add the page to the navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/add-page-to-navigation-servicenow-ai-experience-lab-for-vs-code.md). Otherwise, you can [deploy your changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/deploy-changes-servicenow-ai-experience-lab-for-vs-code.md).
