# Bulk upload master data records

Submit multiple master data requests in a single batch by importing a spreadsheet.

## Before you begin

Requestor access to the domain is required. A spreadsheet with record data in the format provided by the template must be prepared.

Role required: An MDM Orchestrator bulk upload requestor role. \(For more information, see [Roles used in App Engine ERP Rapid Deployment Packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/aes-erp-rdp-components-installed.md).\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MDM Orchestrator** &gt; **MDM Requestor Portal**.

2.  Select **+ Create New Request**.

3.  If you have access to more than one domain, select a domain.

    The domains available depend on your role. You may not see all of these domains. If you only have access to one domain, go to the next step.

    -   **Customer**

        Customer accounts for sales.

    -   **Business Partner**

        Supplier, vendor, or partner organizations.

    -   **Material**

        Inventory items, SKUs, or products.

    -   **Cost Center**

        Financial cost-allocation entities.

    -   **Location**

        Physical or geographic sites.

    -   **Bill of Materials**

        Product component hierarchies.

4.  Select **Bulk Upload**.

5.  Select **Proceed**.

6.  Select **Download Template** to get a spreadsheet with the correct column headers for your domain.

7.  Find and open the downloaded spreadsheet.

8.  For each record to create:

    -   Use one row.
    -   Complete the required fields.
    -   Leave optional fields empty.

9.  Save the spreadsheet with an appropriate name.

10. Return to the MDM Orchestrator in your instance.

11. Upload the completed file.

12. Select **Process Upload**.

    \[Omitted image "aes-erp-rdp-bulk-upload3.png"\] Alt text: Upload data option.

13. Select **Proceed**.

    Each record in the file is validated.

14. Review the validation results.

    -   Valid records are accepted and continue through the workflow.
    -   Invalid records \(missing required fields or incorrect formatting\) are rejected and removed from the batch. Valid records in the same file are unaffected.
15. Select **Proceed** to submit all valid records.


## Result

The records flow through the same enrichment, governance, and approval stages as individual create requests.

## What to do next

If records were rejected, correct the file and upload it again as a new bulk request. Each upload is treated as a separate request.
