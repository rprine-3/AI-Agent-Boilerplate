</table>## Persona assignment and permissions

Administrators assign personas based on role and domain responsibilities. Domain access is independent. You might be a requestor for the Customer domain but an enricher for the Cost Center domain. The enricher, governance, and approver personas typically don't have access to the Create New Request portal. They access only the requests that reach their workflow stage.
