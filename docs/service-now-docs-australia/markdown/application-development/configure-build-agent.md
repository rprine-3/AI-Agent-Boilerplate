# Build Agent configuration

Build Agent connects your instance to AI-powered design workflows. Set up the required application and MCP server connections to start using it.

**Note:** Build Agent is enabled by default to create apps with AI, for example in ServiceNow Studio. To use other ServiceNow Otto products, such as the app generation skill, disable Build Agent. For example, using the setting in your ServiceNow Studio preferences. For more information, see [Use the app generation skill to generate apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/sns-app-gen-use-app-gen-skill.md).

Configuring Build Agent involves several sequential steps:

-   Installing the ServiceNow Otto for Creator application from the ServiceNow Store \(Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to this application.\)
-   Activating the required plugins for your version
-   Establishing MCP server connections
-   Enabling additional settings, such as for tests and custom instructions

Complete these steps to verify that all dependencies and integrations are in place before using Build Agent.
