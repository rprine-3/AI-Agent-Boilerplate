# Example denying all design access to a table

You can prevent other application scopes from creating configuration records on application data tables.

Typically, this is to prevent any other applications from changing the functionality of a table. Denying access requires setting the following value in the table record.

|Field|Value|
|-----|-----|
|**Accessible from**|This application scope only|
|**Can read**|Disabled|
|**Can create**|Disabled|
|**Can update**|Disabled|
|**Can delete**|Disabled|
|**Allow access to this table via web services**|Disabled|
|**Allow configuration**|Disabled|
