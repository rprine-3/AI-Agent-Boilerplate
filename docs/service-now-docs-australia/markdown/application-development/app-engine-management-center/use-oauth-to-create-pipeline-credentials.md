# Use OAuth to create pipeline credentials

Create credential records on each of your instances to enable OAuth use in your pipeline.

## Before you begin

Complete the tasks in [Create OAuth API endpoints for external clients](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/create-oauth-api-endpoints-for-external-clients.md) and [Create third-party OAuth provider records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/create-third-party-oauth-provider-records.md).

In the top right corner of your instance, make sure you set the application scope to **Global**.

Open all of your instances \(development, test, production, and the like\) in separate browser tabs.

Role required: admin

## About this task

To configure credentials correctly, you must create records for each of your production and non-production instances on your production instance. Then, you must create a record for your production instance on each of your non-production instances connecting them all together. Use the videos in each section to follow along with the steps. Begin on your production instance.

## Procedure

1.  On your production instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Change the **Type** to **Credential**.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter `Pipeline Dev OAuth`.

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  Reopen the record you just created \(Pipeline Dev OAuth\).

7.  On the Credentials related list, select **New**.

8.  Select **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**.

9.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Action|
    |-----|------|
    |Name|Enter `Dev OAuth`.|
    |OAuth Entity Profile|Search for and select the **Dev Instance Connection default profile**.|

10. Select **Submit**.

11. Reopen the **Dev OAuth** credential record.

    An expected error appears, directing you to verify the OAuth configuration and select **Get OAuth Token** to request a new token.

12. Under Related Links, select **Get OAuth Token**.

    A development instance opens requesting to connect to your ServiceNow account.

13. Select **Allow**.

14. Go back to the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases list \(**All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**\).

15. Select **New**.

16. Change the **Type** to **Credential**.

17. In the **Name** field, enter `Pipeline Test OAuth`.

18. Select **Submit**.

19. Reopen the record you just created \(Pipeline Test OAuth\).

20. On the Credentials related list, select **New**.

21. Select **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**.

22. On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Action|
    |-----|------|
    |Name|Enter `Test OAuth`.|
    |OAuth Entity Profile|Search for and select the **Test Instance Connection default profile**.|

23. Select **Submit**.

24. Reopen the Test OAuth credential record.

    An expected error appears, directing you to verify the OAuth configuration and select **Get OAuth Token** to request a new token.

25. Under Related Links, select **Get OAuth Token**.

    A test instance opens requesting to connect to your ServiceNow account.

26. Select **Allow**.

27. Go back to the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases list \(**All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**\).

28. Select **New**.

29. Change the **Type** to **Credential**.

30. In the **Name** field, enter `Pipeline Prod OAuth`.

31. Select **Submit**.

32. Reopen the record you just created \(Pipeline Prod OAuth\).

33. On the Credentials related list, select **New**.

34. Select **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**.

35. On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Action|
    |-----|------|
    |Name|Enter `Prod OAuth`.|
    |OAuth Entity Profile|Search for and select the **Prod Instance Connection default profile**.|

36. Select **Submit**.

37. Reopen the Prod OAuth credential record.

    An expected error appears, directing you to verify the OAuth configuration and select **Get OAuth Token** to request a new token.

38. Under Related Links, select **Get OAuth Token**.

    A production instance opens requesting to connect to your ServiceNow account.

39. Select **Allow**.

40. If you have any other non-production instances \(staging, etc.\), create a credential record for each of them on your production instance using the methods above.

    **Important:** After you've completed the steps above on your production instance, follow the steps below to create one credential record on each of your non-production instances connecting them to your production instance. Complete the next steps on your development instance.

41. On your development instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

42. Select **New** to create a record to connect your development instance to production.

43. Change the **Type** to **Credential**.

44. In the **Name** field, enter `Pipeline Prod OAuth`.

45. Select **Submit**.

46. Reopen the record you just created \(Pipeline Prod OAuth\).

47. On the Credentials related list, select **New**.

48. Select **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**.

49. On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Action|
    |-----|------|
    |Name|Enter `Prod OAuth`.|
    |OAuth Entity Profile|Search for and select the **Prod Instance Connection default profile**.|

50. Select **Submit**.

51. Reopen the Prod OAuth credential record.

    An expected error appears, directing you to verify the OAuth configuration and select **Get OAuth Token** to request a new token.

52. Under Related Links, select **Get OAuth Token**.

    A production instance opens requesting to connect to your ServiceNow account.

53. Select **Allow**.

    **Important:** Complete the next steps on your test instance.

54. On your test instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

55. Select **New** to create a record to connect your test instance to production.

56. Change the **Type** to **Credential**.

57. In the **Name** field, enter `Pipeline Prod OAuth`.

58. Select **Submit**.

59. Reopen the record you just created \(Pipeline Prod OAuth\).

60. On the Credentials related list, select **New**.

61. Select **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**.

62. On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Action|
    |-----|------|
    |Name|Enter `Prod OAuth`.|
    |OAuth Entity Profile|Search for and select the **Prod Instance Connection default profile**.|

63. Select **Submit**.

64. Reopen the Prod OAuth credential record.

    An expected error appears, directing you to verify the OAuth configuration and select **Get OAuth Token** to request a new token.

65. Under Related Links, select **Get OAuth Token**.

    A production instance opens requesting to connect to your ServiceNow account.

66. Select **Allow**.

67. If you have any other non-production instances \(staging, etc.\), create a credential record on that instance for production using steps 54-66.


## What to do next

Now that you've created all of the credential records connecting your instances, you can use those records to configure your pipeline environments. For more information, see [Configure your pipeline environments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/config-pipeline-environments.md).
