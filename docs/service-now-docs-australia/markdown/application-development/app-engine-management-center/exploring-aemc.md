# Exploring the App Engine Management Center

Learn about how the App Engine Management Center \(AEMC\) can help to centralize and streamline your application development and governance at scale.

## App Engine Management Center overview

The App Engine Management Center \(AEMC\) is a powerful tool that innovates and unifies the application development, deployment, and governance experience. AEMC contains all of the features that you need to manage application development within your organization, from idea submission to deployment and then monitoring the app. Using AEMC, admins can manage requests for new apps and delegate development and collaboration permissions. Admins can also oversee the entire deployment process with insights into individual deployment requests, test suites, and scheduled deployments.

Starting with version 28.2.1 of AEMC, ReleaseOps is integrated into AEMC. See the ReleaseOps in AEMC section for more information.

## AI features in AEMC

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

AEMC contains AI features that enable you to regenerate release notes. For more information, see [Generate release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/releaseops/generate-release-notes.md).

</table>## App Engine Management Center product tiers

Starting with version 29.2.1 of AEMC and later, there are tiered versions of the AEMC application. The base platform version of AEMC is available for free from the ServiceNow Store with access to standard set of AEMC features. A premium version of AEMC requires a paid subscription and has more features. Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to AEMC platform or subscription features.

## App Engine Management Center workflow

The workflow for managing app development and deployment through an App Engine pipeline using the App Engine Management Center is outlined in the following list:

1.  Developers submit ideas for new applications to build.
2.  App Engine admins review and approve application intake requests.
3.  Developers and collaborators build custom applications using App Engine product offerings.
4.  Once an app is ready, developers submit the app for review.
5.  App Engine admins review and approve deployment requests, moving the app through their organization's unique pipeline.
6.  App Engine admins review test suite logs to verify that the application is ready to be deployed to production instances.
7.  App Engine admins approve apps for deployment to production instances.

## ReleaseOps in AEMC

ReleaseOps is now integrated into AEMC. ReleaseOps improves on the existing pipelines deployment process by supporting deployments using update sets, leveraging the automation capabilities of ServiceNow Playbooks, and enabling both scheduled and on-demand releases. To learn more about ReleaseOps, see [Exploring ReleaseOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/releaseops/exploring-release-ops.md).

Developers working with update sets in version 28.1.2 of ServiceNow Studio and later can trigger ReleaseOps deployments directly within the development environment.

In development environments where full support isn’t available yet, such as App Engine Studio and Creator Studio, you can still take advantage of ReleaseOps features in AEMC by migrating your existing App Engine pipeline to ReleaseOps. For more information about migrating to ReleaseOps, see the following resources:

-   [Migrating App Engine pipelines to ReleaseOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/migrating-ae-pipelines-to-releaseops-aemc.md)
-   [Migration tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/migration-tasks-aemc.md)

Starting with version 29.2.1 of AEMC, ReleaseOps is included in AEMC guided setup. For more information, see [Configuring AEMC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/configuring-aemc.md).
