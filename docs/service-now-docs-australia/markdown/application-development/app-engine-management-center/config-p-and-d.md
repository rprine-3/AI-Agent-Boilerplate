# Configure Pipelines and Deployments

Use the Pipelines and Deployments guided setup to complete the initial configuration of Pipelines and Deployments. Detailed instructions for each step are provided in subsequent sections of the product documentation.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Pipelines and Deployments guided setup provides a sequence of tasks that help you configure Pipelines and Deployments on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information about each task, see [Pipelines and Deployments configuration tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/p-and-d-config-tasks.md).

Starting with version 28.2.1 of Pipelines and Deployments, you can migrate your existing pipelines to ReleaseOps. To learn more about the migration process and the advantages of migrating to ReleaseOps, see [Migrating App Engine pipelines to ReleaseOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/migrating-ae-pipelines-to-releaseops-aemc.md). To get started migrating your existing pipelines, see [Migration tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/migration-tasks-aemc.md).

For general information about guided setup, see [Using guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/guided-setup.md).

2.  To initiate guided setup, select **Get Started**.

    The Pipelines and Deployments Guided Setup category page provides a list of different categories of tasks you must complete before you can use Pipelines and Deployments.

    **Note:** If you have previously started any of the guided setup tasks, and then exited without completing them, the **Get Started** button will be labeled **Continue**.

    **Important:** Each of the tasks in the following list must be performed on different environments in your pipeline.

3.  Select the first **Get Started** button to begin performing configuration tasks on your production environment.

    1.  [Configure environment credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/create-pipeline-credentials.md).
