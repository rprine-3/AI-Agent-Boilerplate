# Application Intake configuration tasks

As you work through the App Engine Studio \(AES\) Application Intake guided setup, you must perform different configuration tasks.

## Activating and configuring the intake request process, and setting up development environments

The tasks for configuring Application Intake are listed below, along with links to detailed instructions for completing them.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Activate the catalog item where developers will submit their application ideas

</td><td>

Activate the Apply for Citizen Development catalog item so that citizen developers can submit their ideas for applications.

 For detailed instructions, see [Activate the Apply for Citizen Development catalog item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/activate-catalog-item-for-app-intake.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set up the Apply for Citizen Development catalog item

</td><td>

For quick setup and use, use the predefined Apply for Citizen Development catalog item in Catalog Builder. To customize your app intake form, either update the Apply for Citizen Development catalog item, or use the AES App Intake template as a starting point and add questions and fields as needed.

 For detailed instructions, see [Customize the App Intake form in Catalog Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/customize-app-intake-form-catalog-builder.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Add users to the App Engine Admins group

</td><td>

Add users to the App Engine Admin group. After the email address of the App Engine Admin group is configured, members can receive notifications for app development-related requests, including application intake requests.**Note:** If you already added users on the production instance using [AES guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/configure-aes.md) or [Configure Pipelines and Deployments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/config-p-and-d.md) guided setup, you can skip this step.

 For detailed instructions, see [Add users to the App Engine Admin group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/add-users-to-admin-grp.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create development environment records

</td><td>

On your production instance, create an environment record of type "Development" for each development instance that you want to provision users to. This will allow your production instance to connect to your development instances.**Note:** If these records have already been set up in the Pipelines and Deployments Guided Setup, you can skip this step.

 For detailed instructions, see [Configure your pipeline environments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/config-pipeline-environments.md).

</table>When you have completed Application Intake guided setup, proceed to [Pipelines and Deployments guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-management-center/config-p-and-d.md) to fully configure App Engine Studio.
