### About this task

Sometimes, if a user gives a specific answer to one question on the App Intake form, you might need a follow-up question to gather more information. For example, if you ask if they have taken any ServiceNow training, and the answer is "no", the user goes to the next visible question. If the answer is "yes", another question appears asking which training courses they have completed. Use the following steps to define this type of dynamic behavior.
