# Installing the Application Repository store app on an air-gapped instance

Because self-hosted, air-gapped customers don't allow their instances to communicate with external networks, they don’t install the Application Repository directly from the ServiceNow® Store. These customers should use the following procedure instead.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Customization of the Application Repository is not supported or recommended.

Role required: You will need the maint role to install and configure, and then just the admin role once the configuration is complete.

**Warning:** If your instances are already connected to the public ServiceNow® Store, you should not install the Application Repository. Doing so causes these instances to lose access. This product is intended for customers who can't connect to the public store.

**Note:** Install on a dedicated ServiceNow® instance separate from your other instances.

## Procedure

1.  Install the application repository using the instruction in the following Knowledge Base article: [How On-Prem Customers Can Request a Store App](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0745101).

2.  After installing, complete the steps in [Configure the application repository on an air-gapped instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/application-repository-self-hosted/configure-app-repo-air-gapped.md).
