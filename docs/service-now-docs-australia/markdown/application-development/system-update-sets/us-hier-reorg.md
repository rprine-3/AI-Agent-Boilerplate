# Reorganize a batch of update sets

You can remove an individual update set from the batch or change its parent.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Update Sets** &gt; **Local Update Sets**.

2.  Select the record for an update set that you want to move or remove as a child in the batch.

3.  On the update set record, navigate to the parent field and select the new update set to act as the parent.

4.  To remove the update set from the batch, delete any text from the parent field and leave it empty.

5.  Select **Update**.

    The system returns to the list of updated sets. If the batch base column is visible, it shows the parent for the newly created child.
