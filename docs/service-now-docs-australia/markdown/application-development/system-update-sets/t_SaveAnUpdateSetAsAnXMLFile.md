# Save an update set as a local XML file

Administrators can export an update set as an XML file to save a specific version of an application or set of changes.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Create an XML file of an update set when:

-   The two instances lack network connectivity, preventing the retrieval of update sets or the creation of a data source for import from the source instance.
-   You don't want to give administrator credentials for the source instance.
-   You want to back up important customizations locally.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System Update Sets** and select either **Local Update Sets** or **Retrieved Update Sets**.

    **Note:** **Retrieved Update Sets** must be in a loaded state to be exported.

2.  Select an update set that is in the **Complete** state.

3.  On the Update Set form, select the **Export to XML** Related Link.

4.  Save the XML file.

    When a file is uploaded to a different instance, it’s recognized as a retrieved update set.
