# Preview a batch of update sets

You can preview at once all the update sets belonging to a batch.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

You must have retrieved the update sets from the source instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Update Sets** &gt; **Retrieved Update Sets**

2.  From the list of retrieved update sets, select the batch base for the batch you want to preview.

    You can’t separately preview an update set that is a child in a batch. You must preview the entire batch by previewing the batch base. If necessary, you can [remove the child update set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets/us-hier-reorg.md) from the batch by editing its record's **parent** field.

3.  Select **Preview Update Set Batch**.

4.  If the system found problems, preview the problems.

    1.  Select the **Preview Problems for Batch** and [resolve the problems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets/t_PreviewARemoteUpdateSet.md) as you normally would for any update set.

    2.  When you have resolved all the problems, select **Run Preview Again for Batch**.
