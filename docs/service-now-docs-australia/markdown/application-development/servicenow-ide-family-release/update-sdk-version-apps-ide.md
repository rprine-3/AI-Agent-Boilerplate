# Update the ServiceNow SDK version for an application in the ServiceNow IDE

Configure which version of the ServiceNow SDK an application uses from the ServiceNow IDE.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

From the ServiceNow IDE, you can configure which version of the ServiceNow SDK, including the ServiceNow Fluent APIs, an application uses beginning with ServiceNow SDK version 3.0.

2.  Open a workspace with an application.

3.  From the Activity Bar, select the File Explorer view \(\[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-file-explorer-icon.png"\] Alt text: File Explorer\).

4.  Open the `package.json` file for the application.

5.  In the `devDependencies` field, update the versions of the `@servicenow/sdk` and `@servicenow/eslint-plugin-sdk-app-plugin` packages to 3.0.0 or later.

    For example:

    ```json
    "devDependencies": {
            "@servicenow/sdk": "3.0.0",
            "@servicenow/glide": "26.0.1",
            "eslint": "8.50.0",
            "@servicenow/eslint-plugin-sdk-app-plugin": "3.0.0"
    }
    ```

6.  Save your changes.

7.  Use one of the following keyboard shortcuts to open the command palette:

    -   Windows: Ctrl-Shift-P
    -   Mac: Cmd-Shift-P
8.  Enter `Package Manager: Install Dependencies` and press Enter.

    The dependencies are updated in the `node_modules` directory.


## Result

You can use the latest version of the ServiceNow SDK application packaging service and ServiceNow Fluent APIs in your application.
