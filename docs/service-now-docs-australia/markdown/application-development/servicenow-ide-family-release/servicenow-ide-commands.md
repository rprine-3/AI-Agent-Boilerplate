Fluent: Download script dependencies

</td><td>

Download script dependencies in your application to get type-ahead support for Glide APIs and script includes. Type definitions are downloaded into the `@types/servicenow` directory based on the scripts in your application.After downloading script dependencies, you can create a `tsconfig.json` file in the `src/fluent` directory that includes the type definitions. For example:

```json
"include": [
    "./**/*.client.js",
    "./**/*.server.js",
    "../../@types/servicenow/*.client.d.ts",
    "../../@types/servicenow/*.server.d.ts",
]
```

If you have previous versions of modules in the EcmaScript Module \[sys\_module\] table that aren't needed, re-installing an application removes previous versions of the application’s modules from the table.
