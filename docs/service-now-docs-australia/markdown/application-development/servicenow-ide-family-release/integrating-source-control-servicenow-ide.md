# Integrating source control with the ServiceNow IDE

Integrate with remote Git repositories to manage applications in source control with the ServiceNow IDE.

You can connect to a Git provider using basic or OAuth 2.0 authentication. Then, initialize a repository for an application in the ServiceNow IDE and push it to a remote repository or clone a remote repository that contains an application. After setting up authentication and connecting to a repository, you can use common Git commands to manage applications in source control.

Learn how to get started using source control in the ServiceNow IDE in the following topics.

## Instance requirements

If an instance includes modified configurations for saving attachments, the following requirements must be met to perform Git operations:

-   If the **glide.attachment.extensions** system property is configured, it must contain `txt,gitdata`.
-   If the **glide.security.attachment\_type.use\_blacklist** system property is set to true, the **glide.attachment.blacklisted.extensions** system property must not contain `txt,gitdata` and the **glide.attachment.blacklisted.types** system property must not contain `text/plain,application/octet-stream`.

If you want to use custom extensions for attachments, set the following properties to custom values: **sn\_glider.git.attachment.extension.text** and **sn\_glider.git.attachment.extension.binary**. For more information, see [ServiceNow IDE properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/servicenow-ide-properties.md).
