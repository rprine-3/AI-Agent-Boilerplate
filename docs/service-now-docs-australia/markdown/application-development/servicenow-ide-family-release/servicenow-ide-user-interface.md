# ServiceNow IDE user interface

The ServiceNow IDE user interface contains many of the same features as Visual Studio Code for the Web and some unique functionality for creating ServiceNow applications.

## Overview of the ServiceNow IDE user interface

The ServiceNow IDE is an implementation of Visual Studio Code for the Web on the ServiceNow AI Platform, which includes the following features:

-   Basic editing and keyboard shortcuts
-   IntelliSense
-   Code navigation
-   Code and file search
-   Command palette
-   Source control integration

Visual Studio Code for the Web is similar to Visual Studio Code Desktop but doesn't support all of the features that are available in the desktop interface. For information about browser-based implementations of Visual Studio Code, see [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web). The following Visual Studio Code features aren't supported in the ServiceNow IDE:

-   Integrated terminal
-   Debugger
-   Marketplace extensions
-   Integrated unit testing
-   Remote development

For general information about common features in Visual Studio Code and the ServiceNow IDE, see the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) website.
