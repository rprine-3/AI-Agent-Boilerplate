# Create an application with the ServiceNow IDE

Create an application to develop in source code with the ServiceNow IDE.

## Before you begin

Create a workspace for your applications. For more information, see [Create a workspace in the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/create-workspace-servicenow-ide.md).

**Note:** You can use Build Agent to help you create and edit applications in the ServiceNow IDE. For more information, see [Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Development** &gt; **ServiceNow IDE**.

2.  Open a workspace.

3.  Use one of the following keyboard shortcuts to open the command palette:

    -   Windows: Ctrl-Shift-P
    -   Mac: Cmd-Shift-P
4.  Enter `Fluent: Create Fluent App` and press Enter.

5.  Select the type of application.

    -   Scoped: Create a scoped application that is protected by identifying and restricting access to application files and data.
    -   Global: Create an application in the global scope to allow it to be accessible to other global applications.
6.  Enter a name for the application and press Enter.

7.  Enter a description for the application and press Enter.

8.  For scoped applications, enter a scope name and press Enter.

    The scope name must be unique on the instance, begin with x\_&lt;prefix&gt;, and be 18 characters or fewer. For more information, see [Namespace identifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_NamespaceIdentifier.md).

9.  Enter a package name for the application and press Enter.

    The package name must adhere to Node Package Manager \(npm\) package naming standards.

10. Select a template that defines the default application structure.

11. Build and install your application to compile source code into application metadata and make your changes available across the instance. For more information, see [Build and install an application in the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/build-applications-servicenow-ide.md).


## Result

An application with the default application structure is added to the instance and open in your workspace. For information about the application structure, see the [Application structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/building-applications-source-code.md) section of the Building applications in source code topic.

\[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-create-app.png"\] Alt text: An application open in the File Explorer view.

In the status bar, a message confirms whether the application was created. If the application creation fails, review the output logs in the panel.

**Note:** For the ServiceNow IDE to install the required dependencies in an application, the public npm registry must respond with the HTTP `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

## What to do next

From your Git provider, create a dedicated Git repository for the application. Initialize a local Git repository for your application and push it to the remote repository. For more information, see [Initialize a Git repository with the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/initialize-git-repository-servicenow-ide.md).

In the ServiceNow IDE, start developing your application in source code with ServiceNow Fluent, writing custom JavaScript modules, or adding third-party libraries.
