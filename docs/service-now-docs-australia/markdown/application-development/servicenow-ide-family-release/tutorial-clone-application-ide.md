# Tutorial part 5: Clone the application on a different instance

Clone the application from the remote repository to develop it on another instance.

## Before you begin

Complete [Tutorial part 4: Install and use a third-party library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/tutorial-install-third-party-library-ide.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

If you have access to another instance, you can install the application from the remote repository onto the instance to support development across instances.

**Note:** The instance and your user on the instance must meet the same requirements mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial.

Cloning is intended for developing an application on multiple non-production instances and managing it in a single repository. To publish an application and deploy it to a production instance, use the Application Repository. For more information, see [ServiceNow application repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/application-repository-self-hosted/app-repo.md).

## Procedure

1.  Push your changes to the remote repository.

    1.  From the Activity Bar, select the Source Control view \(\[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-source-control-icon.png"\] Alt text: Source Control\).

    2.  From the Changes list, select the Stage All Tracked Changes icon \(\[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-stage-icon.png"\] Alt text: Stage all untracked changes\).

    3.  From the Untracked Changes list, select the Stage All Untracked Changes icon \(\[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-stage-icon.png"\] Alt text: Stage all untracked changes\).

        All of your changes should be in the Staged Changes list.

    4.  In the message box, enter a commit message.

    5.  Select the Commit icon \(\[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-commit-icon.png"\] Alt text: Stage all untracked changes\).

    6.  Select the More actions menu icon \(\[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions\) and select **Push**.

        \[Omitted image "servicenow-ide-push-changes.png"\] Alt text: Push the staged changes to the remote repository.

    All of your changes are available in the remote repository. You or other developers can clone the application onto another instance.

2.  Log in to another ServiceNow instance.

3.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Development** &gt; **ServiceNow IDE**.

4.  Create a workspace or open an existing one.

5.  Configure basic authentication in the ServiceNow IDE to connect to the remote repository.

    1.  Use one of the following keyboard shortcuts to open the command palette:

        -   Windows: Ctrl-Shift-P
        -   Mac: Cmd-Shift-P
    2.  Enter `Git: Set IDE Git credentials` and press Enter.

    3.  From the New Git credential form, select **Basic auth**.

    4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Git repository URL|The HTTPS URL to the Git repository you created in GitHub. For example: `https://github.com/<owner>/hello-world.git`.|

    2.  Enter `Git: Clone` and press Enter.

    3.  Enter the HTTPS URL to the remote Git repository and press Enter.
