## What to do next

If you haven't already, configure basic or OAuth 2.0 authentication to connect to a Git domain or repository. For more information, see [Connect to a Git provider using basic authentication with the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/connect-git-provider-basic-auth.md) or [Connect to a Git provider using OAuth 2.0 with the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/connect-git-provider-oauth-2.md).

**Note:** The MID Server user must have the sn\_glider.ide\_git\_user role or admin role to perform Git operations in the ServiceNow IDE. For more information, see [Create the MID Server user and grant the role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_SetupMIDServerRole.md) and [ServiceNow IDE MID Server User \[sn\_glider.ide\_git\_user\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/servicenow-ide-roles.md).
