# Developing applications with the ServiceNow IDE

Create and develop applications in source code with the ServiceNow IDE. Build applications to make your changes available across an instance and collaborate with users of any skill set.

In the ServiceNow IDE, you create applications or convert existing applicationsand develop them in source code using ServiceNow Fluent to define application metadata \[sys\_metadata\]. Optionally, you can create JavaScript modules and use third-party libraries to organize and reuse code within application scopes.

When your changes are saved and ready, build an application to compile the source code to application metadata and make your changes available to users across the instance. As other users modify the application metadata, you can synchronize the changes into the source code.

Learn how to get started developing applications with the ServiceNow IDE in the following topics.

## System requirements

ServiceNow IDE uses the public npm registry \(`https://registry.npmjs.org`\) as its default package source. If your network blocks access to this registry, you must have access to an alternate registry to download packages and build applications in the ServiceNow IDE. If access to the public npm registry is blocked on your system, you must configure a private npm registry in your Package Manager user settings in the ServiceNow IDE. For more information, see [Install an npm package from a private registry with the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/use-library-private-npm-registry.md).

-   **[Use third-party libraries in applications in the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/use-third-party-libraries-ide.md)**  
Call third-party libraries in your application to use existing open-source functionality with the ServiceNow IDE.
-   **[Create an application file in the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-ide-family-release/create-application-file-servicenow-ide.md)**
