# Create a definition for your store application

Create a definition for your store app to define the licensing metrics you want collected.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or developer

## About this task

Create a definition for an application in development or for an application you have already published. However, if you assign a definition to a published application, you will have to re-publish it with the new definition. Additionally, you can only assign one definition to an application.

**Note:** You can only create a definition for capacity subscriptions. See [Types of subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/types-subscription-v2.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **My Company Applications**.

2.  Select the application.

3.  Under the **Subscription Management** section, set **Subscription Model** to **Capacity**.

4.  Select the search icon next to **License Definition**.

    The **Application License Definitions** pop-up loads.

5.  Select **New**.

6.  Fill in the **Application License Definition** record.

<table id="table_vlt_mhd_zlb"><thead><tr><th>

</table>7.  Select **Submit**.

    Your new definition appears in the **Application License Definitions** pop-up.

8.  Select the definition to apply it to the application.


## What to do next

Create a new version of the application and publish it to the ServiceNow Store. While your application is in review, any changes to the definition may cause subsequent versions of your application to be rejected. Once the application is approved and published to the ServiceNow Store, the definition becomes read-only.

To change the definition of an application already on the ServiceNow Store, you must create a new definition, submit a new version of the application, and go through the review process.
