</table>## What's new

Build apps smarter and deliver them faster with the new ServiceNow Studio. ServiceNow Studio empowers platform developers with a modern, unified environment for building on the ServiceNow AI Platform. ServiceNow Studio features streamlined navigation to applications and metadata, integrated low-code tools, efficient tracking and packaging of development work that accelerates development processes and enhances productivity.

## App development phases

-   **\[Omitted image "bus-learn.svg"\] Alt text: [Learning about creating applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/getting-started-with-building-applications.md)**

    Decide whether you want to build a new application or extend an existing application. Check the ServiceNow Store and the ServiceNow Community for existing solutions.

    Before building your first application, you may want to learn some basic information about application development. This phase is optional, and you can complete it at any time while you work on other phases.

    The application development process starts with planning. Consider how the application will work, who will use it, and how it will improve your users' experience. Your application plan should answer the following questions:

    -   What are the goals, objectives, and outputs of your application?
    -   Who uses your application?
    -   Who has access to parts of the application?
    -   What tasks do people complete with your application?
    -   Where does the data come from?
    -   How do people interact with your application?
    -   What processes must the application support?
    -   What UI experience does the application use?
    -   Is there an existing application available on the ServiceNow Store or the ServiceNow Community that you can use or extend?
    -   What subscriptions does your application require?
-   **\[Omitted image "bus-application-development.svg"\] Alt text: [Phase 2: Developing your application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developing-applications.md)**

    During the development phase, you add the components and content of your application. Most applications consist of the following:

    -   **Data**

        Information is stored in your application via tables that you configure. For example, employee phone numbers or office locations.

    -   **Experience**

        Experiences are graphical interfaces that your users interact with. For example, you can create a portal where users find information, submit requests, or complete business tasks.

    -   **Logic and automation**

        Automate all the work in your application by adding logic and automation. For example, you can build a flow that sends a notification to the admin when someone makes a request.

    -   **Security**

        Configure roles and access controls to limit who can use your application. For example, you can restrict access to application data to users who have a specific role.

    Choose a builder that matches the type of user experience that your application provides.

    Verify that the application meets your business requirements. Your testing should cover the following elements:

    -   Record operations, such as create, read, update, and delete.
    -   User interface elements, such as views and UI policies.
    -   Runtime operations, such as business rules and event script actions.
-   **\[Omitted image "bus-rocketship.svg"\] Alt text: [Phase 4: Deploying your application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/deploying-applications.md)**

    After successfully testing an application, deploy it to your production environment with your builder tool.

    -   See [ServiceNow application repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/application-repository-self-hosted/app-repo.md) to learn about the Application Repository.
    -   See [System update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets/system-update-sets.md) to learn about classic deployment using update sets.
-   **\[Omitted image "bus-optimize-manage.svg"\] Alt text: [Phase 5: Maintaining your application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/maintaining-applications.md)**

    Use your Phase 2 builder tool to update and modify your application. Use your Phase 3 testing tool to verify that your application still functions properly.
