# Service Level Agreement API - ServiceNow Fluent

The Service Level Agreement API defines service level agreements \[contract\_sla\] that set the amount of time for a task to reach a specified condition, ensuring that tasks are resolved according to the service levels agreed between a service provider and customer.

**Note:** For the latest ServiceNow Fluent API documentation and examples, see the [ServiceNow Fluent API reference](https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/category/api-reference) and [ServiceNow SDK examples repository](https://github.com/ServiceNow/sdk-examples) on GitHub.

For general information about SLAs, see [Service Level Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/service-level-mgmt-landing-page.md).
