# ServiceNow SDK CLI

Use the ServiceNow SDK command-line interface \(CLI\) to manage changes between a local application and the application on an instance.

**Note:** For the latest ServiceNow SDK CLI documentation, see the [ServiceNow SDK CLI reference](https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/cli) on GitHub.

From the command-line tool on your system, enter `now-sdk` to start the CLI and return a list of available commands or `now-sdk [command]` to begin using the ServiceNow SDK.

**Note:** If you use `npx` to install the ServiceNow SDK in application rather than globally, you must use `npx @servicenow/sdk [command]` rather than `now-sdk [command]` with the ServiceNow SDK CLI.

The CLI includes the following commands and global options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|--version, -v|Return the version of the CLI.|
|--help, -h|Return information about commands, sub-commands, and parameters.|
|--debug, -d|Return the debug logs generated with a command.|

**Parent Topic:**[ServiceNow SDK reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-sdk/servicenow-sdk-reference.md)

## auth

Authenticate to an instance and store, update, or view user credentials for accessing an instance on your system.

The `auth` command has parameters for adding credentials, deleting credentials, listing credentials, and setting credentials to use by default. To use non-interactive authentication in CI/CD pipelines, see the [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-sdk/servicenow-sdk-cli-commands.md) command.

For more information, see [Authenticating to a ServiceNow instance with the ServiceNow SDK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-sdk/authenticate-instance-now-sdk.md).

### add

Store credentials in the device keychain or credential manager on your system.

The `auth` command has the following structure with the `--add` parameter:

```cmd
npx @servicenow/sdk auth [--add <instance url>] [--type <auth method>] [--alias <alias>]
```

**Note:** Using the `npx` command installs the ServiceNow SDK in your application directory instead of globally.

## init

Create an application or convert an existing application to support development in source code. The application is added in the current directory.

To create an application, you can run the `init` command without any optional parameters \(`now-sdk init`\). To convert an existing application, you must include the `--from` parameter to provide the sys\_id of an application on an instance or a path to a local directory that contains an application.

After initializing an application, you must install the required third-party dependencies using your preferred package manager before building the application. For example, if you use Node Package Manager \(npm\), run `npm install`.

The `init` command has the following structure:

```cmd
npx @servicenow/sdk init [--from <sys_id or path>] [--appName <name>] [--packageName <name>] [--scopeName <name>] [--auth <alias>] \[--template &lt;template&gt;\]
```

**Note:** Using the `npx` command installs the ServiceNow SDK in your application directory instead of globally.

## dependencies

Download application dependencies and TypeScript definitions from an instance to enable IntelliSense and code validation for an application.

The `dependencies` command downloads dependencies and TypeScript definitions for scripts and ServiceNow Fluent code:

-   For scripts, this command downloads TypeScript definitions for all Glide APIs and scans the modules and scripts in your application and generates type definitions for the script includes that they use. Type definitions are added in the `@types/servicenow` directory. After downloading script dependencies, you must update your `tsconfig.json` file to include the type definitions.
-   For ServiceNow Fluent, this command downloads the dependencies listed in an application's `now.config.json` file and generates TypeScript definitions for them in the `@types/servicenow/fluent` directory.

To download all script and ServiceNow Fluent dependencies for an application, you can use the `dependencies` command with no parameters. If needed, provide the application directory and authentication alias too.

The `dependencies` command has the following structure:

```cmd
now-sdk dependencies [--directory <package path>] [--auth <alias>]\[--type-defs-only &lt;flag&gt;\] \[--fluent-only &lt;flag&gt;\] \[--add &lt;table&gt; &lt;sys\_ids or names&gt;\] \[--scope &lt;name&gt;\]

Adds the dependencies that you want to download to the application's `now.config.json` file. You must specify the type of dependencies to add using the table name and then the names or sys\_ids of each item to add, separated by spaces.```cmd
--add <table_name> <sys_id1> <sys_id2> <sys_id3>
```

-   To add table dependencies, you can use the `table` alias and names of tables instead of the sys\_ids. For example:

    ```cmd
--add tables incident problem change_request
    ```

-   To add role dependencies, you can use the `role` alias and names of roles instead of the sys\_ids. For example:

    ```cmd

## transform

Download application metadata \(XML\) from the instance and transform the metadata into ServiceNow Fluent source code to synchronize the application changes on the instance into your local application.

After initializing an application, you can run the `transform` command without any parameters to transform new application metadata from the instance into source code in the `src/fluent/generated` directory and synchronize changes to metadata into source code in the `src/fluent` directory. To transform metadata that existed when the application was initialized into source code, use the `--from` parameter to provide the path to a local directory or file that contains XML. If metadata exists in the local application as both XML and source code, the XML version takes precedence when installed on the instance.

The `transform` command has the following structure:

```cmd
now-sdk transform [--from <path>] [--directory <package path>] [--auth <alias>] \[--format &lt;flag&gt;\] \[--table &lt;name&gt;\]

The `query` command can help with referring to instance data while writing ServiceNow Fluent code, such as looking up sys\_ids, inspecting table schemas, checking existing records, and reading choice values. You can use this command with the `explain` command to provide an AI agent with instance data.

The `query` command has the following structure:

```cmd
now-sdk query <table> --query <encoded query> [--limit <number>] [--offset <number>] [--fields <field list>] [--display-value <value>] [--exclude-reference-link <flag>] [--no-count <flag>] [--timeout <time>] [--view <view>] [--query-category <category>] [--query-no-domain <flag>] [--auth <alias>] [--output <format>]
```

|Parameter|Type|Description|Default value|
|---------|----|-----------|-------------|
|table|String|The name of a table to query, such as incident or sys\_dictionary.|—|
|--query, -q|String|An encoded query string \(sysparm\_query\) used to filter records, such as `"active=true^priority<=2"`.|—|

|Parameter|Type|Description|Default value|
|---------|----|-----------|-------------|
|--limit|Number|The maximum number of records to return per page \(sysparm\_limit\).|100|
|--offset|Number|The starting record offset for pagination \(sysparm\_offset\). If --output is `json`, use the `nextOffset` value returned in a previous response to fetch the next page.|0|
|--fields, -f|String|A comma-separated list of fields to return \(sysparm\_fields\). If omitted, all fields are returned.|—|
|--display-value|String|An option to return display values instead of raw values \(sysparm\_display\_value\). Specify `true` to return display values, `false` to return raw values, or `all` to return both.|false|
|--exclude-reference-link|Boolean|An option to exclude reference link metadata in the response \(sysparm\_exclude\_reference\_link\).|true|
|--no-count|Boolean|An option to skip calculating the total record count \(sysparm\_no\_count\). Skipping the count can improve performance for large tables.|false|
|--timeout|Number|The per-request timeout in milliseconds. Each page fetch is bounded by this value.|30000|
|--view|String|A UI view used to determine which fields to return \(sysparm\_view\).|—|
|--query-category|String|A query category for extended queries \(sysparm\_query\_category\).|—|
|--query-no-domain|Boolean|An option to ignore domain separation when querying \(sysparm\_query\_no\_domain\).|false|
|--auth, -a|String|An alias for the credentials to use to authenticate to the instance.|If set, the default alias.|
|--output, -o|String|The output format for the response. Specify `json` to paginate the response and return a machine-readable JSON envelope with `ok`, `hasMore`, `nextOffset`, and `records` fields. When this parameter is used, log output is suppressed.|—|

For example:

```cmd
now-sdk query incident --query 'active=true^priority<=2' --limit 50 --fields 'number,short_description,priority' --auth devuser1 --output json
```
