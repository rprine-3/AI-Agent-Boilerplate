# Authenticate to a ServiceNow instance using basic authentication with the ServiceNow SDK

Use basic authentication to connect to a ServiceNow instance with the ServiceNow SDK.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

This procedure uses the ServiceNow SDK command-line interface \(CLI\). From a command-line tool, enter `now-sdk --help` to get information about the available commands and global options. To get additional information about a command and its parameters, enter the command and `--help` or `-h`. For example, `now-sdk auth --help`. For more information about the CLI, see [ServiceNow SDK CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-sdk/servicenow-sdk-cli-commands.md).

**Note:** To use non-interactive authentication in CI/CD pipelines, see the [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-sdk/servicenow-sdk-cli-commands.md) command.

## Procedure

1.  Create a local directory for your application.

2.  In Visual Studio Code, open the directory.

3.  From the application directory, open an integrated Terminal window.

4.  Specify the instance to authenticate to with the `auth` command.

    ```cmd
    npx @servicenow/sdk auth --add <instance>
    ```

    For example:

    ```cmd
    npx @servicenow/sdk auth --add https://myinstance.service-now.com
    ```

    **Note:** Using the `npx` command installs the ServiceNow SDK in your application directory instead of globally.

5.  Respond to the following series of prompts.
