# Build Agent use cases

Use Build Agent for a wide range of development scenarios beyond application creation, including app analysis, modernization, documentation, governance, and learning assistance.

## Documentation creation

Use Build Agent to create customized knowledge articles, so users can access information and learn the application more easily.

Build Agent can automate the creation of readme files for source code repositories. Generated readme files provide clear, structured documentation that outlines installation procedures, usage guidelines, and example snippets, which reduces onboarding time for new developers.

## Learning assistance

Use Build Agent as a resource for learning ServiceNow application development practices. You can ask about many topics, including development techniques, available APIs, and the overall functionality of the ServiceNow AI Platform.

Build Agent supports continuous learning by summarizing relevant documentation, highlighting key points, and providing concrete examples that illustrate complex concepts. These examples help developers apply general guidelines in their work.

For guidance on structuring a complete development lifecycle with Build Agent, including source control, testing, and release management, see the [SDLC on ServiceNow guide](https://servicenow.github.io/sdk/guides/sdlc-guide) in the ServiceNow SDK documentation.

## Brainstorming sessions

Use Build Agent to refine application development ideas and capture structured requirements for later build steps during brainstorming sessions. Requirements are captured during these sessions, supporting a structured process for developing application features. Ideas are documented so your team can revisit previous discussions and integrate feedback during the development lifecycle.

## Additional use cases

Use the following scenarios to identify specific ways to apply Build Agent in your development workflow.

-   **Playbook authoring**

    Use Build Agent to author Playbook Designer artifacts through a conversation. As of Australia Patch 6, you can have Build Agent do the following for playbooks that it generates:

    -   Generate runtime permissions at the playbook and stage levels
    -   Define on-demand launcher configurations
    -   Create optional activities scoped globally or to a specific stage
    -   Configure Set Playbook Outputs activity definitions for nested playbooks
    -   Set Agentic activity fields on form-based and record-based activities
    For details on using playbooks with Build Agent, see [Supported metadata in Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-supported-metadata.md). For more information on using playbooks, see [Exploring Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/process-automation-designer.md).

-   **App gap analysis**

    Summarize an existing app, identify gaps in coverage, and propose targeted enhancements. For example, Build Agent identifies tables without ACLs, business rules with no test coverage, and manual steps that could be automated with flows.

-   **Security posture review**

    Open an existing app and audit its ACLs, roles, and data filters. Build Agent identifies gaps such as tables with no ACLs, overly permissive rules, and missing role hierarchy, then generates fixes.

-   **Test coverage bootstrapping**

    Analyze an app's metadata, identify what has zero test coverage, generate Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) tests for the gaps, run them, and triage failures.

-   **Architecture diagrams**

    Generate Mermaid.js diagrams by querying and collating data from the platform.

-   **Common workflow patterns**

    Describe a common business process, such as intake and approval, escalation routing, or SLA monitoring with dashboards. Build Agent then scaffolds the full workflow, including tables, flows, catalog items, notifications, and reporting.

-   **Migration acceleration**

    Provide your source system's table definitions, business logic, or data model pasted as SQL, text, CSV, or screenshots. Build Agent then recreates the equivalent tables, fields, relationships, and automation on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

-   **App modernization**

    Analyze legacy customizations such as classic workflows, Jelly UI, and script-heavy logic, then rebuild them using modern patterns: flows instead of workflows, React UI pages instead of Jelly, and structured security instead of script-based checks.

-   **Data-model scaffolding**

    Paste a CSV file, drop a spreadsheet screenshot into the chat, or describe your data model in plain text. Build Agent generates the matching ServiceNow tables, columns, and relationships. For Excel or PDF input, convert to CSV or paste a screenshot first.

-   **Cross-scope workflows**

    Build custom apps that write to global tables such as Incident. For example, auto-generate incidents when assets become overdue.

-   **Build from user stories**

    Point Build Agent at a user story from the rm\_story \[rm\_story\] table or paste one from another tool. The acceptance criteria drive development, creating the tables, logic, and tests that satisfy each criterion.

    **Note:** Querying the rm\_story \[rm\_story\] table directly requires the Agile Development 2.0 plugin.

-   **SQL to table**

    Paste a SQL `CREATE TABLE` definition into the chat and Build Agent translates it into a ServiceNow table with matching column types and relationships.

-   **Post-build summaries**

    Generate release notes and summary documents after the build foundation is complete.

-   **Instance governance setup**

    Create instance scan checks that enforce your organization's standards, including naming conventions, security requirements, and code quality. Checks run as part of your existing instance scan infrastructure.
