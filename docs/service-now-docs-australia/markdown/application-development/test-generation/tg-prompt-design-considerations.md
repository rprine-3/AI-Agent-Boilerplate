# Design considerations for prompting

Generate your desired test by following the guided principles of effective prompting.

Starting with the Australia release, Test generation is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   Clear and concise ATF prompts that describes test steps
-   Consider the scope and capability of Test generation
    -   Test generation is a ServiceNow Otto backed skill to create ATF tests
    -   The tests are created in the application scope that you are currently on
    -   Other types of functional or integration tests are out of Test generation scope
    -   Test generation can't update or delete existing ATF tests
-   Test generation supports the following
    -   Forms: open/submit form, field validation/visibility, UI/Declarative Action and Modal button. Each form API supports workspace as formUI type, including service\_operations\_workspace and asset\_workspace and cmdb\_workspace.
    -   Server operations: impersonation/create user, log message, record CRUD, replay request, search catalog item and check out shopping cart​.
    -   Email: generate, reply, send and validate inbound / outbound email​
    -   Application Navigator: navigate to module, menu/module visibility​
    -   Reporting: report visibility, dash board visibility and sharing​
    -   Service Catalog: open/order catalog item, add item to shopping cart, set/validate item quantity, submit order, validate quantity, price, and variable status​

Good and effective prompts

Bad and irrelevant prompts

</th><th>

Comparison description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Write a test to create a new user with name Bill McDermott and assign the "itil" role. Create a new incident record, update the short description to "my new test record" and then validate the record description. Update caller to Bill McDermott, impact and urgency categories to "2- Medium" and submit the record. Delete the record and create a log for the deletion.

</td><td>

I need a new user Bill McDermott to open a new record. Make sure its called my new test record. Update caller to user, impact and urgency categories to Med. Delete the record and create a log for the deletion.

</td><td>

The bad prompt is irrelevant and incomplete for the following reasons:-   No user role defined
-   Insufficient definition around the new user. Its unclear if the new user is to be created or impersonated
-   Insufficient definition around record handling with the name
-   No specific info about the caller field update
-   Not specific about category value to be used

</td></tr><tr><td>

Write an ATF test, named 'incident record test', impersonate admin, create a new incident record, then update the record short description to 'test update field from example', delete the record, then log a message 'record deleted'

</td><td>

Create an ATF test for an admin to create an incident record. Make description test update field from example. Then delete the record

</td><td>

The bad prompt lacks the following:-   Does not specify "create a new user" or "impersonate" for the model to understand
-   Unclear expectation around setting description name
-   Unclear where exactly the name for the description begins

</td></tr><tr><td>

Write a test to open Apple iPhone 13 catalog item, set color to 'pink', monthly data allowance to 500MB, validate price to be $800.00 and log the price

</td><td>

Write a test to open iPhone, color should be pink and data should be 500. The price should be 800. Log the price

</td><td>

The bad prompt is incomplete for the following reasons:-   Catalog Item entity hasn’t been called out
-   Missing keywords such as set or update for field value settings
-   Incomplete field id specified for monthly data allowance
-   Unclear expectation for price validation
-   Missing $ sign in price
