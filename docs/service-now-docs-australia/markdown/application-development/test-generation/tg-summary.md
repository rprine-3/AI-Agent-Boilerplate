# Test generation design considerations

Leverage the full potential of Test generation by following these design considerations.

Starting with the Australia release, Test generation is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Test generation records and components

Test generation application has the following records and components.

-   **Test**

    A test is a logical grouping of related automated test steps that verify some functionality or feature. Each test is a record in the Test \[sys\_atf\_test\] table. Test designers typically create a test to verify one feature or a group of related features.

-   **Test step**

    A test step combines a step configuration with the runtime test data necessary to run a step. The test step always specifies the order in which it runs in the test. Test steps have their own related list of step results. Each test step is a record in the Test Step \[sys\_atf\_step\] table that specifies a test action, the step configuration, and an execution order. Test designers add test steps to tests to verify functionality.


## Exceptions

-   Test generation doesn't support the following test step categories:
    -   Custom UI
    -   Lists
    -   Service Catalog in Service Portal
    -   Forms in Service Portal
-   Test generation for Servicenow store provided scoped apps. Tests can be created either in Global scope or custom scope, excluding ServiceNow default scope apps.
