# Exploring Test generation

If you are new to Test generation application, read this overview to learn what the app can do.

Starting with the Australia release, Test generation is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Test generation overview

Revolutionize your test automation with Test generation application. Simply outline your test requirements, and Test generation will generate a comprehensive test script. You can then refine the generated test to meet your exact specifications. It helps you achieve the following:

-   Test generation store application simplifies the process of creating test cases, significantly reducing manual effort and time.
-   You can only provide high-level test requirements, making the process more accessible and less technical.
-   Test generation application generates comprehensive test cases, ensuring thorough testing coverage.
-   You can keep modifying the prompt without saving the generated tests until the final objective has been attained.

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).
