# Agentic development app refinement in ServiceNow Studio

ServiceNow Studio connects AI-generated apps to enterprise-grade solutions, where you can review, edit, and enhance your application in a dedicated development environment.

After developing an application agentically with Build Agent or ServiceNow Otto for Creator, ServiceNow Studio provides a powerful, developer-friendly environment for reviewing, customizing, and perfecting your app.

If you're a developer who's new to agentic development, ServiceNow Studio provides a more abstracted approach to code refinement compared to ServiceNow IDE.

For documentation on using Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio, see [Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/build-agent-in-servicenow-studio.md).

## ServiceNow Studio workflow

To review and refine your app from Build Agent in ServiceNow Studio, follow these steps:

1.  Open your app in ServiceNow Studio.

2.  Use Build Agent to create or edit metadata for your application.
3.  Review and edit application files.

    -   Use the **Application Files** tab to see all generated elements and metadata—tables, access controls, roles, record producers, and more.
    -   Open any file \(such as a table or ACL\) in a new tab for detailed inspection and editing.
    -   Confirm that generated tables capture the correct data and adjust field properties as needed.
    -   Edit access control lists \(ACLs\) to confirm that the correct roles and permissions are applied.
    -   Review and modify roles, record producers, and other artifacts for accuracy.
4.  Use developer tools in ServiceNow Studio.

    -   ServiceNow Studio provides a tabbed, IDE-like interface for navigation and editing.
    -   You can refine code, add business logic, and manage metadata across your app's scope.
    -   Use Build Agent for update set management, cross-scope editing, and safe deployment.
5.  Iterate with Build Agent.

    -   Use the Build Agent panel to edit metadata for your application.
    -   Toggle the panel as needed to avoid covering important information.
6.  Test and validate the app.

    -   Use Build Agent to create and run Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) tests.
    -   Verify that your refined app functions correctly.

## When to choose the ServiceNow IDE or ServiceNow Studio

1.  ServiceNow IDE: Best for file‑centric, code‑heavy edits, rapid iteration, and pairing with the ServiceNow SDK for local dev/CI. Suitable for developers familiar with the ServiceNow AI Platform.
2.  ServiceNow Studio: Best for metadata‑centric review \(tables, ACLs, roles\) and cross‑scope editing with a visual overview of app artifacts; keeps Now Assist in‑context for conversational adjustments. Suitable for developers with various levels of experience on the ServiceNow AI Platform.
