# Build Agent and ServiceNow AI Platform tools

Compare how Build Agent behaves in ServiceNow Studio \(UI-first, declarative workflows\) versus the ServiceNow IDE \(code-first, autonomous full-stack development\), so you can choose the right environment for your task and audience.

Build Agent is available in both ServiceNow Studio and the ServiceNow IDE, but each environment emphasizes a different development style. ServiceNow Studio provides a guided, UI-first experience that focuses on metadata creation and controlled, iterative changes. The ServiceNow IDE provides a code-first experience with an autonomous agent capable of generating and modifying full-stack applications through conversational prompts.

## Audience and intent

Choose the environment based on your skill set and the type of work:

-   ServiceNow Studio: Low-code builders and admins who prefer declarative, metadata-driven workflows with previews, diffs, and guardrails.
-   ServiceNow IDE: Pro-code developers who need conversational, code-centric generation, advanced customization, and end-to-end build and deploy steps.

## Key differences between ServiceNow Studio and the ServiceNow IDE

|Area|ServiceNow Studio|ServiceNow IDE|
|----|-----------------|--------------|
|Primary style|UI-first, declarative, metadata-centric|Code-first, conversational, full-stack|
|Typical users|Low-code builders, admins|Pro-code developers|
|Interaction model|Guided steps with suggestions, diffs, and summaries; selectable modes \(guided, batch, one-shot\)|Chat-driven autonomous generation; user approves edits, then build and deploy|
|Scope of automation|Create or update platform metadata \(tables, flows, experiences\) with dependency awareness|Generate and edit entire scoped or global apps \(UI and backend\), explain or repair code, run queries, create documentation|
|Change control|Strong guardrails; preview via ServiceNow Studio diff surfaces|Approval gates before writing; build and deploy workflow in the ServiceNow IDE|
|Best fit|Iterative configuration, edits, low-code delivery|Greenfield app creation, deep refactors, debugging, multi-artifact edits|
|Dependencies|Uses the ServiceNow Studio agentic experience layer and metadata explorers|Relies on the ServiceNow IDE workspace, file and metadata explorers, and build pipeline|

**Note:** You can do conversational checkpoints with Build Agent and roll back to the last conversation checkpoint in both ServiceNow Studio and the ServiceNow IDE.

## Typical Build Agent workflow

A general workflow for using Build Agent in either ServiceNow Studio or the ServiceNow IDE is the following:

1.  Make sure that everything you need is properly configured in the settings, such as supported MCP server connections. For more information, see [Build Agent configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/configure-build-agent.md).
2.  Open ServiceNow Studio.Use the central chat area on the home page to start a new conversation, or select the Conversations icon \[Omitted image "ba-sns-otto-nav-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the Navigator panel to open an existing conversation.
3.  Describe what to create or change in natural language.
4.  Let Build Agent parse requirements and propose the application and files to create or modify.
5.  Build Agent edits code or metadata or scaffolds a new application.
6.  Review proposed edits, diffs, and summaries, and approve or adjust before applying changes. Review checkpoints and manual edit update sets. In ServiceNow Studio, view generated app details from the **Apps** tab, and inspect the source code from the **Explorer** tab.
7.  Iterate until the desired metadata changes are complete. For more information, see [Supported metadata in Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-supported-metadata.md).
8.  Prompt Build Agent to create and run Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) tests to verify that the tests execute as expected. Depending on your configuration, Build Agent may ask you if you want to run ATF tests. If there are failures, auto troubleshooting triages the tests and produces a regression test suite that you can use to monitor app health.
9.  Instruct Build Agent to build the application; verify results in the File Navigator or Metadata Explorer.
10. Deploy the application. If you're using source control, you can push to Git.For more information, see [Deploying what you built with Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent-deployment.md).

-   [Agentic development app refinement in the ServiceNow IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/vc-refine-using-ide.md)

## How to choose

Use ServiceNow Studio when you want to do metadata-centric, abstracted low-code development. ServiceNow Studio provides structured, metadata-focused changes with strong previews and guardrails in low-code builders.

Use the ServiceNow IDE when you want file system code-centric development. The ServiceNow IDE provides autonomous, end-to-end generation, complex refactors, and deeper debugging and code explanations.

## Notes and limitations

Keep the following in mind when using Build Agent:

-   Build Agent generates metadata supported by ServiceNow Fluent. Verify artifact compatibility before approval.
-   Feature availability and UI details might differ between monthly releases. Confirm behavior against your instance version.
