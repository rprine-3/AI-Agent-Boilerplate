# Enrich a master data request

Add supplementary details to master data requests to prepare each record for governance review and approval.

## Before you begin

Domain access is determined by your administrator.

Role required: An MDM Orchestrator enricher role. \(For more information, see [Roles used in App Engine ERP Rapid Deployment Packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/aes-erp-rdp-components-installed.md).\)

## Procedure

1.  In the menu bar, select **Workspaces** &gt; **MDM Orchestrator Dashboard**.

    The dashboard displays pending enrichment requests, service level agreement \(SLA\) breach indicators, in-progress tasks, and a list of the enrichment records assigned to you.

2.  In **My Team Recent Requests**, select a request.

    The record displays the details submitted by the requestor, any attachments, the duplicate-check result, and the fields designated for enrichment.

3.  Add the enrichment data.

    Enrichers typically add data from external or supplementary sources. For a customer record, this might include a company code, a credit score, the legal entity, or an industry classification.

4.  Select **Save**.

    Saving does not advance the request. You can return and edit the enrichment fields.

5.  When finished, select **Complete Request**.


## Result

A governance user performs compliance checks before the record is sent to the approver. For information about the governance stage, see [Governance review](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/aes-erp-rdp-governance-review.md).
