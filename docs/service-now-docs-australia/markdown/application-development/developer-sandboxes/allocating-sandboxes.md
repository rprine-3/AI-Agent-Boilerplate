## Result

Developer Sandboxes starts the process of provisioning the sandbox.

**Note:** It can take between 10 minutes and two hours for a sandbox to be provisioned, depending on the size of the tables used in the template. You can select the refresh icon \[Omitted image "dev-sbx-refresh-icon.png"\] Alt text: to see updates to the Sandboxes list.The record for the sandbox appears in the list as **Initializing** until the sandbox is ready.

Once allocated, developers can access their sandbox by pre-pending the **Sandbox alias** value to the instance name followed by `devsandboxes`. For example, `https://samsbox.[instance].devsandboxes.servicenow.com`.

Sandbox users use the same login credentials for their sandbox as the base instance. If you use Single Sign-On \(SSO\) for login, when you enable it to connect to your account on the base instance, Developer Sandboxes authenticates using the same mechanism and credentials as the base instance. For information on enabling SSO, see [Installing Developer Sandboxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/dev-sbx-installing.md).
