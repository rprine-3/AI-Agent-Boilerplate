# Supported ServiceNow AI Platform features in Developer Sandboxes

Developer Sandboxes supports almost all development-related ServiceNow AI Platform features.

## Development features and apps

Supported features include the following:

-   Metadata updates
-   System Update Sets
-   Legacy source control

    **Note:** Each sandbox can connect to source control with its own git branch. For more information, see [Source control and Developer Sandboxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/dev-sandboxes-source-control.md).

-   ServiceNow IDE
-   Workflow Studio
-   App and plugin installation

    **Note:** Apps and plugins can be installed and upgraded in a sandbox independently.

-   Outgoing integrations

    **Note:** Incoming integrations must be manually updated by customers to support the unique URLs of sandboxes.


## Sandbox considerations and limitations

Upgrading an instance automatically backs up update sets to the base instance and recreates the sandboxes on that instance. Sandboxes are recreated in a base state, so you must restore backed up update sets. For details, see [Cloning and upgrading considerations for Developer Sandboxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/dev-sbx-clone-upgrade-info.md).

**Note:** Sandboxes are not automatically recreated after a clone. You should save your work from a sandbox before the clone so you can recreate it.

You can have up to 30 sandboxes per instance.

Developer Sandboxes does not support self-hosted instances by default, though you can set up your own networking and routing changes to support sandboxes.
