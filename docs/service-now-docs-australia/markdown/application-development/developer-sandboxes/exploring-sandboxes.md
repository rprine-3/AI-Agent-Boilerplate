# Exploring Developer Sandboxes

Developer Sandboxes provide isolated development environments that enable parallel building and testing on top of a shared development instance. Use sandboxes to reduce code conflicts, accelerate delivery, and safely test configurations without affecting other team members' work.

\[Omitted image "dev-sbx-infographic1-updated.png"\] Alt text: Developer Sandboxes architecture and workflow. For the text description, refer to the following sections.

-   Developer Sandboxes are isolated environments for parallel building and testing.
-   Each sandbox is provisioned on demand and fully isolated from others.
-   Every sandbox contains the full metadata of the base instance.
-   Sandboxes can be assigned to specific stories, developers, test plans, or custom criteria.

## Developer Sandboxes overview

Developer Sandboxes aim to provide lower-cost developer isolation and parallelism for customer development environments and instances. Developer Sandboxes are workflow-agnostic and are broadly applicable across workflows for both smaller and larger companies.

Organizations can face challenges when addressing urgent defects and critical feature enhancements simultaneously in applications. Traditional shared development environments introduce risks such as code conflicts, configuration overlaps, and deployment delays, making it difficult to manage parallel workstreams efficiently. Development teams struggle to deliver urgent fixes and new features concurrently without disrupting each others' progress. The absence of isolated, independent development environments slows down delivery, increases rework, and hampers overall agility.

Developer Sandboxes enables better development in the following ways:

-   Isolation: Each developer works in an independent sandbox, ensuring changes do not affect other team members’ work.
-   Faster delivery: Teams can work concurrently, reducing development cycle time and enabling faster turnaround for urgent fixes and enhancements.
-   Safe testing: Developers can test configurations, workflows, and integrations within their sandbox without risking system stability.
-   On-demand provisioning: Admins and developers can quickly provision sandboxes for specific tasks or experiments without waiting for shared resources.

**Note:** Personal Development Instances \(PDIs\) are still available, but they don't have a controlled baseline configuration like Developer Sandboxes do.

\[Omitted image "sandboxes-management-home.png"\] Alt text: Sandbox Management home dashboard.

The Sandbox Management home dashboard displays the total, available, and allocated sandboxes in your instance. The dashboard also displays information relevant to each sandbox, including, the status, data utilization, owner, last accessed date, and when the sandbox was allocated.

Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to Developer Sandboxes. For more information, see [Developer Sandboxes entitlements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/dev-sbx-entitlements.md).

**Warning:** Because sandboxes are retired automatically after an upgrade or clone, ensure any work that you want to keep is preserved before upgrading or cloning.

-   For upgrades, you can restore work from the remote update sets that Developer Sandboxes automatically created from prior sandboxes.
-   For clones, you must manually save and restore all work in sandboxes.
-   Any custom table configuration changes or fixes must be reapplied after an upgrade. Contact Now Support to open a case.

For details, see [Cloning and upgrading considerations for Developer Sandboxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/dev-sbx-clone-upgrade-info.md).

Build Agent is supported in Developer Sandboxes. For more information, see [Build Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/build-agent.md).

## Integrate sandboxes with source control

Developer Sandboxes provide an isolated environment that integrates with source control, such as Git. Using merge tools helps eliminate conflicts and enables parallel development. For more information, see [Source control and Developer Sandboxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/dev-sandboxes-source-control.md).

## Developer Sandboxes users

|User|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Delegated developers|Delegated developers can request sandboxes from an admin or sandbox manager.|
|Admins|Admins can allocate or retire sandboxes.|
|Sandbox managers|Sandbox managers can administer the lifecycle of all sandboxes without full admin privileges.|
|Sandbox users|Sandbox users can request and view Developer Sandboxes.|

Sandbox users use the same login credentials for their sandbox as the base instance. If you use Single Sign-On \(SSO\) for login, when you enable it to connect to your account on the base instance, Developer Sandboxes authenticates using the same mechanism and credentials as the base instance. For information on enabling SSO, see [Installing Developer Sandboxes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/developer-sandboxes/dev-sbx-installing.md).

**Note:** Instances with vanity URLs support SSO.

## Developer Sandboxes workflow

The delegated developer or admin of a sandbox would procure a sandbox, make changes or experiment with development, test their changes, push their changes, and wait for an admin to clone the instance.

1.  A sandbox manager or admin allocates a sandbox to start story work.
2.  The developer makes development changes and tests them out in their fully isolated sandbox.

    **Note:** The work done in one sandbox doesn't appear in other sandboxes or other instances.

3.  Once the developer is content with their work and ready to promote their changes to a shared, integrated environment, they push their changes to the desired upstream shared instance. For example, a `test`/`QA` instance. There are two ways to promote changes:
    1.  Using source control \(preferable\) or exports through Git
    2.  Using update sets and imports \(supported, but not as easy to merge changes\)
4.  Further testing can be done on the shared instance.
5.  The admin of a sandbox instance clones changes from the `test`/`QA` instance to make those changes the default for all future allocated sandboxes.
