# Developer Sandboxes domain separation

Domain separation is supported for Developer Sandboxes. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic



-   Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
-   The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider \(SP\) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).

## Overview of domain separation in Developer Sandboxes

Domain separation must be installed and set up on the base instance before sandboxes are created. When creating a sandbox, the domains defined in the base instance are inherited, and users can define new domains only for the lifecycle of that sandbox. Installing the plugin directly in a sandbox will not work correctly.
