# Customize a workspace home page in Workspace Builder

Edit the home page for a workspace in Workspace Builder. Adjust what users see when first accessing the workspace, which is a dashboard.

This video shows you how to perform the following procedure.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   admin or Guided Application Creator for ServiceNow Studio.
-   sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user or delegated\_developer for AES. For more information, see [Delegate developers using AES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-app-dev-workflow.md).

## About this task

You can edit workspace home pages in Workspace Builder only for workspaces created in Tokyo and going forward. You can edit older workspaces in UI Builder.

**Note:** The home page is an essential part of the workspace, and thus can't be hidden or removed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Workspace Builder.

    For details on how to open Workspace Builder in ServiceNow Studio or AES, see [Accessing Workspace Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/workspace-builder/accessing-workspace-builder-aes-crs.md).

2.  Add an element to the page.

    You must be in the **Navigation configuration** tab. If you're already in the **Navigation configuration** tab, you can't select it.

    1.  In the navigation panel, select **Home**.

    2.  In the home page canvas, select **Add new element**.

    3.  From the list, select the element or component that you want to add.

        For example, to add a graphic of data from the specified table, select **Data visualization** and choose a **New data visualization** or a **Saved data visualization**.

        You can add the following elements to the home page in Workspace Builder.
