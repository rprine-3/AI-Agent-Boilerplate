# Enable analytics for a workspace in Workspace Builder

Enable the Analytics Overview for a workspace in Workspace Builder. The Analytics Overview enables users to track and analyze records and usage with dashboards, data visualizations, and insights on the instance.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   admin or Guided Application Creator for ServiceNow Studio.
-   sn\_app\_eng\_studio.user or delegated\_developer for AES. For more information, see [Delegate developers using AES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/app-engine-studio/aes-app-dev-workflow.md).

## About this task

If Analytics Overview page/route doesn't exist for a workspace, Workspace Builder is still available, but the Analytics Overview tab doesn't appear in the workspace.

The Analytics Overview always displays current, refreshed content.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Workspace Builder.

    For details on how to open Workspace Builder in ServiceNow Studio or AES, see [Accessing Workspace Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/workspace-builder/accessing-workspace-builder-aes-crs.md).

2.  In the navigation panel, select **Analytics**.

    You must be in the **Navigation configuration** tab. If you're already in the **Navigation configuration** tab, you can't select it.

    A mock-up of the Analytics Overview appears in the preview panel.

3.  In the configuration panel, select the **Activate Analytics Center** toggle option.

4.  Make additional configuration updates to the Analytics Overview by selecting the **Open in UI Builder** link in the canvas header.


## Result
