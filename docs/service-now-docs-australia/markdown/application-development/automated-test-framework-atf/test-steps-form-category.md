# Form category

Validate the functionality of fields and UI actions on a form.

**Note:** Test steps that include the **Form UI** field give you the option to select an available UI. For any available workspace, navigation between tabs is not supported. Use the **Open a New Form** or **Open an Existing Record** step to reopen a form.

It is to be noted that Agent Workspace has been removed from the Platform. If you have any Agent Workspace tests or test suites, they won't work anymore.

## Open a New Form

Open a form to a new record in the specified table and **Form UI**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Set Field Values

Set the fields on the current form to the specified values.

To run this step, your test must have already opened a form using either the **Open a New Form** or **Open an Existing Record** step. It is recommended to not run this step directly after a **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** step. This is because they can redirect your test to a different page based on the navigation stack configuration on your instance or the script defined in the clicked UI action. Unless you are certain that the UI action will take you to a specific page, you should explicitly use an **Open a New Form** step after **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** to ensure that the test is on the form as expected. Ensure that the test keeps passing consistently when added to a suite.

The **Field Values Validation**, **Set Field Values**, **Field State Validation**, and **UI Action Visibility** steps can appear in any order.

**Note:** This step waits for the form to load before setting field values. This step doesn't support reference qualifiers, neither at test design time nor at test runtime. A modal form appears either on top of another form or a list. To submit a modal form after setting the field values, your test must have already opened it on top of a form or a list.\[Omitted image "atf-modal-form.png"\] Alt text: Image showing modal form

</table>## Field Values Validation

Validate field values on the current form.

To run this step, your test must have already opened a form using either the **Open a New Form** or **Open an Existing Record** step. It is recommended to not run this step directly after a **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** step. This is because they can redirect your test to a different page based on the navigation stack configuration on your instance or the script defined in the clicked UI action. Unless you are certain that the UI action will take you to a specific page, you should explicitly use an **Open a New Form** step after **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** to ensure that the test is on the form as expected. Ensure that the test keeps passing consistently when added to a suite.

The **Field Values Validation**, **Set Field Values**, **Field State Validation**, and **UI Action Visibility** steps can appear in any order.

For the **Field Values Validation** step, specify the values that you want to test using the standard conditions builder. You can test several conditions against the same field. This step passes if the overall condition is satisfied and fails if the condition is not satisfied. The **Conditions** field is case-sensitive and requires to have the exact value as on the form. To test the values of individual fields independently of each other, include a separate **Field Values Validation** step for each value that you test.

**Note:** The **Field Values Validation** step works only with fields that belong to the record for the open form. For example, with the incident table, this step is not able to validate the **Additional comments**, **Approval history**, **Comments**, or **Work notes** fields because these UI controls are not actual fields on the incident record. These UI controls make it convenient to work with related tables. To validate these cases, use the Server test step, **Record Validation**, instead.

## Click Modal Button

Click a button within a modal in the specified **Form UI**.

Specify your testing by selecting either the standard platform UI or workspace UI from the **Form UI** field. If you select the standard platform UI, this test step selects the button by ID on the specified modal and validates the following conditions:

-   UI page was opened in a modal.
-   Button is visible and enabled.

If you select an available workspace UI, this test step selects either the Confirm or Cancel action and optionally sets the field values within the modal. This step succeeds only if a modal dialog is open on the form, and if the specified button exists on that modal dialog.

Only modals opened with the following g\_modal functions are supported:

-   alert
-   confirm
-   confirmDestroy
-   showFields

**Note:** Click Modal Button now supports global and scoped application modals.

</table>**Note:** The Click Modal Button test step can't access the newly added UI workspace options.

## Click a UI Action

Click a UI action on the current form.

When this step runs, the system performs the action normally activated by that control. The test step also validates that the current form contains the control and that the control is visible and enabled. To run this step, your test must have already opened a form using either the **Open a New Form** or **Open an Existing Record** step. It is recommended to not run this step directly after a **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** step. This is because they can redirect your test to a different page based on the navigation stack configuration on your instance or the script defined in the clicked UI action. Unless you are certain that the UI action will take you to a specific page, you should explicitly use an **Open a New Form** step after **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** to ensure that the test is on the form as expected. Ensure that the test keeps passing consistently when added to a suite.

In the Australia release, this step supports UI actions of type Form context menu.

**Note:** Don't write tests that depend on the system displaying a specific page after executing a **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** step. After these test steps, the system returns to the page that was open before the form was opened. The test cannot determine what that page was, so writing a test that expects a particular page can lead to unpredictable results.

It is recommended to not run this step directly after a **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** step. This is because they can redirect your test to a different page based on the navigation stack configuration on your instance or the script defined in the clicked UI action. Unless you are certain that the UI action will take you to a specific page, you should explicitly use an **Open a New Form** step after **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** to ensure that the test is on the form as expected. Ensure that the test keeps passing consistently when added to a suite.

**Note:** Don't write tests that depend on the system displaying a specific page after executing a **Submit a Form** or **Click a UI Action** step. After these test steps, the system returns to the page that was open before the form was opened. The test cannot determine what that page was, so writing a test that expects a particular page can lead to unpredictable results.

A modal form appears either on top of another form or a list. To submit a modal form, your test must have already opened it on top of a form or a list.

Execution order

</td><td>

Integer specifying the order in which the test executes this step.As you create steps, the system automatically assigns each step an incremental value. This value causes the test to execute steps in the order that you created them in. You can change this default order by editing the **Execution order** values.

Timeout

</td><td>

Number of seconds allowed before the step fails. If the validation fails, the system repeats the step until it reaches the duration of the timeout. If the validation fails after the timeout duration has passed, the step fails.**Note:** This field appears when an available workspace is chosen from **Form UI**.

Option to select an available UI. Apart from the Standard UI, you have other workspace selections available. Depending on the selected workspace, the UI might vary.**Note:** Workspaces are not supported in Internet Explorer \(IE\).

Assert type

</td><td>

The effect on the tests on submitting a form.-   **Form submitted to server**: The step passes only if the form is submitted.
-   **Form submission canceled in browser**: The step passes only if form submission is canceled.
-   **None**: Make no assertion on submitting the form. The step always passes when using this assert type regardless of the result of submitting the form.
