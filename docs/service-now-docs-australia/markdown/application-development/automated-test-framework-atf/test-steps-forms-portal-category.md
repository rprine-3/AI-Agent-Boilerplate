# Forms in Service Portal category

Validate the functionality of fields and UI actions in Service Portal form widgets.

## Service Portal dependency

Creating automated Service Portal steps requires knowledge of the ServiceNow data model and Service Portal form and data structures.

## Open a Form \(SP\)

Opens a form in a portal.

Use this step for the base system Form page. For custom form pages, use the [Open Service Portal Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/test-steps-custom-ui-category.md) step from the Custom UI category.
