# Pass values from one automated test step to another

Assign a form field the value of an output variable returned from a previous step.

## Before you begin

You must have a previous test step that returns an appropriate output variable.

Role required: admin, atf\_test\_admin and atf\_test\_designer

## Procedure

1.  To the right of the field whose value you want to assign, click the input value icon \( \[Omitted image "rem-value-icon.png"\] Alt text: Input value icon\)

    The input value mapping control lists previous steps that create an output variable. If no previous steps create an output variable, the control displays the message: There are no elements to show.

2.  Click the row for the step that contains the output variable you want to use as an input.

3.  Click the output variable you want to use.

    If the output variable is an id for a glide record, the control displays a tree picker providing access to fields for this record.

4.  Navigate through the tree picker hierarchy until you find and select the value you want.
