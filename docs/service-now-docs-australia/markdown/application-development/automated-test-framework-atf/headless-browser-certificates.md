# Generate certificates for Headless Browser setup for Linux

Generate TLS/SSL certificates to secure the Docker REST API and authenticate HTTP requests.

## Before you begin

Complete the prerequisites listed in the [Headless Browser setup for Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/headless-browser-procedure-linux.md) topic.

Role required: admin on your ServiceNow instance and local administrator on the host machine.

## About this task

**Warning:** Get certificate authority keys from a trusted certificate authority.

By default when exposing the Docker API, requests are not authenticated, which can leave your host machine vulnerable to attack. Docker API, however, does support TLS authentication where requests are verified against public private keys provided in the HTTPS encryption. In this step you create those keys for the server and the client.

**Tip:** To make remembering these easier, enter the following commands in your Linux terminal. **Note**: Do not add these environment variables to your terminal profile. For security reasons, they should only exist for the duration of the current session.

-   `export PASSWORD="<password to generate the certificates with>"`
-   `export SERVERIP="<this server's IP address>"`
-   `export HOSTNAME="<hostname of this server>"`

To learn more, see [Use TLS \(HTTPS\) to protect the Docker daemon socket](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/#:~:text=Use%20TLS%20(HTTPS)%20to%20protect,to%20a%20trusted%20CA%20certificate.).

## Procedure

1.  Open a command line.

2.  Generate a self-signed certificate authority key or retrieve a keypair from a trusted certificate authority.

    The following commands are an example. Note that your configuration might vary.

    -   `openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:$PASSWORD -out ca-key.pem 4096`
    -   `openssl req -passin pass:$PASSWORD -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca-key.pem -sha256 -out ca.pem`
    -   `chmod 0400 ca-key.pem`
    -   `chmod 0444 ca.pem`
3.  Generate the server keypair using the certificate authority key.

    The following commands are an example. Note that your configuration might vary.

    -   `openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 4096`
    -   `openssl req -subj "/CN=$HOSTNAME" -new -key server-key.pem -out server.csr`
    -   `echo "subjectAltName = DNS:$HOSTNAME,IP:$SERVERIP,IP:127.0.0.1" > extfile.cnf`
    -   `openssl x509 -passin pass:$PASSWORD -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -extfile extfile.cnf`
4.  Create the client keypair using the certificate authority key.

    The following commands are an example. Note that your configuration might vary.

    -   `openssl genrsa -out client-key.pem 4096`
    -   `openssl req -subj "/CN=$HOSTNAME" -new -key client-key.pem -out client.csr`
    -   `echo "extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth" > extfile.cnf`
    -   `openssl x509 -passin pass:$PASSWORD -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out client-cert.pem -extfile extfile.cnf`
    Now you've created all your encryption keys.

5.  Import the CA Public Key and Client Keypair to a java keystore.

    The following commands are an example. Note that your configuration might vary.

    Create the keystore file and create a password for it \(and save for later use\): `keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias dse -keystore my.keystore`

    Delete a default entry from the keystore file: `keytool -delete -alias dse -keystore my.keystore`

    Import the CA public key to the keystore: `keytool -import -keystore my.keystore -trustcacerts -alias ca -file ca.pem`

    Import the client keypair.

    **Note:** You are creating a new pkcs12 keystore file and importing the keypair to it. Then copy the contents to your original keystore file.

    -   `openssl pkcs12 -export -name clientkeypair -in client-cert.pem -inkey client-key.pem -out clientkeypair.p12`
    -   `keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore my.keystore -srckeystore clientkeypair.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias clientkeypair`
    Now that you have added all of the certificates to the keystore file, save the file **my.keystore** for later, as it will be uploaded to the ServiceNow instance. In addition, be sure to remember the password that you entered when prompted to create the keystore file; you will need to enter that into a form in the ServiceNow instance.
