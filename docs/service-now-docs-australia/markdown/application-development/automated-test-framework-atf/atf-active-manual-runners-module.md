# Active manual test runners

View the client test runners table filtered to show only those runners available to run manually-started tests.

When you start a manual [client test runner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-test-runners.md), the system registers that runner in the Test Runners table as active.

The data in this table is transient. While the runner is active, it reports in to the system at a specified interval. If the runner does not report in at the expected time, the system marks the runner as inactive. After a period of time the system deletes the runner. You can [modify these intervals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-modify-retention-test-clients.md) on the [Automated Test Framework properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-admin-properties.md) page.
