# Build and run your first automated test

Follow these step-by-step instructions to create and run your first automated test. This test creates a new user record.

-   The Automated Test Framework \(com.glide.automated\_testing\_framework\) plugin must be activated. It is activated by default on zBoot or upgrade.
-   If necessary, enable test execution. For instructions, see [Enable or disable executing Automated Test Framework tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-enable-tests.md).

    **Note:** By default, the system property that is used to run automated tests is disabled to prevent you from accidentally running these tests on a production system. To avoid data corruption or an outage, run tests only on development, test, and other non-production instances.

-   Role required: admin

### Result

The system displays the Run Test progress dialog. For more information about running automated tests, see [Run an automated test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-run-test.md).

## Monitor test progress and view test results

Monitor the progress of the automated test and view its test results.

### Before you begin

### About this task

If needed, you can cancel a test even while it's running. For more information, see [Cancelling automated tests and test suites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-cancelling.md).

### Procedure

1.  Monitor the progress of the test in the Run Test progress dialog.

    **Note:** If your test creates data, the system rolls back that data after all steps in the test complete.

2.  When complete, click **Go to Results** on the Run Test progress dialog to display the **Test Results** list, where you can [view and analyze the results.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-view-results-consolidated.md)
