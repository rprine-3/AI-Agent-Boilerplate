# Available quick start tests by application or feature

Validate that your instance still works after you make any configuration change such as apply an upgrade or develop an application. Copy and customize the ServiceNow -provided quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

**Danger**

By default, the system property that is used to run automated tests is turned off to prevent you from accidentally running these tests on a production system. To avoid data corruption or an outage, run tests only on development, test, and other non-production instances. See [Enable or disable executing Automated Test Framework tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-enable-tests.md).
