# Headless Browser for Automated Test Framework

Improve your UI testing by automating the creation of browsers to process Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) User Interface \(UI\) tests. This feature is known as a headless browser, and helps you test UI functionality without having to manually open a browser to the Client Test Runner, which is what processes the UI tests in your local browser.

**Important:** Headless Browser is a legacy feature of ATF; it is recommended to instead use the ATF Test Generator and Cloud Runner application. Cloud Runner offers you an easy setup and a seamless user experience. You can install [Cloud Runner](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/db1676d7421441106f046193880e0b37) from the store app.

If you are an on-premise instance user, you must continue using the Headless Browser option. Cloud Runner is not currently available for on-premise instances.

## Background

ServiceNow customers use Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) to test applications and instances. When developing in the ServiceNow platform, ATF ensures that your changes have both the desired behavior and don’t break existing features.

Since the ServiceNow Orlando release, customers can automate the testing and deployment of their applications via the [Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery \(CI/CD\) API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/cicd-api.md).
