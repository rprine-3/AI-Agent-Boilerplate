# Service Catalog category

Validate single catalog item transactions as well as requester and fulfiller flows in Service Catalog.

## Activation of the Automated Test Framework for Service Catalog

These test steps require activation of the The Automated Test Framework Service Catalog \(com.glide.automated\_testing\_impl.service\_catalog\) plugin, which is active by default on new instances. Administrators may need to activate the plugin on instances upgraded from earlier versions.

## Support for parametrized tests

Service Catalog step configurations support parametrized tests. For more information on parametrized tests, refer to [Parameterized tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/parameterized-tests.md).

## Variable editor support

After opening a record that supports variable editor \(requested item, catalog task, or incident\), you can add step configurations to set variable values, or validate variable states or values. Use the step configurations in the following order to support variable editor.

1.  Step configurations to order a catalog item or record producer in the **Service Catalog** category.
2.  **Open an Existing Record** step configuration in the **Form** category.
3.  **Set Variable Values**, **Validate Variable Values**, or **Variable State Validation** step configuration in the **Service Catalog** category.

**Note:** Custom variables and custom variable with labels are not supported for Set Variable Values, Validate Variable Values, and Variable State Validation step configurations.
