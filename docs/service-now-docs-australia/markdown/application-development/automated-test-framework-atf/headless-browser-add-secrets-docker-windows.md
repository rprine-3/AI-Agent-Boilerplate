# Add secrets to Docker for Headless Browser setup in Microsoft Windows

Create a Docker secret that stores the password of the ServiceNow user who will log into the instance to execute the tests. Docker Secrets is a feature of ServiceNow® for securely storing the passwords that will be used in containers.

## Before you begin

Complete Step 4: [Create the Docker image and containers for Headless Browser setup in Microsoft Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/headless-browser-create-docker-image-containers-windows.md)

Role required: Go to your ServiceNow instance and create a new user to be used by the Docker container to log in. Give this user the roles of **admin** or **atf\_test\_admin**. Save the password to be used in Step 2 of the following procedure.

## About this task

Inside the Docker container is an automation script that opens a web browser, logs into the instance, and opens the Client Test Runner page. In order to log into the ServiceNow instance, you will need a user password. In this step you use a Docker feature called Docker Secrets so you can securely store passwords. Then when you run containers, the password is automatically available to log in to your instance.

## Procedure

1.  In the admin command line, enter `docker swarm init`

2.  In the admin command line, enter `echo <your user's password> | docker secret create sn_password -`

    **Note:** Replace `<your user's password>` with the user's ServiceNow password.

    Your results should look like this:

    \[Omitted image "echo-password.png"\] Alt text: Results of entering echo "my password" code


## Result

The result is your secret ID, which you must save for later use. The secret ID will be added to the ServiceNow instance in the sys\_property `sn_atf.headless.secret_id`.
