# Test suite results examples

Examples of relationship terms and how aggregated results roll up for test suites.

## Example: Base test suite result

The base test suite is the top-level test suite in the hierarchy. For example, if you are viewing the test suite results record for \(A\) Test Suite 1.3.1, the **base test suite result** field links to the test suite results record for \(B\) Test Suite 1.

## Example: Parent test suite results

The parent test suite is the test suite immediately above the one you are currently viewing. For example, ff you are viewing the test suite results record for \(A\) Test Suite 1.3.1, the **parent** field links to the test suite results record for \(B\) Test Suite 1.3.

## Rolled up counts for test suites results

You can view rolled up counts for a test suite for four metrics: test successes, failures, errors, and skips. Each of these sum data from all tests in the test suite plus all tests in the test suite's descendents.

For example, if you are viewing the test suite results record for \(A\) Test Suite 1.3.1, the **Rolled up test success count** field shows the total number of successes counting results from all the tests represented by boxes labeled A.

If you are viewing the test suite results record for \(B\) Test Suite 1.3.1, the **Rolled up test success count** field shows the total number of successes counting results from all the tests represented by boxes labeled B.

## Child Test Suites Results

If you are viewing the test suite results record for \(A\) Test Suite 1, the **Child Test Suites Results** related list shows result records for Test Suite 1.3 \(B\).

## All Test Suites Results

If you are viewing the test suite results record for \(A\) Test Suite 1, the **All Suites Results** related list shows result records for all Test Suites represented by boxes labeled A

If you are viewing the test suite results record for \(B\) Test Suite 1.3, the **All Suites Results** related list shows result records for all Test Suite 1.3.1 only \(represented by the box labeled B\)
