# Server category

Perform server-side operations. For example, query and update a record, impersonate a user, or run a server-side script.

## Create a User

Create a user with specified roles and groups for the test. The user record gets rolled back after the test completes.

|user|The user ID of the user impersonated.|

## Impersonate

Impersonate the specified user for the test.

**Impersonate** specifies a user for executing subsequent steps in this test. It works for both server-side and browser-side steps and stays in effect until changed with another **Impersonate** step or until the test ends. The impersonation automatically ends when the test is over.

**Note:**

-   Do not impersonate a user with the test author role. Doing so can lead to conflicts that interfere with executing the test.
-   Tests which involve impersonated users which no longer exist fail.

    **Tip:** It is recommended to create a new user to avoid data dependencies. See [Create a User](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/test-steps-server-category.md), for more information.

-   Do not rely on user IDs being consistent across different instances. The system dynamically assigns users IDs, so the ID for a particular user often differs from one instance to the next.
-   When exporting and importing automated tests, keep in mind that update sets do not update the user field.
-   Tests can impersonate users with the snc\_external role, which allows testing users who do not have login access. See [Explicit Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/explicit-roles.md) for requirements of the snc\_external role.

</table>## Record Validation

Validates that a record meets the specified conditions on the server side.

For the **Record Validation** step, specify the values you want to test using the standard conditions builder. You can apply several conditions to the same field.

This step passes if the overall condition is satisfied and fails if it is not. If you need to test the values of individual fields independently of each other, include a separate **Record Validation** step for each value to be tested.

    return true; // pass the step
    } else { 
    stepResult.setOutputMessage("Failed to insert task record");
    return false; // fail the step
    }
    ```

-   Jasmine test

    ```
    describe('my suite of script tests', function() {
    it('should meet expectations', function() {
    expect(true).not.toBe(false);
    });
    });
    //  make sure to uncomment jasmine.getEnv().execute(); outside the function body
    assertEqual: A function used to compare that assertion.shouldbe == assertion.value;
    in case of failure it throws an Error and logs that the assertion by name has failed
    ```

    **Note:** `describe` is only supported in Global scope. Use `describe` to create a suite of test scripts and `it` to define test expectations.

-   Logs message to test step output

    ```
    var testAssertion = {
    name: "my test assertion",
    shouldbe: "expected value"
    value: "actual value",
    };
    assertEqual(testAssertion); // throws Error, logs message to test step output
