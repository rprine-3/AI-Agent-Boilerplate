# Service Catalog in Service Portal category

Validate catalog item transactions and requester flows from Service Portal.

## Activation of the Automated Test Framework for Service Catalog in Service Portal

These ATF test steps require activation of the Automated Test Framework Service Catalog Service Portal \(com.glide.automated\_testing\_impl.service\_catalog\_portal\) plugin, which is active by default on new instances. Administrators may need to activate the plugin on instances upgraded from earlier versions.

## Support for parametrized tests

Service Catalog in Service Portal step configurations support parametrized tests. For more information on parametrized tests, refer to [Parameterized tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/parameterized-tests.md).

## Open a Record Producer \(SP\)
