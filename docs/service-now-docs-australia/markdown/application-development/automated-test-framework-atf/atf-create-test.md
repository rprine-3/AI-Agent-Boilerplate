# Create a new automated test

Create a named automated test containing a series of steps to execute.

## Before you begin

Role required: atf\_test\_admin or atf\_test\_designer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Automated Test Framework** &gt; **Tests**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the Test new record form, enter a **Name** for your test.

    The system identifies this test by this name wherever it displays a list of tests \(for example, in the Tests module\).

4.  Enable parameterized testing to run a test multiple times with different test data for each run.

    For more information, see [Parameterized tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/parameterized-tests.md).

5.  Enter a **Description** for your test.

6.  Click **Save**.

    The system creates a new test record and returns to the list of tests.


## What to do next

[Add steps to an automated test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-create-step.md).

-   **[Add a predefined list of steps \(template\) to an automated test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-use-template.md)**  
With test templates you can add a predefined list of steps to a test. Any list of steps that follows a set pattern makes a good candidate for a template.
-   **[Add steps to an automated test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-create-step.md)**  
Create a series of steps for an automated test to run in a specified order.
-   **[Change automated test step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-edit-test-step.md)**  
If necessary, edit a test step after you create it.
-   **[Edit automated test step order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-edit-step-order.md)**  
By default, steps execute in the order in which you created them. You can change this order by editing the **Execution Order** field.
