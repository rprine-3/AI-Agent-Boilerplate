# Allow client errors from step results

Allow client errors as you review step results.

## Before you begin

Role required: atf\_test\_admin, atf\_test\_designer, or admin

## About this task

You can allow multiple or individual client errors. For each client error, you must decide how to report future instances of the client error. Report level options include:

-   Warning: Test steps containing the allowed client error report a status of `Success with warning(s)`. The error message appears in the test result output, and is recorded in the test logs with the status `Warning`.
-   Ignored: Test steps containing the allowed client error report a status of `Success`. The error is recorded in the test logs with an `Ignored` status.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Automated Test Framework** &gt; **Test Results**.

2.  Select the test result for a specific test.

    The system displays the Test Result record.

3.  Select the client errors to be allowed.
