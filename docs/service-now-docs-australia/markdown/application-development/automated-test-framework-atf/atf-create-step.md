# Add steps to an automated test

Create a series of steps for an automated test to run in a specified order.

## Before you begin

You must create a test before you can add steps to the test.

Role required: atf\_test\_admin or atf\_test\_designer

## About this task

This procedure lets you add one step at a time. You can also add a batch of steps at once. For more information, see [Add a predefined list of steps \(template\) to an automated test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-use-template.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Automated Test Framework** &gt; **Tests**.

2.  Click the test that should contain the new test steps.

3.  In the Test Steps related list at the bottom of the Test form, click **Add Test Step**.

4.  From the left panel of the Add Test Step form, select the test step category, or select **All Steps** to view all available test steps for all test categories.

    For example, if selecting a specific test step category, select **Form** for form-related test steps, **Application Navigator** to test application menu or module visibility, or **Server** for tests executed on the server.

    **Note:** When selecting certain types of server tests, you can specify whether a positive or negative test result constitutes a successful test outcome. For more information, see Assert type in [Exploring Automated Test Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/automated-test-framework.md).

5.  Click the type of test step you want to select.

    For example, if you select the **Form** category, select **Set Field Values** to set the field values on a form.

    Start any sequence of steps that work with forms with the **Open a new form** or **Open an existing form** step. Close with the **Submit form** step.

6.  If applicable, from the **Insert after** drop-down list, select the step that you want to precede this step.

    If this is the first step in a test, the **Insert after** drop-down list does not appear.

7.  Click **Next**.

8.  From the **Table** list on the Add Test Step form, select the table that you want to test in this step.

9.  In the **Execution Order** field, enter an integer representing the order in which you want the test to execute this step.

    For more information on **Execution Order**, see [Edit automated test step order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-edit-step-order.md).

10. Fill in the fields that apply to this step.

    For instructions, see [Automated Test Framework \(ATF\) test step categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/test-step-categories.md).

    Some steps return output values that you can pass to the inputs for a subsequent step. For more information, see [Pass values from one automated test step to another](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-retrieve-value.md).

11. Click **Submit**.

    The system creates the step and displays the test record.

12. Repeat Steps 3 through 11 to add additional steps for this test.
