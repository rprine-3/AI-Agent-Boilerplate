# Override component data type

Use the `sn-atf-data-type` and `sn-atf-data-type-params` attributes to override the type of field displayed in a Set Component Value test step.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Settable components have a data type that determines what values a Custom UI test step can set. For example, a page component intended to display a reference to a particular record can have a reference data type to only display Sys ID values.

## Procedure

1.  Open the custom UI page you would like to test.

2.  Add the `sn-atf-data-type` attribute to the settable component and set the value to the field type you would like displayed in the Set Component Value test step.

    This attribute contains a string of the testable data type. The available values include those listed in the following table.

    |Attribute value|Description|
    |---------------|-----------|
    |glide\_date|Contains a string specifying a particular day.|
    |glide\_date\_time|Contains a string specifying a particular day and time of day.|
    |reference|Contains a Sys ID to a related record. This data type requires specifying additional information in the `sn-atf-data-type-params` attribute.|

3.  Add the `sn-atf-data-type-params` attribute to provide additional information when the value of `sn-atf-data-type` is `reference`.

    This attribute contains a string of JSON formatted key-value pairs. Available key-value pairs include those listed in the following table.

    |Key|Value|
    |---|-----|
    |reference|Name of the table that contains the records you want the reference field to display. For example, add `"reference":"incident"` to display records from the Incident table.|
    |reference\_qual|Filter to apply to the query. For example, add `"reference_qual":"active=true"` to display only active Incident records. See [Reference qualifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ReferenceQualifiers.md)|


## Example

```
<input id="someTextField" value="someSysId" sn-atf-data-type="reference" sn-atf-data-type-params='{"reference":"incident","reference_qual":"active=true"}'/>
```
