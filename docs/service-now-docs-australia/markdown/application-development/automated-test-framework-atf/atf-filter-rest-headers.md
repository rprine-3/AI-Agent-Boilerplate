# Filter REST request and response headers

You can add a list of REST request and response headers that are not to be saved in step-result records. You can filter headers that might contain authentication credentials or other sensitive information. The phrase "Header redacted for security" is saved instead.

To specify headers to be filtered, create a system property `glide.atf.rest.log.header_blacklist` with a comma-separated list of header names to be filtered. For information on adding properties, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).
