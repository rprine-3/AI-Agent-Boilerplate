# Copy automated test

Copy an existing test, which you can then re-name and modify.

## Before you begin

Role required: atf\_test\_admin or atf\_test\_designer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Automated Test Framework** &gt; **Tests**.

2.  Click the row containing the test you want to copy top open it.

3.  Near the top-right of the Test record form, click **Copy Test**.

    An annotation displays confirming that the system has copied the test. After you dismiss this annotation, the system displays a new test record identical to the copied record, with the exception of the **Name**.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter the name you want to assign to this new test.

5.  Edit the test steps as desired and proceed as you would for any new test.

6.  When you are finished making changes, click **Update**.

    **Note:** Scope management in ATF tests helps identify and restrict copying of tests in other scopes. If you want to copy a test, you must be in the same scope as the test. See [Application Scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationScope.md) for more information.
