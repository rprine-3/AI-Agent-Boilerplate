# Test logs record

The Test Results Item \(test log\) record contains console logging and test execution information.

During test execution, any information reported to the environment is recorded in the Test Log \(sys\_atf\_test\_result\_item\) table. This information can include browser console logging, results, and error messages recorded by step environments. You access specific test logs from the Test Log related list in the Test Results form.

 **Note:** If a Client Error, you can optionally add it as an ignored or warning entry in the Allowed Client Errors. Doing so prevents the allowed client errors from affecting ATF test executions when they recur in future test runs. For more details, refer to [Allowed client errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/whitelisted-client-errors.md).
