# Edit automated test step order

By default, steps execute in the order in which you created them. You can change this order by editing the **Execution Order** field.

## Before you begin

Role required: atf\_test\_admin or atf\_test\_designer

## About this task

By default, the system assigns the value 1 to **Execution Order** for the first step created for a test. When you add a step, the system assigns it the next-highest available integer value. In other words, if the highest **Execution Order** for any step in the test has the value 7, the system assigns 8 to the new step. By editing these values, you can change the order in which the test executes the steps.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Automated Test Framework** &gt; **Tests**.

2.  Click the row containing the test you want to edit.

    The system displays the **Test**form.

3.  In the **Test Steps** related list, edit the values in the **Execution order** column to determine the new order for the steps.

4.  Click **Update**.
