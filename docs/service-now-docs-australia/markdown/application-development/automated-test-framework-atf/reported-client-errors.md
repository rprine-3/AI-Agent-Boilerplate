**Note:** You can optionally add client errors as an ignored or warning entry in the Allowed Client Errors. Doing so prevents the allowed client errors from affecting ATF test executions when they recur in future test runs. For more details, see [Allowed client errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/whitelisted-client-errors.md).
