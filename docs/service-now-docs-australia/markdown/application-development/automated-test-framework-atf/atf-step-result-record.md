Summary

</td><td>

Summarized version of the Output field.If an error occurred in the test step, the following text indicates that a client error occurred at this step, and includes a detailed exception/error message.

 `This step failed because the client error 'DETAILED ERROR MESSAGE' was detected on the page being tested. See failing Test Logs. To ignore these errors in the next test run, use ‘Add all client errors to warning/ignored list’ links.`

 Test designers and developers should always investigate client errors to determine if there are issues with your business process. For more details, see [Identify and resolve client errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/identify-and-resolve-client-errors.md).

 For a Send REST Request - Inbound step, the URL for the request endpoint, and a response code. For example:

 `The HTTP request has been sent to the endpoint 'https://demonightlyus.service-now.com/api/now/table/kb_knowledge'`

</td></tr><tr><td>

Output

</td><td>

Generated output for the test step.-   For a step result, the outputs from the step, including any explanation why a step failed or was skipped.
-   For a Send REST Request - Inbound step, the REST request and response including the response body. The output field is truncated at 4096 characters.
    -   The REST request and response headers are filtered to prevent sensitive information from being added to the log. A filtered header text is replaced with the text "Header redacted for security."
    -   See [Filter REST request and response headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/automated-test-framework-atf/atf-filter-rest-headers.md) for information on how to add a list of REST request and response headers to be filtered.

 For additional console logging and test execution information for a test step, see the Test Logs record.
