# REST category

Verify the functionality of REST calls.

## Send REST Request - Inbound - REST API Explorer

This test step begins with the REST API Explorer. Use the REST API Explorer to create and specify the HTTP method, path, query parameters, request headers, and body of a REST request, and then send the REST request to the current instance.

When you have tested the request, the **Create Automated Test Step** button appears. Click **Create Automated Test Step** to create the test step. This button does not appear until after the request has been sent. You cannot create a test step when the request payload is larger than the maximum request payload size property.

This test step creates the same test record as the **Send REST Request - Inbound** test step. After the test step is created, you cannot go back and use the REST API Explorer to update the test. All changes must be made on the **Send REST Request - Inbound** test step form.

No HTTP response validation is performed as part of this step. The step fails if the response payload size is too big, the request parameters are invalid, or the request could not be sent. Use the assert steps to validate the response.

You cannot use this step to send a request to another instance or third party/remote address.

These inputs are for the REST API Explorer. The fields you see depend upon the API selected. For more information on using REST APIs on your instance, see [REST APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/c_RESTAPI.md).

</table>## Send REST Request - Inbound

Create a test step to send a REST request to the current instance. Specify the HTTP method, path, query parameters, request headers, and body of a REST request.

No HTTP response validation is performed as part of this step. The step fails if the response payload size is too big, the request parameters are invalid, or the request could not be sent. Use the assert steps to validate the response.

You cannot use this step to send a request to another instance or third party/remote address.
