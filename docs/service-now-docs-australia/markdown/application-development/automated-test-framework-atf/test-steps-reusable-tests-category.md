# Reusable Tests category

Create reusable test components that can be incorporated into various other tests \(regular or reusable test\), minimizing redundant test code and enhancing test maintainability.

The Reusable Tests test step category contains all the reusable tests created on the instance by default. When you add a test step, select **Add Test Step**. You can now invoke the reusable tests you have created through the Reusable Tests test step category.

**Note:** By default, the reusable tests show up in this category. If you have customized a reusable test for another category, it shows up under the selected test step category.
