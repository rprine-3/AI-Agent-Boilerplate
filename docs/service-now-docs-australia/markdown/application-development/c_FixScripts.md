# Fix scripts

A fix script is server-side JavaScript code that you run after an application is installed or upgraded.

Include fix scripts to make changes that are necessary for the data integrity or product stability of an application.

Administrators can create, manage, and run fix scripts. Users with the script\_fix\_admin role can create and manage fix scripts but cannot run fix scripts.

**Note:** An annotation with the following message shows up when you open an existing fix script or create a new fix script.\[Omitted image "uc-fixscript-annotation.png"\] Alt text: Image showing the annotation "Any customizations you make to the fix script will apply only when you manually run the script. Instance upgrades use the out of box fix script"
