# Developer and deployment permissions

Using Manage Developers, administrators can assign one or more developer and deployment permissions to a group or user for a specific application. These permissions designate the specific actions the assigned user can perform for the application.

For example, you might grant permissions that enable a user to upgrade the application, publish to the application repository and ServiceNow Store, but prevent publishing to an update set.

## Developer permissions

**Note:** If the App Collaboration Component is installed, the link appears as **Manage Collaborators**.

</table>## Deployment permissions

The update set deployment permissions are hidden by default and require a system administrator to enable them with system properties. See [Display or hide update set deployment permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-and-deployment/display-or-hide-deployment-permissions.md) for more information.

The Submit for Deployment, Manage Collaborators, and Invite Collaborators delegated development permission sets are only available with the Developer Collaborator feature. They will not be shown in Manage Developers.
