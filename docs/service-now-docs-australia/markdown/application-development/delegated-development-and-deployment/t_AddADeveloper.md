# Delegate development and deployment permissions to personnel

A system administrator can assign a non-administrator user or group as a developer or deployment resource for a specific application. You can set permissions that designate what specific actions the assigned user can perform in the current instance, or make the user a Delegated Admin to grant access to all permissions at once.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin or application administrator

    If [Application administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/application-administration.md) is enabled, only an application administrator of the target application can delegate developers to an application. If application administration is not enabled, an admin user can delegate developers.

-   Records required:
    -   Application
    -   User
    -   Group

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **My Company Applications**.

2.  Select the name of the application to which you want to add developers.

    The system opens the application record.

3.  Select **Manage Developers**.

    **Note:** If the App Collaboration Component is installed, the link appears as **Manage Collaborators**.

    The system displays the Developer Permissions window.

    **Note:** Developer permissions are available only for scoped apps, not global apps.

4.  Select the type of developer \(or user without system admin roles\) you want to assign.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Developers**|To add individual users as developers or deployers.|
    |**Groups**|To add all members of a group as developers or deployers.|

5.  In **Developer Name** or **Group Name**, enter the name of the user or group you want to grant developer or deployment permissions.

6.  Select specific developer and deployment permissions for the application, or select **Delegated Admin** to quickly grant access to all permissions for the application.

    For details, see [Developer and deployment permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/delegated-development-and-deployment/developer-permissions.md).

7.  Select **Save**.

    The system assigns the designated developer and deployment permissions for the application.
