# Agentic app creation with ServiceNow Otto for Creator

ServiceNow Otto for Creator provides core skills for rapid conversational app development. Use the integrated tools to generate scripts, optimize code, scaffold applications, and automate testing through natural language prompts.

**Note:** While ServiceNow Otto for Creator is not a vibe coding product suite, you can use its AI capabilities to quickly enhance app development.

ServiceNow Otto for Creator is the ServiceNow collection of generative AI skills for building apps on the ServiceNow AI Platform. Use it to generate apps, flows, code, tests, UIs, analytics, catalog items, RPA bots, and more from natural language prompts directly in offerings like ServiceNow Studio.

Some skills in ServiceNow Otto for Creator have a conversational interface and can be used for vibe coding and agentic development. For example, the catalog item generation skill in Catalog Builder. For more information, see [AI Authoring for Catalog Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/now-assist-for-catalog-generation.md).

## Core capabilities

For complete information on using ServiceNow Otto for Creator, see [ServiceNow Otto for Creator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/now-assist-for-creator/now-assist-for-creator-landing.md).

The following metadata-driven tools are available for using AI to develop apps:

-   Conversational development: Use Build Agent, which is part of ServiceNow Otto for Creator, to create apps and metadata through a conversational interface.
-   Application generation and scaffolding: Create tables, experiences, roles, and initial data model from a prompt.
-   Flow generation, recommendations, and summarization: Generate multi-step flows, get next step suggestions, and auto-summarize what a flow does.
-   Code generation: Prompt-based server-side and client-side scripts with AI suggestions for script includes, business rules, and GlideRecord queries.
-   Catalog item generation: Produce Service Catalog items from text directions.
-   UI generation: Build experiences by describing the desired interface.
-   Data visualization generation \(Platform Analytics\): Conversational chart and indicator creation.
-   Playbook generation: Outline automated processes from natural language.
-   RPA bot generation: Create desktop automations from text prompts inside RPA Desktop Design Studio.
-   App, table, and flow summaries: Generate explainers and summaries to support onboarding and application understanding.

## Where to start

1.  Welcome guide and skills and prompting: See the Community Welcome Guide and Skill Prompt Guides for Creator. For more information, see the following resources:

## ServiceNow Otto for Creator and agentic development on the ServiceNow AI Platform

ServiceNow Otto for Creator is the ServiceNow AI Platform toolkit for using AI to generate and refine apps. Instead of switching between generic IDEs and separate agents, ServiceNow Otto for Creator provides embedded skills aligned to platform constructs \(such as tables, ACLs, flows, and catalog items\). You can describe a solution through conversation, then inspect and test it with platform tools \(such as ATF, ACLs, and the Metadata Explorer\).

## General ServiceNow Otto for Creator workflow

1.  Enable the skills: Configure the triggers, settings, and display locations for ServiceNow Otto for Creator skills to enable generative AI capabilities across the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [Activate an AI skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-a-now-assist-skill.md).
2.  Describe the app: For example, you can request to “Create a cross-training app with instructor signup, session scheduling, approvals.” Then the application generation scaffolds tables, roles, and experiences.
3.  Add process logic: Use flow generation for approvals and escalations and Flow recommendations to suggest next steps.
4.  Add custom code logic: Prompt code generation for business rule and script include logic \(such as GlideRecord queries\), and then review and refactor as needed.
5.  Expose services: Catalog item generation creates request items for sessions/resources.
6.  Automate outside the platform: RPA bot generation to fetch instructors’ availability from a desktop calendar or copy rosters.
7.  Explain and test: Use app, flow, and table summarization to document; generate tests with the test-generation skill; run ATF.
