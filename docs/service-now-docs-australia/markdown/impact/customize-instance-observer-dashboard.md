    Three widget types are supported:

    -   Time Series: Data for the selected time period displayed in line charts
    -   KPIs: Key Performance Indicators for all important metrics with your choice of aggregation

6.  Add additional widgets to the custom dashboard.

7.  Select the gear icon on a widget to Edit or Delete a widget.

    A delete confirmation will display before removing the widget.

8.  Exit the Edit Dashboard mode to view the dashboard.

    Users can perform additional actions for dashboards:

    -   Select the time period and refresh frequency for the dashboards.
    -   Share a public dashboard’s link with other users in their organization.
    -   Zoom the dashboard on their monitor where in the dashboard will be refreshed automatically in the background
    -   From the gear icon on the dashboard users can perform the following actions:
        -   Settings: Change name, description, instances, share settings, and set the dashboard as default if needed.
        -   Clone: Clone a custom dashboard to use as a baseline for a new dashboard.
        -   Delete: Delete a dashboard, if required. Deleted dashboards will move under the Manage dashboard section and will be available for restoration for 7 days. When a customized dashboard that was set as default is deleted, the dashboard offered by the base system will automatically be your default dashboard.
        -   Manage Dashboard: Lists all dashboards created by the logged in user, shared with the user, and deleted dashboards.
