# Create custom Scan Engine definitions

The Scan Engine contains preexisting base system definitions and you can create your own.

## Before you begin

**Note:** The Impact Guided package allows up to 10 active custom definitions in a single instance. Definitions in excess will be disabled when a scan is executed. The Impact Total package or the Platform Health add-on with the Guided package may have unlimited active custom definitions in a single instance. See [Impact packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/impact-packages1.md) for details.

Role required: Scan Engine Admin \(`sn_se.scan_engine_admin`\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **ALL** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Platform Health** &gt; **Definitions**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Fill in the following fields as needed.

<table id="choicetable_p4w_2cx_2hc"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d47080e125">

Field/Selection

</th><th align="left" id="d47080e128">

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d47080e134">

**Number**

</td><td>

The unique identifier of the definition. This number is generated automatically.**Note:** Your unique company code will be prefixed to the definition number. You can find your company code by navigating to the `sys_properties` table, then searching for `glide.appcreator.company.code` property.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d47080e151">

**Active**

</td><td>

Select to have the Scan Engine evaluate records to see if there are any findings during a scan.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d47080e163">

**Level of Finding**

</td><td>

Select the severity level of the finding for the definition that displays when real-time monitoring is active: -   **Act**: Prevents users from modifying the record until the definition’s conditions are met.
-   **Recommend**: Prevents users from modifying the record unless they provide an exception reason for why the definition was not followed or until the definition's conditions are met.
-   **Suggest**: Prompts users to check if there is a better solution available.
-   **Review**: Calls out less serious items for review. This does not contribute to technical debt.
See [Understand scan results and findings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/understand-scan-engine-results-findings.md) for additional information.
