# Configure exception reason properties

When real-time enforcement, `enforce_real_time_validation` is set to `true`, Recommend level findings require an approved exception reason before the form can be saved.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_se.scan\_engine\_admin, sn\_se.scan\_engine\_read\_user, sn\_se.internal\_rest\_integration

## Procedure

1.  Select whether to **Enforce rejected exception reason validations**.

    When enabled, and if an exception reason is rejected, the object linked to that reason becomes read-only. Users cannot make additional changes until either:

    -   The Recommend level message is resolved.
    -   A new exception reason is submitted.
    This ensures strict compliance with validation rules and prevents inconsistent or unauthorized updates while an exception is unresolved.

2.  Select whether to **Enable approvals in production**.

    If `enable_exception_reason_approvals_in_production` is set to `false`, exceptions can only be approved in the instances in which they are raised.

    **Note:** This setting is only applicable to development instances.

3.  Approval groups will approve or reject exception requests and receive notifications.

    -   Use the`Enable approvals in production` setting to control whether exceptions can be approved in production instances or only in development environments.
    -   Approval group\(s\) displays the group or groups that will approve or reject exception reasons and also receive notifications when new approvals are requested.
4.  Select whether to **Exclude approved exception reasons from technical debt**.

    When enabled, findings with approved exception reasons will be excluded from technical debt metrics.

    **Note:** This does not remove the finding from the system.

5.  **Upon new finding found**, `er_finding_number_validation` , determines how exception reasons are handled when the same issue is detected again in a subsequent scan.

    Options are: **Auto Accept Existing Reason** and **Re-approve Existing Reason**.

6.  **Upon line number change**, `exception_reason_validation`

    -   ``Determines how approved exception reasons are handled when the finding's line number changes in the code.
    -   Options are **Auto Accept Existing Reason** \(default\) and **Re-approve Existing Reason**.
    Choose whether to automatically accept the existing reason.

    **Note:** When you deactivate Scan Engine definitions, the system handles base system and custom definitions differently to ensure accurate entitlement tracking and prevent quota overages.

<table id="table_deactivation_behavior"><thead><tr><th>

Scenario

</th><th>

Behavior

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Direct deactivation of base system definition

</td><td>

-   The definition is deactivated via UI or API without creating an override record.
-   No override is recorded in the system.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Quota impact check after deactivation

</td><td>

-   Deactivated base system definitions are excluded from active definition counts.
-   They do not count toward custom definition quotas.
-   System recalculates entitlements accurately when definitions change status.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Override-then-deactivate existing workflow

</td><td>

-   When a base system definition is overridden and then deactivated, the behavior remains unchanged.
-   The deactivated override does not count as a custom definition.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Entitlement hashing integrity

</td><td>

-   All combinations of base system and overridden definitions in active or inactive states produce consistent entitlement hash results.
-   No regressions occur for states that existed before this feature was introduced.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    **Note:** Deactivating a definition does not remove it from the system. It only changes the active status. If you need to completely remove a definition, contact your system administrator.
