# Use Guided Setup to onboard users to the Impact Store Application

Onboard new and existing users to the Impact Store Application.

## Before you begin

**Note:** You may return to the various steps in the configuration if you don't complete the entire setup at once. As you complete each step successfully, mark the step as complete. Subsequent tasks are locked until the previous step is completed.

Role required: impact app admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Guided Setup** &gt; **User management**.

2.  Select **Start**.

    The Assign users to group assignment table contains a list of available Impact groups to assign users to. You can also create a new group.

    **Note:** For information on Impact groups and roles, see [Roles installed with Impact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/impact-roles.md).

3.  Select a **\[Group name\]** to open the user assignment page for the selected group.

4.  On the **Group Members** tab, select **Edit...**.

5.  Add users from the Collection list to the Group Members List and select **Save**.

    You are returned to the selected Group page. The added members display as Group Members for the selected group.

6.  Select the back arrow on the header of the Group page to return to the Assign users to group table.

    \[Omitted image "guided-setup-group-selection-arrow.png"\] Alt text: The back arrow to return to the Groups selection list.

7.  Repeat the user assignment steps for each relevant group.

8.  After assigning users to groups, select **Mark as complete** on the Assign users to group task.

    This will complete user setup for the Impact Store App and unlock the next step in Guided Setup. If you select **Close**, you will return to Guided Setup and other steps are locked until the Impact User assignment task is marked as complete.

9.  Select **Next** to continue to Assign Platform Health Users.
