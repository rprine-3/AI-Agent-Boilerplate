# Manage definition properties

You can configure additional capabilities and configuration options for the definition ruleset.

For these options to be editable, at least one instance itself must be defined under My instances. Users can synchronize definition overrides and custom definitions between non-production and production instances. Ensuring a consistent ruleset is being applied throughout the instance stack. See [Define My SN Instance environments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/add-view-scan-engine-related-lists.md) for additional information.

Scan Engine admins can remove the checkbox on the active field, or, change the value of the boolean Active field to false without requiring an override.

<table id="table_deactivation_behavior"><thead><tr><th>

Scenario

</th><th>

Behavior

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Direct deactivation of base system definition

</td><td>

-   The definition is deactivated via UI or API without creating an override record.
-   No override is recorded in the system.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Quota impact check after deactivation

</td><td>

-   Deactivated base system definitions are excluded from active definition counts.
-   They do not count toward custom definition quotas.
-   System recalculates entitlements accurately when definitions change status.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Override-then-deactivate existing workflow

</td><td>

-   When a base system definition is overridden and then deactivated, the behavior remains unchanged.
-   The deactivated override does not count as a custom definition.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Entitlement hashing integrity

</td><td>

-   All combinations of base system and overridden definitions in active or inactive states produce consistent entitlement hash results.
-   No regressions occur for states that existed before this feature was introduced.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:** Deactivating a definition does not remove it from the system. It only changes the active status. If you need to completely remove a definition, contact your system administrator.
