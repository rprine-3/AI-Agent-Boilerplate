# Review IRM artifacts

The Data Collection app contains a pre-build data metric structure for the ServiceNow Performance/Platform Analytics application.

The content pack comes with the following artifact types.

|Artifact type|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|Indicator Source|Captures the basic data sets and commits them to the working memory of the platform to provide the foundation for the calculations. This is also called a data cube.|
|Automated Indicator|Basic calculation definition on the indicator source data set, potentially with additional filter conditions that you apply before making the calculation.|
|Manual Indicator|Metric for which there is no data set within the platform. Requires you to manually add a data point.|
|Formula Indicator|A more comprehensive calculation, such as % and ratio calculations that require multiple automated indicator data points for the calculation.|
|Data Collection Jobs|Schedule on which the automated data collection will run.|
|Widgets|Configuration for the UI visualization of an indicator.|
|Dashboard|Display of a collection of widgets on a pane. This dashboard contains two tabs. One tab contains widgets showing quarterly values, and the other contains widgets showing monthly values.|
