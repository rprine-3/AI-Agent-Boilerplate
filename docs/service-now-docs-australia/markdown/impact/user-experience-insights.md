# User Experience

Explore real-time user monitoring to analyze user experience and performance insights in Instance Observer​ telemetry into node, transaction type, URL, and user level breakdowns for Impact Total customers.

-   Access the [User Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/user-experience-insights.md) to visualize quickly your user base issues based on transaction type and volume, outage or service degradations, and access the specific affected URL​ for Impact Total customers.
-   Search for a specific URL that is causing increases in transaction response time.​
-   Analyze node and transaction type level data for outliers and trending​ transactions.
-   Identify which users are impacted by an outage or service degradation.​
-   Quickly visualize your user base based on transaction volume.​
-   Monitor your applications for performance issues and track the cause of performance issues.

The overview page breaks down user history and transaction count into various widgets and charts into a dashboard view.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

-   Transaction count
-   Transaction response time
-   Unique user count
-   Max response time

</td><td>

Displays the current value, a percentage of decrease or increase in historical trend, and a visual graph of the activity.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Top 100 most active users

</td><td>

-   Hover on a user block to see an encrypted user ID and the number of transaction reports for that time period.
    -   Green blocks represent users without a threshold warning
    -   Red blocks indicate a transaction volume that surpasses the general threshold.
-   Select a user block to view the details of the entry.

 **Note:** The user ID is anonymized. Administrators have the capability to opt-in to the collection of non-anonymized data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Node performance by response time

</td><td>

-   Hover on a tile to see the node name and the response time for that node.
    -   Green blocks represent nodes with average response times.
    -   Red blocks indicate increased response time outside of average parameters for the node.
-   Select a node block to view the details of the entry.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Application performance by response time

</td><td>

Track applications that have performance issues by using the average response time metric.The metrics are:

-   Total transaction processing time
-   Total semaphore wait time
-   Total UI time \(Average response time\)
-   Network latency
-   Content download time

-   **[Manage User Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/manage-user-experience.md)**  
Explore in-depth transactions for a user or a node for a given period.
-   **[Use Platform Performance Analyzer to view server details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/io-app-mon-perf-analy.md)**  
Get visibility into the operational metrics of applications and their performance. You can find out the number of applications per instance, the number of pages within each application, page-level response time, user interaction frequency with each application, and page access frequency by users within each application.
-   **[Track of application response time to monitor performance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/monitor-apps-user-experience-io.md)**  
Track the response time of applications to gauge their performance. You can drill down to the transaction ID of each application to learn the slowest and fastest interactions in each instance.
