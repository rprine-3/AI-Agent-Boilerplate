# Exception reason integration

You can synchronize exception reasons from non-production to Production instances once a record is created or updated.

When a developer creates or updates an exception reason on a non-production instance, the integration automatically propagates that change to the production instance. If production approvals are enabled, the exception reason enters a Requested state and triggers an approval workflow before taking effect.

## Approval workflow

When **Enable approvals in production** is selected in Scan Engine Properties, the following workflow applies:

1.  A developer creates or updates an exception reason on the non-production instance.
2.  The exception reason is synced to production in a `Requested` state.
3.  An approval request is sent to the configured Approval Group\(s\).
4.  Once approved or rejected, the status syncs back to the developer instance.

## Prerequisites

-   Authentication is configured. See [Configure the Basic authentication method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/configure-basic-auth-method.md) or [Configure the OAuth authentication method development instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/configure-oauth-auth-method.md).
-   Role required: `sn_se.scan_engine_admin`.

-   **[Sync exception reasons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/syncing-exception-reasons.md)**  
Configure the Exception reason integration to automatically synchronize exception reasons between your non-production and production instances.
