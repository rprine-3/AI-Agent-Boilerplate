# Configure ServiceNow user story integration

Configure the ServiceNow instance user story integration to create stories in a production instance directly from finding records on a non-production instance.

## Before you begin

-   My SN Instances registration and validation must be complete for each instance in this integration. A source instance \(such as development\) and target instance \(such as production\) must be declared and validated. If those instances aren't created and validated, the stories will not be created in the target instance. See [Register your instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/register-your-instance.md).
-   The User Story Table must exist on both the source and target instances before configuring field mappings.

Role required: Scan Engine Admin \(sn\_se.scan\_engine\_admin\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **ALL** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Scan Engine Properties** and select the **User Story Integration** properties tab.

2.  Set **Integration Type** to `ServiceNow instance`.

3.  Set the **User Story Table**.

    This table must exist on both the source and target instances.

4.  Define field mappings in **User Story Field Mapping**.

    The mapping script executes once on the Source instance and once on the Target instance. Use the available script variables to control behavior in each context. See [ServiceNow integration script leading practices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/configuring-sn-integration-options.md) guidance on writing effective field mapping scripts.

## ServiceNow integration script leading practices

TScript variables and leading practices for writing field mapping scripts in the ServiceNow instance user story integration.

### Script variables

The field mapping script executes twice, once on the Source \(Development\) instance and once on the Destination \(Production\) instance. Use the `isSource` and `isDestination` variables to scope logic appropriately for each context.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|`isSource`|True when executing on the Source \(Development\) instance.|
|`isDestination`|True when executing on the Destination \(Production\) instance.|
|`payload`|User-defined variable for passing data between instances.|
|`grFinding`|GlideRecord of the finding. Available on the Source instance only.|
|`grTask`|GlideRecord of the task being created on the Destination instance.|

### Leading practices

-   **Scope logic by instance context**

    Always wrap Source-side logic in `if (isSource)` and Destination-side logic in `if (isDestination)`. The script runs in both contexts — accessing `grFinding` on the Destination instance will fail because the finding record does not exist there.

-   **Use payload to pass data across instances**

    Populate `payload` on the Source instance with any values you need on the Destination. For example, set `payload.shortDescription = grFinding.short_description` on the Source, then read `payload.shortDescription` on the Destination to set the task field.

-   **Enable ES12 mode for modern JavaScript**

    To use modern JavaScript syntax such as arrow functions, destructuring, or template literals, enable **ECMAScript 2021 \(ES12\) mode** in Scan Engine Properties before writing your mapping script.

-   **Validate field existence before mapping**

    Confirm that all target fields in `grTask` exist on the User Story Table in the production instance. Mapping to a non-existent field fails silently and the value is discarded.
