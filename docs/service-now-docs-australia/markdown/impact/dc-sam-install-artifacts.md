# Review SAM artifacts

The Data Collection app contains a pre-build data metric structure for the ServiceNow Performance/Platform Analytics application.

## Performance/Platform analytics

The content pack comes with the following artifact types. For configuring the process, Group Type is the group classification for the User Administration - Groups.

|Artifact type|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|Indicator Source|Captures the basic data sets and commits them to the working memory of the platform to provide the foundation for the calculations. This is also called a data cube.|
|Automated Indicator|Basic calculation definition on the indicator source data set, potentially with additional filter conditions that you apply before making the calculation.|
|Manual Indicator|Metric for which there is no data set within the platform. Requires you to manually add a data point.|
|Formula Indicator|A more comprehensive calculation, such as % and ratio calculations that require multiple automated indicator data points for the calculation.|
|Data Collection Jobs|Schedule on which the automated data collection will run.|
|Widgets|Configuration for the UI visualization of an indicator.|
|Dashboard|Display of a collection of widgets on a pane. This dashboard contains two tabs. One tab contains widgets showing quarterly values, and the other contains widgets showing monthly values.|

## Artifacts by type

The app contains the following artifacts for each of the above-specified artifact types.

**Note:** The frequencies of all applicable indicators and indicator sources have been changed from quarterly to monthly. If this is not the first time using this content pack, you should run a baseline historical job \(data collection job\) to capture applicable historical data. The historical data will be visualized in a future enhancement of the dashboard.
