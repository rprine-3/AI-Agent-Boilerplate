# Root cause correlation

Root Cause Correlation \(RCC\) finds a root cause by automatically correlating metrics, logs, and event information for supported symptoms on production instances for the last 24 hours.

## RCC symptom categories

The RCC feature is available for self-service alerts and Critical or Warning performance symptom categories:

-   Memory
-   Longest running sessions
-   Slow transactions
-   Cache flush
-   Database locks
-   Database impacts

The table describes the symptom categories and the corresponding alerts that the RCC engine detects.

Description

Corresponding alert

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Database Impact​

</td><td>

Helps you to identify and address extended SQL queries impacting database performance, tied to high execution time, or increased volumes. The query patterns give snapshots of 30-minute and 60-minute durations from the time that the impact is observed on query execution times.​

</td><td>

Database response time

</td></tr><tr><td>

Cache Flush​

</td><td>

Cache flushes and node restarts are detected, as well as high service saturation levels that may have occurred around the time a performance alert was triggered.​

</td><td>

Default semaphore mean

</td></tr><tr><td>

Longest Running Session​

</td><td>

-   Searches for the top long-running sessions in mean time to recover \(MTTR\) logs
-   Identifies the top transaction pattern hash with the highest processing times and then the transaction IDs.​

</td><td>

Default semaphore mean

</td></tr><tr><td>

Slow Transactions ​

</td><td>

-   Identifies the top long-running transactions using the total duration, including ACL time, SQL time, CPU time, processing time, BR time, and script time.
-   Returns the transaction IDs, the pattern hash, and these metrics to help you identify the specific causes of long-running transactions.

​

</td><td>

Default semaphore mean​

</td></tr><tr><td>

Memory​

</td><td>

-   Pinpoints the three nodes most impacted by garbage collection pauses, determined by the aggregate duration of the pauses.
-   Identifies any transactions or worker threads on these nodes that exceed 200 seconds.

**Note:** Users are advised to review these long-running or frequently recurring threads.​

</td></tr><tr><td>

DB locks​

</td><td>

The RCC engine monitors innodb\_row\_lock\_waits and threads\_running to detect anomalous database lock events that occur when a database operation requires exclusive access.​

</table>**Note:** As soon as any of the aforementioned alerts or Critical or Warning performance are identified, the system automatically generates an RCA report after waiting for a maximum of 10 minutes, depending on the conditions.
