# Initiate instance scans

You can scan your ServiceNow instance for findings.

## Before you begin

Role required: Scan Engine Admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Platform Health** &gt; **Scheduled Scan**.

2.  To run a full scan, set `force_full_scan` to **True**.

    By default, `force_full_scan` is set to **False**, meaning it will only run delta scans.

3.  Select **Execute Now**.

4.  To review the scan as it runs or after it is completed, open the **Scan Status** module.
