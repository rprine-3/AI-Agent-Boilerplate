# Proactive Code Check scan suite matrix for the Impact Store Application

Refer to the Proactive Code Check \(PCC\) scan suite matrix for details on the checks performed during a PCC scan.

**Note:** Starting with Impact Zurich version 6.0.8 ServiceNow Store release, Proactive Code Check is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Client Scripts should not be defined against the Global table

</td><td>

A global client script is any client script where the selected Table is Global. Global client scripts have no table restrictions; therefore they will load on every page in the system introducing browser load delay in the process. There is no benefit to loading this kind of scripts on every page.

Unnecessary dot walking to sys\_id from current object

Reference fields already store the Sys ID of the referenced record. Using gr.fieldname.sys\_id is a dot-walk and instructs the platform to perform another query only to return the same value. This is an unnecessary overhead.

Avoid Dynamic JEXL Expressions inside Jelly tag

</td><td>

When writing Jelly code, avoid using dynamic JEXL expressions inside the Jelly tag \(or &lt;g2:evaluate&gt; for phase two\). While the code appears to work, it affects a memory resource \(called PermGen\) in the Java Virtual Machine, which can lead to performance issues and even system outages over time. The exception to using JEXL expressions inside &lt;g:evaluate&gt; tags is with static values, including: $\{AMP\}\\, $\{AND\}, $\{GT\}, $\{LT\}, and $\{SP\} \(and their phase two counterparts: $\[AMP\], $\[AND\], and so on\).

The client-side function console.log could cause errors in certain browser versions. Furthermore, there is a good chance that what's being logged is information you would not want publicly exposed, and that persons with malicious intent could manipulate the script to reflect PII. It is never a good idea to go to production with console logging enabled. Console.log is invalid server side and therefore should not be there either.

Scripts should not use the eval\(\) method

HSD0001554a JDBC Data Srcs with "Use last run datetime" disabled for update sets

HSD0001560 Use 'track by' in ngRepeat loops

</td><td>

Use 'track by' in ngRepeat loops

</td><td>

When using the ngRepeat directive without a 'track by' clause, the DOM elements are destroyed and rebuilt every time the source data is updated. Adding a 'track by' clause with a unique key \(such as a sys\_id\) allows the DOM elements to be reused rather than rebuilt, which significantly improves the performance of pages with large, complex lists.

HSD0001578 Business Rules should not use the SOAP getResponse\(\) method

HSD0002016 Server scripts in widgets should use GlideRecordSecure

</td><td>

Server scripts in widgets should use GlideRecordSecure instead of GlideRecord

</td><td>

The best practice should be that server scripts in widgets should use GlideRecordSecure rather than GlideRecord. This is to ensure that security ACLs are considered in all server interactions. To detect deviation from this, any instantiation of GlideRecord should be marked as a finding.

 Note that $sp.getRecord\(\) currently returns a GlideRecord object. This call should actually return a GlideRecordSecure object to be as secure as possible. While that is a separate enhancement outside of the HealthScan tool, it does pose a challenge in that it will be harder for HealthScan to detect the use of the GlideRecord object returned by $sp.getRecord.

HSD0002144 Leverage c.server.get\(\) for better widget performance

</td><td>

Leverage c.server.get\(\) for better widget performance

</td><td>

On the client script, c.server.get\(\) allows you to pass specific data to the server script. Doing this can have performance improvements over c.server.update\(\), which sends the entire data object.

HSD0002150 Remove unused services from widget client script.

</td><td>

Remove unused services from widget client script.

</td><td>

If injected services are not used in a widget's client controller script, consider removing them. Services which are injected and not used will be instantiated, which may have a performance impact. It is also good practice from a code readability perspective to only inject services that are required.

Performance

</td><td>

HSD0002154 Don't use $rootScope.$on in a widget's client script.

</td><td>

Don't use $rootScope.$on in a widget's client script.

</td><td>

$rootScope.$on should only be used in a service. Using event listeners on $rootScope in a widget's client controller script can cause memory leaks if the listeners are not manually destroyed. Every time a widget is loaded, the controller is initialized, and every listener initialized on the $rootScope will not be destroyed with the controller, unless done so manually.

 Services have no other alternative but to fire events on $rootScope, and the listen for events on $rootScope. This is because services are initialized once across the app and do not have their own scope. It is okay to use $rootScope.$on in a service.

The debugger statement is used to tell the executing JavaScript environment to stop execution and start up a debugger at the current point in the code.

Production code should definitely not contain debugger, as it will cause the browser to stop executing code and open an appropriate debugger.
