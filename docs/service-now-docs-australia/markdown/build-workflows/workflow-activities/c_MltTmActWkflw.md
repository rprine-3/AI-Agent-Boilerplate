# Use multiple timer activities in one workflow

Workflow timer activities store data independently of each other in an activity-specific scratchpad.

Previously, all timer activities in a workflow accessed a single, shared scratchpad, which could lead to conflicts when adding multiple timer activities to one workflow.

Timer scratchpads entries hold these values:

-   workflow.scratchpad.endTime
-   workflow.scratchpad.realStartTime
-   workflow.scratchpad.retroactiveSecsLeft
