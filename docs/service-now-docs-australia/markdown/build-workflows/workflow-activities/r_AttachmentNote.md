# Attachment Note workflow activity

The **Attachment Note** activity adds an attachment to the current record.

**Note:** This activity is only available when the workflow runs on a table that extends Task.

This activity allows the use of irregular HTML tags to reference attachments, specifically the `[code]` tag. Entries in a journal field that use irregular HTML do not work if the **glide.ui.allow\_deep\_html\_validation** property is true. This property is set to false by default.

**Note:** Task activities run as the user whose actions complete the task the workflow was waiting for and advances the workflow.

## Results

**Finished:** the activity added the attachment to the record.
