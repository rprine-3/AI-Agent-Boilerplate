# Create Task workflow activity

The **Create Task** activity generates a record on any of the tables that extend Task \[task\].

**Note:** This activity is only available when the workflow runs on a table that extends Task.

If the **Wait for completion** check box is selected, the workflow context waits for a user action on the task, such as Complete or Incomplete, and then progresses based on the user action.

**Note:** Task activities run as the user whose actions complete the task the workflow was waiting for and advances the workflow.

## Results

You can assign a result value using `activity.result` from within a script field of the activity. By default, the final **State** value of the task record determines the result value for the **Create Task** activity. Possible result values are:

-   Closed complete
-   Closed incomplete
-   Closed skipped
-   Deleted
-   Cancelled

## Input variables

The following variables determine the behavior of the activity.
