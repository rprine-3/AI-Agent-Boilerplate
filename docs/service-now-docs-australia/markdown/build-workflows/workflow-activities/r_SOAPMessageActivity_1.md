# SOAP Message legacy workflow activity

The legacy **SOAP Message** activity uses SOAP messages defined in the System Web Services plugin and can call the messages using a MID Server.

This activity is deprecated in the Australia release and no longer shows up in the Workflow canvas for new workflow development. New workflows should use the [Orchestration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r-orchestration.md) SOAP Activity templates instead.

Existing workflows using it will continue to work as designed. To edit this activity in an existing workflow, you must [re-activate the activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ReactivateDeprecatedActivity.md).

</td><td>

Variables to substitute into the SOAP **Envelope** defined in the SOAP Message Function record. Use this format for the string: ```

If either the name or value contains a comma or equal sign, escape these characters with a backslash.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use MID Server

</td><td>

use\_midserver

</td><td>

Check box for using a MID Server to send the SOAP message. A MID Server might be necessary to reach an endpoint within a firewall or a sub-network that is not visible from the instance. If this check box is selected \(true\), but no MID Server is defined in the **MID Server** field, Workflow automatically attempts to find a MID Server.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server

</td><td>

midserver

</td><td>

Name of the MID Server to use. This field appears when you select the **Use MID Server** check box. The workflow ignores this parameter if the **use\_midserver** parameter is disabled.

</td><td>

The script to execute after the request has been made and a response has been received. You can access the full XML response body from the activity.output object.
