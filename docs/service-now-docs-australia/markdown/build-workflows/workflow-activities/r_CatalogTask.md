# Catalog Task workflow activity

The **Catalog Task** activity creates a service catalog task record.

**Note:** This activity is only available when the workflow runs on a table that extends Task.

A user must complete the catalog task. This activity is available only for workflows running on the Catalog Request Item \[sc\_req\_item\] table.

**Note:** Task activities run as the user whose actions complete the task the workflow was waiting for and advances the workflow.

## Results

You can assign a result value using `activity.result` from within a script field of the activity. The final **State** value of the catalog task record determines the result value for the **Create Task** activity. Possible result values are:

-   Closed complete
-   Closed incomplete
-   Closed skipped
-   Deleted
-   Cancelled

## Input fields

The values you enter in the following fields determine the behavior of the activity.
