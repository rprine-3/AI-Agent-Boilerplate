# Approval Action workflow activity

The **Approval Action** activity performs an approval action on the current task.

Use this activity to mark the current task record as approved or rejected.

**Note:** When an **Approval Action** activity is used to mark a task approved, the activity marks all pending approvals as **No Longer Required**. This activity behaves differently from **Set Values** or **Run Script** when used to set the **Approval** field's value.

## Results

The result value of the activity is the final approval disposition selected by the approver. The result value can be **Approved** or **Rejected**. A workflow designer can assign a result value using the *activity.result* variable from within a script field of the activity.

## Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the activity.
