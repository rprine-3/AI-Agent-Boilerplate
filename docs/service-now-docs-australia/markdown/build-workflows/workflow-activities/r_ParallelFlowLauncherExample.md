# Parallel Flow Launcher example

This example shows how to use the **Parallel Flow Launcher**activity with an array of input values and with a WorkflowCoordinator object.

## Sample workflow

This example shows a SQL-based web server with four application nodes. A single subflow runs to provision the database, and multiple parallel subflows each configure an application node. Finally, a separate set of parallel subflows configures the nodes to use a load balancer and sets up the server DNS.

## Provision the application nodes

The first **Parallel Flow Launcher**activity launches the **Provision Node** subflow four times. The activity passes a unique IP address to each subflow from an array in the **Inputs** variable. The scripts defined in the **Flow complete** and **Finished script** variables write log messages regarding the status of the subflows.

## Add nodes to the load balancer

The second **Parallel Flow Launcher** activity uses WorkflowCoordinator objects to specify which subflows to run. The `coordinator` variable stores the completed flow information from the previous **Provision Nodes** activity. The script then retrieves the IP address and port for each node that was provisioned. The `coord2` WorkflowCoordinator object runs the Add Node to Load Balancer subflow once for each node, using the retrieved IP address and port information as input variables. Finally, the `coord2` WorkflowCoordinator object runs the **SetupDNS** subflow once to configure the load balancer.
