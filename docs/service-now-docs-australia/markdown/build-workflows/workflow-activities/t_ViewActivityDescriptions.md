2.  To modify activity descriptions, navigate to **Workflow** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Activity Definitions** and edit the **Description** field.

    **Note:** To view more information about an activity, double-click the activity on the canvas and then click the help icon in the title bar of the Activity Properties window.


## Elements in workflow activity definitions

Each activity can specify a number of elements that control the behavior of the activity or are controlled by the activity.

Not all activities specify all possible elements. See [Workflow activities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-activities/c_WorkflowActivities.md) for links to the activities provided by default. Each activity description includes a detailed explanation of the specific elements offered by that activity.
