# Workflow activities reference

Workflow activity reference, organized by category.

Each activity performs a different task, such as running a script, sending notifications, or requesting approvals.

Workflow runs activities as the user session that starts or advances them. Workflows started from record operations will run activities as the user session that performed the record operation. Workflows started from schedules or restarted from timers run activities as the System user. Workflows started from script calls run activities as the user session that started the script.

## Approval and rollback activities

Approval and rollback activities generate and manage approvals. Not all workflows can include approval activities. For more information, read [Approval and rollback workflow activities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_ApprovalAndRollbackActivities.md).

**Note:** Approval activities run as the user whose actions match the approve or reject conditions the workflow was waiting for and advances the workflow.
