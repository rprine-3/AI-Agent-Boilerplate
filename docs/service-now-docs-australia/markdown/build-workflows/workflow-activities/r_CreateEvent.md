# Create Event workflow activity

The **Create Event** activity adds an event to the event queue, but does not immediately fire the event.

The event processor typically processes the event within one minute. This activity triggers any business rules or email notifications that would normally be triggered by the event.

For more information about creating and using system events, see [System Events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/system-events/events.md).
