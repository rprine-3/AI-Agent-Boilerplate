# Manage transitions between workflow activities

Transitions define the processing path of the workflow, depending on conditions defined in each activity.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

All conditions in an activity must have a transition and all transitions must have a connection to another activity or to the **End** activity.

**Note:**

Run the [workflow validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/c_WorkflowValidation.md) tool prior to publishing to detect missing or disconnected transitions that could cause a workflow to hang.

## Procedure

1.  Add transitions to the workflow using either of these methods:

    -   Drag and drop an activity directly onto a transition line to connect it to the adjacent activities. The transition line turns blue when the connection is made. The system updates the transitions automatically to reflect the new sequence.

        \[Omitted image "WorkflowAddActivity.png"\] Alt text: Add a transition by dragging and dropping an activity on an existing transition line.

    -   Drag the activity to an open area in the canvas and create the transitions manually. Click the yellow square on the right side of the activity condition and drag a connector to the next task.

        \[Omitted image "CreateTransitionManually.png"\] Alt text: Draw a line from one activity to another to create a transition manually.

2.  You can draw multiple transitions from the same activity condition if the activity executes concurrently.

3.  To remove a transition, click to highlight it, and then press **Delete**.


## Custom activity transitions

Controls on the **Approval - User** activity enable an administrator to add additional workflow transitions to the activity other than the default transitions of **Approved** or **Rejected**.

Transitions defined using this method do not become a permanent feature of the **Approval - User** activity. After a new transition is configured, that transition must be applied manually to subsequent instances of the activity, where desired.
