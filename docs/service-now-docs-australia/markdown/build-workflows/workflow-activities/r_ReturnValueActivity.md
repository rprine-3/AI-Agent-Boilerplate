# Return Value workflow activity

The **Return Value** activity returns a value to a parent workflow, when run from a subflow.

This activity has no variables or conditions. For more information, see [Workflows used as subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/workflows-as-subflows.md).

Use this activity within a subflow to store data that the parent flow can access. The **Return Value** activity adds the data from the subflow's *value* variable to the parent workflow's [scratchpad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/c_UsingVariablesInAWorkflow.md).

## Scratchpad entries

The activity uses the workflow scratchpad to read and write persistent values.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|value|The activity writes the value from the subflow *value* variable to the parent scratchpad. The parent workflow activity that runs the subflow includes a *Map return value to* variable that defines where the parent workflow stores the returned data. This data can be scalar, a stringifiable JavaScript object, or an expression that evaluates to a stringifiable JavaScript object.|
