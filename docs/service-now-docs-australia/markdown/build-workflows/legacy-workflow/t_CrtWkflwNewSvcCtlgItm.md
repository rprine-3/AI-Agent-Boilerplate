# Create a workflow for a new service catalog item

When you create a new service catalog item, you can create a new corresponding workflow at the same time.

## Before you begin

-   You must have the snc\_required\_script\_writer\_permission and either the workflow\_admin or workflow\_creator role to use the Workflow Editor.
-   If you are designing the workflow as part of an update set process, see [Workflow movement with update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/c_WorkflowMovementWithUpdateSets.md) before creating the workflow.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Definitions** &gt; **Maintain Items**.

2.  At the top of the form, next to **Catalog Items**, click **New** \[Omitted image "NewCatalogItemButton.png"\] Alt text:.

    The Catalog Item form opens.

3.  Add a **Name**.

4.  Select the **Process Engine** tab.

5.  Next to the **Workflow** field, click the lookup icon .

6.  Next to Workflow at the top, click **New**.

    \[Omitted image "CreateWorkflowFromServiceCatalog.png"\] Alt text: Create a workflow from a Service Catalog item. The Workflow version dialog opens in the New Workflow View. The **Table** field is set to **Requested Item \(sc\_req\_item\)** and is read-only.

    The new workflow is created with the **Begin** and **End**activities connected by a single transition. \[Omitted image "WorkflowNew.png"\] Alt text: New workflow

11. Finish creating the workflow by adding activities, validating, and publishing so the workflow is available to other users.

    For more information, see [Work on workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/work-on-workflows.md).

12. To change advanced settings for the workflow, click the **Properties** icon.
