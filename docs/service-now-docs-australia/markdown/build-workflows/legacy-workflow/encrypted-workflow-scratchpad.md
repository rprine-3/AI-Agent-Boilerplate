# Encrypted workflow scratchpad

The Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad plugin \(com.snc.encrypted.scratchpad\) provides encrypted scratchpad support for workflow context and workflow executing activities.

The platform supports encryption on most fields, and workflows can execute on tables with encrypted fields. Encrypted data is typically stored in the workflow scratch pad for workflows that execute using encrypted fields and must access this data after processing an approval, timer, or create task activity.

Data in the workflow scratchpad is not encrypted by default. The Workflow engine supports scratchpad encryption and executing activity records only when the Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad plugin is activated. Once activated, data stored in the wf\_context and wf\_executing scratchpads is protected by a private workflow engine encryption module, and is prevented from being stored in plain text.

## Incompatibility with domain separation

The Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad plugin is incompatible with domain separation. Activating the Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad plugin on a domain separated instance can produce encryption errors when running some workflows. Consider using a Workflow Studio flow instead.

## Request encrypted workflow scratchpad activation

Request activation of the Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad plugin \(com.snc.encrypted.scratchpad\) from ServiceNow personnel

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

The Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad plugin must be activated via a Customer Service and Support request. You should activate and thoroughly test the plugin in a non-production instance. Only after you satisfied with the results should you request activation in a production instance.

When requesting activation in a production instance, you should schedule a low transactional volume time to do so. Prior to its activation, first activate the Workflow Pause Utility \(com.glideapp.workflow.pause\), and then pause all active workflows. Refer to [Workflow pause utility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/workflow-pause-utility.md). After activation of the Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad plugin, resume all paused workflows.

### About this task

There are two ways to request a plugin:

-   Access the Now Support Service Catalog directly by selecting **Automation Store** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Activate Plugin** on Now Support.
-   Access the Now Support Service Catalog through the All Applications page on your instance by following these steps.

For additional details about requesting a plugin, see [Requesting a Plugin from the Service Catalog \[KB0751715\] article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0751715)

Encrypted Workflow Scratchpad activates these related plugins if they are not already active.
