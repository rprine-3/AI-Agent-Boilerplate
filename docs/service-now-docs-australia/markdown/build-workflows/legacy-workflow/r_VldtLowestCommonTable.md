# ValidateLowestCommonTable

The **ValidateLowestCommonTable** validator reports the lowest table in the Glide hierarchy that the workflow uses.

For example, the Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\] table is the lowest table in a workflow containing a **Catalog Task** activity. This information is significant to a designer who wants to change the table against which an existing workflow runs after adding activities to the canvas.

**Note:** This validator provides information only. It does not indicate an error or warning condition.
