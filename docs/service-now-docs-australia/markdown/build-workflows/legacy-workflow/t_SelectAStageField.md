# Select a stage field

A **Stage field** allows the workflow context to show additional workflow information, such as the stage name and the estimated completion time for an activity.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the workflow field you want to use as the stage field is configured to properly display stages. For detailed steps, see [Create a workflow stage field](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/t_CreateAWorkflowStageField.md).

## About this task

Unless the workflow uses the Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\] table, you can specify which field from the workflow table is the stage field. For workflows that use the Requested Item \[sc\_req\_item\] table, the stage field is automatically set to the **Stage** field of the table and cannot be changed.

To add or edit a workflow stage field:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workflow &gt; Workflow Editor**.

2.  Create or check out the workflow.

3.  In the title bar, click the menu icon and select **Properties**.

4.  In the Workflow Properties dialog box, click the **General** tab.

5.  In the **Table** list, verify that the table containing the workflow field is selected.

6.  Click the **Stages** tab.

7.  From the **Stage field** list, select the workflow field.

8.  Click **Update**.
