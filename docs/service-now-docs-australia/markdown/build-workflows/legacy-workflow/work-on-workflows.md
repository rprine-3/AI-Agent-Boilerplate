# Work on workflows

To complete a workflow, you add workflow activities, validate the workflow, and publish it.

## Before you begin

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer\_permission and either workflow\_creator or workflow\_admin.

**Parent Topic:**[Workflow management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/managing-workflows.md)

## Add a workflow activity

Activities determine the functionality of the workflow.

### Before you begin

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer\_permission and workflow\_admin, workflow\_creator, or admin

### About this task

When they are created, all workflows contain **Start** and **End** activities.

For more information, see [Workflow activities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-activities/c_WorkflowActivities.md).

### Procedure

1.  Open a workflow.

2.  Check out the workflow.

3.  [Drag a workflow activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-activities/t_AddAnActivityToAWorkflow.md) from the Activities menu into the workflow body.

4.  Populate the Workflow Activity form that appears.


## Validate a workflow

You can manually validate a workflow from the Workflow Editor. You can generate a workflow validation report from the Workflow Version form.

### Before you begin

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer and workflow\_admin, workflow\_creator, workflow\_publisher, or admin

### About this task

Running a workflow on a new node automatically attempts to validate the workflow. If validation is successful, the system updates the workflow version record to indicate the workflow has been validated and marks the record as updated by the user who ran the workflow.

### Procedure

1.  Open the workflow to validate in the Workflow Editor.

    When the workflow is loaded, the workflow validator icon appears in the toolbar.

    \[Omitted image "ItsaHelp.png"\] Alt text: Workflow validator

2.  Click the validator icon to run a series of validation tests on the current workflow version and generate a report.

    \[Omitted image "WorkflowValidationReport.png"\] Alt text: Workflow validation report

3.  Complete the following steps to generate a workflow validation report from the Workflow Version form

    1.  Navigate to **Workflow** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Workflow Versions**, and select a workflow to validate.

    2.  Under **Related Links**, click **Validate Workflow**.


## Publish a workflow

When a workflow is complete, publish the workflow so that it is available to all users.

### Before you begin

Before you publish a workflow, validate it to test it for issues that might cause it to fail, such as missing subflows or disconnected transitions. For more information, see [Workflow validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/c_WorkflowValidation.md).

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer and workflow\_admin, workflow\_creator, workflow\_publisher, or admin

### About this task

To publish a workflow:

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow** &gt; **Workflow Editor**.

2.  Open the workflow that you want to publish.

3.  In the title bar, click the menu icon and select **Publish**.


### Result

If you published a new version of workflow, the changes are not applied to running [workflow contexts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/r_AdministeringWorkflowContexts.md). Any currently running workflow context continues using the workflow version that was available when the workflow started. The next time the workflow runs, it uses the new version.

## Determine whether a workflow can run

A workflow can run only if a checked out version is available to the user who has it checked out, and a valid, published version is available for all users with permission to run it.

### Before you begin

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer and workflow\_admin, workflow\_creator, or admin

### Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `wf_workflow.list`, and then open one of the workflows.

2.  In the **Versions** related list, check for all of the following conditions:

    1.  There is only one workflow version in a state of **Checked out** and **Checked out by**.

    2.  There is only one version and it is not checked out.

        This version must be both **Active** and **Published**. You may need to personalize the list and add the **Active** column.

    3.  If there are multiple versions, only one is **Published**.

    These checks determine the only two conditions under which a workflow can run:

    -   A checked out version of a workflow is available for the user who has it checked out.
    -   A valid, published version of a workflow is available for all users who have permission to run the workflow.
    Main flows containing subflows that do not meet one of these two conditions are not permitted to execute against a current record transaction. Instead, a critical log entry detailing the subflow state is added to the Workflow Context record. To enable the workflow to execute on the next appropriate transaction, remove the subflow from the main flow or modify the published and active states of the subflow.


## Edit a published workflow

You can edit a published workflow after you check it out.

### Before you begin

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer and workflow\_admin, workflow\_creator, workflow\_publisher, or admin

### About this task

**Note:** You cannot check out or delete workflows that are associated with a read-only application file.

To check out a workflow:

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow** &gt; **Workflow Editor**.

2.  Open the workflow that you want to edit.

3.  In the title bar, click the menu icon and select **Checkout**.

    A new [version of the workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/c_WorkflowVersions.md) is created and assigned to you.

    If you are in a different domain than the published workflow, the new workflow version is [created in your domain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/c_WorkflowsAndDomainSeparation.md).


### What to do next

After you finish editing the workflow, validate and publish the workflow to make the new version available to other users.

## Copy a workflow between two application scopes

Application scoping protects applications by identifying and restricting access to application files and data. You can copy a workflow created in one application scope \(for example, Test\) to another \(Production\) as needed.

### Before you begin

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer and admin

### Procedure

1.  On the Home page, click \[Omitted image "System\_Setup.png"\] Alt text: System Settings icon, located next to the logged in user name.

2.  In the **Developer** tab, in the **Application** field, select the application scope \(for example, Test\) in which you want to operate the ServiceNow platform.

3.  Close the System Settings page.

4.  Navigate to **Workflow** &gt; **Workflow Editor**.

5.  Create a workflow in the Workflow Editor.

    For more details, see [Create a workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/legacy-workflow/t_CreateAWorkflow.md).

6.  In the Workflow Editor, click \[Omitted image "WorkflowPropertiesIcon.png"\] Alt text: Information icon.

7.  In the **Application** tab, **Application** is set to the current application scope selected in System Settings.

8.  In **Accessible from**, select **All application scopes** if the workflow is available to all application scopes, or select **This application scope only** if it is only available to, and accessible in the current application scope only.

    Only those workflows that are accessible from all application scopes can be copied to another application scope.

9.  Go back to the Homepage, click \[Omitted image "System\_Setup.png"\] Alt text: System Settings icon.

10. In the **Developer** tab, in the **Application** field, select the application scope \(for example, Production\) to which you want to copy the workflow.

11. Navigate to **Workflow** &gt; **Workflow Editor**.

12. Refresh the page, then open the same workflow you created.

    An **Out of scope workflow, workflow belongs to &lt;scope name&gt; scope** message appears, where &lt;scope name&gt; is the application scope in which the workflow was originally created.

13. In the Workflow Editor, click \[Omitted image "WorkflowActionsicon.png"\] Alt text: Context menu.

14. Select **Copy**.

    The **Workflow Name** dialog appears:

    \[Omitted image "Workflowname.png"\] Alt text: Add a name for the workflow copy in the Workflow Name dialog.

    1.  In **Workflow Name**, type the new name for the copied workflow.

    2.  Click **OK**.

        The system creates a workflow in the current application scope.

15. In the Workflow Editor, click \[Omitted image "WorkflowPropertiesIcon.png"\] Alt text: Information icon.

16. In the **Application** tab, **Application** is set to the current application scope.

17. In **Accessible from**, select **This application scope only** if to make the newly copied workflow a private one that cannot be accessed from outside current scope.

18. Click **Update**.


### Result

A new workflow record is created in the selected application scope and marked as private if designated as one in the Workflow Editor.
