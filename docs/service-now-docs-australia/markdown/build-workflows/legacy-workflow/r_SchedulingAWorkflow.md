# Scheduling a workflow

In addition to being run based on conditions, workflows can also be scheduled to perform at a particular time, similar to a scheduled job.

Scheduled workflows do not have a defined current record and do not run on specific records within a table. Due to this behavior, certain activities that depend on a current record, such as **Create Task** or **Catalog Task** are unavailable on scheduled workflows. If your workflow requires one of these activities, consider using a scheduled job that inserts a record to start the workflow instead of using a scheduled workflow.

To schedule a workflow, navigate to **Workflow** &gt; **Scheduled Workflows** and click **New**. Populate the following fields:

<table id="simpletable_imt_4n1_xp"><thead><tr><th>
