# Create an error condition exit

An administrator can reroute the workflow when a script error occurs by creating an error condition exit for specific activities within the workflow. This allows the workflow to process script errors in a predictable way and not create undesirable results.

## Before you begin

Role required: snc\_required\_script\_writer\_permission and workflow\_admin, workflow\_creator, or admin

## Procedure

1.  Open and check out a workflow.

2.  Right-click in the top portion of the activity for which you want to create an error exit.

3.  Select **Add condition** from the context menu.

4.  Add a condition exit with the following values:

    -   Name: `Error`
    -   Condition: `activity.state=='faulted'`
5.  Click **Submit**.

    The **Error** exit appears on the activity.

6.  Connect the **Error** exit to another activity for handling the error state, such as **Notification** or **Log Message**.
