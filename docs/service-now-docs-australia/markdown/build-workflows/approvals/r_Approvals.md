# Classic approvals

Classic approvals are a legacy process to require authorization on tasks before the work is done. In earlier releases, you could create approval records to define approval tasks and associate users or groups to approve or reject them.

Administrators can define classic approval logic by navigating to **All** &gt; **System Policy** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Approvals**.

**Important:** Classic approval rules have been replaced by the Workflow Studio [Ask for Approval action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/ask-approval-flow-designer.md). Use Workflow Studio to create workflow-driven approval logic that is easier to maintain and provides better reporting information.

Administrators can see all approval requests by navigating to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **My Approvals** and removing the list filter.

An approval record consists of these fields:

<table id="table_dkw_tvt_lt"><thead><tr><th>
