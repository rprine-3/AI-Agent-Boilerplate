# Test an action

Test an action before publishing it for other users.

## Before you begin

-   [Create an action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-action.md) and save it.
-   Role required: flow\_designer, flow\_operator, action\_designer, or admin.

## About this task

A user with the flow\_designer role should always test actions on non-production instances containing relevant demonstration data because testing an action creates or changes records on the instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Designer**.

2.  Click the **Actions** tab and select the action that you want to test.

3.  Click **Test**.

    The system displays the Test Action dialog box.

4.  Fill in the fields for the action.

    **Note:** Complete all mandatory fields in the Test Action dialog box.

5.  Click **Run Test**.

    **Note:** Select the **Run test in background** option to test an action asynchronously in the background.

    If you select the **Run test in background** option, the execution details are displayed only after the execution is completed asynchronously in the background.


## What to do next

Click `Action has been executed. To view the action, click here` to view the action execution details. See [Flow execution details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/flow-execution-details.md) for information about the executions.

**Note:** Users must have the flow\_operator or admin role to view the executions.
