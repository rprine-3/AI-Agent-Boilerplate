# Records.\[Table\] data type

Stores one or more Sys ID references to records in a specific table. The Records data format is also known as a Glide List since it stores a list of GlideRecord Sys ID values.

## Basic options

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Label|Displays the label used to identify the data variable in the Workflow Studio interface. The label can consist of any text.|
|Name|Displays the name used to identify the data variable in script calls. The name can only consist of alphanumeric and underscore characters. The system automatically converts the label into a valid name by removing or replacing any special characters.|
|Type|Indicates the type of data stored by the data variable.|
|Mandatory|Indicates whether the data variable must contain a value when configured in an action.|

## Advanced options

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Hint|Provides guidance to flow or action designers on how to configure the data.|
|Default value|Specifies the value used when a flow or action designer does not provide a value.|

## Script support

The records data type is supported in script by the GlideRecord class, which can produce an array containing one or more sys\_id values. For more information about the GlideRecord class and its available methods, see .

## Output of a Look Up Records action

\[Omitted image "example-look-up-records-action-execution-details.png"\] Alt text: Execution details for a Look Up Records action

The Look Up Records action uses the Records data type to store its results. In this example, the action looked up Configuration Item records assigned to the requester of a change request. Each configuration item record is a reference by its Sys ID. The flow execution details shows the configuration item display value, which in this case is the name.
