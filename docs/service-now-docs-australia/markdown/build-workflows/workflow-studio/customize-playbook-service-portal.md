# Customize a playbook in Service Portal

Use the Service Portal Designer to customize the playbook runtime experience for Service Portal users.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin, or portal admin with either snc\_internal or snc\_external
-   Create a record generator if you don't want to use the default record generator or any of the other existing record generators.

    **Note:** A key difference in Service Portal is that the playbook record generator is used instead of the record producer. The Service Portal requester enters the information for the record generator and uses the Next or Continue declarative action to move to the next activity​.

    To learn more about playbook record generators, see [Playbook record generator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-record-generator-overview.md).
