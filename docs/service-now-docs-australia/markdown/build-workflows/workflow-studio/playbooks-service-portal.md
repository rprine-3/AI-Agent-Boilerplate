# Playbooks in Service Portal

Use playbooks to guide Service Portal users through your business processes.

## Using the widget

The Portal Playbook widget adds playbooks that your Service Portal users can run.

Provide a playbook experience to your Service Portal users for a consumer grade user experience. Requests on portals are surfaced as catalog items, including any playbooks you make available in Service Portal. Embedding a playbook in Service Portal enables:

-   A rich user interface for activities during a business process​
-   Guidance for long business processes
-   Going back and editing any previous steps of a business process
-   Saving long running playbooks for a business process and resuming at a later point
-   Seamless transition for agents and teams to enter a business process
-   Visibility into where you are in a business process
-   Visibility on a specific user's tasks
-   Single admin experience for a whole business process.

Service Portal playbooks are also supported in a mobile interface.
