# Spokes

Add application-specific content to Workflow Studio by installing spokes.

A spoke is a scoped application containing Workflow Studio content dedicated to a particular application or record type. For example, the **ITSM Spoke** contains actions for managing Task records such as the **Create Task** action. Spokes are activated when their parent application is activated. For example, the **ITSM Spoke** is activated when the Incident, Problem, and Change applications are activated. Creating a spoke requires familiarity with application development as developers must add Workflow Studio content to a scoped application.
