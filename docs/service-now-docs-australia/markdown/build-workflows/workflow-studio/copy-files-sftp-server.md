Connection

</td><td>

Type of connection to use to connect to the source SFTP server.-   **Define Connection Inline**: Define connection information within the action step.
-   **Use Connection Alias**: Define connection information using the Connection Alias table. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action.

 To learn more about connections and credentials, see [Introduction to credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md).
