# Generate a playbook summary

Generate an AI-generated summary of the stages, activities, triggers, and inputs of a playbook from the Workflow Studio canvas.

## Before you begin

Verify that the ServiceNow Otto for Creator plugin is installed and the **Playbook Summarization** skill is turned on. For more information about turning on the AI skills for Playbooks, see [Turn on AI skills for Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/turn-on-playbook-generation-skill.md).

**Note:** AI skills are available in **Admin** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **AI Skills** &gt; **Creator**.

For information about installing ServiceNow Otto for Creator, see 

The playbook must have at least one stage and activity before a summary can be generated.

Role required: pd\_author

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Open the playbook for which you want to generate the summary.

3.  From the More Actions menu \[Omitted image "triggers-more-actions.png"\] Alt text:, select **Summarize**.

    The Playbook Summary pane displays.

4.  On the Playbook Summary panel, select **Summarize playbook**.

    \[Omitted image "playbook-summary-otto.png"\] Alt text: Generate a playbook summary from the summarize playbook button.

5.  Select a summary format: **Standard**, **Short**, or **Elaborate**.

    The summary is generated and displayed in the panel. The first paragraph provides a brief overview of the playbook, followed by a description of each stage.


## What to do next

After generating a summary, you can perform the following actions:

-   To refine the summary, enter a custom instruction in the AI chat field.
-   To copy the summary to the playbook description field, select **Set as description**, then select **Save and close**.
-   To regenerate the summary after playbook changes, select **Refresh**. If the playbook structure has changed since the last summary was generated, a warning appears prompting you to refresh.
