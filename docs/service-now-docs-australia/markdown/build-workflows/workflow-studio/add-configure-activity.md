        **Warning:** Changing the advanced property fields of an activity can potentially break your automation. Make sure you understand how the playbook and its activities flow before you make changes.

<table id="choicetable_n4l_ydt_vlb"><tbody><tr><td id="d184786e274">

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Open the **Automation** tab.

    Automation, inputs, and outputs sections appear.

    -   **Automation**

        See or open the action, subflow, or flow that drives the activity.

    -   **Inputs**

        Configure inputs for the action, subflow, or flow that is driving the activity. Not all activities require user input.

    -   **Outputs**

        Outputs of the action, subflow, or flow that is driving the activity.

4.  Under the **Inputs** section, define the values of the activity's inputs.

    Configure inputs with a hardcoded value, or by [dot-walking to a data pill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_DotWalking.md) \(\[Omitted image "data-pill-picker-icon.png"\] Alt text: Data pill picker icon\) to use data from previous activities, the playbook trigger, from the playbook parent table, or from the playbook inputs.

    **Tip:** You can use both text and multiple pills in any other rich text or HTML input fields.

5.  Open the **UI Layout** tab.

    Depending on the UI Layout associated with the activity, different sections and fields appear under the activity definition's Activity Experience. These sections and fields let you set up the activity data that renders during the runtime Playbook Experience.

    **Note:** All UI Layouts, except for Record generator, display an Associated Record section. For information on how to set up or edit the Associated Record section in an activity definition, see [Create an activity definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-activity-definition.md).

6.  Specify if an AI Agent performs the activity, and how.

    To learn more, see [Configuring Agentic Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/configure-agentic-playbooks.md).

7.  Click **Save and close** to save the details of your activity.

    At any point while in the Playbooks builder, you can add more activities to a stage as described in the previous steps.
