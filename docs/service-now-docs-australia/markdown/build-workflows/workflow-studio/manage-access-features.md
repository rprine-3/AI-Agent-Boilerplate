# Manage access to Workflow Studio flow features

Restrict access to individual Workflow Studio flow features by user role. Specify what additional roles a user must have to access an individual feature such as copy a flow.

## Before you begin

Create any custom roles that you want to use for feature access. When you specify which roles are required to access a feature, you can select the roles from a list of existing roles.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Features are elements of the Workflow Studio UI. When feature filtering is turned off, users with the flow\_designer role have access to all of the Workflow Studio features. When feature filtering is turned on, you can specify which roles a user must have to access individual features.

**Note:** Your users must have the flow\_designer role to create and edit flows. You can specify the additional roles that a user must have to access particular features or content.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Administration** &gt; **Feature Access List**.

2.  For each feature on the list, select the edit icon \(\[Omitted image "view-edit-icon.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon.\) next to the feature.

3.  Enter the role or roles that are required to access the feature.

    **Note:** Add the flow\_designer role to each feature on the Feature Access List. Your users must have the flow\_designer role to access the Workflow Studio features.

    You can use these options to restrict access to Workflow Studio action authoring features.

4.  Continue adding roles to each feature on the list.

5.  Select **OK**.

6.  To turn on the feature access for your users, select the **Enable feature access filtering?** option.

    After the feature access is enabled, your users must have the required roles before they can access the features. If a user doesn't have the required roles for a feature, the feature does not work for that user.


## What to do next

Assign your users with the roles to access features.
