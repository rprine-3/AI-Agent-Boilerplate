# Workflow Studio steps

A step performs a single operation in an action. You can use Workflow Studio to add steps to a custom action.

A step is a single reusable operation within an action. For example, the **Create Record** step allows action designers to specify the table and field values to use during record creation. Step configuration requires subject matter expertise with application tables, fields, and business logic. Application developers or IT generalists add steps to actions from the Workflow Studio action design environment. Workflow Studio provides a set of ServiceNow core steps to automate ServiceNow AI Platform processes. You can add application-specific steps by activating the associated spoke.

## Search steps

You can use the **Search steps** filter to find a step by name or spoke. As you enter data consisting of at least three characters, Workflow Studio displays a list of steps that match your search criteria.

\[Omitted image "search-steps-text-box.png"\] Alt text: The Steps menu displays a text box labelled Search Actions.

## ServiceNow data

ServiceNow Data steps are available to all actions regardless of the spokes installed. Use these steps to perform record operations on your data.

## Utilities

Utility steps enable you to build payloads, compress data, run scripts, and send notifications.

## Integrations

Enable custom actions to integrate with external systems by activating Integration Hub, which adds integration steps to the Workflow Studio interface.

Create a reusable action to send SQL commands to a relational database.
-   **[JSON Builder step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/json-build-step-action-designer.md)**  
Create a JSON payload to use in another step. Enter values or use data pills to produce a dynamic payload. This step supports several data types, including objects and arrays for nested structures.
-   **[Kafka Producer step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/kafka-producer-action-designer.md)**  
Create an action that publishes events to a topic in your Kafka environment.
