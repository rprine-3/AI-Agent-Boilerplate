</table>**Important:**

-   Not all model providers are available for customers with in-country SKUs, and some AI products/features are currently unavailable for in-country customers. For more information, see the [KB1584492](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1584492) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Be sure to check for model provider availability updates in future releases.
-   Some AI products/features are currently unavailable for customers in the FedRAMP, NSC DOD IL5, or Australia IRAP-Protected data centers, self-hosted customers, or in other restricted environments. For more information, see the [KB0743854](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0743854) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Be sure to check for availability updates in future releases.
-   Some AI products/features are currently available only for customers in some regions. Be sure to check for availability updates in future releases.

Be sure to check for availability updates in future releases.

**Important:** Some generative AI skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. The default behavior works as follows:

-   **New customers**

    When you install an AI product, designated generative AI skills, AI agents, or agentic workflows are turned on automatically.

-   **Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Zurich Patch 4\)**

    There is no change to skills, agents, or agentic workflows that are currently enabled and customized.

    An AI asset is turned on if:

    -   The AI plugin is installed, but the asset was never turned on.
    -   An admin has never adjusted roles for the skill.
    An AI asset is not turned on if:

    -   The asset was previously turned on, and then turned off again.
    -   An admin has adjusted roles for the asset.

## AI limitations

This application uses artificial intelligence \(AI\) and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study that generate predictions based on patterns in data. As a result, this application may not always produce accurate, complete, or appropriate information. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this application has been fully trained or tested for your use case. To mitigate these issues, it is your responsibility to test and evaluate your use of this application for accuracy, harm, and appropriateness for your use case, employ human oversight of output, and refrain from relying solely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making purposes. This is especially important if you choose to deploy this application in areas with consequential impacts such as healthcare, finance, legal, employment, security, or infrastructure. You agree to abide by [ServiceNow’s AI Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.servicenow.com/ai-acceptable-use-policy.html), which may be updated by ServiceNow.

## Data processing

This application requires data to be transferred from ServiceNow customers' individual instances to a centralized ServiceNow environment, which may be located in a different data center region from the one where your instance is, and potentially to a third-party cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure. This data is handled per ServiceNow's internal policies and procedures, including our policies available through our [CORE Compliance Portal](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0564067).
