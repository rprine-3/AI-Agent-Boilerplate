# Workflow Studio actions

Actions can be added to any flow, enabling process analysts to automate ServiceNow AI Platform features without having to write code.

An action is a reusable operation that enables process analysts to automate ServiceNow AI Platform features without having to write code. For example, the **Create Record** action allows process analysts to generate records in a particular table with particular values when certain conditions occur. ServiceNow core actions like Create Record require some familiarity with ServiceNow AI Platform tables and fields. Action designers can create application-specific actions to pre-set configuration details. For example, creating a Create Incident Task action ensures that the process analyst uses the correct table and field configuration each time the action is used. You can add application-specific actions by activating the associated spoke.

In Workflow Studio, a process analyst adds actions to a flow and defines the configuration options.

## Search actions

You can use the **Search Actions** filter to find an action by name or spoke. As you enter data, Workflow Studio displays a list of actions and spokes that match your search criteria.

\[Omitted image "search-actions-text-box.png"\] Alt text: The Action menu displays a text box labelled Search Actions.

## Most Recent

You can use the **Most Recent** option to display a list of the actions you recently selected. Each action displays the action name and the spoke to which it belongs underneath the name. You can use the information icon to see more information about the action such as its description, inputs, and outputs.

\[Omitted image "most-recent-actions-list.png"\] Alt text: The Most Recent option displays a list of recently used actions such as the Look Up record action in the ServiceNow Core spoke.

## Popular

You can use the **Popular** option to display a list of actions that your organization frequently uses. The system runs a scheduled job every seven days to generate the list of popular actions.

## Installed spokes

Workflow Studio displays actions for each installed spoke. You can select a spoke name to see a list of available actions for the spoke. All instances have a ServiceNow Core spoke.

A ServiceNow core action is an action available to any flow regardless of the spokes installed. ServiceNow core actions cannot be viewed or edited from the Workflow Studio flow design environment. For example, the **Ask for Approval** action is a ServiceNow core action that allows process analysts to use ServiceNow AI Platform approvals. Workflow Studio provides a set of ServiceNow core actions to automate ServiceNow AI Platform processes. You can add application-specific actions by activating the associated spoke.

You can find any custom actions you created in the spoke to which they belong. Alternatively, use the Search Actions filter to search for actions by name.
