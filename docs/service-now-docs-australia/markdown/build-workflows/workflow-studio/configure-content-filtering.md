# Configure content filtering definitions

Specify which content a user can access by creating content definitions.

## Before you begin

Content filtering requires some familiarity with user roles and Workflow Studio tables and records.

Role required: flow\_designer, action\_designer, or admin

## About this task

Filter Workflow Studio flow content based on user role. Filtering content requires you to set up:

1.  Content definitions to describe the content that you want to filter. Content definitions specify types of Workflow Studio flow resources, such as actions and subflows.
2.  Content filtering rules to state the role a user must have to access the resource in a particular definition.

Workflow Studio includes several content definitions and filtering rules by default. Get started with content filtering by modifying the preexisting definitions and rules or creating your own.

## Procedure

1.  To modify or create a content definition, navigate to **Process Automation** &gt; **Flow Administration** &gt; **Content Definitions**.

2.  Select the definition that you want to modify or click **New** to create one.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name for the content definition.|
    |Application|Application scope to which the content definition applies. This field is automatically set to the currently selected application scope. If no application scope is selected, the field is set to Global. If you set a specific application scope, then the content definition only applies to that application scope. If you select the Global application scope, then the content definition applies to all applications.|
    |Table|Table containing the resource type that you're defining. For example, the Flow \[sys\_hub\_flow\] table includes all the flows and subflows available on your instance.|
    |Conditions|Conditions used to filter the records in the table. For example, creating a condition where **\[Flow Type\] \[is\] \[SubFlow\]** returns only the subflows from the Flow table.|
    |Resource Tags|Tags used to filter the resources in the table.|

4.  Click **Submit**.
