</table>## Outputs

This activity does not produce output.

## Design considerations

-   **Add placeholders activities to skip activity configuration**

    Playbooks designers can use placeholder activities to communicate the intent of an activity or playbook without having to do any configuration. Playbook designers can defer configuration to another time or delegate the configuration to another user who may better understand the playbook data model.

-   **Edit placeholder activities to replace them with other activities**

    Placeholder activities help playbook designers create playbook, but do not produce any output or advance a playbooks when run. Edit Placeholder activities when you are ready to replace them with another activity type and configure them.
