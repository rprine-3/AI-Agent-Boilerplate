# Look Up Record action

Look up a record from any table based on defined conditions.

## Roles and availability

Available as a Workflow Studio ServiceNow core action. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can add an action to a flow and define configuration details.

## Fields

<table id="table_fdl_yhf_kcb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Select a table from the list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Conditions

</td><td>

Conditions the returned record must meet.

 When building a condition that looks up the value of a reference field, use a data pill that explicitly provides the Sys ID value. Ensure the condition has the format **\[reference field\]\[is\]\[Reference type data pill-&gt;Sys ID\]**. For example, both the Change and Incident tables contain a reference field to the User table. To look up change records where the requester is the caller from an incident record, create the condition **\[Requested by\]\[is\]\[Trigger-&gt;incident record-&gt;Caller-&gt;Sys ID\]**.

Order by

Determines how to sort results when more than one record matches the defined conditions. Select the field you want to use to sort results.

Select whether to sort alphabetically in ascending or descending order.

</td></tr><tr><td>
