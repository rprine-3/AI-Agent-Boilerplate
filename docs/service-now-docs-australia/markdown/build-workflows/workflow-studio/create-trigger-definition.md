# Create a trigger definition

Define the type of trigger that determines when to start running your playbook.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure to set your current application to the application that you want your playbook to run in. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).
-   Role required: admin, playbook.admin, or pd\_trigger\_author

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Process Automation Administration** &gt; **Trigger Definitions**.

2.  In the context header, click **New**.

3.  On the Trigger Definition form, in the **Label** field, enter any label for your trigger definition.

    This label appears as a trigger option when you [Create a playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-process-definition.md).

4.  Next to the **Trigger Type** field, click the lookup using list icon \(\[Omitted image "lookup-using-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon\).

5.  In the Trigger Types list, select a trigger type to use for your trigger definition.

    Options include:

    -   **Record Created**

        The playbook runs when a user creates a record anywhere in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    -   **Record Updated**

        The playbook runs when a user updates an existing record anywhere in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    -   **Record Created or Updated**

        The playbook runs when a user creates a record or updates an existing record anywhere in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

6.  Click **Next** to go on to the next step.

7.  In the Table list, select a table whose record operations you want to trigger your playbook.

8.  Under Condition, use the [condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_ConditionBuilder.md) to add field conditions for when you want to trigger your playbook.

9.  To trigger your playbook for tables that extend your selected table, select the **Run On Extended** check box.

    For more information, see [Table extension and classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-extension-and-classes.md).

10. Click **Update** to finish creating your trigger definition.


## Result

Your trigger definition is added to the Trigger Definition \[sys\_pd\_trigger\_definition\] table. You can now select your preset trigger when you [Create a playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-process-definition.md).
