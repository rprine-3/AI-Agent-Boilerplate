# Non-Interactive activities

A non-interactive activity runs entirely behind-the-scenes on the ServiceNow AI Platform® and doesn't require any user input.

A non-interactive activity is an entirely automated operation on the ServiceNow AI Platform which doesn't require any user input to proceed to completion. Non-interactive activities still render in a playbook, but only display information to agents. Configure the activity inputs for an interactive activity so that the activity is a fully automated operation on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

When non-interactive activities run, they automatically proceed to completion or are skipped. For example, if your activity automatically updates the Assigned To user for a record, the Playbook card can display the newly updated Assigned To user's name to the playbook agent, but the card's status is automatically set to Complete.

Non-interactive activities turn into activity cards that are collapsed and marked complete in a playbook. The playbook continues running without any input from the playbook agent.
