# UI Layouts

A UI Layout describes what properties and components to use when an activity renders as a card in a Playbook Experience.

When creating an activity definition, you must select an UI Layout to associate your activity definition with. Playbooks come with the following UI Layouts that are available in your instance by default:

-   Create Record
-   Questionnaire
-   Instructional
-   Knowledge
-   List
-   Record
-   Record generator

Depending on the UI Layout associated with the activity, different sections and fields appear under the activity definition's Activity Experience. These sections and fields let you set up the activity data that renders during the runtime Playbook Experience.

**Note:** All UI Layouts, except for Record generator, display an Associated Record section. For information on how to set up or edit the Associated Record section in an activity definition, see [Create an activity definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-activity-definition.md).
