# Get started with Dynamic Flow and Get Flow Outputs

Create a sample flow that dynamically calls subflows for provisioning cloud services.

## Before you begin

Role required: flow\_designer or admin

## About this task

To understand how to use the Dynamic Flow and Get Flow Outputs flow logic together, the flow that you create in this task dynamically runs subflows that are related to provisioning cloud services. This flow does the following:

1.  Triggers when a Cloud Instance Provisioning Request record is created.
2.  Calls the appropriate subflow to create a Cloud Instance record.
3.  Gets an output from the dynamically called subflow and updates the Cloud Instance Provisioning Request record with the output's value.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **Studio**.

2.  On the Select Application screen, click **Create Application**.

3.  On the Guided App Creator welcome screen, click **Let's get started**.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter `Cloud Instance Provisioning` and then click **Create**.

5.  In the **Roles** field, enter `flow_designer` or `admin` and then click **Continue**.

6.  From the list of app formats, select **Classic** and then click **Continue**.

7.  Select **Create new table** &gt; **Create table from scratch** &gt; **Continue** to create two new tables for your application.

    -   Add the following fields for the first table and name the table `Cloud Instance`.

        |Field label|Field type|Reference|
        |-----------|----------|---------|
        |Owner|Reference|User \[sys\_user\]|
        |Instance Type|String|None|
        |Instance URL|URL|None|
        |Build Status|String|None|

    -   Add the following fields for the second table and name the table `Cloud Instance Provisioning Request`.

        |Field label|Field type|Reference|
        |-----------|----------|---------|
        |Requested Instance Type|String|None|
        |Requested by|Reference|User \[sys\_user\]|
        |Approval Status|String|None|
        |Approved Instance|URL|None|

8.  After creating both tables, click **Done with tables**.

9.  Select **Start** &gt; **Create** &gt; **Done with apps** to finish creating your application.

## Test your flow

Test your sample flow for provisioning cloud services.

### Before you begin

Role required: flow\_designer or admin

### Procedure

1.  In the Flow header, select **Test** to test your flow.

2.  On the Test Flow screen, select the Create new record \(\[Omitted image "create-new-record-icon.png"\] Alt text: Create new record icon\) icon to create a new record.

3.  For **Requested By**, select the Lookup using list icon \(\[Omitted image "lookup-using-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon\) and select any user from the list.

4.  For **Requested Instance Type**, enter either `Jira` or `Salesforce`.

    The value you enter determines which subflow runs dynamically at runtime. Entering `Jira` runs the **Create Cloud Instance Record - Jira** subflow, and entering `Salesforce` runs the **Create Cloud Instance Record - Salesforce**.

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  Select **Run Test**, and when the flow finishes running, select **Your test has finished running. View the flow execution details.**

    Your flow runs successfully if the values in the State column for each step in your flow shows **Completed** and each step's runtime value populates appropriately.

7.  Select the tab for your **Process Cloud Provisioning Requests** flow and close the Test Flow modal.

8.  In the Flow header, select **Activate** to make your flow accessible within the Cloud Instance Provisioning Application scope.


### Result

When a user in your instance creates a new record in the Cloud Provisioning Request table, your Process Cloud Provisioning Requests flow runs automatically. This flow dynamically creates the proper Cloud Instance record that is based on the requested instance type. It also generates a cloud instance URL, which populates in the Cloud Instance Provisioning Request record.
