# Questionnaire activity

Collects inputs from a user during a playbook run to use later in the playbook.

The questionnaire activity replaces the Collect User Data activity, but does not require you to create a data definition. Use the questionnaire activity if:

-   You don't have a table already,
-   You don't need to run reports on the collected data,
-   And you don't need to use the data outside of the playbook.

If you already have a table to store the collected data, use the [User Form activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/user-form-activity.md).

## Roles and availability

This activity is available as a common activity. Users with the admin, playbook.admin, or pd\_author can add this activity to a playbook.

During a playbook run, you can use data definitions to potentially:

-   Collect a shipping address, then reference the address when generating a shipping label.
-   Ask the user "yes" or "no" questions, and determine subsequent activities based on the user's responses.

## Common properties

These properties are common to all to activities in Playbooks.

Open the activity properties panel and configure your activity to add values for the following inputs. If the input value varies, use the pill-picker to show where to get the value. To learn more about the pill-picker, see [Dot-walking examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/dot-walking-examples.md).

</table>## Questionnaire

In the **Questionnaire** tab, you can:

-   Add questions for agents to respond to,
-   Edit existing questionnaires.

Assignment Group for this Process Step

</td><td>

Reference.Group \[sys\_user\_group\]

</td><td>

Assignment group allowed to perform this playbook activity. If you don't set any values for **Assignment Group** or **Assigned To**, any user can read and edit the collected data. The Assignment group and Assigned to fields limit who has access to do so. To specify only individual users, use the **Assigned To** field. The same users do not need to be specified in both fields.**Note:** By default, these fields are mapped to the **Assignment Group** and **Assigned To** fields of the trigger record. This means that users assigned to work on the parent record have access to submit, view and edit the collected data by default.
