## Data mappings

Users with the admin, flow\_designer, or action\_designer roles can open and view the steps of ITSM Spoke actions. To view data mappings between ITSM data types, view the Create Record step of the ITSM Spoke action. Most ITSM Spoke data is stored in extensions of the Task \[task\] table, which means that many of the data types share common fields.

For example, the Create Normal Change Request from Incident action uses the common Task table fields for Short description, Configuration Item, Priority, Domain, Company, and Description to create a Change Request from an Incident.
