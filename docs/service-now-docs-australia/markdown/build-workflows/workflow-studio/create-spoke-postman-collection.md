# Create spoke and build actions by importing a Postman collection

Automate an integration and generate reusable actions by importing a Postman collection.

## Before you begin

-   Install the Spoke Generator app from the ServiceNow Store.
-   Confirm that ServiceNow Integration Hub Professional Pack Installer \(com.glide.hub.integrations.professional\) is installed and the license is entitled.
-   Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Click **Create new** &gt; **Spoke**.

3.  On the Spoke Info screen, specify if you want to create the spoke in a new scope or an existing scope.

    1.  If you choose to create the spoke in a new scope, select an image as the logo for your integration and fill in the fields.

        Here, we will go through an integration with Notion as an example.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Spoke name|Name to identify the custom spoke.|
        |Description|Description about the custom spoke.|
        |System|Search and select the external system to integrate.|
        |Connector type|Select **Spoke** from the list.|

        \[Omitted image "spk-gen-notion-new-scope.png"\] Alt text: Create application in a new scope.

        **Note:**

        The value of **App scope name** is the format: `x_<company-code>_<spoke-name>_<spoke>`. By default, the &lt;company-code&gt; is, `snc`. You can configure the company code by configuring **Value** of the system property, **glide.appcreator.company.code**.\[Omitted image "spoke-gen-sys-property.png"\] Alt text: Configuring Value of glide.appcreator.company.code.

        This configured value is used when the value **App scope name** is generated.\[Omitted image "spoke-gen-app-scope.png"\] Alt text: Configured value of App scope name.

    2.  If you choose to create the spoke in an existing scope, select an image as the logo for your integration and fill in the fields.

        Here, we will go through an integration with AWS as an example.

    3.  After installing the spoke, navigate to the Workflow Studio tab.

        The system displays the message `Have you installed a spoke from the Store?`.

    4.  Select one of these options and click **Continue**.

        |Option|Description|
        |------|-----------|
        |**Yes, view the installed spoke.**|Option to redirect to the **Spokes** dashboard under **Integrations**.|

19. Click **Done: Go to spoke** to go the Spokes page and view the publish status.

    -   Actions with the OpenAPI step are created. For information about the OpenAPI step, see .
    -   Action inputs and outputs are mapped.
    -   Actions are published and listed in the spoke details page under **Actions** &gt; **Published**.
    You can start using these published actions to create flows and subflows as per your requirement.

    -   If you have saved actions as draft, you can access these draft actions in the spoke details page under **Actions** &gt; **Draft**.
    -   To view run-time information about the spoke activities, click **Spoke activity log** in the spoke details page. Every time a spoke activity is performed, the system generates its information as a spoke activity log. Click the required **Number** to view the activity log. Every operation in the spoke activity log has one of these status values:

        |Status|Description|
        |------|-----------|
        |**new**|An event for the operation is created and this operation will be executed soon.|
        |**error**|The operation has failed to execute.|
        |**processing**|The operation execution is in progress.|
        |**success**|The operation has been executed successfully.|

    You can create flows and subflows in the spoke details page and use them in your integration. For more information, see [Building flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/flows.md) and [Building subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/subflows.md).

    Along with **Spoke activity log**, you can also view details of the available flows, subflows, and actions in the spoke details page.
