# User access to Playbooks in Workflow Studio

Administrators can grant users access to Playbook by assigning delegated development permissions or directly assigning a user role. Administrators can also specify which features and content a user can access based on user roles.

## Access by user role

Administrators can grant access to Playbook in Workflow Studio by directly assigning users the pd\_author user role, which includes the role to view activity definitions.

        -   -   delegated\_developer

## Delegated development access

Administrators can grant users access to Workflow Studio playbooks by creating an application and assigning users as developers with the playbook delegated development permission. Delegated development allows administrators to control whether playbook authors can access features normally restricted to admin users. For more information, see Developer permissions.

## Role-based content filtering

Specify the user roles necessary to access Workflow Studio playbook content. For example, activity definitions and process definitions. Manage content filtering by creating content definitions and content filtering rules. For more information, see [Content filtering for Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/content-filtering-playbooks.md).

## Role-based activity definition access

Manage activity definition access by specifying the **Required Roles** to access an activity definition. Users who can view the playbook but who do not have the required role to access activities with this activity definition will have a read-only view of the playbook.

To learn more about activity definitions, see [Create an activity definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-activity-definition.md) and [Activity definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/activity-definitions.md).

**Note:** Both playbook.admin and pd\_content\_author roles can edit activity definitions, but only the playbook.admin role can edit the **Required Roles** field.
