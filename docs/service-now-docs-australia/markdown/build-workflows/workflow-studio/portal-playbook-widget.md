# Portal Playbook Widget

Explore the Portal Playbook Widget.

## About the widget

The Playbook widget is an iFrame that enables administrators to specify where a playbook event should be directed. The iFrame URL is the UI Builder Playbooks Portal page. The widget handles events that playbook is listening for via the Session Storage API so that it knows when to perform an action in portal, like opening a record or list in a modal within Service Portal.

The out-of-the-box components are built for any Playbook Experience you may need for your Service Portal users. We do not recommend directly editing the out-of-the-box UI Builder Playbook Portal Page, the Service Portal Playbook widget, or the Playbook Content Item. Changing the out-of-the-box components can result in technical problems.

If, for example, you need a UXF Client Action to work for your instance of the playbook page, we recommend cloning the playbook widget instead.

**Note:** To learn more about how to clone or create your own widget instead, see [Developing custom widgets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/widget-dev-guide.md).

## Cloning a Playbook Service Portal Widget

Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Portal** &gt; **Widgets** and find the **Playbook** widget.

**Note:** If you clone the **Playbook** widget, make sure that all out-of-the-box actions and configuration properties are copied over to your cloned widget.

To learn more about the HTML template field, see [Developing custom widgets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/widget-dev-guide.md#section_gpd_lkw_h1b).**Warning:** Make sure the iFrame URL of your cloned widget is different from the iFrame URL for the out-of-the-box widget.

A client script requires knowledge of both the ServiceNow API and AngularJS to create a client controller.
