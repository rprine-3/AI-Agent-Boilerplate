# Configure decision tables

Configure Workflow Studio and assign roles based on the permission level each user requires. Workflow Studio is installed automatically with each family upgrade.

For more information, see [Update to the latest version of Workflow Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/update-to-the-latest-version-of-workflow-studio.md).

## Decision tables personas and roles

The responsibilities of your staff are controlled by roles assigned to each member. Personas aren’t explicitly part of decision tables in Workflow Studio, but administrators assign roles to give team members permission to configure or use decision tables.

### Personas and roles

Review the personas and roles used in decision tables in Workflow Studio.

-   **Decision table admin**

    The decision table admin can create and edit any part of a decision table. The admin may decide when a decision table is needed, create the table, and delegate rule authoring to someone else. Decision table admins are the only persona who can create inputs and decision table columns and values.

-   **Decision table reader**

    The decision table reader has read-only access to decision tables. They can't add or delete inputs, conditions, or results, but they can export a decision table to Excel.

-   **Decision rule author**

    The decision rule author has the most access to update decision tables after the decision table admin. The admin may create a table with inputs and table columns and then pass on the rest of the work to the decision rule author. The decision rule author can add, rearrange, and delete decision rows and edit condition and result values in all rows and columns.

-   **Decision result editor**

    The decision result editor can only edit result values in existing decision rows. The decision result editor may change a value based on a new business decision or policy.
