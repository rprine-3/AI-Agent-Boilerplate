# Invoke PaCE activity

Enable the Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\) activity in Playbooks to develop playbook processes.

## Roles and availability

These activities are available as part of the application that is automatically bundled with PaCE. Users with the admin, pd\_admin, pd\_author, or pd\_content\_author can add these activities to a playbook.

## Inputs

Open the activity properties panel and configure your activity to add values for the following inputs. If the input value varies, use the pill-picker to show where to get the value. To learn more about the pill-picker, see [Dot-walking examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/dot-walking-examples.md).
