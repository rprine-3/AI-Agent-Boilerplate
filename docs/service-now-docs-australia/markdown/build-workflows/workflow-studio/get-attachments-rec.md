# Get Attachments on Record action

Access the list and count of the attachments associated with the provided source record as data pills in a flow. Use flow logic or scripting to process each attachment in the list of the attachments that the action returns.

## Roles and availability

Available as a Workflow Studio ServiceNow core action. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can add an action to a flow and define configuration details.

## Inputs

Provide a value for each input that your flow needs. To add dynamic values, you can also drag and drop pills from the Data panel or select them from the pill picker.

-   **File name**

    Data type: **String**

    Search string containing a partial or entire file name of an attachment file. You can use this input as a query filter to find one or more attachments that have the listed file name. If you leave this input empty, the action returns all attachments associated with the source record.

-   **Source Record**

    Data type: **Document ID**

    Record that you want to get attachments for. Typically this input uses a data pill from the data panel.


## Outputs

These outputs appear in the Data panel. You can use them as inputs elsewhere in your flow.

-   **Attachment List**

    Data type: **Records**

    Sys ID values of Attachment records found.

-   **Count**

    Data type: **Integer**

    Number of attachment records.
