# Make a Decision-First Match activity

Execute rules in a decision table. When this activity runs, it will immediately finish and continue the process execution. The activity returns the result of the first matching decision rule, based on the rank of the rules. To return results from all matching rules, add the decision table to a subflow.

## Roles and availability

This activity is available as a common activity. Users with the admin, playbook.admin, or pd\_author can add this activity to a playbook.
