# Create flow Service Catalog variables

Create Service Catalog variables that are only available to a specific Service Catalog flow. Flow-specific variables are available to catalog tasks and actions in the flow.

## Before you begin

Role required: flow\_designer or admin

## About this task

Flow Service Catalog variables display in the **Catalog Variables** field of the Create Catalog Task and Get Catalog Variables actions. They display in the **Flow:variablename** format and are only available to the flow in which they are defined.

For more information about Service Catalog actions, see [Create Catalog Task action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/create-catalog-task-flow-designer.md) and [Get Catalog Variables action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/get-cat-variables-flow-designer.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open or create a flow with a Service Catalog trigger.

2.  Click \[Omitted image "more-actions-menu-icon.png"\] Alt text: The More Actions icon and select **Manage flow catalog variables**.

    The Flow catalog variables table opens.

3.  Click **New** to add a new variable available to the flow.

4.  Complete the form.
