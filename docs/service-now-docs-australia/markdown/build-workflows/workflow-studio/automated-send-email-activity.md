# Automated Send Email activity

Create an email from previously gathered or generated data without pausing the playbook to ask for user input. When the activity runs, it immediately sends the email and continues to the next activity in the playbook.

## Roles and availability

This activity is available as a common activity. Users with the admin, playbook.admin, or pd\_author can add this activity to a playbook.

## Inputs

Open the activity properties panel and configure your activity to add values for the following inputs. If the input value varies, use the pill-picker to show where to get the value. To learn more about the pill-picker, see [Dot-walking examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/dot-walking-examples.md).

List of Users

</td><td>

Recipient list for the email. There are 2 ways to configure this field:-   Enter email addresses as strings if you want the emails to go to the same addresses every time.
-   When the email address value varies, use the pill picker to indicate where to find the recipient email address. For example, you would use the pill picker if you wanted to automatically notify credit card applicants of a rejection, because each applicant has a different email.

You would select the customer record from the trigger \(when the application was submitted\), because that is where the applicant's email address is found.
