# Enable Guided Activity View

Guide end users through a playbook, step-by-step.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: admin or playbook.admin
-   Familiarize yourself with how to begin customizing the playbook experience in UI Builder. To learn more, see [Customizing the Playbook Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/playbook-customize-playbook.md).

## About this task

Guide end users through a playbook, one activity at a time. If you have a lot of end users encountering issues in a particular area, and you want to walk them through a series of questions that lead to a particular Instruction activity to complete work \(or even KB activity for final instruction\), consider using the **Guided** activity view. There are out-of-the-box playbooks that use the **Guided** activity view for employee self-service requests, such as time off or benefit requests, available through the .

**Note:**

The following configurations and features are not supported for the **Guided** activity view:

-   Parallel activities
-   Optional activities
-   The **Pending Item Visibility** configuration in the **Guided Self-Service Experience** playbook experience record in the **Playbook Experiences** list \[sys\_playbook\_experience.list\]

    **Note:** This property is not relevant since there are no pending activities other than the current activity that an end user is in during a **Guided** self-service playbook run.

-   Stage picker components, including filters

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **UI Builder**, and open the **Guided Self-Service in Employee Center** experience.
