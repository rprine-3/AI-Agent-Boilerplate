</table>## Outputs

These outputs can provide data to other activities in your playbook. You can access this data as activity inputs when you configure your activity:

|Output|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|Table|Table Name|Table containing new record.|
|Create Record View|String|Form view used for record creation.|
|Record Created|Sys ID|Unique identifier of the record that this activity created.|

## Design considerations

-   **Create form views for activities that you want to render in a playbook during runtime.**

    Use a form view to display only the fields your users need to create a record. Your view should display required fields or those fields validated by other business logic. See [View Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/view-management-overview.md).

-   **Run non-interactive activities before interactive activities**

    While a Create Record activity interactively gathers data from users, it prevents the playbook from starting any dependent activities. For example, a Create Record activity would prevent starting **After Previous** activities, which may be in other stages. Where possible, design your playbooks to run non-interactive activities before interactive activities that could block them.
