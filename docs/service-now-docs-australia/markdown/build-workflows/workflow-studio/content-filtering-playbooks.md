# Content filtering for Playbook

Specify which content a user can access based on the user's role.

Display only content that is relevant for a particular user, hiding content that is unnecessary or sensitive. Specify the Workflow Studio playbook content that you want to control access to and the role that a user must have to access it. For example, if a user with the guided\_decision\_builder role is creating a playbook, show only a relevant set of activities.

To implement content filtering, you need:

-   Content definitions to specify types of content.
-   Content filtering rules and roles to determine who can access the content.

There is one content definition for Playbook by default, the **Playbooks - All Activity Definitions** content definition. The **Playbooks - All Activity Definitions** content definition has two content filtering rules by default:

-   **\(Default\) Playbook - Users with delegated\_developer role can access all activity definitions**
-   **\(Default\) Playbook - Users with playbook.activity\_def\_read role can access all activity definitions**

This means that users with the roles delegated\_developer or playbook.activity\_def\_read role can access all activity definitions. Get started with content filtering by using default definitions and rules, or create your own.

## Content definitions

Content definitions specify a type of Workflow Studio resource. Resources are key elements of Workflow Studio components, such as activity definitions for playbooks. Create content definitions to include an entire resource, or use a condition builder to refine your definitions. For example, the content definition for playbook activity definitions includes all activity definitions, but you could create a content definition that includes only the activity definitions that contain Guided Decision in the **Name** or **Package**.

You can further refine content definitions through tagging. Add resource tags to items in a resource list, then design your content definition to only include resources with that tag.

## Content filtering rules

Content filtering rules specify the role that a user must have to access the content in a particular definition. Each rule associates user roles with a single content definition. When a user accesses Playbook in Workflow Studio, content filtering rules determine what activities the user may access based on the user's role.

## Role-based activity definition access

Manage activity definition access by specifying the **Required Roles** to access an activity definition. This overrides any content access filtering. To learn more about roles, see [Playbooks roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/process-automation-designer-roles.md). To learn more about activity definitions, see [Activity definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/activity-definitions.md).

**Note:** Both playbook.admin and pd\_content\_author roles can edit activity definitions, but only the playbook.admin role can edit the **Required Roles** field.

## Read-only playbooks

Users have a read-only view of playbooks with:

-   activities they do not have access to,
-   process definitions **\[sys\_pd\_process\_definition\]** they don't have write access to.

-   The activity definition is hidden and cannot be selected when building a playbook.
-   Playbooks with the activity definition are read-only.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Design considerations

-   **Content definition roles for activity definitions**

    Give users access to the subset of activity definitions in a content definition by assigning the playbook.write role, not the pd\_author role.
