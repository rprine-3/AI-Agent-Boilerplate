# Send SMS action

Send an email-based SMS text message to specified users or groups using your instance email server. Recipients must have an SMS device configured to receive the message.

## Roles and availability

Available as a Workflow Studio ServiceNow core action. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can add an action to a flow and define configuration details.

## Deprecation of email-to-text gateway

Email-to-text service is now deprecated and no longer supported by service providers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon. It is recommended to use Notify for sending SMS notifications.

Notify provides support for sending SMS notifications through integration of third-party services, such as Twilio, and requires configuration of supporting workflows. For more information, see [How to setup a SMS email notification in ServiceNow \[KB0712569\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0712569) knowledge base article.
