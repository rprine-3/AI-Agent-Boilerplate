# Machine Learning solutions for Flow Designer

With Predictive Intelligence for Flow Designer \(com.snc.ml\_flowdesigner\), you can deploy machine learning solutions in your instance. This spoke provides actions to incorporate Predictive Intelligence model predictions into flows.

## Predictive Intelligence activation

This spoke requires Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\). For more information, see [Install Predictive Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-predictive-intelligence.md).

## Key features

Predictive Intelligence for Flow Designer provides three frameworks that you can use to create machine-learning solutions in your instance. Each framework delivers a different solution type for training the system to predict, recommend, and organize data outcomes.

-   Classification framework
-   Similarity framework
-   Clustering framework

## Spoke requirements

-   A sharedservice.worker user to train solutions.
-   A pre-trained Predictive Intelligence solution.

## Spoke dependencies

If you’re having trouble installing the app, ensure that these dependent plugins are installed:

-   Predictive Intelligence \(com.glide.platform\_ml\) plugin
-   Predictive Intelligence Reporting \(com.glide.platform\_ml\_pa\) plugin

**Note:** Some plugins may be licensable features and require appropriate licenses, if used outside the spoke implementation.

## Spoke actions

Predictive Intelligence for Flow Designer \(com.snc.ml\_flowdesigner\) provides actions to make predictions using existing models without having to write or maintain script. Available actions include:

<table id="table_gdw_w1v_r4b"><thead><tr><th>

Action

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Classification Batch Prediction

</td><td>

Obtain a predicted value from an active classification solution definition using multiple input records.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Classification Prediction

</td><td>

Obtain a predicted value from an active classification solution definition using a single input record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

PI Confidence Check

</td><td>

Compare an output value \(number\) from Predictive intelligence with a number specified by the user. For example: Compare the confidence value of a prediction with a specified value.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Regression Batch Prediction

</td><td>

Obtain a predicted value from an active regression solution definition using multiple input records.**Note:** The regression framework is deprecated in the Australia release. You can continue to use existing regression solutions but you can't create new ones.
