Connections

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source Connection

</td><td>

Type of connection to use to connect to the source SFTP server.-   **Define Connection Inline**: Define connection information within the action step.
-   **Use Connection Alias**: Define connection information using the Connection Alias table. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action.

 To learn more about connections and credentials, see [Introduction to credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source Connection Alias

</td><td>

Connection &amp; Credential alias record that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. This field is available when **Use Connection Alias** is selected from the Source Connection list.

To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. This field is available when **Define Connection Inline** is selected from the Source Connection list.**Note:** The SFTP step requires a credential record that supports either SSH private key credentials or SSH credentials. This step does not support Windows credentials where the **Use MID Server service account** option is selected.
