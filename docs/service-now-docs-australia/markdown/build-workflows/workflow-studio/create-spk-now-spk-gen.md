# Create spoke and build actions using the spoke generation skill in ServiceNow Otto

Automate an integration and generate reusable actions by providing the required third-party API documentation snippet as an input.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

-   Role required: admin
-   Create the required action categories for your integration in the Action Category \[sys\_hub\_category\] table.
-   Confirm that ServiceNow Integration Hub Professional Pack Installer \(com.glide.hub.integrations.professional\) is installed and the license is entitled.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Click **New** &gt; **Spoke**.

3.  On the Spoke Info screen, specify if you want to create the spoke in a new scope or an existing scope.

    1.  If you choose to create the spoke in a new scope, select an image as the logo for your integration and fill in the fields.

        Here, we will go through an integration with LearnOrbit as an example.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Spoke name|Name to identify the custom spoke.|
        |Description|Description about the custom spoke.|

        \[Omitted image "build-spoke-now-assist.png"\] Alt text: Spoke generator window.

        **Note:**

        The value of **App scope name** is the format: `x_<company-code>_<spoke-name>_<spoke>`. By default, the &lt;company-code&gt; is, `snc`. You can configure the company code by configuring **Value** of the system property, **glide.appcreator.company.code**.\[Omitted image "spoke-gen-sys-property.png"\] Alt text: Configuring Value of glide.appcreator.company.code.

        This configured value is used when the value **App scope name** is generated.\[Omitted image "spoke-gen-app-scope.png"\] Alt text: Configured value of App scope name.

    2.  If you choose to create the spoke in an existing scope, select an image as the logo for your integration and fill in the fields.

        Here, we will go through an integration with LearnOrbit as an example.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|

7.  On the Generate action screen, paste the required content from the API documentation in **AI Context**.

    In this example, we will copy the documentation related to the enrollUser action and paste it in **AI Context**.

    **Note:** Ensure that you paste the documentation related to only one action at a time.

    \[Omitted image "build-spoke-action-api-docs.png"\] Alt text: Create spoke action window.
