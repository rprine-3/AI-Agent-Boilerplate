# Generate recommendations for placeholder activities

Select the activity definition for a placeholder activity from a list of AI-generated recommendations. The system generates recommendations based on an activity's name and description.

## Before you begin

-   Verify that the ServiceNow Otto for Creator plugin is installed and the **Playbook recommendations** skill is turned on. For more information about turning on the AI skills for Playbooks, see [Turn on AI skills for Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/turn-on-playbook-generation-skill.md).

    **Note:** AI skills are available in **Admin** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **AI Skills** &gt; **Creator**.

    For information about installing ServiceNow Otto for Creator, see 

-   You can only generate recommendations for placeholder activities in a generated playbook outline. To learn how to generate a playbook outline, see [Generate a playbook from text or image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/generate-a-playbook-outline.md).
-   Role required:
    -   admin, playbook.admin, pd\_author, or a delegated developer permission

## Procedure

1.  Open you playbook and hover over the placeholder activity and select the recommendations icon \[Omitted image "recommendations-icon.png"\] Alt text: Now Recommendations icon in the mini-picker.

    \[Omitted image "playbook-recommendation-otto.png"\] Alt text: Sample AI recommendation for placeholder activity.

2.  Select one of the recommended activity definitions, if appropriate.

    **Note:** If there are no recommendations listed, then no activity definitions are considered relevant to the activity name and description.

3.  Try updating the **Label** and **Description** to improve results.

    1.  Open the placeholder activity.

    2.  Update the **Label** and **Description**.

    3.  Under the **Activity definition** field, select the recommendations button \(\[Omitted image "now-recommendations-button.png"\] Alt text: Recommendations button\) to try to generate recommendations again.

    4.  Select one of the recommended activity definitions, if appropriate.

4.  Continue on with activity configuration from Step [8.e](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/generate-a-playbook-outline.md) of the [Generate a playbook from text or image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/generate-a-playbook-outline.md) procedure.


## Result

When your playbook's trigger conditions are met, your playbook runs. As a result, the system creates a Process Execution record and renders user-facing configurations for Playbook Experience. For an example of how to digitize a manual business process that renders as a playbook, see [Create a sample playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/design-automated-process.md).

## What to do next
