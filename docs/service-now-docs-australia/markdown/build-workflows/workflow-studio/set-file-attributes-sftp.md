# Set File Attributes

Sets common file attributes, such as timestamps, size, permissions, and UID/GID, for a file or directory on an SFTP server.

A good practice is to use the Get File List command to return a list of files and their attributes first. Then, after you have moved the files from a source host to a target host, use the Set File Attributes command to set the source file attributes on the target file.

Description

Connections

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source Connection

</td><td>

Type of connection to use to connect to the source SFTP server.-   **Define Connection Inline**: Define connection information within the action step.
-   **Use Connection Alias**: Define connection information using the Connection Alias table. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action.

 To learn more about connections and credentials, see [Introduction to credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source Connection Alias

</td><td>

Connection &amp; Credential alias record that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials and connection information profiles when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the connection information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. This field is available when **Use Connection Alias** is selected from the Source Connection list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source Credential alias

</td><td>

Credential alias that the system uses to run the action step. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can create or select an associated Connection record. Using an alias eliminates the need to configure multiple credentials when using an action in multiple environments. Likewise, if the credential information changes, you don't need to update your custom action. To learn more about connections and credentials, see [credentials, connections, and aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-connections-alias.md). The credential value is displayed as a Password \(2 Way Encrypted\) data pill on the data panel. This field is available when **Define Connection Inline** is selected from the Source Connection list.**Note:** The SFTP step requires a credential record that supports either SSH private key credentials or SSH credentials. This step does not support Windows credentials where the **Use MID Server service account** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Host

</td><td>

Name or IP address of the SFTP server that contains the file you wish to remove.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Port

</td><td>

Port number to communicate with the server.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Selection

</td><td>

Option to select a specific MID Server or MID Cluster. Choose any one of the following options. -   **Auto-Select MID Server**: Your ServiceNow instance selects the MID Server without manual input.
-   **Specific MID Server**: Your ServiceNow instance uses MID Server that you specify.
-   **Specific MID Cluster**: Your ServiceNow instance uses the MID Cluster that you specify.

A MID Cluster is a group of MID Servers that enables your ServiceNow instance to handle multiple integrations, and improve integration speed. For more information, see [Configure a MID Server cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureAMIDServerCluster.md).
