# Generate a playbook from a knowledge base article

Use an existing knowledge base article to generate a playbook using AI. The stages and activities are automatically populated based on the article content.

## Before you begin

Verify that the ServiceNow Otto for Creator plugin is installed and the **Playbook Generation with KB** skill is turned on. For more information about turning on the AI skills for Playbooks, see [Turn on AI skills for Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/turn-on-playbook-generation-skill.md).

**Note:** AI skills are available in **Admin** &gt; **AI Admin Hub** &gt; **AI Skills** &gt; **Creator**.

For information about installing ServiceNow Otto for Creator, see 

Verify that the knowledge base article describes a process with steps. Articles that contain only definitions or reference information can't be used to generate a playbook.

Role required: playbook\_author.

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  From the **New** drop-down menu, select **Playbook**.
