# Content filtering for Workflow Studio flows

Specify which content a user can access based on the user's role.

Display only content that is relevant for a particular user, hiding content that is unnecessary or sensitive. Specify the Workflow Studio flow content that you want to control access to and the role that a user must have to access it. For example, if a user with the hr\_manager role in human resources is creating a flow, show only the set of actions and subflows that are relevant to HR cases.

Content filtering uses:

-   Content definitions to specify types of content.
-   Content filtering rules to determine who can access the content.

Workflow Studio includes several default definitions and filtering rules. Set up content filtering by modifying pre-existing rules or creating your own.

## Content definitions

Content definitions specify a type of Workflow Studio flow resource. Resources are the key components of Workflow Studio flows, such as triggers, actions, and subflows. Create definitions to include an entire resource, or refine your definitions through conditions. For example, you can create a definition that includes all flow triggers, or you can use conditions to include only triggers with a category of date.

You can further refine content definitions through tagging. Add tags to items in a resource list, then design your content definition to only include resources with that tag.

## Content filtering rules

Content filtering rules specify the role that a user must have to access the content in a particular definition. Each rule associates a single user role with a single content definition. When a user accesses Workflow Studio flows, content filtering rules determine what content the user may access based on the user's role.

## Feature access

You can also filter access to Workflow Studio flow features. Features are UI elements and sections. Access to both elements and sections can be managed by configuring content definitions and filtering rules. However, access to UI elements can also be managed through a simplified UI. For more information, see [Manage access to Workflow Studio flow features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/manage-access-features.md).

## Read-only flows

Users may be able to view a flow, subflow, or action containing content that they can't normally access. For example, a flow that's visible to a user might include an action the user wouldn't usually be able to view. When a flow contains restricted content, the entire flow becomes read-only. Users can run the flow but can't modify or copy it.

The creation of read-only flows doesn't apply to feature filtering. If a user doesn't have access to a feature, the feature doesn't render for that user. It doesn't affect the ability to copy or modify a flow. If a user doesn't have access to transform functions and uses a flow that already has a transform function applied, the transform function is read-only. The rest of the flow can still be copied and modified.
