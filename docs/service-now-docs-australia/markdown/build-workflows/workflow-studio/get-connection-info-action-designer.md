# Get Connection Info step

Provide the connection and credential details from another step, such as a REST step, to other steps in your action.

**Note:** The Get Connection Info step is not available in the base system and requires the subscription to Integration Hub Starter Pack Installer \(com.glide.hub.integrations\) or later. For more information about the ServiceNow® Integration Hub subscription packages, see Integration Hub usage and subscription. After the required plugin is activated, the step is visible under Integrations.

## Roles and availability

After setting up your Integration Hub Starter subscription, the Get Connection Info step is available as an Workflow Studio action step. Users with the action\_designer role can create a custom action with the Get Connection Info step.

## Inputs

Provide a value for each input that your step needs. To add dynamic values, you can also drag and drop pills from the Data panel or select them from the pill picker.
