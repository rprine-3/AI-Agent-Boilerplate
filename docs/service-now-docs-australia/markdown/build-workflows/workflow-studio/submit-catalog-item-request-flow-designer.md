Create a requested item \[sc\_req\_item\] on a Service Catalog Request \[sc\_request\].

## Roles and availability

Available as a Workflow Studio ServiceNow core action. Users with the flow\_designer or admin role can add an action to a flow and define configuration details.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable timeout

</td><td>

Option to limit the amount of time that the flow waits for the action to be completed before continuing.

**Note:** Use the **Enable timeout** option to prevent this action from continuing to run. If the condition to continue is never met, a timeout value specifies when the system skips the Wait for Condition action and go to the next item in the flow. You must set a Duration value to enable a timeout. You can also select a Schedule if you want to compute the duration end date based on a specific work schedule.

 This field appears only when the **Wait for Completion** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Duration

</td><td>

Amount of time that the flow waits before continuing when the **Enable timeout** option is selected. Enter the time to wait in hours, minutes, and seconds. If you leave this field empty, the flow does not wait.

 This field appears only when the **Wait for Completion** option is selected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Schedule

</td><td>

Schedule used to compute the timeout duration when the **Enable timeout** option is selected. For example, waiting for 10 hours as part of an 8-5 weekdays schedule causes the flow to wait for one or more business days. If you leave this field empty, the timeout runs without a schedule.

 This field appears only when the **Wait for Completion** option is selected.

## Design considerations

Follow these design considerations when creating flows that contain Submit a Catalog Item Request actions.

-   **Escape quotation marks from string data pills with the String Replace transform function**

    Complex string variables are converted into JSON format when stored in the system. To prevent any JSON formatting errors, you can use a Replace String transform function to escape the quotation marks present in any string data pills you use for catalog variables. See [String transform functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/string-transform-functions.md).

-   **Use transform functions to validate data pills**

    Whenever you use a data pill to provide data for an action input, you can use a transform function to validate the data. See [Transform functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/transform-functions.md) for a list of available transform functions.
