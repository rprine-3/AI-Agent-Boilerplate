# Modify decision table structure in Workflow Studio

Modify the inputs or columns of a decision table in Workflow Studio to keep pace with changing business logic.

**Parent Topic:**[Decision tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/using-decision-builder.md)

## Modify an input for a decision table

Modify an input by changing the label, modifying the type and associated properties, and changing the mandatory toggle.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin, decision\_table\_admin, or delegated developer permissions. For more information, see Delegate developers using App Engine Studio.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the homepage, select **Decision tables**.

3.  Select a decision table.

4.  Select the input to modify.

5.  Modify the input.

    -   To modify the label, select the label, provide a new name, and press **Enter**.
    -   To change the input type, choose a different input type from the Type list.

        **Note:** The input type can be modified only if the input is not linked to a condition column.

    -   To modify the input type properties, select the property field and update the value.
6.  Select **Save**.


## Filter reference inputs and results in a decision table

Narrow down the list of results to only information that you need to see for Reference type input and result fields in decision tables in Workflow Studio.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin or decision\_table\_admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the homepage, select **Decision tables**.

3.  Select a decision table.

4.  Create a filter for an input or result.

<table id="choicetable_mgh_hb1_cyb"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d50418e274">

Action

</th><th align="left" id="d50418e277">

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d50418e283">

**Create a filter for a Reference type input**

</td><td>

1.  Select **Add an input**.
2.  In the **Label** field, add a label for the input. For example, `Reference input`.
3.  In the **Type** field, select **Reference**.

The **Reference** column appears and displays the Reference table.

4.  In the **Table** field, select the table to reference. For example, `sys_user`.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d50418e333">

**Create a filter for a Reference type result**

</td><td>

1.  Select **Add result column**.
2.  In the **Result column label** field, enter a name for the field.
3.  In the **Result type** field, select **Reference**.
4.  In the **Result table** field, select the table to reference.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  Select **Add reference filter**.

6.  Build a filter by adding conditions that contain a field, operator, and value.

    You can build a more complex filter by selecting **New condition set** and adding more conditions with **or** or **and** to string them together.

7.  Select **Done**.

8.  Add a linked reference condition column with the filters you've created applied by selecting **Add condition column** in the Reference input row.

9.  In the **Data to evaluate** section, select **Reference record**.

    A filtered input filters the list of records in linked condition column cells where the data to evaluate is **Reference record**. A filtered result column filters the list of records in the corresponding result column cells.

10. Select **Save**.


## Update an existing reference filter

Make changes to an existing filter on Reference type inputs or results in decision tables in Workflow Studio.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the homepage, select **Decision tables**.

3.  Select a decision table.

4.  Select the input or result to modify.

5.  Point to the result column header, and select the Edit column properties icon \(\[Omitted image "Pencil.png"\] Alt text: Edit column properties icon\).

6.  Select **Modify reference filter**.

7.  Make your changes and select **Done**.

8.  Select **Save**.


## Delete an input from a decision table

Delete inputs that are no longer necessary from your decision table in Workflow Studio. Deleting an input also deletes any related condition columns.

### Before you begin

Deleting an input from a decision table can break a flow, playbook, or script passing data through the input. Because of this possibility, you should know where the decision table is used before deleting anything from it.

Role required: admin, decision\_table\_admin, or delegated developer permissions. For more information, see Delegate developers using App Engine Studio.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the homepage, select **Decision tables**.

3.  Select a decision table.

4.  At the end of the input row, select the Input menu options icon \(\[Omitted image "ellipses.png"\] Alt text: Input menu options icon.\), and select **Delete**.

5.  Select **Save**.


## Modify a decision table condition column

Modify a condition column by renaming the label, editing the description, or updating the input type or default operator of your decision table in Workflow Studio.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin, decision\_table\_admin, or delegated developer permissions. For more information, see Delegate developers using App Engine Studio.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the homepage, select **Decision tables**.

3.  Select a decision table.

4.  Point to the condition column header and select the Edit column properties icon \(\[Omitted image "Pencil.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon.\).

5.  Make your changes and select **Done**.

    **Note:** If you have an input of the type *Choice*, and you switch the input type to any other type, that action deletes all values from the condition column.

6.  Select **Save**.


## Modify a decision table result column

Change the data that a decision evaluates by changing the source table for that decision table in Workflow Studio.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin, decision\_table\_admin, delegated developer permissions. For more information, see Delegate developers using App Engine Studio.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the homepage, select **Decision tables**.

3.  Select a decision table.

4.  Point to the results column header and select the Edit column properties icon \(\[Omitted image "Pencil.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon.\).

5.  Replace the existing result table with a different source table.

    **Note:** Changing the result table deletes the current decision table results values.

6.  Select **Done**.

7.  Select **Save**.
