# Check for conversational compatible subflows

Run a compatibility check on new or all subflows to determine if they are conversation compatible. Review the inputs of a subflow to determine if their data types are compatible.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   admin or flow\_designer
-   now.assist.creator

## About this task

You can only configure conversational settings for subflows that are marked as conversational compatible. Run a compatibility check to update the list of conversational compatible subflows. After you create or update a subflow, run a compatibility check to determine if you can make it conversational.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the homepage, select **Subflows**.

3.  Go to the **Conversational compatible** tab and select **Run compatibility check**.

    \[Omitted image "conv-compatible-subflows.png"\] Alt text: Screen showing the conversational compatible tab on the subflows page.

    By default, the system only checks new subflows that were created since the last compatibility check. If you want to check all subflows, select **Complete scan**. You can use a complete scan to verify that updated subflows remain conversationally compatible.

    The system runs a compatibility check in the background. The more subflows there are to check, the longer the compatibility check takes.


## Result

The system updates the list of conversational compatible subflows.

## What to do next

To make a subflow conversational, configure its conversational settings. See [Configure subflow conversational settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/configure-subflow-conversation-settings.md).
