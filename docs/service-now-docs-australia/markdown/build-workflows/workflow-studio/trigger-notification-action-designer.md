# Notification step

Trigger a notification as a step within an action by selecting a record \(such as an incident, change request, problem, or user record\) to trigger a notification and defining the associated notification.

[Notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/notifications.md) is a platform feature. Before triggering a notification as an action step in Workflow Studio, ensure that the notification is set up for use in the platform.

-   When you [Create an email notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_CreateANotification.md), set the **Send when** field in the **When to send** tab of the Notification form to Triggered.
-   Verify that your users have an active primary email channel and that all their notifications are active.

## Roles and availability

Available as an Workflow Studio action step. Users with the action\_designer role can create a custom action with one or more action steps.
