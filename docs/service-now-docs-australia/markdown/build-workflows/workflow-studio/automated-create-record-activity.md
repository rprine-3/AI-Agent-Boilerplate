# Automated Create Record activity

Create a record without pausing the playbook to ask for user input. When the activity runs, it immediately creates the record and continues to the next activity in the playbook. The record must meet server-side validation rules such as data policies, business rules and dictionary-defined mandatory fields but ignores UI policies.

## Roles and availability

-   This activity is available as a common activity. Users with the admin, playbook.admin, or pd\_author can add this activity to a playbook.

## Inputs

To learn more about the pill-picker, see [Dot-walking examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/dot-walking-examples.md).
