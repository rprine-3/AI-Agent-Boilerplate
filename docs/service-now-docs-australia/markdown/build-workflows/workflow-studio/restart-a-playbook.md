# Restart a playbook

Restart a playbook from the beginning, an activity, or a stage.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent or pd\_restarter

If your playbook admin has enabled restart in your playbook, you can find the restart action in the action menus of the playbook, stages, or activities. If you are an admin and would like to enable and configure restart for a playbook in Workflow Studio, see [Configure restart for Playbooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/workflow-studio/enable-define-restart.md).

If a stage or activity is not configured to be restartable, you will not see all of the buttons in this procedure.

**Note:** Certain activities within a playbook cannot be restarted once they have started. Playbooks in a Cancelled, Complete, or Error state also cannot be restarted. However, the opposite is true for activities and stages. Activities and stages must be complete or in an error state before they can be restarted.

## Procedure

1.  Restart playbook
2.  **Note:** Playbooks in a **Complete**, **Error**, or **Cancelled** state cannot be restarted.

    Open your playbook.

3.  To restart the whole playbook:

    1.  Hover over the playbook name in the contextual side panel to open the context menu\[Omitted image "icon-menu.png"\] Alt text: context menu.
