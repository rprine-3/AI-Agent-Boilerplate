# Exploring Workflow Studio

Work with playbooks, flows, subflows, actions, data streams, and decision tables from a single consolidated interface. See operational details of your workflow applications and configure integration connections and credentials.

    Use the integrations page to add, configure, or view available connections.

-   **12. Integration types**

    See a list of available and configured spokes and connections. Configure or create a spoke to integrate data. Use the connection card to configure a connection or review its details.


## Create button

\[Omitted image "workflow-studio-create-button-and-menu-options.png"\] Alt text: Create button and its available options

Beginning with the Xanadu release, you can create new workflow items from any Workflow Studio page rather than just the Homepage. Use the Create button on the tab header to display a list of available workflow components.

-   Playbook
-   Flow
-   Subflow
-   Action
-   Data Stream
-   Decision table

## Choosing between playbooks and flows

Flows, subflows, and actions are the basic building blocks of a process automation. Playbooks are built on flows, subflows, and actions, and come with a set of out-of-the-box activities driven by subflows that are already built. If you're trying to decide whether your automation should be a playbook rather than just a flow, start by determining if your flow needs user interaction.

-   If your process automation requires user interaction, does it need manual user interaction? Examples of manual user interactions are a user reading a knowledge base article, going through a checklist, and gathering feedback.
    -   If yes, use a playbook.
    -   If no, does your process automation have several user interactions? Examples of user interaction are changing record field values such as changing the incident state or adding task work notes.
        -   If yes, consider using a playbook for a better user experience.
        -   If no, use a flow. Flows use less data storage in your instance.
-   If your process automation doesn't require user interaction, is it a sequence of subflow calls?
    -   If yes, is it hard to manage or difficult to view the flow?
        -   If yes, consider using a playbook for a better user experience. Stages in playbooks are easier to view and also have additional configuration options.
        -   If no, use a flow. Flows use less data storage in your instance.
    -   If your process automation does not require any user interaction, keep it as a flow. Flows use less data storage in your instance.

**Note:** You can also use flows that trigger a playbook just for interactive steps.

If you're trying to determine if a playbook should be a flow instead, start by determining whether your playbook is triggered 10s, 100s, or even 1000s of times per second.

-   If your playbook is triggered 10s, 100s, or 1000s of times per second, are there any user interactions?
    -   If yes, do the user interactions happen during every single run?
        -   If yes, use a playbook. Playbooks offer visibility into where you're at in a process, particularly business processes with manual user steps.
        -   If no, create a flow that triggers a playbook for the user interactions.
    -   If no, use a flow. Flows use less data storage in your instance.
-   If your playbook is not triggered very often, keep it as a playbook. Playbooks offer visibility into where you're at in a process, particularly business processes with manual user steps.

You can reference decision tables in flows, subflows, actions, and playbooks. Data streams are not used in flows, subflows, actions, playbooks, or decision tables. To learn more about data streams, see .

## Differences from previous releases

Workflow Studio combines playbooks, flows, subflows, actions, decision tables, and Integration Hub integrations into a single builder application. Each of the prior workflow applications retain their functionality and their user interface to create and edit workflow objects. Workflow Studio introduces these changes.

-   **Access Workflow Studio from duplicate menu items**

    Workflow Studio uses the existing menu items for the separate workflow builder applications to open the corresponding workflow object type. For example, selecting the Process Automation Designer menu item opens the playbooks list from the Workflow Studio homepage.

-   **Configure integration connections**

    Workflow Studio enables you to configure integrations in the same user interface as you build integration components. For example, you can create a data stream action and also define its connection details.

-   **Create workflow components from any page**

    Beginning with the Xanadu release, Workflow Studio allows you to create a workflow component from any page rather than just the Homepage.

-   **Display each workflow type in a separate tab**

    Workflow Studio displays each workflow object type in its own tab. For example, playbooks open in a playbook tab and flows open in a flow tab.

-   **Edit different workflow types simultaneously**

    Workflow Studio combines all workflow object types into a single user interface. You can work on related workflow objects simultaneously rather than switch between separate workflow builder applications. For example you can create a flow that includes the Make a decision flow logic and also create the decision table used by that decision.

-   **Set application specific settings from the existing property pages**

    Workflow Studio relies on the existing system properties pages to add and configure setting for each workflow application. For example, open the flows properties page to configure the behavior of flows, subflows, and actions.

-   **View all available execution details**

    Workflow Studio contains execution details for all workflow object types. You no longer have to switch between applications to see execution details for a particular object type.
