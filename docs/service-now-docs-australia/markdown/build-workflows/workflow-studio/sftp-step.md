# SFTP step

Create a reusable action to manage files and directories on an SFTP server and to move files from one SFTP server to another.

**Note:**

-   This step requires an Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf). For more information about the ServiceNow® Integration Hub subscription packages, see Integration Hub usage and subscription. After the required plugin is activated, the step is visible under Integrations.
-   The SFTP step runs only on a ServiceNow® MID Server with SSH capabilities. Activate the plugin, Integration Hub in Workflow Data Fabric Professional \(com.glide.hub.integrations.professional\) to use the JDBC capability for the MID Server. For more information, see .
-   The SFTP step requires a credential record that supports either SSH private key credentials or SSH credentials. This step does not support Windows credentials where the **Use MID Server service account** option is selected.

## Roles and availability

The SFTP step is available as an Workflow Studio action step. Users with the action\_designer role can create a custom action with one or more action steps.

## Prerequisite

Activate the Managed File Transfer Extensions for the SFTP Step \(com.glide.hub.action\_step.sftp\_mft\) plugin.
