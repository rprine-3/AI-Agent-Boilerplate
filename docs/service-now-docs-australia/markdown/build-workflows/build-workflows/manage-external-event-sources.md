# Managing external event sources

Create and manage external event sources for a spoke or a scoped application that listen to events occurring in an application outside ServiceNow. Then, you can create external trigger definitions and associate them with the external event sources. When the event that you specify in the external trigger definition occurs, it starts one or more flows on your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: trigger\_designer \(Can create, read, update, or delete external event sources\) and trigger\_designer\_read \(can perform read-only operations on the external event sources that the trigger\_designer role creates.\)

Confirm that you have installed the External Trigger Builder plugin on your instance. External Trigger Builder v1.0.3 is the latest available version.

## About this task

An external event source is an end point on your ServiceNow instance which listens to a system or application outside of ServiceNow. After the application outside ServiceNow sends an event to the external event source, it enables a trigger definition to start one or more flows. For example, you define an external event source for an issue-tracking software that communicates with an external trigger definition that you have defined. The external trigger definition listens to the event source and starts a flow when a new issue is created in the issue-tracking software. Both the external event source and the trigger definitions are defined on your ServiceNow instance. An external trigger definition gives a set of conditions that tells your ServiceNow instance when to start a flow.

## Create an external event source

Create an external event source for a spoke or scoped application that listens to events occurring in an application or system outside ServiceNow. Based on the external event source, you can create an external trigger definition that receives communication from the external event source and starts a flow on your ServiceNow instance.

### Before you begin

Role required: trigger\_designer \(Can create, read, update, or delete external event sources\) and trigger\_designer\_read \(can perform read-only operations on the external event sources that the trigger\_designer role creates.\)

Confirm that you have installed the External Trigger Builder plugin on your instance.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Click the **Integrations** tab.

3.  Click the spoke.

    The **Spokes** tab is selected by default. If it isn’t selected already, confirm that you have selected it.

4.  On the left panel, click Event sources.

    \[Omitted image "external-event-source-event-src-menu.png"\] Alt text: Event sources menu.

5.  Click **Create event source**.

6.  In the Event Source name field, provide a unique name to the external event source.

7.  In the Description field, enter a description of the external event source.

    \[Omitted image "external-event-source-create-external-event-src-scrn.png"\] Alt text: Create external event source screen.

8.  Click **Create event source**.

    The external event source is created in the draft state.

9.  View the external event source in the draft state.

    1.  Select the spoke tab.

        \[Omitted image "external-event-src-view-draft.png"\] Alt text: Spoke tab is clicked.

    2.  Select the **Drafts** tab.

        The external event source that you created, appears.

        **Tip:** If the external event source doesn't appear, refresh the page, and then select the **Drafts** tab.

10. Under the Authentication heading, select the method to authenticate the webhook that the external application sends to your ServiceNow instance.

    The following authentication methods are available.

    -   Basic
    -   OAuth
    -   Hash
    -   Token
    If you choose the Hash or Token authentication method, then you must specify the information given in the table.

</table>11. Click **Publish**.

    The external event source is available for you to associate with an external trigger definition.

    \[Omitted image "external-event-src-published.png"\] Alt text: External event source published.

12. View the published external event source.

    1.  Select the spoke tab.

        \[Omitted image "external-event-src-view-pub-event.png"\] Alt text: Spoke tab selected.

    2.  Select the **Published** tab.

    The external event source that you published, appears.

    **Tip:** If the external event source doesn't appear, refresh the page and select the **Drafts** tab.


### What to do next
