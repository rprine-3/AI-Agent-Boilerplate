# Use a saved trigger

Instead of creating a trigger, use a saved trigger in your flow. Using a saved trigger enables you to reuse standardized trigger logic across flows, reducing the effort, improving consistency, and simplifying ongoing maintenance.

## Before you begin

Role required: flow-designer or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Under **Flows**, select the flow you want to edit, or create a flow.

    To create a flow, specify the flow properties and select **Build flow**.

3.  Under **TRIGGER**, select **Add a trigger**.

    If the flow already contains a trigger that you want to replace with a saved trigger, hover over the existing trigger and select the delete icon.

4.  From the **Trigger** list, under **INSTALLED APPLICATIONS**, select the application under which the trigger was created.

    For example, Global. Workflow Studio displays a list of triggers present in the selected application. Select the info icon to see more details about the trigger.

    \[Omitted image "saved-trigger-select.png"\] Alt text: Select a saved trigger under the installed applications.

5.  Select the trigger.

    The selected trigger is added to the flow.

6.  Depending on the trigger configurations, you can view the trigger properties and add additional conditions for the trigger.

    **Note:** Adding additional conditions affects only the flow, it doesn't alter the saved trigger.

    \[Omitted image "saved-trigger-properties.png"\] Alt text: View trigger properties and optionally add more conditions for the flow.

7.  Select **Done**.


## Result

The selected saved trigger is added to the flow and will start the flow depending on how the trigger is configured.
