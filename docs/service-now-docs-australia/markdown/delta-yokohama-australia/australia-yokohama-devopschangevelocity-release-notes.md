-   **Upgrade information**

If you are a new customer or are using a zBoot instance and you want to create type-based workflow change requests in DevOps Change Velocity, you must add the**com.snc.change\_management.change\_model.type\_compatibility** property and set it to True. For more information, see [Add a system property](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

If you are an upgrading customer, you must run the **ReConfigure Bitbucket Server Repositories for PullRequest** job to re-configure your existing Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center repositories so that pull request records can be imported. You can navigate to **All &gt; System Definition &gt; Scheduled Jobs** to search for this job and run it.
