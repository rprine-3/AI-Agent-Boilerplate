Write and edit text natively from within your mobile app using the Now Assist Context Menu. Refine your selected text by asking Now Assist to shorten it, make it more elaborate, or change the tone, and so on. Now Assist Context Menu is supported for the Task Summarization skill for input form screens.

-   **[Single instance login](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mobile-instances-admin-concept&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Customers with a single instance can bypass the instance selection page and navigate users directly to the login screen. This process shortens the login process.

-   **[Display a customized page before user login](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=branded-landing-page&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure your own branded landing page to appear before users log in to their ServiceNow mobile apps. The branded landing page can contain a login button or deep link that redirects users to an area of a ServiceNow mobile app. For example, a municipality can add a button to open a ticket, which navigates the user to complete a record in the Now Mobile® app.

This feature is available to customers using a single instance, and is supported for both Mobile Publishing apps.

-   **[Define attachment sources available to users](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=attachment-source-define&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Control the types of attachments used from a phone's gallery, camera, or file system. This capability confirms that images can’t be reused or are AI-generated images. This feature is supported for all attachment locations, including: activity stream, functions with type “attachment”, input form screen with field type “attachment”, Mobile App Bridge, and Cabrillo JS uploads.

-   **[Add annotations to uploaded images](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=image-annotation-adjust&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Edit and annotate uploaded images within ServiceNow mobile apps. Markup options include adding text, drawing, and highlighting areas. This feature is supported for all attachment locations, including: activity stream, functions with type “attachments”, input form screen with field type “attachment”, Mobile App Bridge, and Cabrillo JS uploads.

-   **[Mobile App Builder live mobile previews](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mab-record-example-panel&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

See your mobile content change in real-time with live previews for most mobile components. The mobile interface changes according to what component you have selected, and updates when you add, change, or remove UI-based elements.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Client-side localization](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=localization-client&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Mobile Custom Localization app, available from mobile client version 20.6, to let mobile users view app content in any language. This feature improves platform consistency and accessibility for global users. The ServiceNow Store app provides a collection of mobile strings that automatically populates the instance with translatable content required for localization. Once these strings are translated into a custom language, the mobile app automatically retrieves and displays them within the app interface.

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Mobile offline enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mobile-offline-mode&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the following enhancements added to the mobile offline capability:

    -   Use the seamless online-to-offline continuity, by enabling users to start a form online, save it, and then proceed offline. While offline, users can continue viewing and editing the same data, including attachments, comments, and navigation, for uninterrupted productivity in low or no-connectivity environments. All changes automatically sync after your connection is restored.
    -   Save or submit forms offline, and reopen them later while still offline with all data fully restored.
    -   Support of offline capabilities for descriptive elements in input forms.
    -   Support of offline capabilities for input actions in input forms.
    -   Improved outbox efficiency for input forms by continually combining saved and submitted data.
-   **[Dedicated mobile\_admin role for mobile configuration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mobile-admin-role&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Assign the new mobile\_admin role to administrators who configure mobile applications, granting them precisely the permissions needed to complete their tasks. This new role helps reduce reliance on the broader admin role for controlled, secure access of your ServiceNow® account.

-   **[Multiple users on a shared device](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=multi-user-single-instance&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable multiple users to securely log into a ServiceNow single account from shared mobile devices. This feature is beneficial in environments where devices are not personal, as it offers secure and personalized access through user-configured PINs, eliminating the need for repetitive full authentications.

**Note:** From the Australia version and above, the terms instance and instances have been renamed as account and accounts on mobile devices. Accounts are a reflection of platform instances on a mobile device and work in the same way, only the terminology has changed.

-   **[Configurable timing for PIN application timeout](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=pin-timeout&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure a new property to define the PIN timeout for different ServiceNow mobile apps. This configuration helps reinforce security by controlling how long users can remain inactive before being required to reenter their PIN.

-   **[Dynamic variable support in record screens](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=record-screen-script-type&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the script screen field in record screens to display dynamic field values. For example, you can display translated content for dynamic variables within an email.

-   **[Mobile AI Voice Agent](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mobile-voice-agent&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Speak with an AI-powered voice assistant on your mobile device for real-time support. Follow along with live conversation transcripts that can also be saved or shared after the call.

-   **[Push notifications for logged-out users](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sg-mobile-push-notifications&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure push notifications to be sent to users even when they’re logged out so critical updates aren't missed.

-   **[Mobile Voice Agent SDK support](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-mobile-sdk&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable Voice Agent in SDK-based mobile applications by configuring the External Applications section within the Voice Assistant configuration. Admins with an SDK app configured on the instance can select and save a custom app to activate Voice Agent for that SDK application.

-   **Premium chat for mobile Virtual Agent [\[Placeholder link text to key using-premium-chat\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-premium-chat&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Premium Chat opens a web-based chat experience within your mobile app, ensuring that every feature configured for the web is accessible on your mobile device.

</td><td>

-   **[Mobile App Builder](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mab-concept&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the following enhancements added to Mobile App Builder:

    -   Live component preview enables admins to view their mobile app changes in real-time.
    -   Use Mobile App Builder to transform your web forms into native mobile experiences with the guided flow when you create a new mobile record screen.
    -   The right-hand panel is now visible when a record is opened in a preview browser tab.
    -   Component recommendations available for additional record types.
    -   The card selection and preview screens in the Web to Mobile flow have been consolidated to create a more streamlined user experience. This allows for the ability to generate previews using the different card options and jump back and forth between them to review.

 -   **[Input form screen enhancement and changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=parameter-input-screen&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the following enhancements added to the input form screen:

    -   Selecting input values directly within the input form screen, either from a list or from a group of chips. Now users don’t need to navigate to a separate dedicated screen for value selection, when using the inline choice chips layout. You can also define the number of input values to display on an input form screen section.
    -   Ability to add images, plain text, and rich text within specific inputs. These added descriptive elements provide more context to your users and give a clearer idea of what is required for certain inputs. For example, an image can accompany a checklist to ensure that a piece of hardware is wired correctly.
    -   Provide users with the ability to perform actions in relation to the displayed input parameter, while working directly on an input form screen. The available actions are: navigate to another screen, add an attachment from the gallery or camera, and add a comment to a field. Users submit these added actions either when saving their progress or completing the input form screen.
    -   Save input form screen data before it's submitted. Users with access to the same record can see each other's changes either when saving their progress or completing the input form screen.
    -   Interact and switch between other navigation tabs while also working on the input form screen.
    -   Sections are no longer displayed if they don’t contain any input fields.
-   **[Additional number attributes for input form screens](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=parameter-screen-var-attr&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the following number attributes in your input form screens:

    -   Use the **CustomErrorMessage** attribute to specify an error message when a UI rule condition is met.
    -   Use the **SkipValidationWhenHidden** attribute to skip validation on hidden inputs.
-   **[Enable barcode scanning with an external scanner](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=enable-external-barcode-scanner&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure barcode scanning with an external scanner without denying access to the camera for the entire mobile app.

-   **[Mobile Publishing enhancements and changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mobile-publishing&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Enabled Android deep links for multiple instances.
    -   Enhanced validation for transparent images used in branded apps.
    -   Support for public-facing screens in branded mobile apps. Admins can configure URLs that link to public-facing web pages. These web pages are displayed to end users without needing to log in to the mobile app.
-   **[Turn off Zero Trust Access banners in mobile app screens](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=turn-off-zta-banner&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

In mobile client versions 19.4 and later, you can turn off Zero Trust Access banners on mobile screens. Turning off these banners can enhance usability of your mobile apps because the banner does not display each time the connection state changes so end users are not interrupted by the banner display. You can configure this behavior by setting the **disableZTABanner** mobile property on your ServiceNow instance.
