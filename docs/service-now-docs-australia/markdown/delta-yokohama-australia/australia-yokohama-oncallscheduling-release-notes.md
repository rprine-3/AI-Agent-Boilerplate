-   **Upgrade information**

Starting from the Zurich release, On-Call Scheduling uses subflows, not workflows. You must transition from workflows to subflows, because the workflows are considered as legacy workflows. For existing users in Zurich, your current workflows continue to be supported. However, for new users, the On-Call Scheduling plugin installations on Zurich and later instances only use subflows.

Maintain, build, and modify your own custom on-call scheduling flows in Workflow Studio with subflows for new instances. The following subflows are available for configuration:

    -   On-Call: Assign
    -   On-Call: Assign and Notify
    -   On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgment
    -   On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement per Rota
    -   On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement Voice
    -   On-Call: Check Assignment Response
    -   On-Call: Conference Call Escalation
    -   On-Call: Escalations by Email
    -   On-Call: Escalation By Email per Rota
    -   On-Call: Time-off approval

-   **[Add custom on-call notification channels](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=custom-on-call-channel-integration&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Increase the flexibility in communication by adding and configuring service providers as on-call notification channels. You must configure the communication channel by using the On-call communication channel configuration \[on\_call\_comunication\_channel\_config\] table. After you configure the channel, you can select the new channel. This feature is applicable only after the subflows are configured and used.

-   **[Customize the on-call notification message and keywords](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-oncall-communication-channel&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Customize an on-call notification message and response keywords that are sent to the user and user groups as per your preferences. You can customize the message and keywords by using the On-call communication channel configuration \[on\_call\_communication\_channel\_config\] tables.

-   **[Send the on-call escalation notifications when the configured record fields are modified](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-trigger-rule-oncall&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Send the on-call escalation notifications when the configured record fields are modified. On-call trigger rules have the following enhancements:

    -   Configure the changes to fields as a triggering condition to run trigger rules. For example, changes to the **Priority** field for an incident can be configured as a trigger condition.
    -   Configure the group or team level trigger rules, or you can configure the global trigger rules that aren’t associated with a user group.
    -   If the assignment group is auto-populated when an incident is created, you can still configure the on-call trigger rules to run and send the escalation notifications.

-   **[Monthly roster rotation for an on-call schedule](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-update-schedule-oncall&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify shift management by configuring a monthly roster rotation for an on-call schedule. This option is available only for the 2024 schedule engine.

-   **[Granular role for on-call schedule configurations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-assigning-oncall&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure on-call schedule features using the granular and specific role, sn\_on\_call\_admin. It contains sn\_trigger\_table\_cfg\_read and sn\_trigger\_table\_cfg\_write roles.

-   **[Email redirection behavior for links in major on-call schedule email notification](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-update-schedule-oncall&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

In all major on-call schedule or shift email notifications, you can now decide where the links to an on-call schedule or shift record are redirected. Instead of an on-call schedule or shift record automatically opening in the classic UI16 interface in On-Call Scheduling, the record can be opened in SOW. The on-call schedule or shift record link in an email notification opens in SOW only if the following conditions are met:

    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect**\) property is set to `true`.
    -   The **Redirect SOW Email notification for On-call scheduling** \(**sow\_email\_notification\_redirect.on\_call**\) property is set to `true`.
    -   You have the sn\_sow\_user role.
The ITSM Notifications Redirection \(com.snc.itsm.notifications\_redirection\) plugin is installed and activated automatically to support this behavior.

-   **Coral theme**

Coral is now the default theme for new portal, web, and mobile experiences with Next Experience or Core UI enabled. This theme provides a fresh look and feel, featuring brand-neutral illustrations to enhance your user experience. A dark theme option is available for web and mobile experiences.


 -   **[Performance improvements in subflows for on-call notifications](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=on-call-new-trigger-engine&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following performance enhancements are available for on-call notifications when subflows are used:

    -   On-call notifications are sent to multiple channels such as SMS or email simultaneously instead of sending it sequentially.
    -   When the **com.snc.on\_call\_rotation.new\_trigger\_engine** property is set to true, the on-call subflows are processed via the Flow runner queue. The on-call subflows that are marked as High priority are processed faster via a Flow runner queue especially when multiple events are triggered at the same time and are in the process queue.
    -   Reminder notifications are also sent to users when the instance is upgrading.
-   **[Enhanced on-call trigger rules to support subflows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=on-call-scheduling-subflows-overview&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The on-call trigger rules form is enhanced to trigger a subflow when the trigger rule is executed. You can enable and select a specific subflow for a trigger rule.
