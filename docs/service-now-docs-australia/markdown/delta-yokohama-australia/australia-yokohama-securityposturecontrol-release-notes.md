For a complete list of the applications that are required to implement Security Posture Control, see [Install Security Posture Control](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spc-install&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US). Starting with Zurich Patch 12, Now Assist for Vulnerability Response is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. The change is reflected in the name of ServiceNow® products, including Now Assist for Vulnerability Response which is called ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management.

Use generative AI to help your developers create SPC API connectors quickly with the Connector builder framework module in the Security Posture Control workspace. With a Now Assist skill that is included with the ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management application, your developers have the option to automate steps in the Connector builder framework.

    -   You have the option to automate the steps for selecting API templates, populating request and header parameters, and response field mapping with generative AI.

**Note:** You must install [Yokohama Patch 11](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=yokohama-patch-11&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) of the ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management application to have access to the generative AI skill for the Connector builder framework. See the [ServiceNow Otto for Security Incident Response \(SIR\) release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=secops-now-assist-security-operations-rn&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) and [Supporting information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=supporting-information-now-assist-vr&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

    -   Use your custom API connector to integrate with security tools and import asset data that is based on the unique requirements of your environment.

-   Security Posture Control relies on data from service graph connectors that is populated in the CMDB 360 Data \[cmdb\_multisource\_data\] table. This data is populated only when the glide.identification\_engine.multisource\_enabled system property is set to true. You must have the cmdb\_ms\_admin role to modify property values. To set the property, navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CMDB 360 Properties**.
-   The labels on the form view for the mitigation control details record associated with vulnerable item records \(VITs\) have been enhanced for more clarity. These updates make the interface more user-friendly by expanding abbreviations on the form view, such as changing "EDR" to "Endpoint Protection."

 -   **Coral theme**

Coral is now the default theme for new portal, web, and mobile experiences with Next Experience or Core UI enabled. This theme provides a fresh look and feel, featuring brand-neutral illustrations to enhance your user experience. A dark theme option is available for web and mobile experiences.
