-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Yokohama Patch 5, Now Assist usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: Now Assist Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).

-   **[Some Now Assist skills are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill is turned on automatically \(the skill was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[Configure ACLs for AI agents and agentic workflows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=aia-security-implementation&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure the access control lists for who can discover and trigger AI agents and agentic workflows in their guided setups in AI Agent Studio. You can determine whether an AI agent or agentic workflow behaves as a dynamic user or as an AI user. You can also specify if an AI agent or agentic workflow can be available to all authenticated users or publicly available.
