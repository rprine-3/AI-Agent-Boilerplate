# Combined Predictive Intelligence release notes for upgrades from Yokohama to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Predictive Intelligence from Yokohama to Australia. Predictive Intelligence was previously called Agent Intelligence.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Predictive Intelligence release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Yokohama to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Predictive Intelligence to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

-   **[Model Explainability](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-explainability&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Learn which classes contribute most to your model's predictions by optionally adding Model Explainability to Workflow Classification solutions. Model Explainability provides a new tab labeled **Feature Importance** where you can run an analysis of each class's contribution to the overall prediction.

-   **[Leverage new advanced options for classification solutions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-advanced-settings-ml-solutions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US), from Yokohama Patch 4.**
    -   [Configure include only top N labels](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-only-top-n-labels&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Limit the classification model to use only the top most frequent labels. You can choose a number as the limit.
    -   [Minimum records needed for label to include it](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-minimum-records-needed-label&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Set a threshold for the minimum number of records a label must have in your dataset to be included in model training.
    -   [Remove others label](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-remove-others-label&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Reduce noise in the model and enhance predictive accuracy by removing records with the label "others" from training data.
    -   [Use LightGBM algo for classification model training](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-lightgbm-algo&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Enable the LightGBM \(Light Gradient-Boosting Machine\) algorithm for training classification models.
    -   [Config parameters for model config in classification](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=predictive-intel-config-parameters-classification&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Customize training behavior by including a dictionary of parameters in the JSON format.
