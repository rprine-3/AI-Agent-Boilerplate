The Service Operations Workspace list page has the following enhancements:

    -   Ability to assign the incident record to yourself if you’re the logged-in user or to reassign it to another user or assignment group.
    -   An animated dot symbol that indicates whether a list has been customized.
-   **[Major incident management record page enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=communicating-with-stakeholders-sow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhance incident and major incident-related communications including ad hoc communications and major incident playbooks in SOW by adding DEX Desktop Assistant as a channel.

-   **[Direct approvals in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-approvals-sow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Service desk agent can approve records directly within the SOW without having to navigate to the Core UI. By approving records from the SOW, you can reduce response times, and ensure quick resolution of the tasks.

-   **[Automatically close an interaction in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=automatically-close-interaction-sow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Interactions are now automatically closed when the associated incident is resolved, streamlining the workflow and ensuring consistent status updates.

-   **[Enhanced side panel features](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=get-field-recommendations&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

    -   Access the Recommended Actions and AI Search features from the contextual side panel for request items and catalog tasks.
    -   Determine the order of the items in the contextual side panel.
The Recommended Actions and AI Search features are now available in the contextual side panel for both request Items and catalog tasks.

-   **[Enable email redirection to SOW from SOW Admin Center](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-admin-console-sow-itsm&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Stay within the SOW and work on your tasks more efficiently by enabling email redirection. By enabling email redirection within the SOW Admin Center, you can simplify communication management, enabling the users to stay within the SOW and focus on their tasks without interruption.

-   **[Initiate a chat from Sidebar in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=initate-sidebar-chat-sow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use Slack as a primary mode of communication from the Sidebar so you can send direct messages to users without having to leave the SOW.

-   **[View the device health of user assets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=work-on-interaction-sow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

DEX is integrated with SOW to monitor CIs or assets associated with SOW records such as incidents and interactions to determine the health of devices. You can view the device health information of the user's assets on the Record information side panel of the incident and interactions record page. This feature is available only if the DEX plugin \[sn\_dex\] is installed and DEX monitoring is enabled for the asset.

-   **[Using MRA Async for adding child incident, affected CIs, impacted services and assets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-update-inc-overview-tab&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

When adding a list containing more than 50 child incidents, affected CIs, impacted services or assets from the **Overview** tab or **Related records** tab of an incident or problem record, the Multiple Record Associator \(MRA\) component batch processes in async and helps adding them in background thereby increasing the overall performance of the system. This feature works only if the number of items to be added is more than 50 as the **async Threshold** configuration property is set to 50.

-   **[Viewing the device health of the user assets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=work-on-interaction-sow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

View the device health information of the user's assets from the Assigned assets section on the Record information side panel of the incident and interactions record page. This helps in providing a quick resolution to the user. This feature is available only if the DEX plugin \[sn\_dex\] is installed and DEX monitoring is enabled for the asset.

-   **[Guided tours for SOW](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=play-guided-tour-sow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Learn about Service Operations Workspace for ITSM through a sequence of interactive steps that guide you through a specific concept or process.

The SOW record page has the following enhancements:

    -   Add a clickable URL to the Summary section on the **Overview** tab of an incident record, enhancing navigation and reference capabilities. The Overview page supports URL type of field in read-only mode.
    -   Perform various DEX actions on a CI using actions from the Action library in the contextual side panel of the SOW record page.
    -   Manage user actions on the reference fields of a SOW record page with the following glide list actions:
        -   Add me - Add the logged in user to the field.
        -   Remove me - Remove the logged in user from the field.
        -   Add multiple users - Add multiple users to the field.
        -   Add multiple records - Add multiple records to the field.
-   **[View recent tasks in a knowledge article record](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=work-knowledge-article&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Introduction of Granular Admin roles in SOW](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-in-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following granular admin roles are introduced in SOW:

    -   sn\_sow\_admin.sn\_sow\_admin: Provides access to SOW Admin Center page for SOW configurations. Admins can use the role to configure SOW features and maintain organizational policies.

-   **[View conflicts in the change request form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-change-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The improved schedule and conflicts section added in the change request form displays the scheduling conflicts for a change request. If a scheduling conflict exists, conflict detection also provides details of any related blackout or maintenance schedules and other active change requests to determine the scheduling conflict. You can use the resulting information to review and modify the change request details to eliminate conflicts. You can also manually check and manage conflicts.

</td><td>

-   **[Incident record page changes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-inc-record-info-contextual-sidepanel&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The Incident record page has the following changes:

    -   The caller card is placed first on the Record information side panel for tier 1 agents.
    -   The origin card itself is no longer clickable to reduce usability issues with the card and its clickable elements.
-   **[Reference field behavior changes in SOW](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-update-inc-overview-tab&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Selecting any reference field in SOW now displays only the recent selection values instead of automatic searching and displaying the results of the field values available in the system. This change increases the overall performance of the reference fields. By default, this change is enabled. To revert this change, set the **Reference search on click** \(**ref\_search\_on\_click**\) UX page property to set to `true`.

-   **[Viewing Assign to me option](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=users-sow-itsm&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The list page in SOW has the following enhancements:

    -   The related lists in the **Related records** tab of the SOW record pages, including those within the record pages as well such as Recent Incidents or Assigned Assets, are updated with the record list bundle. This update provides them with the same appearance, functionality, and user experience as the SOW list page.
    -   The related lists in the **Related records** tab of the SOW record pages, including the Multi Record Associator \(MRA\) list, as well as the related lists within the record pages such as Recent Incidents or Assigned Assets, now support the fuzzy count UX page property. You can configure a default value that is applicable to the list for all tables or a value for a specific table such as incident thereby improving the list page performance.
-   **[Dependency view changes for reference fields](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-update-inc-overview-tab&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Selecting the dependency view for the following fields in the incident, problem, change, and request records, opens a unified CMDB map in a new tab within the workspace view instead of a new browser tab:

    -   Configuration item
    -   Service
    -   Service offering
-   **[Propose a standard change template](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=propose-standard-change-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **Accessibility information**
    -   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [\[Placeholder link text to key bundle-platux.auto-reflow\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
