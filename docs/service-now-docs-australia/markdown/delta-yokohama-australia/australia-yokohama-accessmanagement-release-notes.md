</td><td>

-   **[Security data filters](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=security-data-filters&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Security data Filters enable you to control who can access sensitive data by restricting access to authorized users, regardless of how the data is accessed. Security data filters are applied before query execution, ensuring restricted data never leaves the database and prevents data leakage at the query level. Filters integrate into queries for GlideRecordSecure, GlideRecordSandbox, and GlideAggregateSandbox by default.

-   **[Related record access](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=related-record-access&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Related record access integrated into the ACL framework enhances access management by enabling administrators to enforce specific ACLs for related tables. This ensures users can only access records in related tables, such as costs, estimations, or tasks, based on their permissions for the parent table, like projects or cases. Combined with broader ACL capabilities, Related record access ensures consistent, granular, and enforceable


</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Machine identity access controls](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=machine-identity-access-controls&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enforce fine-grained access to data via REST or SOAP endpoints using Machine Identity Access Controls. This feature enables you to define which integrations can access specific data, confirming that the integrations only have access to the resources they need.

-   **[Scripting Governance Tool](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=scripting-governance&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) tool and role**

Review and help reduce the number of users with scripting privileges using the Scripting Governance Tool. This tool helps improve platform security with scripting governance based on user role.

A new deny-by-default behavior is enforced for scripting unless you have the snc\_required\_script\_writer\_permission role. After an upgrade or zBoot, this role is automatically assigned via the Conditional Script Writer group.

-   **[Datatype ACL](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=datatype-acl&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify and help reduce redundant ACL definitions with Datatype ACLs. Create a single ACL to target all table columns of a specific data type, streamlining access control configurations.

-   **[Query ACLs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=query-acl-rule&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Query ACLs now load automatically during plugin installation for most platform plugins. These preconfigured ACLs reduce the need to run the QueryRangeACLAuditor tool to generate query ACLs. Store app query ACLs aren't included in preconfigured query ACLs. For more information about preconfigured query ACLs, see the [Maintenance Information \[KB2046494\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2046494) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.Existing custom query ACLs are preserved and loaded as inactive. To view inactive ACLs, use this command: `<INSTANCE_URL>/sys_security_acl_list.do?[query_parameters]`QueryRangeACLAuditor tool modifications are preserved.

-   **[ACL types](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acl-rule-types&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Core field and datatype ACLs are replaced with more comprehensive rules to optimize ACL volume.

-   Security Data Filters are a powerful new feature designed to restrict access to sensitive records based on roles or security attributes. This ensures only authorized users can view data, regardless of how the data is accessed.
-   Related Record Access allows enforcement of consistent access rules across related tables, ensuring that users only see records associated with the data they are authorized to access.

 See [Access Control List Rules](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=access-control-rules&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

-   Enforce access to data via REST or SOAP endpoints using the Machine Identity Access Controls, which helps improve security, governance, and auditability.
-   Target all table columns of a given data type with a single ACL using Datatype ACLs.
-   Govern scripting permissions with the Scripting Governance tool, a new base system deny-by-default behavior.

Early Availability

-   Use ServiceNow® Access Analyzer v6.1, a self-service tool designed for AI administrators or creators to validate the access controls configured within agentic assets \(agentic workflows and AI agents\).
-   Use new preconfigured query ACLs for most platform plugins, as part of ongoing security risk mitigation. These base system ACLs significantly reduce the need to run the QueryRangeACLAuditor tool.
-   Use Access Findings, the proactive detection and remediation layer within Access Management Console, to run eight base system access checks against your instance on a daily schedule. This surfaces prioritized findings when misconfigurations are detected, and provides a complete remediation workflow including AI-powered guidance.

 See [Access Control Lists \(ACLs\)](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=access-control-rules&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.
