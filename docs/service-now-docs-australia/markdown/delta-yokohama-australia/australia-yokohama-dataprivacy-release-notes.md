# Combined Data Privacy release notes for upgrades from Yokohama to Australia

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Data Privacy release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Yokohama to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

-   Use the [improved anonymization dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dps-data-privacy-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) to get more details about anonymization. For example, what data was anonymized and how \(real-time or through anonymization jobs\).
-   Use the new [real-time protection module](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=real-time-protection&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) to configure real-time alerting and your blocking policies. You can also view real-time sensitive data logs.

 -   **New experience**
    -   [Optional condition filter](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dps-create-anonymization-job&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) when running anonymization jobs to fine tune the scope of data to be anonymized.
    -   [Specific anonymization policy](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dps-create-anonymization-policies&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) for catalog variables to anonymize sensitive data in catalog requests.

 -   **Key word matching**

As part of key word matching when discovering sensitive data using regex, more precise data pattern matching has been implemented, using full strings of text. This may require customers to add more specific variants of keywords to achieve the same level of discovery precision as prior platform releases
