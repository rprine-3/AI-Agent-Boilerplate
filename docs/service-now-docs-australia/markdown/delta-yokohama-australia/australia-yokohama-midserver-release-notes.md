-   **Upgrade information**

For the latest MID Server system requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). The minimum JRE version supported is 17.0.10 and the recommended version is 17.0.12.

If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to verify that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

    -   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
    -   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.
All MID Server host machines require access to the download site at `install.service-now.com` to enable auto-upgrades. For additional details, read how the system manages [MID Server upgrades](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

Only one Windows MID Server service is permitted according to the executable path. Upgraded Windows MID Servers that have multiple services pointing to the same installation folder can’t start. See [MID Server fails to start](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-startup-fails&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

For more information about MID Server upgrades, see the following topics:

    -   [MID Server pre-upgrade check](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US): Describes how the AutoUpgrade monitor tests the ability of the MID Server to upgrade on your system before the actual upgrade.

The ITOM Infra Services Workspace provides a concise overview of MID Server activity. The dashboard integrates several previously disparate tables so that issues can be monitored and resolved. The workspace provides real-time monitoring, proactive alerts, automation of common tasks, and centralized diagnostics to reduce downtime and support tickets.

-   **[MID Guardian Agent](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-guardian&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The MID Guardian Agent is an advanced AI feature within the MID Server ecosystem/ITOM Infra Services workspace, designed to proactively assist users in diagnosing and resolving issues related to configuration, connectivity, upgrades, and operations. By intelligently analyzing logs, signals, and runtime behaviors, it offers guided troubleshooting steps, automated fixes, and predictive insights. This significantly reduces Mean Time to Repair \(MTTR\) and enhances the reliability and operational efficiency of the MID server.
