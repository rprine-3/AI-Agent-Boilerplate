-   Review network traffic-based alert grouping, which uses discovered TCP connections together with ML Service Mapping to correlate alerts on host CIs that have network traffic connections between them. This approach reduces noise, enhances visibility, and accelerates response times by focusing on critical connections and dependencies.
-   Starting in version 26.3.4, benefit from the new alert grouping based on network traffic correlations:
    -   Investigate network traffic-based alert groups by using Express List®.
    -   Review alert group analysis by Now Assist
    -   View connections between network traffic-based alerts in **Link View**.
-   Enable team-level operators to create and manage their own integrations, set up their own alert automations, and enhancing control over alert management for their teams by assigning the new team\_operator role.
-   Review relevant information in the Now Assist panel based on records selected in the Express List®.
-   Starting in version 2.15.1, you can configure metric connector instances for the [Nagios](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-nagios-metrics-connector&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US), [SolarWinds](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-solarwinds-connector&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US), and [Zabbix](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-zabbix-metrics-connector&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) monitoring tools to receive metrics directly from these monitoring tools. This enhancement provides the following benefits:
    -   Seamlessly integrate monitoring data from multiple sources into Metric Intelligence.
    -   Improve anomaly detection and alerting with real-time metric ingestion.
