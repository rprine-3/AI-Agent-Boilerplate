# Combined Platform Analytics experience release notes for upgrades from Yokohama to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Platform Analytics experience from Yokohama to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Platform Analytics experience release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Yokohama to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Platform Analytics experience to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

If you had previously migrated your analytics assets to Platform Analytics, assets that were in compatibility mode but are newly supported in Yokohama are migrated automatically.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

On upgrade, any homepages on your instance that have been opened are migrated to Core UI dashboards, which are visible in the dashboard library. For more information, see [Homepage deprecation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=homepage-deprecation-help-tool&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

Simple lists are all converted to the new List element on upgrade.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

When upgrading, all Core UI reports and dashboards are identified as such in the library under the **UI version** column. Users can edit these legacy artifacts in the Report Builder and Dashboard Builder applications.

**Note:** Users who have not migrated their instances to Platform Analytics experience have the option to create dashboards and data visualizations in either Core UI or Next Experience. Next Experience is recommended.

All Core UI public reports are unpublished after upgrading. Report administrators can make these reports available to logged-in users.

After upgrading, the Analytics Hub isn't available. Links to the Analytics Hub are redirected to KPI Details.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Generate data visualizations conversationally](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=analytics-assist-landing-page&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate Platform Analytics artifacts from conversational interactions using Analytics Generation. Analytics Generation is part of the ServiceNow Otto for Creator application.

-   **[Implement filters in groups](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-filter-group&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create filter groups with shared apply, clear, and reset buttons. Filters in a group appear in their own container. Grouping filters reduces the number of calls and improves performance compared to cascading filters for big data use cases.

-   **[Apply multiple levels of breakdown to an indicator](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=multi-level-breakdowns&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Migrate indicators from traditional Performance Analytics architecture to change data capture \(CDC\)-based data snapshots. This new architecture allows for more than two levels of breakdown to apply to an indicator. RaptorDB Professional is required, and not all indicators qualify for migration.

-   **[Show the distribution of data in box plot data visualizations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-dv-box-plot&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Show the median and lower and upper quartiles of numeric data along with outliers by using box plots. You can also compare the distribution of different groups of this data.

-   **[Target suggestion cards](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=proactive-analytics&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Be notified of missing target values and review dates for indicators. If you have target Insights active for your dashboard, Target suggestion cards alert you to the missing values and provide an easy way to fix them.

Take advantage of the improved list capabilities of the List element, which replaces List - Simple. The List supports pagination, export from dashboards, export to comma-separated values, and alternative group by. It also provides a consistent configuration experience with other data visualizations.

-   **[Create indicators and migrate to data snapshots in the indicator library](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=your-kpis&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Manage indicators from the indicator library, including links to create and edit indicators.
    -   Activate data snapshots conveniently, opening up the possibilities of applying multiple levels of breakdown to your indicators. See statistics on recent views and updates in tiles.
    -   If data snapshots are activated for the instance, see how many indicators are eligible and have already had data snapshots enabled.
    -   Show columns for any field on indicator records, as well as usage information.
-   **[Drill down to application overviews for Usage Insights](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=visualization-drilldown-in-config-ws&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Navigate to individual application overviews for Usage Insights from data visualizations. The **Go to data view** chart interaction is now supported for Usage Insights data and takes the viewer to these overview pages by default.

Filter Usage Insights data on default and custom Usage Insights properties.

As an analytics manager, view usage statistics in the data visualization library. Those statistics include the number of reports, data visualizations that aren't used in any dashboards, and the number of data visualizations not viewed for more than six months.

-   **[Get recommendations to review problematic analytics resources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=pa-library-recommendations&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

As an analytics manager, view recommendations for which artifacts you should fix or delete in the Dashboard, Data Visualization, and Indicator libraries.

-   **[Executive dashboards](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=executive-dashboard-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Business calendars are a **Trend by** option for table data sources on time series visualizations. \(Core UI feature gap\)

-   **[Use a Fiscal calendar in date filters](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-date-filter-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If your instance has Fiscal calendars installed, you can choose relative data ranges from that calendar.

-   **Export [dashboards](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=export-pae-dashboard-ppt&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) and [data visualizations](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=export-visualization-vd&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) to PDF and PPT**

Export dashboards and data visualizations to PDF or Microsoft PowerPoint files at will or in [scheduled emails](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=schedule-export-dboards-data-viz&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Show breakdown elements separately on time series visualizations of indicators](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-dv-time-series-ind-data&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Show multiple elements in the chart separately rather than as an aggregate value by turning on the **Show filter as separate series** option. \(Core UI feature gap\)

-   **[Lock editing on dashboards](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=edit-db-in-ac&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Ensure that only one person can have a dashboard open for editing at one time through the edit lock on dashboards. If you are locked out of editing a dashboard, you see who the current editor is.
