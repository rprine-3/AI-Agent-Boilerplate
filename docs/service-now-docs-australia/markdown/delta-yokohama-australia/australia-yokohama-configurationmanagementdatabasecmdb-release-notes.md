# Combined Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) release notes for upgrades from Yokohama to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) from Yokohama to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Yokohama to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

Three new indexes \(parent, type\), \(child, type\), and \(child, parent, type, port\) are added to the CI Relationship \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\] table to improve the performance of Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) querying this table. This change is likely to increase upgrade time. For more information about the impact of this change during upgrade and to learn how to minimize that impact, see [Increased Yokohama Upgrade Time due to cmdb\_rel\_ci index additions \[KB1703367\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB1703367).


</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

Due to the removal of the **Design** value for the operational status attribute in a CI, after an upgrade, you must review all CIs that have the discovery source attribute set to **Manual via IRE**. Review the operational status attribute of those CIs and set it to a supported value in CMDB for your environment. For example, you can set the attribute to **Non-Operational**. For more information about the operational status values, see [Tangible/physical life cycle](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=csdm-lifecycle-hardware&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

On an upgraded Zurich instance, to configure the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with the necessary permissions to perform some CMDB Workspace tasks, you must manually run the scheduled job **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles**. This scheduled job modifies the user roles as follows:

    -   Updates the itil user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role, and updates the itil\_admin user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
    -   If those permissions don't exist, updates the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with create, update, and delete access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class. For more information about the **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles** scheduled job, see [Remove sn\_cmdb\_admin from itil\_admin and sn\_cmdb\_editor from itil, and then add create/update/delete access to cmdb\_ci table for sn\_cmdb\_admin / sn\_cmdb\_editor \[KB2290506\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB2290506).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **Upgrade information**

Due to changes in the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] table, if you're upgrading to Australia, you might experience an increased upgrade time. To learn more about this change and reducing its impact, see the [Increased Australia Upgrade Time due to cmdb\_ci composite index addition \[KB2588894\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2588894) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

If you're upgrading from Xanadu or Yokohama directly to the Australia release, you must run the **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles** scheduled job to correctly configure some user roles, such as CMDB Admin and CMDB Editor. For more information about this scheduled job and its use, see the [CMDB Zurich release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-rn&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform®. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. Refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) for additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings. For more information about granular read-only security options, see [Configuring read-only security options](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=read-only-option&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[CMDB Workspace v7.6](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US):**
    -   Access a centralized location with a comprehensive view of CI details by using the new CI form in CMDB Workspace. The form shows the attributes \(key attributes are highlighted on a Summary page\), tags, resources, activities, relationships, related services, health state, performance indicators, and CMDB 360 data that is associated with the CI. While viewing, you can also modify many of those CI details. For information about all the details on a CI form, see [Manage CI details in CI Form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ci-form-cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   Access the Data Certification dashboard in CMDB Workspace. The Data Certification dashboard provides the insights about the data certification activities and progress, policies and tasks, reports about certification instances, charts that show the aging certification tasks, and group and individual workloads. For more information, see [Data Certification Dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-cert-dashboard-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).
    -   [Manage a shared preset](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=unified-map-manage-shared-preset&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Save Unified Map filter settings as shared presets that any user on the team can access. This task requires the sn\_cmdb\_admin, sm\_admin, or admin role.
    -   [Access Unified Map from the main navigation panel](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace-unified-map&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). Access Unified Map from the main navigation panel by navigating to **All** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **Unified Map**.
    -   Archival and destroy processes of certification policy related records, are now separated from those processes for records of all other policy types. This separation facilitates the extension of the retention period of certification policy records, as follows:
        -   The table cleanup rule for table CMDB Data Management Policy Executions \[cmdb\_data\_management\_policy\_execution\], which is stored in the Auto Flushes \[sys\_auto\_flush\] table, now excludes certification policy execution records from recurring cleanups.

Retaining certification policy execution records instead of deleting them after 7 days is useful in situations where those records are needed for audits and are also useful for the Data Certification Dashboard, which is populated by these records.

        -   The Archive CMDB Data Management Tasks archive rule, that applied to all CMDB Data Manager policy execution records, now excludes certification policy records. At each archive run, this archive rule is configured to also automatically archive its related records in table CMDB Data Management Certification Task To Document \[sn\_cmdb\_ws\_dm\_certification\_task\_to\_document\] \(Archive Related Records\).
        -   The archive rule, Archive Certification Instances, is added to specifically archive certification policy execution records from the CMDB Data Management Policy Execution \[cmdb\_data\_management\_policy\_execution\] table. This new archive rule is configured to archive certification policy execution records 2 years after creation, and to destroy those records 7 years after they are archived.
        -   The archive rule, Archive Certification tasks, is added to specifically archive certification task records from the CMDB Data Management Task \[cmdb\_data\_management\_task table\].
        -   The archival of related records in table CMDB Data Management Certification Task To Document \[sn\_cmdb\_ws\_dm\_certification\_task\_to\_document\] is now moved as an Archive Related Records entry from the Archive CMDB Data Management Tasks archive rule to the new Archive Certification tasks archive rule.

-   **[Access changes for the sn\_cmdb\_editor and sn\_cmdb\_admin user roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Starting with Yokohama Patch 4 \(zbooted or upgraded\), access has been reduced for the sn\_cmdb\_editor \(CMDB Editor\) and the sn\_cmdb\_admin \(CMDB Admin\) user roles which are used in [CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US). The sn\_cmdb\_editor and sn\_cmdb\_admin user roles no longer have create, update, or delete access to records in the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class.
    -   Starting with Yokohama Patch 6 \(zbooted or upgraded\), you must manually run the scheduled job '**Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles** to configure the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with the permissions that are necessary for performing some CMDB Workspace tasks.

This scheduled job modifies user roles as follows:

        -   Updates the itil user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role, and updates the itil\_admin user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
        -   If those permissions don't exist, updates the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with create, update, and delete access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class. For more information about the 'Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles' scheduled job, see [Remove sn\_cmdb\_admin from itil\_admin and sn\_cmdb\_editor from itil, and then add create/update/delete access to cmdb\_ci table for sn\_cmdb\_admin / sn\_cmdb\_editor \[KB2290506\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB2290506).

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[CMDB Workspace v7.6](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   On the Published policy tile on the Data Manager policies page, the policies list view now shows the scheduled job that is associated with the policy and the user that the policy runs as.

For more information, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   Instead of the system automatically setting the **run as** attribute of the scheduled certification and attestation jobs to be the user that authored the policy, you can now set a specific user that adheres to the policies and regulations in the organization. Configure the default values for the run as user and user accounts available for run as assignees for auditing purposes when it’s important to know who initiated the changes.

For more information, see [Components related to CMDB Data Manager](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=components-cmdb-data-manager&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   For certification and attestation policy tasks, choose how to assign tasks in cases where a specified task assignment field is empty for a target CI. Specify a user or a user group to assign such tasks to, or create the tasks without assigning them. An administrator can later review and assign those tasks.

For more information, see [Create a CMDB Data Manager policy](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-manager-create-policy-wrkspc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   View the closed tasks in the My Work view in CMDB Workspace. Select the Closed card in the Task status tile to review the \(in read-only mode\) details for tasks that are in the Closed Complete, Closed Canceled, Closed Incomplete, or Rejected state.

For more information, see [My Work view in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=cmdb-workspace-govern-view&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   New CIs in the Create CI experience no longer have their **Operational status** attribute set. The new **CI Operational state** attribute appears on the Additional attributes page of the Create CI experience. Setting it to any value is optional.

For more information, see [Create a CI manually in CMDB Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-ci-manual-cmdb-workspace&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

    -   The itil user role now contains the sn\_cmdb\_user user role and no longer contains the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role. As a result, the following functions that were accessible to itil users now require the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role:
        -   Create and delete the operations that are related to CMDB 360 queries.
        -   Access the CMDB Retirement Definitions module by navigating to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CMDB Retirement Definitions**.
        -   Access the Create CI quick link on the Home view of CMDB Workspace.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Elevated user roles are no longer required for CMDB tasks](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-cmdb&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Access to CMDB tables is no longer restricted to users with elevated privileges. Instead, for improved security, users with access privileges that are trimmed to CMDB features can complete any administrative or end-user CMDB task:

    -   CMDB tables that required the admin or itil\_admin roles are now also accessible to the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
    -   CMDB tables that required the itil role are now also accessible to the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role.
-   **[Automatically generate de-duplication tasks for lookup and related tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=id-detect-dup-ci&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure IRE to automatically generate de-duplication tasks for specific lookup or related tables during the identification process. You can then process those de-duplication tasks to remediate any duplications.

-   **[Remediate duplicate related items in lookup tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=id-detect-dup-ci&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure IRE to create de-duplication tasks for duplicate related items in a lookup table, detected during a lookup-based identification. Sort which duplicates do or don't require remediation by configuring the system property **glide.identification\_engine.lookup\_match.create\_duplicate\_task\_ci.enabled**. For more information, see [Detecting duplicate CIs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=id-detect-dup-ci&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Domain separation for key CMDB tables](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_DomainSeparationSetup&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following tables now support domain separation on instances which are configured with domain separation:

    -   Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\]
    -   Printer Instance \[cmdb\_print\_queue\_instance\]
    -   Software Instance \[cmdb\_software\_instance\]
    -   Client Access \[samp\_client\_access\]
    -   Oracle Options \[samp\_oracle\_options\]
Domain separation can help protect sensitive information by supporting domain-specific data segregation.

For more information about domain separation and how to activate it, see [Setup and administration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_DomainSeparationSetup&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Execution modes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=query-builder-engine-execution-mode&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The CMDB Query Builder expanded its support for various types of query structures that can run in V2 engine mode. Also, the performance of running queries in V2 mode is improved. Query structures that aren't supported include related list conditions, NOT operators combined with filters, certain Service Mapping relationships, and OR operators unless explicitly enabled by the **glide.cmdb.query.or\_execution\_mode** system property.

-   **Accessibility information**
    -   **Accessibility improvements**

Accessibility improvements were completed to create a configurable workspace that supports Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1 Level AA conformance.

    -   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to the monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [Reflow for Configurable Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US) for the details.

-   Access changes to the CMDB Editor and CMDB Admin user roles:
    -   Starting with Yokohama Patch 4, the sn\_cmdb\_editor and sn\_cmdb\_admin user roles no longer have create, update, or delete access to records in the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class.
    -   Starting with Yokohama Patch 6, you can configure the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with the necessary permissions to perform some CMDB Workspace tasks by manually running a scheduled job.
-   Manually create a configuration item \(CI\) in CMDB Workspace that is verified by the Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) and is unique within CMDB. Creating a CI using the IRE identification rules helps to maintain the integrity of CMDB.
-   Use the ServiceNow Otto for CMDB CI summarization skill to see a comprehensive summary for a CI, with details such as discovery and related incidents, directly on the configuration item \(CI\) form. Use the manage duplicate CIs skill for step-by-step guidance on how to use de-duplication templates to de-duplicate CIs.
-   The Configuration item summarizer AI agent accepts the sys\_id of a CI and returns a full summary of Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) data for the CI. The agent isn’t typically used as a standalone agent and any use case can access it.
-   View the various counts, such as the number of CIs and the number of CI types, for the CIs that are connected to the home node in Unified Map.
-   Apply filters that were previously available only to the coverage charts in the CMDB 360 dashboard in CMDB Workspace to all charts in the Discovery sources tile.
-   Use a condition builder or a custom script to restrict the list of de-duplication tasks that are assigned to a de-duplication template when de-duplicating CIs.

-   Access the Data Certification dashboard in CMDB Workspace to gain insights about the data certification activities and progress, examine policies and tasks, and see the reports about the certification instances, charts of the aging certification tasks, and group and individual workloads.
-   Add or remove CIs directly from a map in Unified Map. You can also add, modify, or delete CI relationships in CMDB.
-   Configure the system to use Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) identification rules to uniquely identify CIs in a payload, instead of using the **source\_name** and **source\_native\_key** attributes.
-   In zbooted instances, the itil user role no longer contains the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role, and the itil\_admin user role no longer contains the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role. However, the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles now have full \(create, update, delete\) access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class.

-   Use CMDB success advisor to achieve Data Foundations, Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\), and Software Asset Management \(SAM\) target outcomes.
-   Users with CMDB related roles can perform all CMDB functions as access to CMDB tables is no longer restricted to users with elevated privileges.
-   Switch into using the Service Graph Workspace instead of CMDB Workspace. The Service Graph Workspace provides access to data such as company, location, user and CMDB. The new workspace is specifically organized to help CMDB administrators, data owners, and analysts work efficiently with the CMDB.
-   Simplify duplicate CI remediation by using the ServiceNow Otto for CMDB remediation option in the Duplicate CI Remediator, and using the automatically-filled remediation options.
-   Use Dynamic Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) that eliminates the need for manually-created identification rules and reduces incorrect detection of duplicate CIs in the CMDB.
-   Protect sensitive information with domain separation that supports key CMDB tables such as the Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\] table.
