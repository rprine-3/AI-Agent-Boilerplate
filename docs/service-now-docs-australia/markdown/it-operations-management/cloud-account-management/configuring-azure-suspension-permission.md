5.  Select **Add** and then select **Add custom role**.

6.  In the **Custom role name** box, specify a name for the custom role.

    The name must be unique for the Microsoft Entra directory.

7.  Select **Next**.

8.  On the **Permissions** tab, select **Next**.

9.  On the **Assignable scopes** tab, you specify where your custom role is available for assignment, such as management group, subscriptions, or resource groups.

    ```
    {
        "properties": {
            "roleName": "Policy Lock/Unlock Manager",
            "description": "Allows locking and unlocking Azure Policy assignments at management group level",
            "assignableScopes": [
                "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/<ManagementGroupId>” 
            ],
            "permissions": [
                {
                    "actions": [
                        "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write",
                        "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/delete",
                        "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/read"
                    ],
                    "notActions": [],
                    "dataActions": [],
                    "notDataActions": []
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```
