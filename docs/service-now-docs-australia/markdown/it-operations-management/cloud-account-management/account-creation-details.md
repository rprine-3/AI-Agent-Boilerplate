</table>**Note:** For AWS and AWS GovCloud accounts, the values entered in the **Cost center**, **Business Unit**, **Department**, **Project/Application service**, **Business application**, and **Environment** fields are synced to AWS as tags. AWS restricts tag values to letters, numbers, spaces, and the following special characters: `+ - = . _ : / @`. Any other characters are automatically replaced with spaces. If all characters in a field value are unsupported, the tag is skipped. A tooltip on the form indicates this behavior. These actions are recorded in the execution log.
