# Set up and verify root email in AWS

Create a unique email address to manage several accounts. Having multiple accounts and emails can be a significant challenge for an AWS admin. A single AD email for multiple AWS accounts simplifies management.

## Before you begin

Role required: Email / AD admin

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Create an email address similar to `aws-ccoe@mycompany.com`.

2.  Send a test email from your email to `aws-ccoe+test@mycompany.com`.

3.  Confirm that the test email is received in the `aws-ccoe+test@mycompany.com` mailbox.


## What to do next

Share the confirmed email address with the Provisioner or ServiceNow AI Platform admin for configuration purposes.

Once you receive an account creation confirmation email on `aws-ccoe@mycompany.com`, set the root credentials manually based on your company's security standards.
