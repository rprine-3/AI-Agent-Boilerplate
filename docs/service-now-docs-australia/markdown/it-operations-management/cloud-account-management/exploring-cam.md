# Exploring Cloud Account Management

The ServiceNow Cloud Account Management in Cloud Workspace application provides a framework to streamline the cloud account creation and management process.

## Cloud Account Management overview

The automation capabilities of Cloud Account Management in Cloud Workspace simplify administrative tasks related to account management, such as creation, suspension, reactivation, and certification. Data certification confirms the integrity and security of user accounts within the organization's cloud environment.

As a Cloud Account Management admin, you can view the account statistics displayed on the **Home** tab, which include critical severity accounts, high severity accounts, suspended accounts, accounts due for certification, and accounts with undefined budgets.

## About Cloud Workspace entitlements

Cloud Account Management dynamically adjusts the features available to you based on your entitlements.

-   Cloud Account Management entitlement becomes available with the ITOM Cloud Accelerate license.
-   The Cloud Governance Suite \(CGS\) license is a prerequisite to have Cloud Workspace. The CGS license provides the following capabilities:
    -   Access the home page
    -   Access the asset explorer, which provides an overview of your cloud assets and asset details
-   The Cloud Governance Suite with the Cloud Account Management entitlements \(CGS + CAM\) provides the following additional capabilities:
    -   View an overview of your accounts and account details
    -   Submit, view, or approve account requests
    -   Certify an account
    -   View the compliance dashboard
    -   Configure Cloud Account Management or view configuration details
    -   Create request policies to automate the complete account creation and suspension process

## Compliance dashboard in Cloud Workspace

The compliance dashboard consolidates data from ITOM Visibility, Cloud Account Management to provide a unified view of cloud data and key metrics critical for security and compliance reporting.

For more details, see [Viewing the compliance dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-account-management/viewing-compliance-dashboard.md).

## Cloud account terminology

Cloud Account Management uses the term "cloud account," but other cloud providers use different terms for similar concepts. The terms are as follows:

-   Microsoft Azure Cloud \(Azure\) refers to subscriptions
-   Amazon AWS Cloud \(AWS\) refers to management and member accounts
-   Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) refers to projects

Cloud providers offer two main access mechanisms for performing operations:

-   Console user access
-   Programmatic user access

For Cloud Account Management, these operations are referred to as IAM service accounts. However, other cloud providers use different terminology:

-   AWS refers to the IAM user
-   Azure refers to service principals
-   GCP refers to service accounts
