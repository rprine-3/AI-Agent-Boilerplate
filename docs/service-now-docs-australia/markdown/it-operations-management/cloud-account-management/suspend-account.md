# Suspend a Cloud account

Suspend an account when there’s a budget constraint or the account owner isn’t available in the organization. Only admins and account owners can see the suspended accounts.

## Before you begin

An account requires a suspend profile to be suspended. For more information, see [Set up suspension of an AWS account using service control policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-account-management/configure-suspension-policy.md).

Role required: sn\_itom\_cam.cw\_admin or sn\_itom\_cam.cw\_requestor

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Cloud Workspace** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select **Subscription Accounts**.

3.  Under the **Managed Accounts** section, select **Active**.

4.  Select an account check box and select **Suspend**.

5.  In the confirmation dialog box, enter the reason for suspension and select **Yes**.

    -   Once you have created a suspension request, the request is sent to the admin for approval.
    -   Suspended accounts are listed under the **Managed Accounts** &gt; **Suspended** section.
