# Create a Terraform organization for Cloud Account Management in Cloud Workspace

Integrate with Terraform Cloud/Terraform Enterprise to organize accounts, define workflows, enforce security, improve collaboration, and enhance scalability.

## Before you begin

Role required: Terraform admin

Attributes required for this setup:

-   AWS Access Key
-   AWS Secret Key

Make sure you have access to Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise to perform the following procedure.

## Procedure

1.  Log in and navigate to the Terraform Cloud \(`https://app.terraform.io/session`\) or Terraform Enterprise portal \( `https://<tfe_server_url>/api/v1`\).

2.  Select the user name or organization name.

3.  In the modal window, enter a unique org name and other details.

4.  Select **Create Organization**.

    **Note:**

    -   After a new organization is created, you’ll receive confirmation within the platform. You can manage your organization settings, add members, and configure workspaces within your newly created organization.

    -   To see to the official Terraform documentation:
        -   Terraform Cloud: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations)
        -   Terraform Enterprise: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations)
5.  In Terraform org, navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Variable set** &gt; **Create variable set**.

    A variable set is a collection of variables shareable across multiple workspaces.

6.  Provide a descriptive name like AWS credentials.

7.  Select the appropriate scope \(organization or a workspace\).

8.  Create two variable sets within the **Variables** section as follows:

    -   Key: AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID and Value: &lt;AWS access key&gt;
    -   Key: AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY and Value: &lt;AWS secret key&gt;

        **Note:** Select as **Sensitive** to restrict the visibility of credentials to unauthorized personnel with Terraform access.

    For more details on variable sets, see [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started/cloud-create-variable-set\#](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started/cloud-create-variable-set).
