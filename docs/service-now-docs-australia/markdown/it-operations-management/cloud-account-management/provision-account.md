# Provision a cloud account

Provision a cloud account as an admin through Cloud Workspace.

## Before you begin

Confirm that the cloud context has been configured. For more information, see [Creating configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-account-management/cam-config.md).

Discovery must have been performed on the cloud admin portal.

Role required: sn\_itom\_cam.cw\_admin

2.  On the Account requests page, select the **Approved requests** tile.

3.  Select the account to provision.

4.  In the **Select cloud context** section, fill in the fields.

## Result

-   Based on the defined context, Cloud Account Management creates a subscription account within the specified cloud organization and AWS organization unit or Azure management group
-   To provide a more user-friendly alternative to a subscription ID, an alias is appended to the request name when an Azure subscription is requested through Cloud Account Management. The alias consists of an 8-character randomly generated suffix. For example: `CWSAREQ0000001-businessapp1-UEFwnlF8`.
