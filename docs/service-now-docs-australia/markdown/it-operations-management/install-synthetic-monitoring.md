## Before you begin

-   Review the [synthetic monitoring](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/16ade75aa323021035ce4514d31e61aa/1.0.0) application listing in the ServiceNow Store for information on dependencies, licensing or subscription requirements, and release compatibility.
-   Confirm that the Configuration items \(CI\) that you want to monitor exist in the CMDB HTTP Endpoints \[cmdb\_ci\_endpoint\_http\] table.
-   Confirm that configured credentials exist in the Credentials \[discovery\_credentials\] table if your endpoint requires authentication.
