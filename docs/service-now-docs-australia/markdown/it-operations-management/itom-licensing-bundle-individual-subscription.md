# ITOM/OT SU Licensing Bundle and Individual \(ala carte\) subscription

You can purchase subscriptions for individual ITOM applications \(a la carte\) or as a bundle covering multiple ITOM applications.

The ITOM/OT SU Licensing application calculates and displays the subscription usage for ITOM products. It displays the ITOM products individually or as part of a bundle, based on your subscription. If your organization has purchased ITOM subscriptions both as a bundle and individually \(a la carte\), the licensing module deducts from the bundle first. It then deducts from the individually purchased subscriptions.

If your organization surpasses the allocated number of subscription units, the Subscriptions window indicates the corresponding subscriptions as overdrawn. When subscriptions from both bundle and a la carte options exceed the allocation, the licensing module identifies the surplus as taken from the a la carte subscription. If the total subscriptions for an application covered solely by the bundle surpass the allocation, the Subscriptions window displays the bundle as overdrawn. The individual application is not listed separately.

## Subscription deduction process: Bundle usage and a la carte scenario

You can purchase ITOM subscriptions as a bundle and also acquire a la carte subscriptions for an application included in the bundle. The licensing module deducts from the bundle first, then from the a la carte subscriptions.

In the following example, an organization utilized all subscriptions allocated by the ITOM Pro bundle for ITOM AIOps. Subsequently, the licensing module deducted from the a la carte subscriptions for ITOM AIOps.

## Subscription display: Application covered by bundle and a la carte subscriptions

If your organization surpasses the total number of subscriptions in both the bundle and a la carte subscriptions, the licensing module regards it as overdrawn on the a la carte subscription. However, if your organization exceeds the subscriptions specifically for an application covered solely by the bundle, it is considered overdrawn on the bundle.

In this scenario, the Subscriptions window indicates the a la carte subscriptions for this application as overdrawn. If your organization exceeds the total subscriptions for an application covered solely by the bundle, the Subscriptions window displays the bundle as overdrawn.

In the provided figure, ITOM AIOps consumed 860 subscriptions, surpassing the subscriptions provided by the bundle \(500\) and a la carte \(250\). Consequently, the Subscriptions window indicates the ITOM AIOps a la carte subscription as overdrawn.

For ITOM Visibility, which consumed 550 subscriptions, and with no a la carte subscriptions purchased, the ITOM Pro bundle covering ITOM Visibility appears as overdrawn.
