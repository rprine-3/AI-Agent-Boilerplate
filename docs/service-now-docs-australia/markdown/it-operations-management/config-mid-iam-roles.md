# Configure the MID Server for AWS IAM roles

Configure the MID Server to retrieve the temporary security credentials associated with an IAM role.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin or sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin \(for Cloud Provisioning and Governance\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **MID Servers**.

2.  Select a MID Server installed on an Amazon EC2 instance within the relevant AWS service account.

3.  Open the **Configuration Parameters** related list.

4.  Click **New**.

5.  In the configuration parameter form, select **mid.aws.instance\_profile\_name** in the **Parameter name** field.

6.  Enter the name of the IAM role attached to the EC2 Instance in the **Value** field.

    **Note:** AWS Cloud Discovery for "mid.aws.instance\_profile\_name" accepts both "role name" and "full ARN" as valid parameter values. For example, both of the following values are acceptable:

    -   arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id
    -   resource-id
    The MID Server uses the same IAM role that is set up for the corresponding AWS service account. For more information, see [Configure temporary credential access for trusted AWS accounts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/configure-iam-role-aws-account.md).

    For operational information about creating AWS roles, refer to the Amazon documentation on [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html).

7.  Click **Submit**.

    The new parameter is listed in the MID Server record.
