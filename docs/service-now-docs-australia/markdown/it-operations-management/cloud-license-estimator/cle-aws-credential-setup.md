# Configure AWS credentials for Cloud License Estimator

This task guides you in configuring IAM user permanent credentials for the designated account.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can configure IAM roles to generate temporary credentials using STS API for a specified account. When using IAM roles for temporary credentials, the Credential ID is optional in the configuration form. However, AWS service accounts require an IAM role to be configured in service accounts. At least one service account must have credentials to generate temporary credentials.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Filter Navigator** &gt; **All** &gt; **ITOM Cloud License Estimator** &gt; **Home**.

2.  On the Home page, select **Go to Credentials** to open the **Credentials \(discovery\_credentials\)** page.

3.  Select **New** &gt; **AWS Credentials** and enter the requisite information.

    A **Credential ID** is generated, which is used when creating configurations.

## Configure AWS Service Accounts for CLE

There are several ways to configure AWS Service Accounts depending on the credentials and master accounts.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

Service accounts can be configured with the following options:

-   Configure a service account with permanent credentials. When an account is configured with permanent credentials, it is referred to as an accessor account. This account can be either a management account or member account.

-   Configure a management account with the IAM role.

-   Configure a member account with a custom IAM role. If the member account uses the default IAM Role \(OrganizationAccountAccessRole\) to generate temporary credentials, configuring a service account for the member account is not required.


### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Filter Navigation** &gt; **All** &gt; **ITOM Cloud License Estimator** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select the **Service Account List** icon.

3.  On the **Service account** page, select **Create New**.

4.  To configure a service account with permanent credentials, enter the following information:

    -   **Name:** Enter the AWS account name.

    -   **Cloud provider:** Select AWS.

    -   **Account ID:** Enter the AWS account ID.

    -   **Master account:** Select if this is a management account.

    -   **Credentials:** Select the AWS Credential ID created for permanent credentials.

    -   **Master account:** Leave blank if not applicable.

    -   **Accessor Account and Accessor role ARN:** Not applicable for permanent credentials.

5.  To configure a management account with the IAM role, enter the following information:

    -   **Name:** Enter the AWS account name.

    -   **Cloud provider:** Select AWS.

    -   **Account ID:** Enter the AWS account ID.

    -   **Master account:** Select if this is a management account.

    -   **Credentials:** Leave blank. No credentials are required for this account.

    -   **Master account:** Leave blank.

    -   **Accessor Account:** Select the account that has a trust relationship with this management account's IAM role.

    -   **Accessor role ARN:** Enter the full ARN of the IAM role.
6.  To configure a member account with a custom IAM role, enter the following information:

    -   **Name:** Enter the AWS account name.

    -   **Cloud provider:** Select AWS.

    -   **Account ID:** Enter the AWS account ID.

    -   **Master account:** Do not select this, as this is a member account.

    -   **Credentials:** Leave blank. No credentials are required for this account.

    -   **Master account:** Select the management account from the list.

    -   **Accessor Account:** Choose the account that has a trust relationship with this member account's IAM role. This can be either the management account or another member account.

    -   **Accessor role ARN:** Enter the full ARN of the IAM role.
7.  After providing the relevant information for your account type, select **Save**.
