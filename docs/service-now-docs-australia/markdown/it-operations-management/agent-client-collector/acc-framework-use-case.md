# Agent Client Collector Framework use case

The Agent Client Collector Framework \(ACC-F\) use case demonstrates how a financial organization can use Agent Client Collector Framework to assist in IT asset discovery.

## Use case overview

A leading financial organization needed a robust IT discovery solution to maintain compliance, secure critical systems, and manage a growing remote workforce. While the organization initially relied on agentless discovery methods — where MID Servers interrogate systems and populate the CMDB—it faced significant challenges. These limitations affected their ability to monitor secure environments and remote endpoints effectively, leading to potential security and compliance risks.

## Challenges

-   Restricted server access: The financial organization’s security policies restricted MID Servers from initiating connections to core banking servers and sensitive financial databases. This made agentless discovery insufficient for these high-security assets.
-   Remote workforce visibility: The company’s growing remote workforce meant many employee laptops and mobile devices operated outside the corporate network. Agentless discovery couldn’t capture data from these endpoints, creating blind spots in asset tracking and compliance monitoring.
-   Regulatory compliance: Financial institutions face stringent regulations \(such as PCI, DSS and SOX\) requiring detailed and auditable asset data. Agentless discovery struggled to meet these requirements, especially for in-depth monitoring and policy enforcement.

## Solutions

To address these challenges, the financial organization implemented an agent-based discovery approach.

-   Agent deployment on critical servers: Agents were installed on core banking servers and sensitive financial databases. This allowed continuous, secure monitoring without violating access restrictions.
-   Remote endpoint management: Agents deployed on remote employee laptops provided real-time data collection and monitoring, regardless of location. This ensured that all devices, even those outside the corporate network, were included in asset discovery.
-   Enhanced data collection: The agents collected detailed system information and enforced security policies directly on each asset, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and improving audit readiness.

## Outcomes

-   Comprehensive asset visibility: The organization achieved full visibility across its IT environment, including secure data centers and remote endpoints. This reduced blind spots and improved decision-making for IT operations and security teams.
-   Improved compliance and audit readiness: Agent-based discovery provided granular, auditable data that met stringent regulatory requirements. This streamlined compliance reporting and reduced the risk of regulatory penalties.
-   Enhanced security posture: By enforcing policies at the endpoint level, the organization strengthened its cybersecurity defenses, protecting sensitive financial data from potential threats.

This approach enabled the financial institution to maintain control over its IT environment, support its remote workforce effectively, and ensure compliance with industry regulations - critical factors in safeguarding sensitive financial operations and maintaining customer trust.
