# Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content default checks and policies

Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) provides various checks and policies as well as a business rule.

## Policies

**Note:** ACC-VC policies execute at a frequency of once per day. The total data ingested would be approximately 572KB. This takes into consideration an average of approximately 1500 installed software applications and approximately 500 running processes other than CI data per machine.

Enhanced Discovery

</td><td>

Runs on a schedule, by default every 24 hours \(86400 seconds\). The policy interval can be adjusted, for example to run every 4 hours \(set the interval to 14400\). The ACC-VC policy configuration is synced to all agents based on the policy filter defined by ACC-VC. Update the following ACC-F system properties, if needed:-   **sn\_agent.disco\_minimum\_threshold\_for\_rediscovery\_minutes**: to avoid discovering the system too frequently.
-   **sn\_agent.disco\_disable\_ci\_clobber\_of\_agentless\_disco**: to avoid Discovery conflicts.
-   **sn\_agent.disco\_ci\_clobber\_of\_agentless\_disco\_threshold\_days**: to avoid Discovery conflicts.

File-based Discovery background policy

</td><td>

Takes the config file as input from the instance to an agent. Scans the system using config file parameters and stores the output in two separate files on the agent.-   FBDSAMOutput.json: Stores metadata related to the set of file names generated from the **samp\_file\_name** table.
-   FBDFileOutput.json: Stores metadata related to files scanned by a wildcard extension.

Runs on the agent when file-based discovery is invoked. For details, see [Agent Client Collector File-Based Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/file-based-discovery-overview.md).

Default: false. To activate, navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Configuration Console** and in the **File Based Discovery** section, activate the Enable File Based Discovery toggle switch.

File-based Discovery - SAM

</td><td>

Discovers known software files on the endpoint. Uses an allowlist of recognized software filenames maintained by ServiceNow. When a file on disk matches an allowlist entry, FBD uses the FileBasedDiscovery API to identify the collected software metadata \(file name, path, size, and version\), identifies the software package it belongs to and records the installation on the instance. Unrecognized files are tracked in the unidentified file records table \(cmdb\_unidentified\_file\_set\). Runs daily.Default: false. To activate, navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Configuration Console** and in the **File Based Discovery** section, activate the Enable File Based Discovery toggle switch.

</td><td>

File-based Discovery - SWID tag

</td><td>

Enables SWID tag scanning on a Windows, Linux or macOS platform. When enabled, the scanner looks for `.swid`, `.swidtag`, and `.cmptag` files in the configured scan directories. Stores results in the following tables:-   cmdb\_swid\_tag: Parsed SWID tag records
-   cmdb\_file\_information: Individual file records
-   cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install: Individual software records

Default: false. To activate, navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Configuration Console** and in the **File Based Discovery** section, activate the Enable File Based Discovery toggle switch.

</td></tr><tr><td>

File-based Discovery - File management

</td><td>

Discovers files based on customer-defined rules. Administrators configure which file extensions to look for and define filename matching rules such as exact match, starts with, ends with, or contains. This policy builds a device-level file inventory based on the organization's specific needs. Results are stored in the sn\_acc\_vis\_content\_device\_file\_information table.Configure rules in the File Matching rules \(sn\_acc\_vis\_contet\_file\_config\) and File extensions \(sn\_acc\_vis\_content\_file\_extension\) properties. For details on these properties, see [Agent Client Collector File-Based Discovery properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/file-based-discovery-configuration-properties.md).

File Management supports delta scanning; after the initial full scan, only added, modified, and deleted files are sent on subsequent runs. For details on delta scanning, see [Agent Client Collector File-Based Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/file-based-discovery-overview.md).

Default: false. To activate, navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Configuration Console** and in the **File Based Discovery** section, activate the Enable File Based Discovery toggle switch.

</table>**Note:** Windows endpoint devices include devices that have a Windows operating system and belong to CI class: computer.

See [System properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md) for more details. For more details on policies, see [Checks and policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/checks-policies.md).

## Check type

ACC-VC has the following check types: **Enhanced Discovery**, **SAM Advanced Discovery**, and **Installed Software**.

-   **__Enhanced Discovery__**

    This check type is responsible for invoking the EnhancedDiscoveryHandler script include that processes the payload produced by endpoint\_discovery.rb as executed by ACC.

    Used by File-base Discovery.

-   **__SAM Advanced Discovery__**

    This check type is for the SAM Discovery policy that invokes the EnhancedDiscoveryHandler script include for processing the SAM data produced by the sam\_advanced.rb file.

-   **__Installed Software__**

    This check type for the **Software installed policy** that invokes the EnhancedDiscoveryHandler script include for processing the installed software data produced by the installed\_software.rb file.

Enhanced Discovery

Synced to all agents based on the policy filter defined by ACC-VC. The Check definition is configured to run with certain assets and determines what gets synced between the agent and the MID Server. For more details on policies, see [Checks and policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/checks-policies.md).**Note:**

For the agent to retrieve the OS serial numbers and TCP connections along with associated running processes, sudo access for “dmidecode” and “ss” is required on Linux systems. For example, this content could be added to /etc/sudoers or to an individual file in `/etc/sudoers.d/`:

```
Cmnd_Alias AGENT_ACC_V = /usr/sbin/dmidecode -s baseboard-serial-number,/usr/sbin/dmidecode -s chassis-serial-number,/usr/sbin/dmidecode -s system-serial-number,/usr/sbin/dmidecode -s system-uuid,/usr/sbin/ss -tanp
servicenow ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:AGENT_ACC_V
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

SAM background log check

</td><td>

Runs every 8 minutes and performs inline aggregation of data generated from Osqueryd logs. After collecting the data, it writes all the intermediate data results into a temporary marker file which is reused in the next run. This reuse limits the number of log files and disk space needed on target systems. **Note:** You may notice a spike in system resource consumption, as the background aggregation check runs every interval.

</td><td>

Collects data every 24 hours.

</td><td>

Fetches installed software data for all devices other than Windows and macOS endpoint devices.

Oracle GLAS Java Process Discovery

</td><td>

Runs `pbd_java_discovery.rb` via osquery to collect Java version, vendor, AMC, and licensing flags. Timeout: 600s. Runs on all platforms.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Oracle GLAS HW data collection

</td><td>

Runs ```
endpoint_discovery.rb
        --select=oracle_glas_hw_discovery
```

 to execute Oracle's `ct_cpuq` script. Executes Oracle's hardware validation script on non-Oracle, non-macOS hosts to collect CPU/socket data for GLAS reporting. Runs weekly.

VISC Get targeted URL metric

</td><td>

Gathers per-day usage metrics for the monitored URL from each managed device, and sends the data back to the instance.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Business rule

The **Enhanced Discovery – On CI Delete** business rule triggers the Endpoint Discovery Check when the CI associated with a given CI is deleted from sn\_agent\_cmdb\_ci\_agent.
