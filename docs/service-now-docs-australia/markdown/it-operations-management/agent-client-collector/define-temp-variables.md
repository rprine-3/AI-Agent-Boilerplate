# Define temporary variables for a pattern allowlist

Define temporary variables by assigning values such as executable paths, config file paths, and so forth. Defining temporary variables ensures that runtime commands are successful.

## About this task

If a Linux command executable relies on an undefined temporary variable, the command fails at runtime.

For example, for the command `$pathToCmd "/log/acc.log"`, if a value is not defined for `$pathToCmd`, the command will fail.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Pattern Designer** &gt; **Pattern Allowlist Temporary Variables**.

2.  Select **New** to create a new variable.

3.  Create a record and define the temporary variable.

    For example:

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Value|bin/sh/testexec|
    |Pattern|.NET Application|
    |Operating system|Linux|
    |Temporary variable|exePath|

4.  Select **Submit**.
