# Using push-based Discovery and SAM together

Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) collects installed software data for use cases for Software Asset Management \(SAM\), when the SAM plugin is installed. Using push-based Discovery and SAM together can help optimize software data collection with SAM basic metering and SAM total usage metrics.

ACC-VC can capture the last accessed time for the software or applications that are installed on the target via push-based Discovery. This information along with the target CI reference, is added to the Software Update \[samp\_sw\_usage\] table.

SAM Basic metering and SAM total usage metrics are supported for both Windows and macOS.

The software usage records are domain separated. The records are populated with the domain of the MID Server that is used for the agent-based Discovery for the target.

**Note:** For software installations \(cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\), to avoid insertion of duplicate records, the same discovery source "ServiceNow" is being used for both push-based Discovery and horizontal IP-based Discovery.

## Requirements

-   **SAM basic metering and SAM total usage metrics**

    To apply SAM basic metering or SAM total usage metrics, you need the following:

    -   SAM plugin \(com.snc.samp\) enabled
    -   System property \[**sn\_acc\_vis\_content.persist\_sam\_usage\_metrics**\] set to true. See [System properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md) for more details.
    -   Write permissions enabled for the log folder in the ACC install directory.
    -   In a Windows environment: For maximum efficiency, run ACC with the Local System account \(on the agent, set **Log On As = Local System**\).
    For details on SAM metering setup with the Agent Client Collector, see the Knowledge Base article [KB1642676](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1642676).

-   **Software edition information**

    To retrieve software edition information, you need the SAM plugin \(com.snc.samp\) enabled.


## SAM basic metering

SAM basic metering tracks when installed software was last used on an endpoint. In a Windows environment, this is determined by observing which applications are running on the machine.

-   **How SAM basic metering works \(on a Windows machine\)**
    -   Every 8 minutes, the agent checks the running process table on the endpoint and records each observed application.
    -   Running applications are considered used, and their last accessed time updates to the current time.
    -   Once every 24 hours, the agent also reads the Windows Registry Run keys \(`HKLM...\Run`, `HKLM\Wow6432Node...\Run`, and `per-user HKU<SID>...\Run`\) to acknowledge auto-start applications that may have started and exited before being checked. These observations are sent to the instance as part of the existing 24-hour metering payload.
    -   On an instance, each observed executable is matched to a product using an exact lookup in the Software Product Process \(**samp\_sw\_product\_process**\) table.
    -   If a matching product is found, the last accessed time on the corresponding Software Installation \(**cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install**\) record is updated.
    -   If no mapping exists in the Software Product Process \(**samp\_sw\_product\_process**\) table for an executable, no last accessed time is written for the software installation record. The unmapped executable is logged for the for review.
-   **How SAM basic metering works \(on a macOS machine\)**

    The last accessed time \(**last\_used** value\) is collected using the native macOS metadata attribute.


If reclamation rules are enabled for the product, the last accessed time is also stored in the Software Usage \(**samp\_sw\_usage**\) table.

Use the **sn\_acc\_vis\_content.disable\_sam\_reclamation\_rules\_for\_licensable\_softwares** property to define reclamation rules for licensable software, as follows:

-   **True**: SAM usage is stored for all licensable software \(with or without defined reclamation rules\), and for any non-licensable software that has a reclamation rule defined.
-   **False**: Store SAM usage according to defined reclamation rules.

Common applications supported include:

-   WinZip
-   Google Chrome
-   Sublime Text
-   Notepad++
-   Autodesk
-   Microsoft Office 365
-   Tableau

## SAM total usage metrics

SAM total usage metrics allows you to measure total usage time and total usage count on any application that has a software reclamation rule enabled.

Osquery provides a daemon executable which can run as a service, called Osqueryd. Osqueryd needs to be manually deployed for SAM total usage metrics to work properly. Each Osqueryd deployment requires the osquery.conf file, optional external packs, and initialization flags \(configured in osquery.flags file\) provided when starting the service. In return, the daemon service runs scheduled queries on the host and logs it into a local file system.

**Note:** Osquery supports filesystem-based logging by default. This configuration is provided in the osquery.conf file on any fresh Osquery installation. Osquery is not needed from an implementation or configuration viewpoint for basic metering. Total Usage metrics requires osqueryd to be installed separately.

Domain information can be collected during the data collection. This can help large organizations with multiple employee directories map software to the correct user. Currently, this is supported for Windows only. To map the software usage/assigned\_to with the correct user in a domain separated environment, use the system property \[sn\_acc\_vis\_content.column\_name\_for\_user\_mapping\] with a valid field name. By default, the value of this system property is empty which means it only validates the username and not the domain. You can use either of the following formats to validate username and domain: username@domain or domain\\username.

Using the list of processes, you can perform SAM normalization to map the processes for the relevant installed software records. This provides flexibility since installed software names and processes are not usually the same. For the list of processes in the payload, query the Software Discovery Model \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_discovery\_model\] table and Software Product \[samp\_sw\_product\] table to fetch the corresponding product and publisher. Once the product is fetched, check if the reclamation rule is enabled for that product to persist the total usage time in the Software Usage \[samp\_sw\_usage\] table. See the flowchart for details.

install and configure Osqueryd for Windows using the following script.

```
# Install latest osquery

$msi = "osquery-5.7.0.msi"
$url = "https://pkg.osquery.io/windows/$msi"
$dst = "$PSScriptRoot\$msi"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $dst
# msiexec /i "$dst" /quiet /qn /norestart
Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait "/i $dst /quiet /qn /norestart"

# Configure osqueryd service

$flags = "--logger_rotate=true
--logger_rotate_size=26214400
--logger_rotate_max_files=1
--watchdog_level=-1
--config_path=C:\Program Files\osquery\osquery-sam.conf"
Set-Content -Path 'C:\Program Files\osquery\osquery.flags.default' -Value "$flags"

$conf = @'

For details on Windows and macOS see [Configure Osqueryd schedule for SAM total usage metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/import-external-pack-file-for-sam-total-usage-metrics.md) and [Configure Osqueryd logs for SAM total usage metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/configure-osquery-logs-for-sam-total-usage-metrics.md).

## Collecting SAM metrics without osqueryd

Optionally, you can enhance efficiency by using non-osqueryd data collection when using push-based Discovery and Software Asset Management \(SAM\) together. When non-osqueryd data collection is invoked, data collection is automatically performed on all available agents, instead of invoking osqueryd on each agent individually.

To perform non-osqueryd data collection:

1.  Ensure that the following permissions are configured for the relevant OS:
    -   Windows: The ACC service must run as the Local System account. Set the ACC service's Log On As value to **Local System**.
    -   macOS: The `servicenow` user must be able to run osqueryi without a password. For information about `servicenow` user permissions for osqueryi, see [Configure ServiceNow sudoers file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/config-sudoers-file.md).
2.  On the System Properties page \(**All** &gt; **System properties** &gt; **All properties**\), set the **sn\_acc\_vis\_content.enable\_sam\_collection\_without\_osqueryd** property to **true**.

    **Note:**

    -   Enable this property only when all agents are version 4.1.0 or later.
    -   SAM basic metering \(last accessed time\) works with both osqueryd and non-osqueryd configurations. The 8-minute process poll and 24-hour payload run regardless of the osqueryd deployment mode.

## Software edition information

Edition information is supported for Adobe Acrobat and MS SQL server. With this feature, SAM admins can get clear visibility into the editions of their installed software. Osquery commands are used to fetch the edition information which then shows in the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table in the Edition Override column. For more details, see the support KB: [https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb\_article\_view&amp;sysparm\_article=KB0721360](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0721360)
