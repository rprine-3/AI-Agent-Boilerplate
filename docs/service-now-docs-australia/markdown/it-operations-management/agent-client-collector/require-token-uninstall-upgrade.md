# Enable uninstall validation during agent upgrade

Configure requiring a maintenance token to uninstall agents during agent upgrade. A maintenance token provides a layer of administrative control so that unauthorized personnel can't perform the uninstall.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_agent.token\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.

2.  Locate the **sn\_agent.upgrade\_enable\_uninstall\_validation** property and set its value to **true**.

    If the property does not exist, select **New** to create it.

    **Note:** If uninstall validation is enabled, setting the system property back to **false** disables the feature on the next version upgrade.


## Result

The property is invoked for both selective upgrade and high volume upgrade, and the uninstall feature is enabled on Windows agents.
