# Agent Client Collector Discovery

Discover CIs in your environment by using Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) Discovery. ACC-VC works with both horizontal IP-based Discovery, and you can also use push-based Discovery.

-   **[Using push-based and horizontal IP-based Discovery together](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/using-enhanced-discovery-and-agent-less-discovery-together.md)**  
Discovery performed by Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) is compatible and can coexist with horizontal IP-based Discovery. You may have ACC installed on a given target host and still have that host as part of a horizontal IP-based Discovery schedule as well.

Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) can collect data for uses cases with the Intel vPro® platform when the Intel ® Endpoint Management Assistant \(EMA\) application is installed on Windows endpoints. You can install the Intel EMA application from the ServiceNow store. Attributes are stored in the CMDB when enabled. Currently, data for Intel EMA can only be fetched for Windows endpoints.
-   **[Discovering DNS names using push-based discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-v-discover-dns-names.md)**  
CMDB owners need CIs to contain all domain system names \(DNS\) associated with their system. Starting in Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) version 2.3.0, ACC-VC can discover DNS name lists for Windows and Linux CIs.

You can persist the type of users that populate the CMDB depending on your particular interests. Currently, local and system are supported for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
-   **[License key discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/license-key-discovery.md)**
