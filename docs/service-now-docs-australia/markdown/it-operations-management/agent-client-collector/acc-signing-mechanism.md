# Enable OpenSSL secure signing for plugins

Create a self-signed certificate for an Agent Client Collector plugin. The following procedure gives an example of how to create an x509 certificate using OpenSSL. For other certificate types, consult OpenSSL documentation.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the **verify-plugin-signature** property is set to **True** in the agent's `acc.yml` file to verify plugin signing.
-   Ensure **OpenSSL** is installed on your system.

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## About this task

Enabling an OpenSSL secure signing mechanism for plugins works with an Agent Client Collector installed on a Linux system.

## Procedure

1.  Create a plugin file with a `tar.gz` extension.

    For more information, see [Create and edit Agent Client Collector plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/create-edit-assets.md).

2.  Generate your own secure self-certificate for the plugin file.

    1.  Create an x509 certificate.

        ```
        openssl req -nodes -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout "sign.key" -out "sign.crt" -days 365 -subj
                "/C=<CountryName>/ST=<StateOrProvinceName>/L=<Locality>/O=<Organization>/OU=<OrganizationalUnit>/CN=sign"
        ```

    2.  Sign the plugin file.

        ```
        openssl dgst -sha256 -sign "sign.key" -out sign.txt.sha256 <plugin-name>.tar.gz
        ```

        Alternatively, you can sign plugins using a certificate authority. When doing so, assign the certificate .pem format and place it in the agent's `cert` directory.

    3.  Verify that the signature is configured correctly.

        ```
        openssl dgst -sha256 -verify  <(openssl x509 -in "sign.crt" -pubkey -noout) -signature sign.txt.sha256 <plugin-name>.tar.gz
        ```

        If the file is valid, the output is `Verified OK`.

    4.  Encode the signature's certificate with base64 coding.

        ```
        base64 sign.txt.sha256 > sign.txt.sha256_encode64.sig
        ```

        A `sign.txt.sha256_encode64.sig` file is created.

3.  Run the following commands to create a new directory and insert the `tar.gz` and `sign.txt.sha256_encode64.sig` files.

    1.  `mkdir signed-plugin`

    2.  `mv <plugin-name>.tar.gz signed-plugin`

    3.  `mv sign.txt.sha256_encode64.sig signed-plugin`

    4.  `cd signed-plugin`

4.  Create another `tar.gz` file by running the same commands as you ran for the first `tar.gz` file.

    1.  `tar -C . -zcvf ../<plugin-name>.tar.gz *`

    2.  `cd..`

        **Note:** Save the new file as `../<plugin-name>.tar.gz` to avoid naming collisions with the original `<plugin-name>.tar.gz` file that exists in the current directory.

5.  Upload the new `tar.gz` plugin file to the instance.

6.  Set the plugin file as **active=true**.

7.  Place the `sign.crt` file into one of the following locations:

    -   The Agent Client Collector's `cert` directory, located in the `config` folder.
    -   On the MID Server, compress the file into a `.zip` file and place it in the `agent/static/cert/customer` folder.
8.  In the `acc.yml` file, set `verify-plugin-signature` to **true**.


## What to do next

Add the self-signed `sign.crt` file to the agent host trust store, as described in [Add a self-signed certificate to the OS truststore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/add-certificate-trust-store.md).
