# Use case: Data isolation and monitoring with domain separation

Optimizing data isolation and monitoring with domain separation ensures financial institutions protect sensitive information, improve operational efficiency, and maintain compliance by securely segregating departmental data.

## Use case overview

In a large financial institution, departments like IT, Finance, Compliance, and HR need to manage their systems independently while keeping sensitive data protected. The Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) collects data from various agents on servers and devices, and domain separation ensures that each department's data is securely isolated. This allows departments to manage their own monitoring, troubleshooting, and reporting, greatly reducing the risk of cross-domain interference or unauthorized access.

## Challenges without domain separation

-   Data privacy and security risks: Sensitive data could be exposed to unauthorized users. For example, IT staff could inadvertently access financial or payroll data, violating privacy policies.
-   Operational inefficiency: Departments would have to share configurations, making it harder to manage and troubleshoot issues, leading to confusion and inefficiencies.
-   Compliance issues: Meeting regulatory requirements for data isolation would be difficult, risking compliance violations.
-   Increased risk of data corruption: Shared environments can lead to accidental data corruption, as changes in one department could affect others.

## Solution

-   Data isolation: Each department has a dedicated domain, ensuring that data collected by agents is accessible only within that domain.
-   Independent configuration and monitoring: Departments set their own checks, policies, and tasks without affecting others.
-   Access control: Role-based access control \(RBAC\) restricts user access to data within their domain. For example, IT can access only infrastructure data, while Finance can access only financial transaction data.
-   Enhanced security: Domain separation ensures that users in one department cannot access data from other departments, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Outcome

-   Improved data security: Sensitive data is protected, reducing unauthorized access risks.
-   Operational efficiency: Departments operate independently, managing configurations and monitoring without conflicts.
-   Regulatory compliance: Easier adherence to data privacy regulations \(GDPR, SOX\) due to secure data segregation.
-   Reduced data corruption: Isolated environments prevent unintended cross-departmental impacts, enhancing system stability.
