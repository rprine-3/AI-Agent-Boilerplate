# Create and edit checks

You can select a check based on the type of entity \(such as a server or an application\) you want to monitor. You can view and edit the default checks or create new checks, as needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Check Definitions**.

2.  Click **New**.

    The **Check Definition** page appears.

    **Note:** Using Ruby scripts in a Windows environment causes high CPU consumption.

3.  Enter values in the fields on the page, as described in [Agent Client Collector check definition page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/check-definition-form.md).

4.  On the **Parameters** tab, enter parameter definitions, as needed.

    Parameters are used for the **Command** field when the Simple template is used, as described in [Agent Client Collector check definition page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/check-definition-form.md).

    The information you can add for parameters is described in [Check definition form parameters tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/check-definition-parameters-tab.md).
