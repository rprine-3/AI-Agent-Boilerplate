# Repeat high-volume upgrade for failed agents

If high-volume upgrade fails for specific agents, you must clear the problematic agents' history to re-enable upgrade. If the target upgrade version changes, you don't need to clear the agents' history, as the agents upgrade with the next scheduled high-volume upgrade.

-   In a Linux environment: sudo rpm/dpkg
-   In a macOS environment: sudo pkg

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Agent Client Collectors page **All** &gt; **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Agents**.

2.  Select an entry for which the **Version** number is not the highest available version.

3.  Locate the **Agent Upgrade Histories** tab.
