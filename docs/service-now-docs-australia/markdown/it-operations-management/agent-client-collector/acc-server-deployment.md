# Deploying Agent Client Collector on servers

When deploying the Agent Client Collector, perform deployment and management tasks on your environment's servers.

Server deployment uses MID Servers to connect your agents to a ServiceNow instance. Agents deployed on data center servers open WebSocket connections to your MID Servers, which relay data to your instance. You manage the sizing, certificates, and load balancing of the MID Server.

Use server deployment when your agents are in controlled environments such as data centers, where you are already running MID Servers and want to keep traffic on your network. Agent Client Collector Monitoring \(ACC-M\) and Agent Client Collector Log Analytics \(ACC-L\) require server deployment, and you can deploy Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) with servers as well.

Configure the Agent Client Collector with a MID Server to enable communication between network servers and the ServiceNow instance.
-   **[Agent Client Collector installation on a Linux OS system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-install-linux-concept.md)**  
Install Agent Client Collector on a system that uses a Linux OS, either using a single-line command script, or following the installation procedure to embed in your own package distribution mechanism. The installation procedure provides consistency when using package distribution solutions.
-   **[Agent Client Collector installation on a Windows machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-windows-install-concept.md)**  
When installing the Agent Client Collector on a Windows machine, either download an installation file and use a wizard to install the agent manually, or use silent installation to automate agent installation and configuration. Manual installation enables you to test the agent on a single system, while silent installation enables you to deploy the agent at scale.
-   **[Require a maintenance token for Windows uninstalls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/require-maintenance-token-uninstall.md)**  
Require using a maintenance token when uninstalling an agent from a Windows device. A maintenance token provides a layer of administrative control so that unauthorized personnel can't perform the uninstall.
-   **[Create a maintenance token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/create-maintenance-token.md)**  
Create a maintenance token to use when uninstalling an agent from a Windows device. Administrators require maintenance tokens to ensure that unauthorized employees can't perform an uninstall.
-   **[Uninstall an agent using a maintenance token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/uninstall-agent-maintenance-token.md)**  
Uninstall an agent from a Windows device using a maintenance token. Administrators require maintenance tokens to ensure that unauthorized employees can't perform an uninstall.
-   **[Prepare for agent deployment on a non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/npvdi-agent-instance-prep.md)**  
Configure the preliminary settings on an instance to enable using the agent with a non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure machine \(NPVDI\) machine. NPVDI agents gather data more quickly than traditional agents not enabled for a VPVDI.
-   **[Enable a non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure \(NPVDI\) agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/enable-npvdi-agent.md)**  
Configure an agent to enable it to work in a non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure \(NPVDI\) environment. NPVDI agents are self-sufficient and start running checks immediately.
-   **[Agent Client Collector upgrade overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-agent-upgrade-overview.md)**  
The Agent Client Collector Framework manages agent upgrades directly from the instance, with no manual action required on individual agent hosts.
-   **[Create and edit Agent Client Collector plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/create-edit-assets.md)**  
Custom plugins extend Agent Client Collector monitoring capabilities beyond the default plugins. You can create plugins for specific monitoring requirements or modify existing plugins.
-   **[Optimize distribution of agents to MID Servers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-redistribute-agents-mid.md)**  
Optimize the distribution of agents by allowing redistribution from one MID Server to another. Agents will always be connected to the MID Server with the fastest response time.
-   **[View the Agent Client Collector configuration file for an agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-yml-view.md)**  
View the `acc.yml` Agent Client Collector configuration file without having to access the host server by retrieving the file from an agent.
-   **[Create an Agent Client Collector configuration data file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/create-acc-config-data-file.md)**  
Create an Agent Client Collector configuration data file and associate it with check definitions so that you can view the information about your instance. You can also add or delete an attachment to the configuration data files, which are used by check definitions during check executions.
-   **[Validate plugins on the MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/validate-assets-mid-server.md)**  
Validate plugins on your MID Server to ensure that they match the plugins on your ServiceNow instance. Validating plugins ensures that the instance provides accurate data on all of your MID Server plugins.
