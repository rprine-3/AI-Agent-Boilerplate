# Azure metrics script

When creating a new policy for Azure cloud metrics, create a .json script to determine the metrics to be monitored. The format for the script appears below, followed by a table explaining the script contents.

```
{
  "namespace": "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers",
  "metrics": [
          "AllocatedSnatPorts",
          "ByteCount",
          "DipAvailability",
          "PacketCount",
          "SnatConnectionCount",
          "SYNCount",
          "UsedSnatPorts",
          "VipAvailability"
  ],
  "time_grain": "PT1M"
}
```

Resources and their metrics are retrievable from the [Supported metrics for Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-compute-virtualmachines-metrics) page.
