# Monitor HTTP points

Use the **Monitoring HTTP Entry Points** and **Monitoring HTTP Entry Points Metrics** policies that come with the ITOM Monitoring scoped app to monitor `http` and `https` entry points and entry points metrics. You can customize these policies as needed, or you can configure a new policy to monitor service entry points.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## About this task

An entry point is the access point for a service. In an Agent Client Collector policy, you specify the service you want to monitor, and the policy monitors the service's entry points.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Policies**.

2.  Select either the **Monitoring HTTP Entry Points** or **Monitoring HTTP Entry Points Metrics** policy.

    The relevant **Policy - Monitoring HTTP Entry Points** page opens.

3.  On the **Monitored CIs** tab:

    1.  In the **Table** field, ensure that the **sn\_itmon\_http\_entrypoint** database view table is selected for the Agent Client Collector to retrieve http and https entry points for monitoring.

    2.  In the **Filter** section, configure a filter for the services and entry points to be taken from the **sn\_itmon\_http\_entrypoint** database view table.

4.  Click the **Proxy Settings** tab and select the type of proxy you want to enable for the entry point monitoring.

    -   **Single proxy agent**: Select to enable monitoring a single agent, which you select in the **Proxy agent** field that appears after selecting this option.
    -   **Multi-proxy agents by filter**: Select to enable monitoring multiple agents. Configure a filter in the **Proxy filter** section that appears after selecting this option to monitor only the agents that match the filter's conditions.
    -   **Script based proxy**: Select to enable monitoring an agent based on a script.
    You must configure a proxy to run an HTTP policy.

5.  Click the **Checks** tab and in the **Filter checks by groups** field, select **HTTP** to display all of the http checks in the **Available** cell.

6.  Select the relevant checks and click the right arrow button to move them to the **Selected** cell.

7.  Select the **Active** check box at the top of the page to activate the policy.

8.  Click **Update**.

    The policy monitors the entry points specified by the policy's configurations.
