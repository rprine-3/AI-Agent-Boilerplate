# GlassFish metrics

The following table lists the metrics that are gathered as output from GlassFish checks. Entries indicated as **Featured metrics** are high-visibility metrics that are displayed in the Operator Workspace Metric tab after an alert is generated. These metrics provide the operator with additional information to help them further explore the specified issue.
