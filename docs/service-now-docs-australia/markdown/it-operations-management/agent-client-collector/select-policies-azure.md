## Before you begin

-   Prepare an instance with an active MID Server and metric base.
-   Install Agent Client Collector Framework and Agent Client Collector Monitoring.
-   Run Discovery on the Azure cloud account to populate the CMDB with CIs to be monitored.

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Prepare and configure the proxy agent to be used by the policy.
