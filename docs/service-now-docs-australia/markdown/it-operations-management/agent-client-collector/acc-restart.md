Perform manual restart of an agent when the agent configuration file has been refreshed, or if the agent is unstable. You can perform manual restart only on agents installed in a Windows environment and for Linux-based agents that use `systemd`.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Agents**.

    The **Agent Client Collectors** page appears with the list of agents.
