# Enable automatic MID Server selection

Enabling automatic MID Server selection lets the agent perform a connectivity test against the list of available MID Servers and determine the best connection based on latency and number of currently connected agents. Automatic MID Server selection is disabled by default.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

-   To enable sending periodic MID Server updates from the ServiceNow instance to existing agents, set the **sn\_agent.enable\_auto\_mid\_selection** system property to **true**.

-   To enable automatic MID Server selection for individual agents:

    1.  Set the **enable-auto-mid-selection** property in the agent's `acc.yml` file to **true**.
    2.  Enable and execute the Update MID List for All Agents and Update MID List for All New Agents scheduled jobs.

## What to do next

To disable automatic MID Server selection again, set each of the properties back to **false**.
