# Enable Apache Kafka health monitoring

Set configurations in the Apache HTTP server application to enable the Agent Client Collector to perform Apache Kafka HTTP server monitoring.

## Before you begin

-   Enable Java Management Extensions \(JMX\) for Kafka metric collection by running the following command:

    ```
    Environment=”JMX_PORT=9999”
    ```

-   Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Enable collecting Apache Kafka performance metrics using Java Management Extensions \(JMX\) by running the following command:

    ```
    JMX_PORT=9999 bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```

2.  Configure the admin server port by modifying the port number of the admin.serverPort property in the zookeeper.properties file.

    The default port is 8080.
