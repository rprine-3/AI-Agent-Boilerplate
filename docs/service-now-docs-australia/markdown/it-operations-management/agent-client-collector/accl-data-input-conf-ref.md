MID

</td><td>

The MID Server to which the logs stream.**Note:**

-   Only one ACC data input can be defined per MID Server. You can select only MID Servers with AgentClientCollector capability that support basic authentication. MID Servers that support mTLS are not listed.
-   The default maximum number of data inputs streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. You can modify this number in the MID Server properties. However, when 10 non-ACC data inputs are defined for a MID Server, you can still define one ACC data input for it. This addition makes a total of 11 data inputs for that MID Server.
-   When you submit the form, this field becomes read-only.

This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Port

</td><td>

The port on the MID Server.

 The port must be configured and active. It must not be occupied by another process. Make sure that your organization’s security team opens the port before you assign it.

 **Note:** When you update the port, the system updates the Agent Client Collector with the new port configuration. Log streaming continues seamlessly without log loss after 1-3 minutes.
