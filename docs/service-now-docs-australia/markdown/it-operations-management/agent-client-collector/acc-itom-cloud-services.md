# Installing MID-less Agent Client Collector

Installing MID-less Agent Client Collector enables you to send data from the agent to the instance through the cloud. Sending information through the cloud allows the MID Server to be used for more persistent resources.

Before using MID-less Agent Client Collector, do the following:

1.  Ensure that your ServiceNow instance has migrated from an F5 load balancer to Application Delivery Controller, version 2 \(ADCv2\) and has mTLS support.
    1.  Enter the following command in your terminal: `curl -v https://<instance>.service-now.com/stats.do 2>&1 | grep "< Server"`.
        -   If the system returns **snow\_adc**, the instance is on ADCv2/ADCv3.
        -   If the system doesn't return **snow\_adc**, the instance isn’t on ADCv2/ADCv3. To migrate the instance to ADCv2/ADCv3, contact Customer Support.
    2.  Navigate to `<instance_url>/adcv2/supports_tls`

        If the URL returns a value of **true**, mTLS is supported.

2.  Install the ITOM Cloud Services Core \(sn\_itom\_cloud\_svc\) scoped app plugin.

    If you’re using Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content, install the Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(sn\_acc\_vis\_content\) plugin.

3.  Configure an agent registration key on the instance. For details, see [Configure an agent registration key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/agent-registration-key-configuration.md).

    If registration fails between the agent and the instance, the registration key is cleared from the `acc.yml` configuration file.
