# Setting exclusion lists for IPs and NICs

Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) version 1.3.0 supports exclusion list for IPs and Network Interface Controllers \(NICs\) with a flexible mechanism for filtering out values for IPs and or NICs when creating or updating the host CI and related items.

The property \[**sn\_acc\_vis\_content.network\_adapter\_exclusion\_list**\] contains the list of regular expressions for the names and IP addresses that are excluded in the Network Adapter and IP Address tables. The value of this property is comma-separated regular expressions. Make sure that there is no comma in the regex and nic and ip\_addr should be in different lines.

Sample format of the value should be:

-   nic = nameRegex1, nameRegex2, nameRegex3
-   ip\_addr = IPRegex1, IPRegex2
