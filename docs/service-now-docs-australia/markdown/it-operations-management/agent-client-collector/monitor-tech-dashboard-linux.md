# Monitoring Technology Dashboard for Linux

With the Linux Monitoring Technology Dashboard, you can monitor the health and performance of your Linux infrastructure. The dashboard enables you to identify the CIs and servers in your system with the highest resource consumption, and also the most recent active alerts.

## Overview of the dashboard

The Monitoring Technology Dashboard shows the five CIs and servers with the highest metric readouts during the past six hours. The dashboard also shows the 50 most recent active alerts on your OS's servers.

To view the dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **AIOps Dashboards** &gt; **Monitoring Technology Dashboards** and select **Linux Server**.

## Using the Monitoring Technology Dashboard for Linux

Before using the Monitoring Technology Dashboard for Linux:

-   Ensure that you’re working in the Agent Client Collector Monitoring scope in your ServiceNow instance.
-   Ensure that the agent\_client\_collector\_admin and dashboard\_admin roles are enabled.
-   Enable Metric Intelligence on the MID Server.
-   Ensure that the **Linux OS Events** and **Linux OS Metrics** policies are enabled.

    Enabling these policies activates metric to CI mapping.

-   Ensure that the clotho plugin version 1.19.0.10 or above is enabled.
-   After upgrading from a previous version, follow the procedure described in the [ACC-M Dashboard Filters are not working when upgraded from Tokyo/Utah to Vancouver \[KB1438042\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1438042) article in the NOW Support Knowledge Base.

Point to the relevant widget to view a specific point of data and all of its details in a pop-up window. Select the Alerts tab to view the 50 most recent active alerts for CIs.

You can filter the dashboard data according to the following filters:

|Filter name|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|Time range filter|The time range for which you want metric data to display on the dashboard.|
|Metrics by selected CI filter|The CIs for which you want metric data to display on the dashboard.|
|Metrics by selected OS filter|The OS for which you want metric data to display on the dashboard.|

On the right side of widgets displaying a single metric, you can select the More options icon \(\[Omitted image "three-vertical-icon.png"\] Alt text: More options icon\) and select **Change group by**. Select the category you want to view the metric by: Host name, Class, Operating System, or OS Version.

## Linux server dashboard

The Metrics subtab displays the top five performing CIs and servers over the past six hours, according to the following metrics.

-   CPU Utilization
-   System Uptime
-   CPU Usage
-   Load Average
-   Memory
-   Memory Distribution
-   Processes
-   Network Utilization
-   Swap
-   Disk Usage

You can customize the appearance of the individual widgets on the Linux Monitoring Technology Dashboard. For example, you could change the timeframe for which the alerts appear. You can also include customized widgets when you are creating a custom dashboard.
