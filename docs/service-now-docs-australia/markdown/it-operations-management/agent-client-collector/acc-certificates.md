# Agent Client Collector certificates

Agent Client Collector certificates verify the authenticity of your agents, servers, and users. Using Agent Client Collector certificates ensures the safety of your environment.

## Discovering certificates

To discover certificates on all of your host's applications with open ports, navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties** and set the **sn\_acc\_vis\_content.tls\_ssl\_scan\_all\_open\_ports** property to **true**.

If you want to maintain certificates only for applications running on specific ports, set this property to **false**. The property's default value is **true**.

-   **[Manually refresh Agent Client Collector certificates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/manually-sync-certificates.md)**  
Refresh Agent Client Collector self-signed certificates manually to validate Agent Client Collector plugins, instead of waiting for the scheduled synchronization. For example, you can use this feature when the agent can't validate a plugin and you don't want to wait for the scheduled synchronization.
-   **[Enable OpenSSL secure signing for plugins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-signing-mechanism.md)**  
Create a self-signed certificate for an Agent Client Collector plugin. The following procedure gives an example of how to create an x509 certificate using OpenSSL. For other certificate types, consult OpenSSL documentation.
-   **[Add a self-signed certificate to the OS truststore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/add-certificate-trust-store.md)**  
Add a self-signed certificate to the truststore of your operating system \(OS\). By adding a certificate to the truststore, you can verify that the certificate is authentic and that your connections are secure.
-   **[Import a self-signed certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/import-self-signed-certificate.md)**  
Import a self-signed certificate in a Windows system by using the Certificate Import Wizard. The Certificate Import Wizard is required to complete the self-signed certificate import process on a Windows Operating System \(OS\).
-   **[Revoke Agent Client Collector certificates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/revoke-agent-certificate.md)**  
Stop communication between the agent and ITOM cloud services by removing an Agent Client Collector certificate. For example, there might be a security breach due to which you want to stop communication by revoking the agent's certificate.
-   **[Agent certificate rotation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/agent-certificate-rotation.md)**  
The Agent Client Collector certificate is valid for two years and must be rotated before it expires to avoid issues with agent connectivity. When expiration is approaching, the agent initiates a certificate rotation request.
-   **[Run Certificate Discovery via Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/run-cert-discovery-accvc.md)**  
Discover TLS/SSL certificates used by ports running on the agent's server. The Certificate Inventory and Management application uses this information to manage TLS/SSL certificates.
