# MongoDB metrics

The following table lists the metrics that are gathered as output from MongoDB checks. Entries indicated as **Featured metrics** are high-visibility metrics that are displayed in the Operator Workspace Metric tab after an alert is generated. These metrics provide the operator with additional information to help them further explore the specified issue.

|Metric type|Resource \(name of specific database, where relevant\)|Units|Metric type description|
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----------------------|
|mongodb.asserts.msg \(featured metric\)| |count|Number of message assertions raised since the MongoDB process started. Examine the log file for more information about these messages.|
|mongodb.asserts.regular \(featured metric\)| |count|Number of regular assertions raised since the MongoDB process started. Examine the log file for more information about these messages.|
|mongodb.asserts.rollovers| |count|Number of times that the rollover counters have rolled over since the last time the MongoDB process started.|
|mongodb.asserts.tripwire| | |Number of tripwire assertions raised since the MongoDB process started.|
|mongodb.asserts.user| |count|Number of "user asserts" that occurred since the last time the MongoDB process started.|
|mongodb.asserts.warning \(featured metric\)| |count|Number of warnings raised since the MongoDB process started.|

|mongodb.cursor.open.pinned| |count|Number of "pinned" open cursors.|
|mongodb.cursor.open.total \(featured metric\)| |count|Number of cursors that MongoDB is maintaining for clients. Because MongoDB exhausts unused cursors, typically this value is small or zero. However, if there is a queue, stale tailable cursors, or a large number of operations, this value may increase.|
|mongodb.cursor.timedOut| |count|Total number of cursors that have timed out since the server process started.|
|mongodb.databaseSizes.avgObjSize|admin|bytes|Average size of each document in bytes.|
|mongodb.databaseSizes.avgObjSize|config|bytes|Average size of each document in bytes.|

|mongodb.databaseSizes.collections|local|count|Number of collections in the database.|
|mongodb.databaseSizes.dataSize|admin|bytes|Total size of the uncompressed data held in the database. The **dataSize** decreases when you remove documents. For databases using the **WiredTiger** storage engine, **dataSize** may be larger than **storageSize** if compression is enabled. The **dataSize** decreases when documents shrink.|

|mongodb.databaseSizes.objects|local|count|Number of objects \(specifically, documents\) in the database across all collections.|
|mongodb.databaseSizes.storageSize|admin|bytes|This value does not decrease as you remove or shrink documents. This value may be smaller than **dataSize** for databases using the **WiredTiger** storage engine with compression enabled. **storageSize** does not include space allocated to indexes.

|mongodb.globalLock.activeClients.writers \(featured metric\)| |count|Number of active client connections performing write operations.|
|mongodb.globalLock.currentQueue.readers \(featured metric\)| |count|Number of operations that are currently queued and waiting for the read lock. A consistently small read queue, particularly of shorter operations, is not a cause for concern.|
|mongodb.globalLock.currentQueue.total| |count|Total number of operations queued waiting for the lock \(i.e., the sum of **globalLock.currentQueue.readers** and **globalLock.currentQueue.writers**\).

|mongodb.mem.pageFaults| |count|Total number of page faults. The **extra\_info.page\_faults** counter may increase dramatically during moments of poor performance and may correlate with limited memory environments and larger data sets. Limited and sporadic page faults do not necessarily indicate an issue.|
|mongodb.mem.resident \(featured metric\)| |mebibyte|This value is roughly equivalent to the amount of RAM, in mebibyte \(MiB\), currently used by the database process. During normal use, this value tends to grow. In dedicated database servers, the number tends to approach the total amount of system memory.|
|mongodb.mem.virtual| |mebibyte|The quantity, in mebibyte \(MiB\), of virtual memory used by the mongod process.|

|mongodb.metrics.repl.network.ops| |count|Total number of operations read from the replication source.|
|mongodb.metrics.repl.network.readersCreated| |count|Total number of oplog query processes created. MongoDB creates a new oplog query any time an error occurs in the connection, including a timeout, or a network operation. Furthermore, **metrics.repl.network.readersCreated** increments every time MongoDB selects a new source for replication.|
