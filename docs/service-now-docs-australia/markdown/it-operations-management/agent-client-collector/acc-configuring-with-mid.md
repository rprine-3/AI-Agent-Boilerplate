# Configuring Agent Client Collector with a MID Server

Configure the Agent Client Collector with a MID Server to enable communication between network servers and the ServiceNow instance.

-   **[Configure an Agent Client Collector with a MID Server using a single-line command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/configure-acc-with-mid.md)**  
Use a single-line command to set up an Agent Client Collector with a MID Server. You can also use the single-line command to migrate agents with MID-less configuration to be used with a MID Server.
-   **[Configure the websocket server on the MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-configure-web-server.md)**  
Configure the websocket server on MID Servers to enable connections from agents to the MID Server. You can configure only one websocket server per MID Server.
-   **[Configure a websocket endpoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-configure-websocket-endpoint.md)**  
Configure a websocket to enable the endpoint to provide web access from the MID Server to the Agent Client Collector \(ACC\).
-   **[Configure the frequency of updating the agent MID Server list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-update-mid-server-list.md)**  
By default, the list of MID servers connected to agents is updated once daily. If you have a dynamic environment that adds MID servers frequently, you may want to schedule updates more often, or execute the job on demand.
-   **[Enable Agent Client Collector monitoring on the MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-monitoring-setup.md)**  
Enable Agent Client Collector monitoring on the MID Server by configuring the Agent Client Collector framework \(ACC-F\) and Metric Intelligence extensions in a single action. Enabling Agent Client Collector monitoring also enables monitoring on agents connected to the MID Server.
-   **[Automatic MID Server selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-auto-mid-selection.md)**  
Automatic selection of MID Servers ensures that each agent uses the most efficient available MID Server.
