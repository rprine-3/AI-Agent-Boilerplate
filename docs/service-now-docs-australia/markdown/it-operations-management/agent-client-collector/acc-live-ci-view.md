# View live CI data with Agent Client Collector

View live data for incident-related CIs through Agent Client Collector for information that can help resolve the incidents.

## Before you begin

-   Collecting running processes for a macOS system requires `sudo` privileges. If `sudo` privileges aren't granted, only processes run by the Agent Client Collector are collected.

    To enable `sudo` privileges for osqueryi, add the following strings to either the `/etc/sudoers` file or to an individual file in the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory:

    -   `Cmnd_Alias LIVE_CI_VIEW = /Library/Application\ Support/servicenow/agent-client-collector/osquery/bin/osqueryi`
    -   `_servicenow ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:LIVE_CI_VIEW`
-   To enable the OSQuery executable to retrieve information on logged-in users in a Windows environment, the agent must run as a local SYSTEM account.

Verify that you have installed Agent Client Collector Framework and Service Operations Workspace on your instance.
