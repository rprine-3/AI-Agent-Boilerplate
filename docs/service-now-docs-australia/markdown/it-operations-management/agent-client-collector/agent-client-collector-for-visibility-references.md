# Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content reference

Review this information for details on OS query scripts, data collected, and definition of terms.

## OS module scripts for Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\)

These platform-specific plugins invoke platform-specific module scripts. Each script outputs to a standard JSON payload regardless of the platform.

</table>**Note:**

running\_processes.rb and tcp\_connections.rb are interdependent. For an efficient Discovery, keep both tcp\_connections.rb and running\_processes.rb together. Both the files are needed to get the complete data. If one is not there, it will not populate the other data.

To fetch information about all the running\_processes on the macOS, you must provide sudo access to osquery. If this configuration is not made, then running\_processes.rb will only fetch what is triggered by \_servicenow user. For tcp\_connections.rb, you must add ‘sudo lsof’ command in the sudoers file. If this is not done, tcp\_connections.rb will only fetch what is triggered by \_servicenow user.

## Data collected

ACC-VC uses the same classification criteria as IP-based Discovery for classifying as computer or server. The subset of collected data includes the following categories:

-   Basic inventory – Starting with ACC-F version 2.10.1, this will not be used.
-   Data collection - Collects the necessary data for classification and identification of a host CI. This includes host name, serial numbers, and OS information.
-   Installed Software – cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install \(if SAM enabled\) and cmdb\_software\_instance \(if SAM not enabled\)
-   File Systems – cmdb\_ci\_file\_system
-   Storage Devices – cmdb\_ci\_disk and cmdb\_ci\_storage\_device
-   Serial Numbers – cmdb\_serial\_number
-   Network Adapters – cmdb\_ci\_network\_adapter and cmdb\_ci\_ip\_address
-   TCP Connections – cmdb\_tcp
-   Running Processes – cmdb\_running\_process \(ACC-VC also classifies the running processes and creates application CIs in cmdb\_ci\_appl, where possible\)
-   Local User – cmdb\_os\_user \(Populates the local users for all the Operating Systems that ACC-VC supports by adding a new module called local\_user​\)
-   Enhanced inventory – Collects enhanced data \(such CPU info, start\_date, object\_id\) which is not necessary for identifying a unique host.

## Agent Client Collector terms

-   **Agent Client Collector \(ACC\)**

    The software component installed on target hosts that communicates with the MID Server. Sometimes referred to as Agent. This component is a ServiceNow derivative of Sensu-Go.

-   **Agent Client Collector Framework \(ACC-F\)**

    A ServiceNow base scoped application that leverages ACC and provides core capabilities \(including Check Types, Check Definitions, Policies, and so on\) enabling other ACC scoped applications, including ACC-M and ACC-VC.

-   **Agent Client Collector Monitoring Monitoring \(ACC-M\)**

    A ServiceNow scoped application enabling monitoring use cases.

-   **Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\)**

    A ServiceNow scoped application that implements push-based Discovery leveraging ACC and ACC-F.

-   **Horizontal IP-based Discovery**

    Traditional Discovery available to customers prior to ACC-VC. It discovers data via Probes and Patterns through the MID Server, requiring the Discovery Plugin.

-   **Modules**

    A subset of discovered data that is populated as part of Discovery. Examples of Modules include: Data Collection, Installed Processes, Serial Numbers, File Systems, Storage Devices, Network Adapters, Running Processes, and TCP Connections.

-   **Push-based Discovery**

    Discover data via ACC, ACC-F, ACC-VC, and the MID Server with a direct push of data from the target host. Discovery does not require specific IP range configuration on a Discovery Schedule or providing Discovery Credentials for target host.

-   **Sensu-Go agent**

    The Free and Open Source project which ACC is derived from.

-   **Virtual Machine Instance**

    A virtual target host running inside of a hypervisor, either on-premise or within a cloud service provider like AWS, GCP, or Microsoft Azure.

-   **Virtual Machine Image**

    A snapshot of a live virtual machine instance persisted to a file system or cloud storage.
