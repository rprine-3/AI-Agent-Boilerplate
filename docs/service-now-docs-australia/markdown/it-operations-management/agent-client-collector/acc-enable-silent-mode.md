If CPU consumption on your server is getting too high, you can manually turn off the Agent Client Collector data collection to pause all checks performed by the agent, except for the agent's keep alive messages.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Agents**.

    The **Agent Client Collectors** page appears, displaying the list of configured agents.

2.  Select the checkbox next to the relevant agents.

3.  In the **Actions on selected rows...** dropdown, select **Pause data collection** to pause data collection on the agents \(**Data Collection = Off \(manual\)**\).
