# Install MID-less Agent Client Collector using a single-line command in a Linux environment

Install MID-less Agent Client Collector on a Linux machine to enable sending data from the agent to the instance through the cloud. Sending information through the cloud allows the MID Server to be used for more persistent resources.

## Before you begin

-   Install the ITOM Cloud Services Core \(sn\_itom\_cloud\_svc\) plugin.
-   Onboard your instance to use ITOM Cloud Services. For details, contact Customer Support.
-   Configure an agent registration key. For details, see [Configure an agent registration key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/agent-registration-key-configuration.md).
-   Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## About this task

For details on sending data through the cloud in a MID-less deployment, see [DEX Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/dex-architecture.md).

## Procedure

1.  Retrieve the agent registration key:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Deployment** &gt; **Agent Registration Key**.
    2.  Select the relevant agent registration key.
    3.  Copy the registration key value and store it in a place where you can easily retrieve it, when needed.
2.  Retrieve the publicly accessible gateway URL, based on your location.

    -   AMER \(Americas\): `itomcnc-prod-gateway-amer.sncapps.service-now.com:443`
    -   EMEA \(Europe\): `itomcnc-prod-gateway-emea.sncapps.service-now.com:443`
    -   APAC \(Asia Pacific\): `itomcnc-prod-gateway-apac.sncapps.service-now.com:443`
3.  On the Linux server where the agent is installed, enter the following command:

    ```
    CONNECT_WITHOUT_MID="true" ACC_CNC="<gateway_endpoint>" REGISTRATION_KEY="<registration_key>" INSTANCE_URL="https://<instance_url>" bash -c "$(curl -L https://<instance_url>/api/sn_agent/agents/install_agent)"
    ```

    For details on the parameter values in the command, see [Agent Client Collector MID-less installation command parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-ics-command-params.md).
