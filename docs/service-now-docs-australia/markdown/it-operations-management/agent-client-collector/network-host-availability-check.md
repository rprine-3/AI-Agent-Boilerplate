</td><td>

Checks the network host availability via ICMP \(ping\) requests.

 Generates an OK event if the ping success ratio exceeds the Warning threshold \(-W, default 50%\).

 Generates a Warning event if the ping success ratio is between the warning threshold \(-W, default 50%\) and the critical threshold \(-C, default 20%\).

 Generates a Critical event if the ping success ratio falls below the critical threshold \(-C, default 20%\).

 A proxy agent is required.

</td><td>

`check-ping.rb -h <ip-address>` \(options\)`-h host`: Host to ping \(Required\). Default=&lt;localhost&gt;

`-c count`: Number of ping requests sent to the host. Default=1

`-T timeout`: The timeout \(in seconds\) for each ping request. If the timeout expires before a reply is received, the ping is considered failed. Default=5

`-6 ipv6`: Enables IPv6 pinging. Ping uses IPv4 when this flag is not used. Default=False

`-i interval`: Interval \(in seconds\) between each ping request. Default=1

`-W ratio`: The success ratio threshold for a Warning state. If the successful ping responses are below this ratio and above the -C ratio, the script returns a Warning. Default=0.5

`-C ratio`: The success ratio threshold for a Critical state. If the successful ping responses are below this ratio, the script returns a Critical failure. Default=0.2

`-r report`: Flag to append to the failure message of an MTR \(My Trace Route\) report if the ping fails. When MTR runs, a network diagnostic report generates. Default=false
