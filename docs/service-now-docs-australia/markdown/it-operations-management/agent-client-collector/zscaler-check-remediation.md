# Check Zscaler remediation

Verify that Zscaler remediation stops and starts the Zscaler app after the remediation monitoring check fails.

## Before you begin

Verify that the Zscaler monitoring check returns an **Application Status** value of **Down**, indicating that the Zscaler app isn’t working properly.

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

-   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Remediate Zscaler VPN** &gt; **Remediation Result**.

    The **Application Remediation Status** page appears.

    When remediation successfully shuts down and restarts Zscaler, the Remediation Result column has a value of **Success**. The Task Associated column displays a link to the incident created on remediation. When remediation is successful, the incident closes automatically.
