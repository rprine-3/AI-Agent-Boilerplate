# Install the Agent Client Collector on a Windows machine manually

Install the Agent Client Collector on a Windows machine manually when you want to test the agent on a single system.

## Before you begin

1.  Ensure that you’ve configured the Agent Client Collector web server. For details, see [Configure the websocket server on the MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/acc-configure-web-server.md).
2.  Verify your server's OS and version.
3.  When using Microsoft Internet Explorer, do the following to prepare the Agent Client Collector installation file:
    1.  Navigate to **Server Manager** &gt; **Local Server**.
    2.  Turn off **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.
    3.  Download the installation file.
    4.  Change the extension of the installation file from `.man` to `.msi`
4.  Ensure that .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later is installed on the target machine.

    **Note:** If the .NET Framework is not running effectively, use the legacy VBSript installer by running the following command on the target machine: `msiexec /i <msi_file_path> /quiet /qn /norestart USE_VBS_CA=1 ACC_API_KEY=<key_value> ACC_MID=wss://<mid_ip>:<websocket_port>/ws/events ACC_ALLOW_LIST=False`

5.  Enable golden image mode for cloning additional agents by setting the msi property **GOLDEN\_IMAGE=true**.

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Agent Downloads**.

2.  To perform installation using the wizard:

    1.  Download the .msi file that is accessible from the link on the UI.

        The Installation Wizard opens.

    2.  Select **Next** until you reach the **MID Web Server Connection Settings** page.

        \[Omitted image "ACC-MID-Connection-Settings-Updated.png"\] Alt text: MID Connection Settings page

    3.  Enter the relevant parameters in the dialog box fields:

        |Field name|Description|
        |----------|-----------|
        |MID Web Server Name/IP|IP address of the MID Web server.|
        |MID Web Server Port|Port number of the MID Web server. Use a number between 1024-49151.|
        |MID Web Server API Key|API key to access the MID Web server.|

    4.  Select **Next**.

        The **Create Local User Account** page appears.

        \[Omitted image "ACC-Create-Local-User-Account.png"\] Alt text: Create Local User Account page

    5.  Select the relevant option in the dialog box.

<table id="table_hdl_d1z_hkb"><thead><tr><th>

Option

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Use default user \(servicenow\)

</td><td>

Default user with which to run the Agent Client Collector on a Windows machine.Selecting this option creates a local user called **servicenow** as part of the installation.

The servicenow user password is randomly generated and is not stored in the system. A security event is created on the host machine which, if repeated, requires opening a support case. For details, see [KB1649116](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1649116) article in the HI Knowledge Base.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select existing user

</td><td>

When selecting this option, configure the following subfields:-   **User Name**: User name to log in to the Windows environment.
-   **Password**: Password of the selected user.
The user can be one of the following:

-   Local user \(created by the virtual machine owner; provides added resiliency\).
-   Domain user \(created by IT personnel\).
-   Group Managed Service Account \(gMSA\): Enter the name of the group managed service account in the **User Name** field and leave the **Password** field empty.
-   Local Service Account: Enter **LOCALSERVICE** in the **User Name** field and leave the **Password** field empty.
-   Local System Account: Enter **SYSTEM** in the **User Name** field and leave the **Password** field empty.

Due to Windows UAC restrictions, running the agent as a local SYSTEM account is necessary to perform an upgrade via **msiexec**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>        **Note:** Using a Local System account creates the local group **ServiceNow Users**, and adds the created user to the group. The ServiceNow Users group has access to Agent Client Collector directories and has the following privileges:

        -   **Performance Monitor**: Comes with the base system; enables viewing all performance counters in the system.
        -   **Log on as a service**: Enables starting network services and services that run continuously, even when no one is logged onto the console.
        -   **Debug programs**: Enables debugging processes and reading process details for users outside the ServiceNow user group.
    6.  Select **Create User**.

        The system creates a Windows user with the specified credentials, and the Agent Client Collector Configuration page appears.

    7.  To enable the **Allow-List** containing the checks enabled to run after setup, select the **Enable executing command allow list** check box on the resulting page.

        \[Omitted image "ACC-Allow-List-Windows.png"\] Alt text: Allow list check box

    8.  Select **Next** to open the installation page.

        When installation completes, click **Next** to complete and exit the wizard.

        After a successful installation, the service starts automatically and generates the following:

        -   User: Default = servicenow \(an existing user can also be configured to manage the service\). The servicenow user belongs to the local user group **ServiceNow Users**.
        -   Service: AgentClientCollector
        -   File location:
            -   Default for installation = `C:\Program Files\ServiceNow\agent-client-collector`
            -   Default for service files = `C:\ProgramData\ServiceNow\agent-client-collector`, which holds the `cache`, `config`, and `log` folders.
3.  To run Silent installation to disable installation reports, run the command line appearing in the **Silent installation** section of the procedure, as follows:

    `msiexec /i <msi_file_path> /quiet /qn /norestart ACC_API_KEY=<key_value> ACC_MID=wss://<mid_ip>:<websocket_port>/ws/events ACC_ALLOW_LIST=False`

    To enable the allow list of specified checks when running Silent installation, set the **ACC\_ALLOW\_LIST** parameter to **True**.

4.  To configure multiple MID Servers with Silent installation, run the command line appearing in the **Silent installation** section of the procedure with comma-separated values, as follows:

    `msiexec /i <msi_file_path> /quiet /qn /norestart ACC_API_KEY=<key_value> ACC_MID="wss://<mid1_ip>:<websocket1_port>/ws/events,wss://<mid2_ip>:<websocket2_port>/ws/events"`

    Insert the following parameter values in the command:

</table>    The configured MID Server values are automatically added to the `acc.yml` file. The agent connects to the first available MID Server in the list.

    To configure a secondary MID server, enter the following syntax in the `backend-url` section of the `acc.yml` file, per the `.yml` standard: `- "wss://<MID IP>:<Web socket port>/ws/events"` \(with the quotation marks\).
