# Exploring Agent Client Collector Monitoring

Agent Client Collector Monitoring is built on a Sensu framework which enables you to adopt and extend monitoring checks from the community. Agent Client Collector Monitoring collects data on your company’s infrastructure and installed applications.

## Agent Client Collector Monitoring overview

Checks and policies run on the agent’s client to retrieve the relevant data, which is transformed into events or metrics, as appropriate. Events and metrics are sent from the agent to your ServiceNow instance through a Metric Intelligence MID Server and are stored in the relevant database. A single MID Server can support multiple agents \(such as ACC-M and ACC-L\). For details on configuring the MID Server for Metric Intelligence, see [MID Server distributed cluster for Metric Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/metric-intelligence/ops-intelligence-mid-server.md).

Agent Client Collector Monitoring comes with the Event Management plugin and also requires installing the request Metricbase \(Clotho DB\), as described in [How to request Metricbase \(Clotho DB\) configuration \(KB0816088\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0816088).

For details on the plugins installed with Agent Client Collector Monitoring, see [Plugins or applications installed with ITOM AIOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/plugin-app-itom-health.md).
