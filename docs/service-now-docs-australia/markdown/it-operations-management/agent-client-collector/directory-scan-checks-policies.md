Event

</td><td>

check-directory-file-count

</td><td>

Checks the number of files present in a given directory and compares it to the provided warning and critical thresholds. Returns a CRITICAL, WARNING, or OK event based on the critical and warning thresholds.

**Note:**

-   Counts the number of files inside the directory, not including files in subdirectories.
-   The agent requires read and execute permissions on the directory being monitored.

</td><td>

check-directory-file-count.rb \(options\)

-d, --dir Absolute path to the directory to count the files \(required\)

-w, --warning Warning threshold \(required\)

-c, --critical Critical threshold \(required\)

-H, include\_hidden\_files Set active to **true** to include hidden files while counting \(default is **false**\)

**Usage Example:**

`check-directory-file-count.rb -d /path/to/directory -w 50 -c 100`

</td><td>

DirectoryFileCount CRITICAL: &lt;path to dir&gt; has 165 files.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Event

</td><td>

check-directory-integrity

</td><td>

Compares the last modified time of the directory with the current time to determine if any updates have occurred within a defined time interval. Based on this comparison, the check returns a CRITICAL or OK event.

**Note:** The agent requires read and execute permissions on the directory being monitored.

</td><td>

commonchecks check-directory-integrity \(options\)

 -d, --dirpath DIRPATH: Absolute path to the directory to check \(required\).

 -i, --interval INTERVAL: Time interval in seconds to check for recent updates \(required\). Default value can be set to 180 seconds.

 **Usage example:**

 `commonchecks check-directory-update -d /path/to/directory -i 180`

</td><td>

Common Checks CRITICAL: Directory Integrity: CHANGES DETECTED for &lt;path to file&gt; within the last 180 seconds \(Last Modified: Wed, 04 Dec 2024 12:18:55 EST\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Event

</td><td>

check-file-age

</td><td>

Evaluates the age of a specified file by comparing its last modification time with the current time. Raises an alert if the file exceeds the defined critical or warning age thresholds.

 **Note:** The agent requires read and execute permissions on the file being monitored.

</td><td>

commonchecks check-file-age \(options\)-f, --filepath FILEPATH: Absolute path to the file to check \(required\).

</td><td>

Common Checks OK: File &lt;path to file&gt; age: 30 minutes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Event

</td><td>

check-file-response-time
