# Limit metrics collection and evaluation

You can limit the metrics you send from the MID Server to the instance, either by de-activating a specific CI or an entire CI type.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  To limit metrics collection and evaluation for specific CIs:

    1.  Navigate to **Event Management** &gt; **Anomaly Detection** &gt; **Metric to CI**.

        The **Metric to CI Mappings** page appears.

        \[Omitted image "metric-to-ci-mappings.png"\] Alt text: Metric to CI Mappings page

        **Note:** The Metric to CI Mapping is identified by both its metric identifier and its configuration item.

    2.  To prevent sending metrics for a specific metric and CI, set the value of the **Active** column to **false**.

2.  To limit metrics collection and evaluation for an entire CI type:

    1.  Navigate to **Event Management** &gt; **Anomaly Detection** &gt; **Metric Types**.

        The **Monitoring System Metric Types** page appears.
