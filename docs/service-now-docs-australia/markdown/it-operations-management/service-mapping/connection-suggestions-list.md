<table id="table_gq2_nkh_2nb"><thead><tr><th>

Description

From

</td><td>

The CI class or fingerprint process of the CI that is the connection source. This field appears only when you access connection suggestions by navigating to **Service Mapping** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Connection Suggestions**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

To

</td><td>

The CI class, or fingerprint, or process of the CI that is the connection target.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target Host

</td><td>

The host of the CI that is the connection target.If the [**VIP**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/connection-suggestions-list.md) column shows **true**, the target host is a load balancer member. When you select such a target host, the system adds the load balancer and all its members as CIs in the application service.

</td></tr><tr><td>

IP

</td><td>

The IP of the CI that is the connection target.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Port

</td><td>

The port of the CI that is the connection target.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Confidence

</td><td>

The confidence level indicates the likelihood of this connection being part of the service instances.

-   **High** - Commonly a connection to an internal component that is only used by this specific component or application.
-   **Medium** - Commonly a connection to a middleware component used by multiple services, such as IBM MQ or Oracle WebLogic Server.
-   **Low** - Commonly a connection to an application deployed on numerous servers in the organization, typically for monitoring purposes, such as Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agents or MID Server.
-   **Very low** - Commonly a connection to a central application used by the entire organization, for example, Microsoft Active Directory or Okta.

If the confidence level appears as **N/A**, wait until the application fingerprints training is complete. See the [Application fingerprint training status report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/readiness-dashboard-ml.md).

 Confidence level is available only if fingerprint based discovery is enabled. See [Discover applications based on fingerprints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discover-application-based-process.md) for more information.

VIP

</td><td>

The target host is a load balancer member. The system shows this information only for load balancers that you previously discovered using horizontal discovery.

Decision changed by

</td><td>

The user who changed the decision last time.If the decision was changed by a rule, this field shows the MID Server user.
