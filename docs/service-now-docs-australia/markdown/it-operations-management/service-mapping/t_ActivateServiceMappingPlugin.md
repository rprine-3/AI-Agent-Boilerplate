# Request Service Mapping

Service Mapping is available under the ITOM Visibility subscription and requires activation by ServiceNow personnel.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. The account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.

If you don't have an account manager, decide to delay activation after purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a subproduction instance without charge, follow these steps.

Role required: admin

## About this task

****The following plugins are activated automatically when the Service Mapping plugin \(com.snc.service-mapping\) is activated:

-   Discovery \(com.snc.discovery\)

    **Note:** If you're activating the Discovery plugin for the first time in the Australia release, install the Discovery \(com.snc.discovery\) plugin first. Then install the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns \(com.sn\_itom\_pattern\) plugin version 1.0.52 for Cloud Discovery to work. You can then upgrade to Australia.

-   Pattern Designer \(com.snc.pattern.designer\)
-   Cloud Provisioning and Governance Core \(com.snc.cloud.core\)
-   Performance Analytics – Content Pack – Service Mapping \(com.snc.service-mapping.pa.content\)
-   Event Management and Service Mapping Core \(com.snc.service-watch\)

    **Note:** The Event Management and Service Mapping Core \(com.snc.service-watch\) plugin is different from the Event Management plugin \(com.glideapp.itom.snac\).
