# Business App Mapping AI Agent confidence thresholds

The Business App Mapping AI Agent handles matches based on their AI confidence score. Each score range triggers a specific action.

|Score range|Confidence level|Action|
|-----------|----------------|------|
|0.3 – 1.0|High|The agent automatically creates a "Uses::Used by" relationship in \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\]. A business application can be linked to multiple services.|
|0.1 – 0.29|Medium|The agent saves the candidate to the staging table \[sn\_sm\_gen\_ai\_ba\_candidate\_rel\] for administrator review. No relationship is created automatically. Administrators can accept a candidate to create the \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\] relationship, or dismiss it.|
|Below 0.1|Low|The candidate is filtered out. The agent does not create a record or a relationship.|
