# Create an application service for unmapped servers

Maximize the use of your organization's resources by mapping application service candidates that include unmapped servers. Use the Service Mapping workspace's unmapped servers widget to create an application service and ensure that your servers are used efficiently.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that Predictive Intelligence is enabled.
-   Verify Machine Learning readiness.
-   Confirm that the data is trained.

For more information, see [Application service readiness dashboard in configurable workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/readiness-dashboard-ml.md).

**Important:**

Service Mapping Plus v.1.10.0 or higher:

To update your data and view application candidates for unmapped servers, see [Troubleshooting steps for Mapping unmapped servers with Application service candidates \[KB1585065\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1585065) in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
