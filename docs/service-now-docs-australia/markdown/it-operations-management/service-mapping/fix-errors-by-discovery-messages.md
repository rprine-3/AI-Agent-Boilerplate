# Fix service mapping errors using discovery messages

Service Mapping does not offer semi-automated resolution options for errors that require advanced resolution. Fix such errors using symptoms and discovery messages.

## Before you begin

Try fixing errors using semi-automated resolution options as described in [Fix errors in individual application service maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/fix-or-ignore-errors-business-service-map.md).

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

## About this task

You can fix errors in individual application services at any time.

## Procedure

1.  Open the service instance map.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **CSDM** &gt; **Manage Technology Management Services** &gt; **Service Instance**.

    2.  Select the needed service instance.

    3.  On the service instance page, select **View Map**.

2.  Select **View Map** next to the relevant service instance.

3.  Ensure that the map opens in Edit mode.

    \[Omitted image "MapEditDiscoveryMessages.png"\] Alt text: Discovery messages appear under the map.

    CIs discovered with errors appear with the warning icon \(\[Omitted image "MapWarningIcon.png"\] Alt text: The Warning icon\) on the map. Discovery messages on the **Discovery Messages** tab give short error descriptions.

4.  Fix errors based on the symptoms and discovery messages.

The following discovery message is displayed: `The map does not display the entire service, because it is too large. The number of CI connections exceeded the allowed maximum.`

</td><td>

Reduce the application service size.-   For an application service mapped using pattern-based and traffic-based discovery, perform the following actions:
    -   If you use customized discovery patterns and mapping results in very large service instances, modify the patterns so that they don't map irrelevant CIs.
    -   [Split the service into smaller services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/add-segment-to-business-service-map.md).
-   For an application service converted from an application service, perform the following actions:
    -   Review the converted service instance to identify CI relations irrelevant or redundant for this service. Remove such CI relations in the CMDB.
    -   Decide how many levels of related CIs you must include into this service instance. If necessary, [change the number of levels used in conversion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/update-services-from-cmdb.md) to reduce the service size.


</td></tr><tr><td>

The following discovery message is displayed in a tag-based service instance: **This tag-based service instance reached the maximum number of CIs. For more information, refer to the product documentation.**

</td><td>

Perform the following actions: -   [Modify tag definitions used for mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/modify-tag-category-family.md) to make sure Service Mapping includes only relevant CIs in the service instance.
-   If necessary, [Tag-based discovery configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/tag_discovery_configuration.md) to change which CIs Service Mapping includes in tag-based service instances.
