# View the list of CIs belonging to an application service

View a complete list of CIs that make up an application service, including CIs not shown on the application service map: tracked configuration files, endpoints, processes, and network devices.

## Before you begin

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin or service\_mapping\_user

## About this task

By default, application service maps show application CIs and connections between them. The rest of the CIs behind applications and connections between them are hidden. The CI list displays the following additional CIs:

-   Servers that host applications.
-   Network devices like routers or switches.
-   Processes running on hosting servers. Processes are used for identification and classification of applications.
-   Tracked configuration files for applications that are part of the service.
-   Endpoints belonging to the applications. Endpoints contain information necessary for connecting to applications, like hosts and ports.
-   The application service CI for this application service.

The CI lists for empty application services, that do not contain any CIs contain only one CI: For the application service itself.
