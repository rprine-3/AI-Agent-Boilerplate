## Map Citrix XenApp and Presentation Server services

Map an application service containing Citrix XenApps, Presentation Servers, and Citrix Usage Collectors and verify that Service Mapping discovered all Citrix components correctly.

### Before you begin

-   Provide a user with permissions to read and query the Citrix repository:
    -   For versions 4.5 and later, a PowerShell script from the XenApp server.
    -   For versions earlier than 4.5, a Microsoft Visual Basic Script \(VBScript\) from the Citrix Presentation Server
-   On the ServiceNow AI Platform, configure a domain user for accessing the Windows OS as described in [Windows credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_WindowsCredentialsForm.md).

    **Note:** To use this credential later for XenAPP, set the **Credential alias** attribute to cmdb\_ci\_appl\_citrix\_xenapp. To use this credential later for Citrix, set the **Credential alias** attribute to cmdb\_ci\_appl\_citrix\_collector.

-   \(Optional\) To discover using the WinRM protocol, see [Configure WinRM trusted hosts on MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/enable-winRM-MID-servers.md)
-   Configure a user with permissions to run PowerShell commands on the Citrix server.
-   \(For discovery of Citrix Presentation Server only\) Find out the icon path for the entry point:
    1.  In the Citrix Access Management Console, navigate to **Presentation Server** &gt; **Applications**.
    2.  Locate the Icon Path folder in the navigation tree.
    3.  Right-click the Icon Path folder and click **Copy path**.
-   \(For discovery of Citrix XenApp Server only\) Find out the icon path for the entry point by checking the Distinguish Name attribute for the Icon Path.

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

### Procedure

1.  Create a service instance.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Mapping** &gt; **Service Instances**.

    2.  Select **New**.

        The **Discoverable by Service Mapping** option is selected by default.

    3.  In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the service instance.

2.  Define the entry point for this service instance:

    1.  Select the **Citrix XenApp** tile.

    2.  Define entry point attributes.

        |Attribute|Description|
        |---------|-----------|
        |Host|The URL of the Citrix XenApp or Presentation Server. The URL must contain a VIP IP or a physical host.|
        |Port|The port that the Citrix XenApp or Presentation Server uses on the host.|
        |Icon Path|The path to the logical application location as it appears in the Citrix Access Management Console. The path must start with the Applications folder. For example, /Application/Jane/Windows Media Player.|
        |URL|The URL must contain a VIP IP or a physical host. For example, http://&lt;host&gt;/Citrix/StoreWeb.|

    3.  Click **Add**.

    4.  Click **Save**.

3.  Click **Additional Info** on the left and clear the **Traffic based discovery** check box.

4.  Click **Update**.

5.  Verify that the mapping result is satisfactory:

    1.  Click **View map** and wait until the mapping is complete.

        It may take a few minutes.

    2.  Review the application service map and make sure that it resembles in the following example.

        \[Omitted image "Citrix-XenApp-top-down-map.png"\] Alt text: Check the result of mapping an application service containing the XenApp Servers and other environment components.


If the mapping result is not as you expected, perform basic troubleshooting.

Solution

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Discovery failed. The discovery log displays the message that starts with the following text: You do not have sufficient permissions.

</td><td>

The indication sections of the pattern fail, because the user does not have permissions for running PowerShell commands.

</td><td>

Make sure that you provided a user with permissions to run PowerShell commands on servers that host Citrix XenApp, Presentation Server, or Citrix Usage Collector.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Discovery failed. The discovery log displays the error message that includes the following text:CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: \(:\) \[\], PSSecurityException+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeException

</td><td>

The MID Server cannot run PowerShell commands remotely, because the execution policy is set to RemoteSigned on the target servers.

</td><td>

Use the `set-executionpolicy remotesigned` command on the target servers to enable the MID Server to successfully run PowerShell commands.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Discovery failed. The discovery log displays the error message that includes the following text:Import-XAFarm : The Citrix Common Commands PowerShell Snapin is not installed

</td><td>

The target host does not have this PowerShell library: Citrix Common Commands PowerShell Snapin.

</td><td>

Download and install PowerShell SDK for Citrix XenApp on all servers hosting Citrix XenApp, Presentation Server, or Citrix Usage Collector.

</td></tr><tr><td>

The application service map shows the Citrix Delivery Controller, but does not include the Citrix XenApp, Citrix Presentation Server or Citrix Usage Collector.

</td><td>

The icon path you defined is incorrect.

</td><td>

Verify the icon path and reenter it in the entry point attributes for the application service.
