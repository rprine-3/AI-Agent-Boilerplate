The outcome of the mapping attempt:

-   **Already connected** – The relationship between the business application and the application service was created manually.
-   **Needs review** - The AI Agent identified a possible match between the business application and an application service, but the confidence level was not high enough to create the relationship automatically.
-   **No match found** - The AI Agent did not find an application service that could be linked to the business application with sufficient confidence. No relationship was created.
-   **Failed** – The AI Agent has failed to link between the business application and the service instance.
