# Prerequisites for performing top-down discovery using Service Mapping

Learn about credentials, users, and user permissions you must configure to let Service Mapping access and discover applications inside your organization private network.

Configure the relevant requirements to enable successful top-down discovery:

-   **Host credentials**

    Service Mapping uses credentials of the hosts to access applications running on this host. Typically, host credentials are enough for top-down discovery. For example, to discover the HP Service Manager Application Server, configure only credentials for accessing the server hosting this application, SSH credentials, or Windows credentials.

-   **Applicative credentials**

    To discover some applications, Service Mapping needs separate credentials from credentials of the host on which such applications run. This type of credentials is referred to in ServiceNow as applicative credentials. For example, to discover the ABAP SAP Central Services \(ASCS\), configure applicative credential in addition to the host credentials.

-   **Elevated rights for Unix-based hosts**

    For Unix-based hosts, configure on MID Servers, you must provide a user with sudo-level credentials on all Unix-based hosts in your organization. For example, if the server hosting ASCS is Unix-based, provide a user with elevated rights to be able to run discovery commands against this Unix-based server.

-   **SNMP community credentials**

    Configure SNMP community credentials to allow Service Mapping and Discovery to query network devices using the SNMP protocol. For example, configure SNMP community credentials for A10 Networks Thunder ADC.

-   **Users or user permissions**

    You may need to provide additional users or user permissions to run certain commands or access certain directories. For example, for ASCS, provide a user with permissions to run SOAP on RFC read table function.


The ServiceNow AI Platform provides a centralized way of configuring credentials for Discovery, Service Mapping, and other applications. It allows you to configure credentials for hosts and applications only once. If you have already configured host-related credentials for another application, you do not need to do it again for Service Mapping.

You can assign credentials to specific MID Servers or keep credential generic so all MID Servers can use them. MID Servers retrieve commands and credentials from the ServiceNow instance and apply them to discover CIs inside organization private network.

\[Omitted image "CredentialsGeneralDiagram.png"\] Alt text: Assigning credentials to the MID Server that uses them to access CIs

Use the following guidelines to decide for which MID Server to create credentials:

-   If all CIs, belonging to the same CI type, share a credential, you do not need to specify a MID Server for it. In that case, it is used on all MID Servers by default.

    **Note:** Specifying the MID Server when configuring credentials is optional.

-   If CIs of the same type and on the same network have different credentials, configure these credentials and define order in which Service Mapping uses them when trying to connect to these CIs.

In addition to generic credentials, you configure on MID Servers, you must configure sudo-level credentials on all Unix-based hosts in your organization.

If the MID Server does not have sufficient credentials to access a device or application, it can run Network Mapper \(Nmap\) commands to collect basic information without using credentials. Credential-less discovery with Nmap requires additional configuration as described in [Install and uninstall Nmap on a MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/install-nmap-on-mid-server.md).

-   Verify that the following applications are up to date:
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   Visibility Content
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
-   To successfully discover the load balancer pool members, set the **display service names** option \(**bigpipe.displayservicenames**\) of the load balancer to **false** on the F5 load balancer.
-   For F5 Load Balancer pattern:
    -   Configure [SNMP credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_SNMPCredentials.md) on the ServiceNow AI Platform.
    -   \(Optional\) If there are iRules or SNMP community credentials aren't enough for discovering outgoing connections, configure [SSH credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).

**Note:** If you don't want to use SSH credentials, you can use the REST API to create a connection to F5 BIG-IP devices.

Service Mapping uses the SSH credentials to retrieve connections that aren't from CMDB. Discovering connections using the SSH protocol is a failover mechanism for the SNMP-based discovery.

-   For F5 Load Balancer SSH pattern:
    -   Configure [SSH credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).
    -   Verify permissions for the following SSH commands. In newer versions of F5 BIG-IP, only A-type GTM pools are supported.
        -   `list auth partition all`
        -   `list sys global-settings`

**Note:** You also have the option of using [SSH credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).

In this case, use SNMP credentials instead.

Configure the credential as a [credential alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/discovery-credential-alias.md).

**Note:** If you configure Windows credentials for a user different from the Microsoft Exchange Server administrator, Service Mapping uses traffic-based discovery that results in mapping all Microsoft Exchange clients.

</table>## Resolving credential-related issues

If there are discovery issues caused by incorrectly configured or missing credentials, resolve them as explained in the KB article: [Credentials &amp; Permissions troubleshooting on Discovery, Service Mapping, Orchestration](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0657528)

-   **[Credentials required for host discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/r_Credentials4HostDiscovery.md)**  
There are credentials and permissions that Service Mapping requires for discovering hosts.
-   **[Service Mapping commands requiring a privileged user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/r_CommandsnCredentials.md)**  
Service Mapping uses commands requiring elevated rights to discover and map Unix-based hosts in your organization. In addition to configuring necessary credentials, configure servers in your organization to allow Service Mapping to run these commands with elevated rights.
-   **[Service Mapping commands not requiring a privileged user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/r_NonSudoCommands.md)**  
Most of commands utilized by Service Mapping for discovery and mapping do not require elevated rights.
-   **[SNMP-based queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/snmp-based-queries.md)**  
Service Mapping accesses network infrastructure devices like load balancers and routers using Simple Network Management Protocol \(SNMP\) v1/v2c/v3. Configure SNMP community credentials to enable this type of access.
