# Application service readiness dashboard in configurable workspace

Review the information on the dashboard to confirm that you’re ready to discover and map application services based on machine learning \(ML\). Service Mapping uses data processed by Predictive Intelligence to generate suggestions for traffic-based connections.

The Application service readiness dashboard is part of Service Mapping Plus, available on the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

Predictive Intelligence evaluates connections between application fingerprints, CIs, and processes, and ranks their relevancy. Service Mapping uses this information to create connections based on connection rules. It also generates connection suggestions for servers and load balancers for you to decide which connections to add or remove from the service instances.

Widgets on the ML Dashboard page show the information about prerequisites and issues related to service discovery based on Predictive Intelligence. Select links inside the widgets and reports to navigate to the related list or form.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

## Access the Application service readiness dashboard

To open the dashboard, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Mapping**. Then select the Application service readiness icon\[Omitted image "readiness-dashboard-navigation.png"\] Alt text: application service readiness icon. \[Omitted image "readiness-dashboard.png"\] Alt text: Assessment dashboard

## Reports

The dashboard includes the following reports.

ML-Related Service Status \[ml\_related\_service\_status\]

</td><td>

A bar report that provides the summary of ML-related issues in mapped application services. For detailed information, see [Mapping status of application services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/readiness-dashboard-ml.md).

AFP Training Status \[afp\_training\_status\]

</td><td>

A donut report that shows the status of application fingerprint training. Predictive Intelligence trains predictive models and machine-learning solutions. View the training status for application fingerprints to understand if your deployment is ready for mapping using Predictive Intelligence.

Connection Suggestions \[sa\_ml\_connection\_suggestion\]

</td><td>

A donut report that reflects the ratio of classified connections to valid connections in the Connections Suggestions table. This table is only populated during top-down discovery.

</table>## Mapping status of application services

Review the summary of ML-related issues in mapped application services.

|Category|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Mapped without issues|The number of service instances discovered without ML-related issues.|
|Missing source-target AFP|The number of service instances missing some application fingerprints for a source or target process. To solve issues, calibrate the fingerprint-based discovery.|
|Missing source-target process|The number of service instances missing some source-target process information. To solve these issues, rediscover the target hosts and ensure that the relevant processes are discovered.|
|Confidence level unavailable|The confidence level indicates the likelihood of this connection being part of the service instances. If the confidence level appears as **N/A**, wait until the application fingerprints training is complete.|
|Missing target host|The number of service instances with some CI connections not fully discovered, because the horizontal discovery didn't discover host CIs. To solve these issues, rediscover the target hosts and ensure that the relevant processes are discovered.|

## Prerequisites status

Service instance mapping requires the integration of several modules and applications: credentials, Predictive Intelligence, enhanced Application Dependency Mapping \(ADME\) discovery, and scheduled jobs. Review the list of prerequisites and ensure that the state of all prerequisites is **Ready**.

<table id="id_jdp_1ps_1sb"><thead><tr><th>

Prerequisite

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Install and enable Predictive Intelligence \(PI\) plugin

</td><td>

Service Mapping uses Predictive Intelligence to generate connection suggestions. 1.  Ensure that the Predictive Intelligence plugin appears **Installed**.
2.  Click the Predictive Intelligence tile and verify that the **Status** is **Active**. If the status is **Inactive**, select the **Activate/Repair** link under **Related Links**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable ADME property

</td><td>

Service Mapping uses ADME probes. Ensure that the **glide.discovery.enable\_adme** property is set to **True**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable ADME or ADM probe for each relevant OS

</td><td>

There are multiple ADME probes for different types of operating systems. Enable all probes necessary to discover configuration items \(CIs\) in your environment.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Allow IP address expansion

</td><td>

This setting helps manage the expansion of global addresses \(such as '0.0.0.0' or '\*'\) into individual IP addresses. The limit for this expansion must be greater than 0.

 To verify and set this limit:

1.  Navigate to the System Property \[sys\_property\] table.
2.  Locate the **sn.adm.ip\_expansion\_limit** property.
3.  Ensure that this property is set to a positive number.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable application fingerprint \(AFP\) scheduled job

</td><td>

Ensure that the **Applications suggestion - ITOM Autodisco** scheduled job that controls the fingerprint-based discovery is set to **Active**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable Connection Suggestion property

</td><td>

Confirm that discovery based on Predictive Intelligence is enabled. Navigate to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table and verify that the **sa\_ml.connection\_suggestions.active** property is set to **True**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable connection suggestion scheduled job

</td><td>

Ensure that the **Status** of the **Service Mapping - Traffic Process to Process** scheduled job is **Active**. This schedule job triggers generation of connection suggestions.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Service issues

Review the list of service instances most affected by ML-related issues. The list of most affected services is available if the connection suggestions feature is enabled in your deployment. The list shows service names and the number of ML-related issues for each of them. It also indicates if the traffic-based feature is enabled for the services.
