# Map your application services using tags in the Service Mapping Workspace

Categorize and organize organization's configuration items and map them into application services using the Tag-based dashboard in the Service Mapping workspace.

## Before you begin

-   Verify that you have installed Service Mapping Plus version 1.16.3, which is required to access tag-based mapping in the Service Mapping workspace. For more information, see [Install Service Mapping Plus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/install-service-mapping-plus.md).
-   Review and analyze your organization’s tag usage, making a list of all tags and their purposes. Use the Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\] table to see the tags in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).
-   Use Tag Governance to optimize tag application in your organization. See [Tag Governance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/tag-governance/exploring-tag-governance.md) for more information.
-   Assign tags to configuration items \(CIs\) that you want to include in application services.
-   Run Discovery to horizontally discover CIs. Discovery populates the CMDB with the CI data, including tags. For more information about discovery tag-based discovery for the Service Mapping workspace, see [Tag-based discovery for the Service Mapping Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/tag-discovery-service-mapping-workspace.md).
