# Add CIs to application services using connection rules

Create rules for automatically adding traffic-based connections and the CIs they lead to in discovered service instances. Create rules that add CIs to multiple application services.

## Before you begin

-   Analyze the infrastructure you are mapping to identify the most common connections. These common connections are good candidates for connection rules.
-   [Discover applications based on fingerprints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discover-application-based-process.md).
-   Confirm that discovery based on Predictive Intelligence is enabled. Navigate to the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table and verify that the **sa\_ml.connection\_suggestions.active** property is set to **True**.

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

## About this task

Connection rules enhance the connection suggestions generated using Predictive Intelligence. Each rule contains a condition that describes an aspect of a traffic-based connection. The fields available in conditions come from the Connection Suggestion \[sa\_ml\_connection\_suggestion\] table, which is only populated when you run top-down discovery. You can base your rules directly on the connection suggestions. For example, create a rule for any connection with confidence level High. Alternatively, if you know which CIs must be part of the service instances, you can choose fields that point at these CIs.

For information about Service Mapping evaluating and applying connection rules, see [Traffic-based discovery in Service Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/traffic-based-discovery.md).

In addition to connection rules that add CIs to multiple services, you can [create rules for adding CIs to specific application services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/add-cis-connection-rules-single.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Service Mapping** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Connection Rules**.

    Alternatively, from a service application map, select **Suggestions** &gt; **Global Rules**.

2.  Create a new connection rule by clicking **New**.

    Alternatively, customize an existing rule by clicking the rule name in the list.

    The Connection Rule form opens.

3.  Select **Active** to start using this connection rule.

    Service Mapping evaluates only active connection rules.

4.  Enter a unique and meaningful name in the **Name** field.

5.  Enter the value that Service Mapping uses for the sequence in the **Order** field.

6.  Configure the filter condition in the **Condition** area.

    1.  Select the field, operator, and the value.

        For example, to add outgoing connections for any Tomcat server, configure the following filtering condition.

        \[Omitted image "connection-rule-condition-example.png"\] Alt text: Filtering condition for Tomcat

    2.  To create an additional filtering condition, click **Add Filter Condition**.

    3.  To create an additional filtering condition using the OR operator, click **Add "OR" Clause**.

7.  Select `Global` from the **Scope** list.

8.  Specify services to which this connection rule doesn't apply.

    1.  Click **New** in the **Excluded Services** area.

        The Excluded Service form opens.

    2.  Select the relevant service from the **Discovered Application Service** list.

    3.  Click **Submit**.

9.  Click **Update**.


## What to do next

Verify that Service Mapping added CIs as expected by performing the following steps:

1.  After the scheduled jobs rediscover the application services, open the maps of the application services where you expected Service Mapping to add CIs.
2.  Check that CIs are added correctly based on the connection rules.
