# Service Mapping Workspace

The Service Mapping workspace provides a central location to streamline the process of mapping your application services. Use the visualizations and reports to analyze, monitor, and update your resources, create application services, and manage your service mapping tasks efficiently.

## Access

Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Mapping**.

## Key features and capabilities

-   **Machine Learning \(ML\) readiness**

    Confirm that your Machine Learning environment is prepared before you start to map application services.

-   **Detailed service maps**

    Drill down for detailed information on service maps across various categories.

-   **Automated Service Suggestions**

    Leverage Automated Service Suggestions to evaluate suggested application service candidates, using them to create application services or enhance existing ones.

-   **Improved resource utilization**

    Use unmapped servers linked to an application service candidate to create application services.

-   **Tag-based service mapping**

    Use the Tag-based mapping dashboard to map your organization's configuration items \(CIs\) into application services.

-   **Create a service instance or a unified service**
    -   Create a service instance to leverage your resources in unmapped services.
    -   Create a unified service from various sources. For more information, see: [Multi-source service mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/multi-source-service-mapping.md).

**Important:**

Access to tag-based service mapping in the Service Mapping workspace requires the installation of Service Mapping Plus version 1.16.3. For more information, see [Install Service Mapping Plus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/install-service-mapping-plus.md).

## Key metrics

-   **Mapped application services**

    The number of application services previously mapped. Select to view specific information about these services such as operational status and business criticality.

-   **ML-powered candidates**

    The number of application service candidates identified using the Automated Service Suggestions feature.

    **Note:** Starting with Service Mapping Plus version 1.16.3, the filtering process has been updated to include only the most relevant candidates, excluding any ignored or irrelevant ones. This enhancement requires the installation of ITOM Content Service.

-   **Mapped servers**

    The number of servers currently linked to an application service. Select the tile to view information such as operational status and owner. The **Mapped servers** tile is replaced with Now Assist metrics, once Now Assist is installed.

-   **Maps created by Now Assist**

    The number of service maps created by Now Assist. Select the tile to view the [Service Mapping AI Agent activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/sm-ai-specialist-activity-columns.md). This tile is available only when Now Assist is installed.

-   **Business app linked to service instance**

    The number of business applications with a CSDM relationship linked to a service instance. Select the tile to view the [Business App Map Agent activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/sm-ai-specialist-activity-columns.md). This tile is available only when Now Assist is installed.


## Service Mapping AI Agents

When Now Assist is installed, the **Service Mapping home** page displays the AI Agent activation panel. Use this panel to activate or deactivate AI agents that automate service mapping tasks. For more information, see [AI Agents for Service Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/service-mapping-ai-specialists.md).
