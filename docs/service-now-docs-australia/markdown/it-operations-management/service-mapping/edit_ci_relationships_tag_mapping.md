# Add or edit CI relationships in tag-based discovery

Activate pre-configured CI relationships that Service Mapping does not include by default or add additional relationships to use in the tag-based discovery process. For example, you can add a CI relationship between Linux servers and storage devices to discover servers hosting storage devices based on tags.

## Before you begin

Learn about default feature configuration in [Tag-based discovery in Service Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/tag-based-mapping.md).

**Note:** Starting with Service Mapping Plus version 1.16.3, take advantage of the Tag-based Service Mapping workspace to efficiently map you application services. For more information, see [Tag-based mapping in the Service Mapping Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/tag-based-mapping-dashboard.md) and [Tag-based discovery for the Service Mapping Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/tag-discovery-service-mapping-workspace.md).

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

## About this task

The Application Services \[svc\_traversal\_rules\] table appears filtered to show only CI relationships used for tag-based discovery. By default, preconfigured CI relationships used in tag-based discovery have the **true** value in the **Base System Rule** column. Use this information to create new CI relationships or to edit preconfigured CI relationships in tag-based discovery.

**Important:** You cannot delete or modify preconfigured CI relationships used for tag-based discovery from the Traversal Rules for Application Services \[svc\_traversal\_rules\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Service Mapping** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Tag-based Service Traversal Rules**.

    \[Omitted image "traversal-rules-application-services-table.png"\] Alt text: Table containing information on CI relationships used in tag-based discovery.

2.  Click the existing CI relationship that you want to modify or click **New** to use an additional CI relationship in the tag-based discovery process.

    To view default CI relationships, see [Preconfigured CI relationships in tag-based discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/ci_relationships_tag_mapping.md).

3.  Complete the **Traversal Rules for Application Services** form.

    To complete this form, see [Traversal Rules for Application Services form completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/traversal_rules_form_completion.md).

4.  Click **Submit**.


## What to do next

If you refine the default configuration after creating appliations based on tags, see [Recalculate previously created application services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/recalculate_application_services.md) for the next steps
