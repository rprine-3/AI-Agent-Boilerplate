# Provide entry points for mapping an application service

As an application service owner you may receive a request for information about entry points in an email notification. Provide information about entry points to enable administrators to start discovery of an application service.

## Before you begin

Role required: sm\_app\_owner or service\_mapping\_admin

## About this task

If information about service instance entry points is missing, an administrator cannot start mapping the service instance. In this case, the administrator sends a request for missing data from the service instance form, which creates a service process task assigned to you. You receive an email notification with the link to the Questionnaire page where you must enter the missing data. The most important information is about the entry points, however, any additional data about application service components, their connections, or usage is of help for the administrator. When you finish entering data in the Questionnaire and submit it, the system closes the service process task.

4.  To add information about any other components comprising this service instance, click the **Components** tab, and enter the relevant data there.

5.  When you finished entering the information, click **Actions**, and then select **Submit Questionnaire**.
