Deferred Discovery Cleanup \[sysauto\_script\_ba4bee737f0022008f1c3b19befa9108\]

</td><td>

Runs every minute. Detects and cancels discovery schedules on TCP connections that are not in the active state anymore \(5 minutes of no activity\).

</td><td>

Runs every minute. Updates the discovery status attribute for application services. The discovery status is calculated as the overall status over all endpoints that an service instance contains.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Flow Discovery Scheduler \[sysauto\_script\_74c676f0dbb0220060ff742eaf9619f2\]

</td><td>

Runs every 10 minutes. Triggers the network flow discovery and writes the data into the \[sa\_flow\_connector\] table. This scheduled job is disabled by default. Enable this scheduled job to discover CIs using Netflow as described in [Data collection and discovery using Netflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/data-collection-netflow-mapping.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Generate entry point candidates from netflow and netstat data \[sysauto\_script\_b0b95067c3d0030039a3553a81d3aeb5\]

</td><td>

Runs daily. Scans the TCP Connection \[cmdb\_tcp\] table and uses this data to generate entry points and store them in the Candidate Entry Points \[sa\_cand\_entry\_point\] table. This scheduled job supports generating entry points necessary for [mapping multiple application services \(in bulk\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/map-business-services-in-bulk.md). This scheduled job is enabled by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Save thread dumps \[sysauto\_script\_a49cd030c302020039a3553a81d3aefb\]

</td><td>

Not active by default. When enabled, collects thread dumps and stores the data in the \[sys\_thread\_dump\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

\[sm dedup tracker for specific discovery sources\]

</td><td>

In some cases, Service Mapping and third-party discovery or monitoring tools identify the same configuration item \(CI\) differently. It results in the CMDB application table containing two records for the same CI. This scheduled job scans the CMDB application tables that contain information about CIs identified as generic applications. If the scheduled job identifies duplicate records based on the CI type and the discovery source, it creates a deduplication task.

</td></tr><tr><td>

com.snc.sw.mapping.reaper.max\_reap\_size

Controls the MID Server selection algorithm used during top-down discovery. Keep this legacy property set to **False** to use the current MID Server selection algorithm.

 When set to true, Service Mapping uses the legacy MID Server selection algorithm and the MID affinity features have no effect, regardless of their configuration. This can result in incorrect MID Server identification in networks with overlapping IP ranges or reused IP addresses.
