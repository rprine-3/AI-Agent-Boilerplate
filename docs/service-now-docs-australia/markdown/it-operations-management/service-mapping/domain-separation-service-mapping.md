# Domain separation and Service Mapping

Domain separation is supported in Service Mapping. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic



-   Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
-   The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider \(SP\) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see [Application support for domain separation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/domain-separated-apps.md).

## How domain separation works in Service Mapping

In domain-separated environments, switch into relevant leaf domains to access actions related to mapping performed by Service Mapping. A leaf domain is a child domain of the lowest level, meaning it does not have any child domains itself.

Domain separation is handled in a slightly different way than simply configuring separate domains. Notice that you must select or specify the relevant leaf domain to perform the following mapping actions in domain-separated environments:

-   When creating an service instance, the service instance is assigned to the user's domain.
-   When manually adding a CI to an service instance, you can choose only CIs that belong to the service domain.
-   When manually adding connections to CIs to an service instance, users must belong to the same domain as the application service.
-   When transferring service definitions between instances, imported service instances and service groups are assigned to the user's domain.

## Domain separation and Automated Service Suggestions

Automated Service Suggestions supports domain separation. This means that:

-   The source and target process must reside in the same domain to create a connection.
-   The user can view only the data in the current domain.

**Note:** After installing Service Mapping Plus with domain separation support, verify that all content is in the appropriate domain. For a detailed explanation of the required steps, see the [Service mapping plus for domain separated instance \[KB1303398\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1303398) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Automated Service Suggestions supports domain separation starting with version 1.9.0. No support is currently offered for on-premise instances. Reach out to product management for further information.
