Verify that the necessary tables are populated with data according to the process explained in [CMDB-based mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/cmdb-based-mapping.md).

-   Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\) Connection \[cmdb\_tcp\] table
-   Running Process \[cmdb\_running\_process\] table
-   Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] table

Confirm that you have installed the Service Mapping Plus August 2024 version from the ServiceNow® Store.

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter.

2.  In the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, search for the **sa.topdown.enable\_cmdb\_based\_mapping** property.

3.  Set the **sa.topdown.enable\_cmdb\_based\_mapping** system property to configure Service Mapping to use the data in your CMDB.

    1.  Confirm that the **Type** field value is set to true\|false.

    2.  Set the **Value** field to `true`.
