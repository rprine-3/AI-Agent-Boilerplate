# Define criticality for application services

For each service instance, select a criticality level that reflects how important it is to your organization operations.

## Before you begin

Determine how important the application service is to your organization.

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

## About this task

Typically, you might assign high criticality to service instances, which impact your customer base or sales revenue, while giving low criticality to internal service instances causing minor inconvenience to organization employees. For example, you could set high criticality for a service instance that supports sales functionality using the organization web site. A service instance that provides internal printing for the organization employees could receive low criticality.

You can also use a criticality value to define recovery strategies.

    3.  Select the relevant application service.

    4.  Click **Additional Info**.
