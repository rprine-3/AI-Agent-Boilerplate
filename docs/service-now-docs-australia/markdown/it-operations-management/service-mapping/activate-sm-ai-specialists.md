# Activate AI Agents for Service Mapping

Activate the Service Mapping AI Agent and the Business App Mapping AI Agent from the Service Mapping home page to start automated service map creation.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, verify the following:

-   ITOM AI agents for Service Mapping \[sn\_sm\_gen\_ai, version 1.3.1 or later\] is installed as part of ServiceNow Otto for ITOM.
-   Service Mapping Plus version 1.20.0 or later is installed. The AI Agent UI is delivered through Service Mapping Plus.
-   Zurich Patch 9 or Australia Patch 2.

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

## About this task

The AI Agents are inactive by default. You can activate one or both AI Agents. After activation, the agents run automatically in the background without further input. You can deactivate an agent at any time.

**Note:** If the ITOM AI Agents for Service Mapping application is not installed, the **Support your team with an AI Agent** section does not appear on the home page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Mapping**.

2.  On the Service Mapping home page, locate the **Support your team with an AI Agent** section and expand the section.

    The section displays two cards: **Service Mapping AI Agent** and **Business App Mapping AI Agent**. Each card shows a description and an **Activate** button.

3.  On the card for the AI Agent you want to activate, select **Activate**.

    The button changes to **Deactivate** and an **Active** badge appears on the card. The AI Agent begins running in the background.

4.  Repeat the previous step for the second AI Agent.

    The activated AI Agents run automatically. You can monitor their activity in the list navigation under **AI Activity**.


## What to do next

To deactivate an AI Agent, select **Deactivate** on the respective card. The button returns to **Activate**.
