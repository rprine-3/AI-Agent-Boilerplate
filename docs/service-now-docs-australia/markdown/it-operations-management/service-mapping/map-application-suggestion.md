# Map application services based on Automated Service Suggestions

Map a new application service based on automatically generated suggestions. Use the Automated Service Suggestions or Service Fingerprints features to create a new application service or add to an existing service in a few clicks.

## Before you begin

-   Service Mapping Plus must be installed. For more information, see [Install Service Mapping Plus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/install-service-mapping-plus.md).
-   Confirm that the application is ready to discover and map application services. See [Application service readiness dashboard in configurable workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/readiness-dashboard-ml.md).

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

## About this task

In addition to being provided with automatically generated suggestions, you can also identify and choose an application service by using Service Fingerprints suggestions that include information about the components in the application service candidates. For more information, see [Automated Service Suggestions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/auto-serv-suggest.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Mapping**

2.  Select **ML powered candidates**.

    **Note:** Starting with Service Mapping Plus version 1.16.3, the filtering process has been updated to include only the most relevant candidates, excluding any ignored or irrelevant ones. This enhancement requires the installation of ITOM Content Service.

3.  Select an application service either based on candidate suggestions or identify services with desired component.
