# Entry point attributes

Service Mapping comes with a wide range of preconfigured entry point types that cover many commonly used applications. Check attribute definitions to correctly add entry points to your application services.

An entry point is a point where clients access a service instance. Entry points are stored as records in the Endpoint \[cmdb\_ci\_endpoint\] tables.

There are some general attributes shared by almost all entry point types as described in the following table:

<table id="table_wp1_4jd_tt"><thead><tr><th>

Attribute

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Host/Hostname/Host Name

</td><td>

The value of the target server on which the service is running. This value can contain a real host name, alias, IP, or VIP.**Important:** Do not use a localhost or loopback address \(127.0.0.1\) for discovery and mapping.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Port

</td><td>

The port number of the service that you want to discover.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

The name of the service that you want to discover.

</td></tr><tr><td>

URL

</td><td>

The URL of the service that you want to discover in the following format: http\(s\)://\(address\):\(port\). If you do not provide the port, the system uses the default port 443.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Network location

</td><td>

The location of the applicable subnetwork.**Note:** This field is optional and visible only if Network location is enabled.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>To configure entry points for subnetworks, see [Fine-tune Service Mapping with MID affinity and IP reuse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/network-location-mid-affinity-td-discovery.md).

There are some attributes which you configure differently depending on what entry point they relate to, as described in the following table:
