## Map application services containing Oracle Tuxedo platform

Map an application service containing an Oracle Tuxedo platform and verify that Service Mapping discovered all Tuxedo components correctly.

### Before you begin

-   On the ServiceNow AI Platform, configure [SSH credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).
-   \(Optional\) For discovering using the WinRM protocol, see [Configure WinRM trusted hosts on MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/enable-winRM-MID-servers.md).
-   \(If hosted on Unix\) Provide a user with the elevated rights for running commands described in [Service Mapping commands requiring a privileged user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/r_CommandsnCredentials.md).

Role required: service\_mapping\_admin

### Procedure

1.  Create a service instance.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Mapping** &gt; **Service Instances**.

    2.  Select **New**.

        The **Discoverable by Service Mapping** option is selected by default.

    3.  In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the service instance.

2.  Define the entry point for this application service:

    1.  Select the **Other Application** tile.

    2.  Select `TCP Endpoint` from the list.

    3.  Define the entry point as follows:

        -   A host of the server that hosts the Tuxedo process.
        -   A port on this server that the Tuxedo process opens.
    4.  Click **Add**.

    5.  Click **Save**.

3.  Click **Additional Info** on the left and clear the **Traffic based discovery** check box.

4.  Click **Update**.

5.  Verify that the mapping result is satisfactory:

    1.  Click **View Map** and wait until the mapping is complete.

        It may take a few minutes.

    2.  Review the application service map.


If the mapping result is not as you expected, perform basic troubleshooting.
