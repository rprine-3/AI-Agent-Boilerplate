# Reliability metrics in SLO Management

Learn about the reliability metrics and features that can help you track service health, respond to issues, and support business goals.

## Service reliability dashboard

The Service reliability dashboard displays a customizable, high-level view of service performance. It helps you monitor and manage reliability using visualizations that track service states, error budgets, and service level objectives \(SLOs\) over time.

The dashboard displays information about all services in Service Reliability Management \(SRM\). You can access the dashboard in Service Operations Workspace in the following ways:

-   Navigate to **Services \(\[Omitted image "icon-sr-services.png"\] Alt text: Services icon\)** &gt; **Service reliability**.
-   Navigate to **Home \(\[Omitted image "icon-sr-homepage.png"\] Alt text: Home icon\)** &gt; **Service reliability**

For more details, see [Visualizations in the Service reliability dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-level-objective-management/sr-service-dashboard-visualizations.md).

**Note:** You can also view SLO information for all services on the Services Overview tab. See [Working with SRM services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-work-services.md) for more information.

## Notification destinations

Notification destinations help keep teams informed about service reliability. Attach them to error budget policies to send notifications when a policy is breached.

To view and manage notification destinations in Service Operations Workspace, navigate to **Teams** &gt; **\[Your team\]** &gt; **SLO Notification destinations**.

Visit the following links to learn more about creating and working with notification destinations:

-   [Create a notification destination in SRM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-level-objective-management/create-notification-destination.md)
-   [Create SLOs, SLIs, and error budget policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-level-objective-management/sr-create-slo-sli.md)
-   [Notifications for breached error budgets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-level-objective-management/srm-notifications-messages.md)

## Reliability metrics tab

The Reliability metrics tab shows how well a specific service is meeting its reliability goals. Use it to track SLOs, service level indicators \(SLIs\), and error budgets for a service.

To view the Reliability metrics tab in Service Operations Workspace, navigate to **Services \(\[Omitted image "icon-sr-services.png"\] Alt text: Services icon\)** &gt; **\[Your service\]** &gt; **Reliability Metrics**.

See these links to learn more about what you can do in the Reliability metrics tab:

## Service level objectives table

On the Reliability metrics tab, the Service level objectives table includes the following details about the service SLOs:

-   **Name** - Name of the SLO. You can select the name to view the SLO record.
-   **Reliability** - Current state of the SLO. For example, stable, at risk, or critical.
-   **% Error budget remaining** - Percentage of the error budget still available in the current compliance period.
-   **Compliance period** - Time window used to calculate performance:
    -   Month - Current month, for example, if the current date is January 26, the month is January 1 through January 31.
    -   Rolling 7, 30, or 90 days - Number of days from the current date. For example, for rolling 7 days, the duration is 7 days back from the current date.
-   **SLI type** - Performance category being measured:
    -   Availability - Percentage of time your service or configuration item is available, also known as uptime.
    -   Errors - Frequency of your service errors.
    -   Latency - Time that it takes to service a request.
    -   Saturation - Fullness of your system, focusing on resource usage.
-   **Source type** - Origin of the data used to calculate the SLIs for this SLO:
    -   Alert - Uses alerts from integrated monitoring tools.
    -   Outage - Uses outages detected by monitoring tools and reported by users. An outage indicates when the service was unavailable. This source type excludes planned outages, such as scheduled maintenance.
-   **Updated** - The date and time the SLO was last edited.
-   **Updated by** - The user name of the person who last edited the SLO.
-   **State** - Status of the SLO. For example, running or retired.

**Note:** For performance purposes, SLO and SLI records \(\[sn\_sow\_srm\_slo\_history\] and \[sn\_sow\_srm\_sli\_metric\]\) are archived after one year and deleted five years later. Archived data is omitted from tables and visualizations.
