# Notifications for breached error budgets

Details about the notifications that teams receive for breached error budget policies.

## When notifications are sent

When a service or configuration item breaches its error budget policy and a notification destination is set, Service Reliability Management \(SRM\) sends a notification to the configured Microsoft Teams channel.

## Notification content

The message contains details about the breach to help team members learn about the issue and act. In Microsoft Teams, the message is titled `Error budget policy violation` and lists the following information:

-   Service level objective - Name of the service level objective \(SLO\), for example, `Navigation service availability 99.95`.
-   Service/CI - Name of the associated service or configuration time. Select the name to open the relevant service in SRM.
-   Policy name - Name of the error budget policy that was breached.
-   Error budget remaining - Percentage of error budget left at the time of the breach.
-   View SLO in ServiceNow - Link to view the SLO details in SRM.

## Sample notification

The following image is a sample notification in Microsoft Teams. It shows an error budget policy violation for the Cart service and details about the SLO and error budget remaining.
