# Manage SLO creator agent settings

Activate or deactivate the service level objective \(SLO\) creator agent and configure the notification settings.

## Before you begin

You must have ServiceNow Otto for ITOM and Service Reliability Management \(SRM\) installed on your instance. For more information, see [Install plugins for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-now-assist-feature-plugins.md) and [Install Service Reliability Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-install-sr-store-app.md).

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

For an overview of how and when the SLO creator agent generates SLOs, see [Generating service level objectives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-level-objective-management/now-assist-itom-slo-generation.md).

**Include a policy to email the assigned team if the error budget is less than or equal to 25%.**

</td><td>

Sends an email notification to the team assigned to the service or CI when the SLO error budget reaches 25% or lower.

**Email team managers when an SLO is generated, or the team if no manager is assigned.**

</td><td>

Sends an email notification when the agent generates a new SLO.If a team manager is assigned to the service or CI, the manager receives the notification. Otherwise, the notification is sent to the group email. If no group email exists, all group members with an email address receive the notification.
