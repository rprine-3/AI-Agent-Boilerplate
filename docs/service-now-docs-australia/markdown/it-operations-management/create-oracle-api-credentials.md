# Create Oracle API credentials

Create Oracle API credentials on the ServiceNow AI Platform to enable access to your Oracle resources during Oracle discovery.

## Before you begin

Verify that your OCI user has at least read-only access to all Oracle services. For information on access permissions, consult your system administrator.

Retrieve the following properties from the Oracle Cloud Console:

-   Tenancy Oracle Cloud Identifier \(Tenancy OCID\)
-   User OCID
-   Key fingerprint
-   Private key

For instructions on retrieving these properties, go to the [Oracle Help Center](https://docs.oracle.com/en/) and search for the "Required Keys and OCIDs" article.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Credentials**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select **Oracle API Credentials**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields with the property values you retrieved.
