# Proxy server configuration for MID Servers used for Cloud Discovery and Cloud Provisioning and Governance

You can configure the MID Server for Cloud Provisioning and Governance to use a proxy server. Using a proxy server supports all cloud-based activities such as running Discovery, billing downloads, provisioning virtual machines, and running life-cycle operations on virtual machines.

## Proxy server limitations

-   VMware Cloud is not supported.
-   Windows or Linux platforms only are supported.
-   The Google Cloud Console integration does not support downloading billing data.
-   Remote PowerShell scripts cannot be executed.
-   Custom APIs may not work.

**Note:**

SSH calls should not be routed through a proxy server, when using a private cloud environment that is on the same side of the proxy as the MID Server.

Set **mid.capi.skip\_proxy\_for\_ssh** to true to skip it. See [MID Server properties used by Service Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/mid-server-properties-service-mapping.md) for more information.

**mid.capi.skip\_proxy\_for\_ssh**:

-   Determines whether the MID Server skips the proxy server when routing SSH calls.
-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false
