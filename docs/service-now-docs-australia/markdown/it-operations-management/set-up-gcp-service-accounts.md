# Set up Google Cloud Platform service accounts

Create and configure cloud service accounts at ServiceNow AI Platform for the corresponding Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) service accounts.

GCP service account is a unique account typically used by an application or compute workload, such as a Compute Engine instance, rather than a user. A service account is identified by its email address, which is unique to the account. It’s used to authenticate and authorize interactions between your application and various GCP services.

## Verify the REST API Permissions

Download the [Cloud Discovery patterns spreadsheet](https://downloads.docs.servicenow.com/resource/enus/api/servicenow-discovery-patterns-api-details.xlsx) so you can grant user permissions required for running the Discovery patterns. In addition to permissions, the spreadsheet also includes useful information such as pattern names, types, CI Classes, and links to vendor documentation. New patterns are available quarterly, so check periodically to be sure you have the latest version of the spreadsheet.
