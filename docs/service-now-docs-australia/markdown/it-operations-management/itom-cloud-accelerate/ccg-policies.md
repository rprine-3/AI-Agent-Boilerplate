# Cloud Configuration Governance policies

Cloud Configuration Governance policy defines the non-compliant configurations for a given cloud resource type.

Each Cloud Configuration Governance policy contains the following information:

-   The cloud on which the resource is provisioned.
-   The cloud resource type.
-   Definition of the non-compliant configuration. For example, unencrypted Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) S3 buckets or insecure Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) accounts.
-   Definition of the audit violation \(policy violation\) report.

**Note:** Starting with Cloud Configuration Governance version 1.3.7, the base system contents are moved to the CCG Content Pack. Install the CCG Content Pack to access the base system Cloud Configuration Governance contents.

Cloud Configuration Governance provides several base system policies. You can either use these policies or create custom policies as per the needs of your organization. Depending on the need and your familiarity with the ServiceNow AI Platform, you can use any one of the following methods to create the policy:

-   [Create a policy with the condition builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-cloud-accelerate/ccg-create-policy-condition-builder.md)
-   [Create a policy with Integration Hub flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-cloud-accelerate/ccg-create-policy-ih-subflow.md)
-   [Create a policy through script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-cloud-accelerate/ccg-create-policy-through-script.md)

To use the policy, add the policy to a policy set. Each policy set can contain one or more policies. For more information on creating policy sets, see [Create policy set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-cloud-accelerate/create-ccg-policy-set.md).
