# Create a CI finder mapping

Use the CI finder mapping to link the resources fetched by the ServiceNow Cloud Configuration Governance scan runs with the appropriate Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) Configuration Items \(CIs\), if available. After you create the mapping, you can associate the reported configuration violations with the CIs to which they belong.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_itom\_ccg.scheduling\_admin or sn\_itom\_ccg.governor

## About this task

After creating a resource type in Cloud Configuration Governance, you can optionally create a CI finder mapping for the new resource type. Cloud Configuration governance calls the CI finder mapping script for all the resources fetched by the scan runs.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Cloud Configuration Governance** &gt; **CI Finder Mappings**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
