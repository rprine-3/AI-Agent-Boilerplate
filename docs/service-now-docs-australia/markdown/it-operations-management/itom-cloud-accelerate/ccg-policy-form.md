Conditions for reporting the non-compliant cloud resource configuration. Always specify the key and value in a pair. Use the **OR** operator and the **AND** operator to perform logical operations in the policy condition.

 **Syntax**

 ```
Key is <key_name>
<data_type> Value <condition> <value>

```

 For example,

 ```
Key is AWS:IAM:User:PasswordEnabled
Boolean Value is true

```

 You can create script includes to externalize the decision making and reuse the code across different scripts. For more information on creating the script includes, see [Script includes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_ScriptIncludes.md).

 **Note:** If you create a custom audit result record through the script, then the **Audit Violation Reporting** configuration defined in the policy doesn’t take effect.
