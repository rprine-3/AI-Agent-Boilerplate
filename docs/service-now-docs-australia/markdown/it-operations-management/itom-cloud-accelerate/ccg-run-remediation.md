# Run remediation

Run the appropriate remediation action to fix the non-compliant cloud configuration identified during the Cloud Configuration Governance scan run.

## Before you begin

-   The scan run is complete
-   Role required: sn\_itom\_ccg.ccg\_operator

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Configuration Governance** &gt; **Scan Run**.

2.  Open the scan run during which **Cloud Configuration Governance** reported the audit issues.

3.  Select **Show audit results**.

4.  Select the violation type that you want to fix.

    Cloud Configuration Governance groups the violations per the violation type. During a remediation run, you can fix one or more violations of the same type only.

5.  Select one or more violations.

6.  Select **Remediate**.

    **Note:** You can select **Ignore for Now** to ignore the issue. When you ignore an issue, Cloud Configuration Governance doesn't report the issue as a violation and it is not represented in the dashboard reports.

7.  Review the list of resources selected for remediation.

8.  Select the remediation action.

9.  Select **OK**.
