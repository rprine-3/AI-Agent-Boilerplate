# SRM alert states

Alert can be in a few different states depending on how they are acted on.

An alert is created in SRM when a third-party monitoring tool has an event. Alerts are manually assigned. An alert is one of four states. You can edit actions from either the Alerts list or the Alert form. Use the **Save** button in the form to keep any changes you've made. Changes to Alerts in the list view are automatically saved.

**Note:** You can acknowledge and assign an alert in any state.
