# Create an SRM on-call schedule

Set up an on-call schedule to make sure that someone is available to respond to incidents and critical alerts.

## Before you begin

Before creating an on-call schedule, a team must exist in Service Reliability Management \(SRM\). The Alert table \[em\_alert\] must also be added to the Trigger Rule Table Config list. See [Add an SRM team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-create-team.md) and [Add alert table to enable on-call scheduling for Service Operations Workspace for ITOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/add-alert-table-oncall.md) for more information.

Role required: srm\_manager, srm\_responder, or srm\_admin

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** &gt; **Teams \(\[Omitted image "icon-sr-teams.png"\] Alt text: Teams icon\)**.

2.  On the Teams page, select your team.

3.  Select the **Schedule** tab and then select **Create shift**.

4.  In the Create new dialog, select either **Create new** or **Use template**.

    Your system admin can create predefined templates for you to use to create shifts.

5.  Fill in the fields.
