# Resolve an SRM incident

Resolve an incident, if you need it reviewed, or you think it has already been handled, but aren't ready to close it.

## Before you begin

Role required: srm\_manager, srm\_responder, or srm\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

    You're taken to your SRM Home page.

    **Note:** If you use other Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) applications, you may see the SOW Home page instead of the SRM Home page. The SOW Home page includes SRM alerts and incidents in its metrics.

2.  From the primary navigation, select **Reliability tasks** \(\[Omitted image "icon-sr-reliability-tasks.png"\] Alt text: Reliability tasks icon\).

3.  Select the **Incidents** tab.

4.  You have two options.

**In the incident list view**

</td><td>

1.  Double-click the **State** field \(or use the keyboard shortcut\) for the incident and select from the list menu.
2.  Select **OK**.
 **Tip:** If you have the srm\_admin role, you can update multiple incidents at once. First, select the relevant incidents and select **Edit**. Then use the **State** drop-down to choose the appropriate value and select **Update**.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d426604e149">

**In the incident form**

</td><td>

1.  Select a new **State** field value from the list menu.
2.  Select **Save**.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    For value choices, see [SRM incidents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-incidents-workspace.md).

    The new state is displayed in the incident list view, incident form, and form header.


## Result

Resolved incidents remain in the Incidents list view. Check your filters if you don't see them.

**Note:**

When you resolve an incident, the related alerts remain open until you close the incident.
