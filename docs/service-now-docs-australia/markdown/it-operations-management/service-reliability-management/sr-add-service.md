# Add a service to SRM

Add services to Service Reliability Management \(SRM\) to help your teams manage service health.

## Before you begin

If you’re adding atechnology management service to SRM, make sure it doesn’t have a support group. You assign the support group when you add the service to SRM.

Role required: srm\_manager, srm\_responder, or srm\_admin

## About this task

Add a service to SRM to assign it to your teams and let them access its incidents and alerts. You can either create a service or import an existing one. SRM supports both service instances and technology management services:

-   Service instances - Business-facing services, such as an HR portal. Service instances often have multiple infrastructure components.
-   Technology management services - IT-focused services that support a business service or service instance. For example, an authentication service or database service.

When you add a technology management service to SRM, you also add its offerings. Offerings are specific components within a parent technology management service. For example, Spam filtering is an offering within the Email technology management service. In SRM, you can assign a parent technology management service and its offerings to different teams.

**Note:** When you import an existingtechnology management service, itsofferings don’t inherit its support group. Offerings either keep their existing support group or, if they don’t have one, you must assign it before setting up Service Level Objectives \(SLOs\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

    You're taken to your SRM Home page.

    **Note:** If you use other Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) applications, you may see the SOW Home page instead of the SRM Home page. The SOW Home page includes SRM alerts and incidents in its metrics.

2.  Select the Services icon \[Omitted image "icon-sr-services.png"\] Alt text: Services page icon and then select **Add**.

3.  In the Add services for your teams modal, you can either create a service or add existing services.

2.  Fill in the fields. For field descriptions, see [Add service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-add-service-form.md).

1.  Select **Select existing services**.
2.  Search for and select your service. You can add more than one.
3.  Select **Next**.
 **Tip:** Select the search box to view up to 25 services not yet in SRM, ordered by creation time. After you enter three characters, it shows up to 25 matching results. Both lists can include services with or without a support group. If a service has one, the support group can be an SRM team or a group outside SRM.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  In the Assign a team step, assign your service to an existing or new support group.

    In SRM, support groups are also known as teams.

    |Option|Steps|
    |------|-----|
    |**Select an existing team**|Enter your team's name in the search box.|
    |**Create a team**|Select **Create a team**. For more information about creating teams, see [Add an SRM team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-create-team.md).|

5.  Select **Add service**.

    If approvals aren't enabled, your service appears in the service list. If approvals are enabled, your request is sent for approval. After it's approved, the service appears in the services list.

    **Note:** If you added atechnology management service, itsofferings appear in the Offerings tab on the parenttechnology management service's page. Offerings also appear in the services list. To viewan offering without an assigned support group, remove all filters from the services list.


## What to do next

Ifan offering doesn't have a support group, assign it to a support group before setting up SLOs. For how to assign support groups, see [Edit service details in SRM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-edit-service.md).

You can also add integrations to your service to start monitoring its health.
