# Exploring Service Reliability Management

Service Reliability Management \(SRM\) provides a self-serve, guided experience for teams to manage service health. The experience is built using the Service Operations Workspace application and combines ITOM and ITSM capabilities into a single workflow.

## SRM overview

Optimize service health with site reliability engineering \(SRE\) practices. SRM is a single operations workspace that empowers teams to improve the reliability of digital services with SRE.

-   Use on-call escalations to respond to issues in a timely manner.
-   Reduce setup friction with guided self-service to onboard distributed teams with separated data, empowered access, and minimal governance from central IT.

When SRM is installed, several plugins and applications are also activated. For more information, see [Plugins or applications installed with ITOM AIOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/plugin-app-itom-health.md).

## SRM users

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

admin

</td><td>

ServiceNow administrators manage, configure, and maintain the ServiceNow platform. In SRM, they can access and work in the Service Operations Workspace Admin Center. Only administrators can do the following:

-   Install SRM.
-   Add and manage SRM administrators.
-   Create and manage integration users.

</td><td>

All

</td></tr><tr><td>

SRM administrator \[srm\_admin\]**Note:** This role differs from the ServiceNow admin role.

</td><td>

SRM administrators can manage account settings, configurations, and users.

 Administrators can perform the following actions:

-   Access, create, edit, or delete all SRM configurations.
-   Add or manage integrations.
-   Create integrations with Application Performance Monitoring \(APM\) tools.
-   Set up and maintain reliability metrics.
-   Set up and maintain error budget policies.

</td><td>

-   Manager
-   Responder

</td></tr><tr><td>

SRM manager \[srm\_manager\]

</td><td>

Managers oversee a team of SREs. Managers assign SREs to the team on-call schedule, monitor their performance, and create procedures to handle incidents and develop solutions. Managers promote resilience across all the systems and the DevOps workflows.Managers can perform the following actions within the context of their teams:

-   Define and set up teams, on-call schedules, and services.
-   Add and delete users such as responders and managers for the teams they're a part of.
-   Add or manage integrations.
-   Create Integrations with Application Performance Monitoring \(APM\) tools.
-   Set up and maintain reliability metrics.
-   Set up and maintain error budget policies.

</td><td>

Responder

</td></tr><tr><td>

SRM responder \[srm\_responder\]

</td><td>

A Service Reliability Engineer \(SRE\) that uses SRM to perform everyday tasks. Responders are the individuals who are on call and diagnose and remediate incidents.

 Responders can only access configurations that they’re a part of. They can only access the alerts or incidents for which they have permissions.

 SREs can perform the following actions, within the context of their teams:

-   Set up services, teams, and integrations.
-   Confirm their on-call schedules.
-   Manage incident and alert records.
-   Update teams that they’ve created.
-   Add other responders.
-   Create integrations with Application Performance Monitoring \(APM\) tools.
-   Set up and maintain reliability metrics.
-   Set up and maintain error budget actions.

Inherits 17 roles including the following:

-   cmdb\_read
-   sn\_sow.sow\_user
-   sn\_sow\_srm.srm\_responder
-   workspace\_user
-   slo\_operator

## SRM workflow

\[Omitted image "sr-explore-workfflows.png"\] Alt text: Infographic showing how responders, managers, and administrators manage teams, register services, define SLO, monitor integrations, respond to notifications, and remediate incidents. For details, refer to the following description.

1.  Product teams in IT or Lines of Business continuously deliver newservice instances and technology management services. Example: New customer billing portal.
2.  Along with SLO Management, teams can register services and define service level objectives \(SLOs\), helping them reach business outcomes. Example: 95% monthly availability for the billing portal.
3.  Monitoring integrations are set up by the teams to collect the real-time health of these services. Example: Cloud Observability.
4.  Monitoring creates service level indicators \(SLIs\) impacting alerts when services are underperforming. Automation groups and enriches. Example: Billing portal latency is exceeding 7 s.
5.  When the alerts indicate an outage or customer-impacting degradation, incidents are created and on-call notifications notify appropriate team resources. Example: A Billing SRE team is notified via phone of a latency issue on the billing portal.
6.  After teams collaboratively diagnose and remediate incidents, they identify action items for improving the system's resilience. Example: The Billing team decides to add additional web server capacity.
7.  Management continually reviews SLO performance, helps to prevent changes when the error budget is exhausted, and prioritizes improvement initiatives for underperforming services.
