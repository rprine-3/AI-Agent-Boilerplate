# Configure fields for escalation triggers

Configure additional fields for on-call escalation triggers in Service Reliability Management \(SRM\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Configure additional fields that teams can use when setting up escalation triggers. By default, escalation triggers run only when the Assignment group field changes. Completing the following procedure makes other fields available, giving teams more flexibility and helping them respond to issues quickly.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **On-Call Scheduling** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Trigger Rule Table Config**.

2.  Select **em\_alert** or **incident** to configure additional trigger fields for alerts or incidents.

3.  In **Trigger condition fields**, add fields from the following table.

    **Note:** Selecting fields not listed in the table might cause performance issues.

<table id="choicetable_uxy_qdw_3hc"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d406012e110">

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Select **Update** to save your changes.

    The selected fields now appear as options for teams configuring escalation triggers.
