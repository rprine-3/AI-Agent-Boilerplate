# Reassign an SRM incident

Reassign an incident to a responder when the incident tasks should be addressed by a particular team member.

## Before you begin

This action is available when the **Assigned to** field in the incident is populated.

Role required: srm\_manager, srm\_responder, or srm\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

    You're taken to your SRM Home page.

    **Note:** If you use other Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) applications, you may see the SOW Home page instead of the SRM Home page. The SOW Home page includes SRM alerts and incidents in its metrics.

2.  From the primary navigation, select **Reliability tasks** \(\[Omitted image "icon-sr-reliability-tasks.png"\] Alt text: Reliability tasks icon\).

3.  Select the **Incidents** tab.

4.  You have two options.
