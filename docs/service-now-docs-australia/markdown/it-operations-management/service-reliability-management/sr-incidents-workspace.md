# SRM incidents

Track and collaborate on incidents in the Incidents tab, helping you and your teams resolve issues efficiently.

The Incidents tab appears in the Service Reliability Management \(SRM\) Reliability tasks page. Its top header shows description information, tags, priority information, state, service, and assignment group.

**Note:** Tags are imported from third-party integrations and attached to incidents. However, you can also create tags to categorize data and drive system logic using the Tag icon \[Omitted image "icon-sr-tag.png"\] Alt text: Tag icon. For more information on creating and viewing tags, see [Manually create SRM tags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-create-tags.md).

When selecting an incident, you're taken to an overview. This section contains three content panels: Summary, Activity, and Recommended actions.

**Note:** When an editable field is updated, notifications are sent based on user notification preferences.

In the Impact Summary, you find the following information:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Configuration item|Name of and link to the configuration item associated with this incident.|
