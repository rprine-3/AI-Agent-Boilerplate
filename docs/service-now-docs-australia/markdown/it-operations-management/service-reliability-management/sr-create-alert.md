# Manually create an SRM alert

Create an alert for testing purposes or if you think an issue poses a risk.

## Before you begin

Role required: srm\_admin, srm\_manager, or srm\_responder

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

    You're taken to your SRM Home page.

    **Note:** If you use other Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) applications, you may see the SOW Home page instead of the SRM Home page. The SOW Home page includes SRM alerts and incidents in its metrics.

2.  In the navigation pane, select **Services**.

3.  Select the service that you want to trigger an alert for.

4.  Select the **Related alerts** tab.

5.  Select **Trigger alert** and fill out the **Trigger an alert** form.

    To trigger an alert, you must first create an event to get processed. Only **Service** is required.
