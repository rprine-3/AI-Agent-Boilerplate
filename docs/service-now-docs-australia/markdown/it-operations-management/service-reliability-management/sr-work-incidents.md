# Working with incidents in SRM

Plan ahead of service disruptions and have SRM send notifications and create status when incidents occur. Distractions are minimized and teams stay focused on remediation.

You can manually create incidents within SRM or create an error budget action to do so. See [Manually create an SRM incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-create-incident.md) or [Create SLOs, SLIs, and error budget policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-level-objective-management/sr-create-slo-sli.md) for more information.

-   [Manual creation from an alert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/open-incident.md).
-   [Manual creation from the incident view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-create-incident.md).
-   Automatically from Alert automations, if Alert automations are installed.

The **Assigned to** field on an incident specify who should be notified. When a team is selected as a responder, team automations are checked to determine which schedule to use for the notifications.

**Note:**

The **Assigned to** field is cleared when the **Assigned-team** or **Service** field is updated on an incident. Escalation policies for the newly assigned teams run. The field remains cleared until a user on the new team acknowledges an escalation notification.

If the Service is changed and the new Service does not have an assigned team, no changes occur.

When a service is deleted, its integrations, alerts, incidents, and automations are removed. Deleting a service isn't a recoverable action so consider deactivating the service instead.

Responders and above are notified for updates to incidents based on their notification preferences. If you made the update, you won't be notified.

You can resolve incidents by selecting specific incidents or in bulk. See [Resolve an SRM incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-resolve-incident.md), or [Close an SRM incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-close-incident.md) or [Cancel an SRM incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-cancel-incident.md).

**Note:**

Incidents in the **Resolved** state are automatically closed after 3 days.

For more information on the areas and fields available in an incident, see [SRM incidents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-reliability-management/sr-incidents-workspace.md).
