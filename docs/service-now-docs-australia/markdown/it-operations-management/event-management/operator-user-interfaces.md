</table>## The Service Operations Workspace dashboard

Your main area of work is the Service Operations Workspace dashboard, which provides a view that focuses on how alerts relate to application services. From here, you can drill into each application services to see the affected CIs and get an understanding of the overall impact of whatever caused the alert. To open the dashboard, navigate to **Event Management** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

    The banner contains controls that show or hide application services based on the criteria you select:

<table id="table_jfs_jyq_hdb"><tbody><tr><td>

Click a severity level to show or hide application services based on the alerts associated with them.

Use the **Group** and **Segment** controls to organize the view.

 **Note:** Your administrator assigns an application the criticality and cost value to your application services.

</table>-   **Application services**

    The Service Operations Workspace dashboard displays tiles that represent application services. The color of a tile represents the severity of the alerts that are associated with the application service.

<table id="table_zkt_jlr_hdb"><tbody><tr><td>

You can filter or sort the list to find an alert. Sort by any alert details, such as the **Priority**, which considers multiple factors for how serious the alert is. You can also sort by the **Severity**, which is the value provided by the event monitoring tool.

 \[Omitted image "sort-by-severity.png"\] Alt text: Sort icon
