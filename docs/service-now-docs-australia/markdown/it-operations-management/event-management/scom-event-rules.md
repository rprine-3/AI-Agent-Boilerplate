# SCOM metric event rules

The base system comes with Microsoft System Center Operations Manager \(SCOM\) metric event rules. SCOM metric event rules bind event metrics to configuration items \(CIs\).

When an event's metrics match the event filter conditions, the metrics bind to the indicated CI. The event rules that come with the base system are:

|Rule Name|CI type|
|---------|-------|
|SCOM Metrics - Windows Server|cmdb\_ci\_win\_server|
|SCOM Metrics - IIS Web Server|cmdb\_ci\_microsoft\_iis\_web\_server|
|SCOM Metrics - SQL Server Reporting Services|cmdb\_ci\_db\_mssql\_reporting|
|SCOM Metrics - MS SQL Database|cmdb\_ci\_db\_mssql\_database|
|SCOM Metrics - MSFT SQL Instance|cmdb\_ci\_db\_mssql\_instance|

You can create a custom event rule to bind metrics with other CI types. For details, see [Create or edit an event rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-or-edit-event-rule.md).

If the event rule filter doesn't match, the default rule, **SCOM Metrics - Default** \(CI type = **cmdb\_ci\_hardware**\) is invoked. The order number of the default event rule must be higher than the order number of any SCOM event rules. This includes both base system rules and custom rules. This ensures that all other rules are checked for matching before invoking the default rule. For details on event rules, see [Event rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-event-rules.md).
