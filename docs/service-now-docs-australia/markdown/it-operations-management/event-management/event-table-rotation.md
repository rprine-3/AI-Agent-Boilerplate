# Modify event table rotation

Table rotation is used by Event Management, by default, to contain the growth of event \[em\_event\] tables within the rotation table group.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Table rotation ensures that event tables grow to a reasonable size.

Each table rotation has a schedule, according to which new data is written to one of the tables in the rotation group. A table rotation group includes the original table plus several additional tables. After the rotation procedure has written the last table in a rotation, the rotation overwrites the first table in the rotation. By default, the table rotation for Event Management is to rotate the em\_table to an offload table and the base table cleanup takes place after seven table rotations. For information about backing up events to a custom table, see [Event Management configuration preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/r_EMBestPractice.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Table Rotations**.

2.  Select the \[em\_event\] table rotation group to modify.

3.  Edit the required fields.

4.  Select **Update**.
