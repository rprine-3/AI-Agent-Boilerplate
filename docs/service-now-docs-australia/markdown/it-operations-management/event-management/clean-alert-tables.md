# Clean alert history and impact status tables

Schedule jobs to mark and remove old alert records in the Alert History \[em\_alert\_history\] and Impact Status \[em\_impact\_status\] tables, to prevent the tables from becoming overloaded with data.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Schedule the following jobs to remove old alert records:

-   **Backfill**: Determines when alerts are to be marked for deletion.
-   **Clean**: Deletes the alerts.

**Note:** The records in the \[em\_alert\_history\] and \[em\_impact\_status\] tables are deleted by default after three months. This is controlled by the properties **evt\_mgmt.impact\_calculation.cleanup\_age\_seconds.em\_alert\_history** and **evt\_mgmt.impact\_calculation.cleanup\_age\_seconds.em\_impact\_status**. The default value is 7,776,000 seconds \(equivalent to 90 days\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

    The **Scheduled Jobs** page appears.

2.  To determine how often to mark alerts for deletion on the **Impact Status** table:

    1.  Locate and select the **Event Management - Backfill Impact Status Table** job.
