# Integrate Sentry events

Integrate Sentry with Event Management by adding a standard webhook in the Sentry platform.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the Event Management Connectors \(sn\_em\_connector\) plugin is installed on the ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

Discovery for Sentry services are not supported. You must create a CI manually in the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_auto\] table to enable binding by completing the following steps:

1.  From the navigation bar, go to **Configuration/Application Service**.
2.  Provide the project name you are monitoring on the Sentry application.
3.  Set the operational status to **Operational**.
4.  Click **Next** then **Done**.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Configure Event Management for the collection of events from Sentry by authenticating Sentry as a data source. In your Sentry platform, use a standard webhook to set your ServiceNow AI Platform as the rest endpoint.

## Procedure

1.  In the Sentry console, create an internal integration.

    1.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Developer Settings**.

    2.  Click **New Internal Integration**.

    3.  In the Internal Integration Details section, on the Sentry Integration Details page, fill in the fields.
