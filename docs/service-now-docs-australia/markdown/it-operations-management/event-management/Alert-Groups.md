# Alert grouping types and creation methods

Explore different alert grouping types, understand their descriptions, and learn about their creation methods to enhance problem identification and streamline alert management.

## Viewing and managing alert groups

Navigate to **Event Management** &gt; **All Alerts** to view all alert groups. The icon in the **Group** column denotes the alert group type, while alerts not associated with any group have no entry in the **Group** column. Double-click the **Group** column to open the Grouped Alerts dialog, where you can view all alerts in the group and manually add or remove alerts.

**Note:** An alert can belong to only one alert group at a time.
