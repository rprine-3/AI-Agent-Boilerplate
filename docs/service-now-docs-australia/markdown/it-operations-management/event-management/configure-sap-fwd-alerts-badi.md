2.  In the ribbon at the top of the System Monitoring configuration page, select **2 Configure Infrastructure** &gt; **2.3 Default Settings**.

    The **Default Settings** page appears.

    2.  Select the **Third-Party Components** tab.

    3.  Click **Add** and add the following value as the third-party connector: `Implementation: BADI Definition for Alert Reactions ZSNOW with scope = All Alerts and Metrics`.

    4.  Click **Save** to activate third-party components globally.

4.  Define the objects to which the monitoring template will be assigned.

    2.  Select the managed object to which you want to assign the monitoring template.

        The monitoring template is assigned to the selected objects.

5.  Reactivate the monitoring of templates.

    1.  Select **6 Setup Monitoring**.

    2.  Search for and locate entries with **Setup Status = Reconfigure Required** and assign the monitoring template to those entries.

    3.  Select **Apply** and **Activate**.

        When the jobs finish, verify that the **Assignment Status** is green.

        All templates and active alerts assigned to the selected objects use the new forwarding method.
