# View discovered service history

The discovered service history shows the frequency of discovered services for a particular time period.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin, evt\_mgmt\_operator, or evt\_mgmt\_user

## About this task

The discovered services history appears only when there are multiple discovered services that occur over a period. A discovered service is a service that is discovered by Service Mapping. The discovered services history is not available for application services. If no discovered services are generated for a particular service, the discovered services history is hidden.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  Click a service tile and click **Service Map**.

3.  Click the **History map** button.

    The history timeline appears, with changes to the service indicated by a clock icon \(\[Omitted image "clock-icon.png"\] Alt text: Clock icon\).

    The displayed color corresponds to the discovered services severity. The length of the bar in each color corresponds to how long the discovered services stayed at that severity.

    The following table explains the severity colors:

    |Severity|Icon color|
    |--------|----------|
    |Critical|Red \[Omitted image "red-critical-icon.png"\] Alt text: Red icon - Critical severity|
    |Major|Orange \[Omitted image "orange-major-icon.png"\] Alt text: Orange icon - Major severity|
    |Minor|Yellow \[Omitted image "yellow-minor-icon.png"\] Alt text: Yellow icon - Minor severity|
    |Warning|Blue \[Omitted image "blue-warning-icon.png"\] Alt text: Blue icon - Warning severity|

5.  To change the information that appears on the discovered services history Advanced map, click a history icon.
