# Create or edit CI remediation

Create a CI remediation rule that lets users manually apply an Orchestration workflow for resolving issues with specific CIs associated with alerts. Define these CIs in the CI filter conditions of the rule.

## Before you begin

Create the workflow to remediate CIs. In the workflow settings, select **Remediation Task \[em\_remediation\_task\]** in the **Table** field.

Then submit the workflow definition, and add the following conditions to the workflow properties:

-   **\[Run Remediation\]\[is\]\[true\]**
-   **\[Workflow\]\[is\]\[&lt;name of the new workflow that you just created&gt;\]**

    For example, if the name of the workflow is `CI remediation`, add this condition:

    **\[Workflow\]\[is\]\[CI remediation\]**


After you finish configuring the workflow, make sure that you publish it. For more details, see Create a workflow.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

A CI remediation rule associates a set of CIs that might experience problems with a remediation workflow. The remediation workflow can either resolve the underlying problem or help troubleshoot the problem that generated the alert. For example, you can proactively configure a workflow with the appropriate response actions for predictable alerts. For more details, see the [Event Management Remediation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXboAU_R_74) short video.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **CI Remediations**.

2.  Click **New**, or select a CI remediation to edit.

3.  Fill in the fields, and click **Submit** or **Update**.

    |Control|Description|
    |-------|-----------|
    |CI filter|Conditions to match the CIs that you want to apply this remediation to.|
    |Orchestration workflow|The remediation workflow to apply to CIs that match the filter conditions.|


## Result

In service maps that are opened from the Event Management dashboard, this remediation can be applied to any CIs that match the filter conditions.
