# Refresh event rules

Manually update event rules to reflect current event information because once an event rule is created, the **Event Additional info** and **Event Raw info** fields are not automatically updated.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

**Note:** Use [Ignore automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-ignore-automation-sow-itom.md) and [Enrich automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/enrich-alert-sow-itom.md) in Service Operations Workspace, the updated way to automatically filter out irrelevant alerts, or to transform and standardize alert data for better response.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **All Events**.

2.  Select the event.

3.  Select **Refresh Event Rule**.

4.  Select the event rules to refresh.

5.  Select **Refresh Selected**.

    If you selected multiple event rules, then the last selected item in the list opens in the Event Rule Designer.

    **Note:** If the current event rule regex expressions do not match the selected event after the refresh, the update fails and an error message appears specifying the problematic fields. This safeguard ensures that your previously defined event rule regex expressions are not broken due to the refresh.
