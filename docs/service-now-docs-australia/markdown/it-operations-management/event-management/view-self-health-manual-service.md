# View the Event Management self-health application services map

You can view Event Management application services maps to visualize configuration items \(CIs\) that comprise this service. The maps show the relations and connections between these CIs.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

The Event Management application services topology map only displays MID Servers that have passed validation and connectors that are active.

## About this task

The Event Management components that are monitored by the self-health application services are listed in the following table:

<table id="table_znl_gzs_ncb"><thead><tr><th>

Component

</th><th>

What is monitored

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Event connectors

</td><td>

For each connector:-   Status: Success or Error
-   Delay: Elapsed time from ‘last run time’ \(above threshold\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Event processing jobs

</td><td>

For each event processing job:-   Number of actual jobs executed compared to the number of jobs configured to run.
-   Delay of any of the event processing jobs above the time set as threshold.
-   Duration of events in Ready state compared to the specified threshold.
-   Delay of event rule processing above the set threshold. If there is a delay, an alert is generated and the event rule is disabled.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Servers

</td><td>

MID Servers that have been validated are displayed. The MID Server status and the `Ecc_agent_issue` table are monitored. An event is triggered whenever this table is updated. The MID Server status is displayed, either **Up** or **Down**.For information about MID Server health, see [MID Server heartbeat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerHeartbeat.md)

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Services** &gt; **Application Services**.

2.  Click the **ServiceNow Event Management** application services.

3.  On the **Application Services** page, locate **ServiceNow Event Management** and click **View Service**.

    \[Omitted image "application-service.png"\] Alt text: Event Management health — application service

    Displayed on the map are the related MID Servers and the Event Management object, as depicted in the following image; these MID Servers have an **UP** status. MID Servers are updated when they are created or deactivated.

    \[Omitted image "view-map.png"\] Alt text: Event Management application service map

    Under the Event Management object is Event Processing, Alert Processing, and Event Sources \(for example, connectors\). Only **Active** connectors are shown; when a connector is created, the connector is displayed only after it has been activated. The status of active connectors is updated and the status of non-active connectors is not displayed.

    In the preceding image, the health of Event Management components is displayed. The omniConnector component has a red bar, indicating that a critical alert has occurred that affects this connector. In addition, this critical alert impacts the parent Alert Processing object, which as a result, has a red bar.


## Result

You can select the configuration item that has a critical alert and change the impact from parent to application service.
