# Alert lifecycle configuration

Event Management provides various modules, templates, and properties for configuring alerts and the actions that execute for these alerts.

-   **[Configure the alert active interval](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/t_EMSetTheAlertActiveInterval.md)**  
The active interval property \(**evt\_mgmt.active\_interval**\) determines how Event Management handles a new event that is similar to events that appear on an existing closed alert. The system either reopens the alert and adds the event information to it, or creates a new alert.
-   **[Configure alert flapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/t_EMConfigAlertStateFlapDetect.md)**  
Set flapping properties to determine when an alert enters and exits the flapping state. Flapping can indicate configuration problems \(that is, thresholds set too low\), troublesome services, or real network problems.
