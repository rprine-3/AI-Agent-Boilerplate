# View the Dependency map for CMDB alerts

The Dependency map illustrates how and why alerts are grouped, simplifying troubleshooting and issue management. It reveals connections between CIs within a CMDB alert group, enhancing visibility into their relationships. Additionally, if a CI is not part of the group but connects to other alert CIs, it remains visible on the map, aiding alert resolution and proactive management.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_user, evt\_mgmt\_operator

## About this task

To create CMDB-based alert grouping, you can also create a grouping automation in Service Operations Workspace. For more information, see [Create Group automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/group-alert-sow-itom.md).

## Procedure

2.  Search for the CMDB group.

3.  Open a CMDB group alert.
