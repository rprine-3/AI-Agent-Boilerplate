# Create integration account

Create a dedicated account with the evt\_mgmt\_integration role for third-party monitoring systems to push events to ServiceNow.

## Before you begin

Verify you have installed the ITOM AIOps and ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) plugins.

Ensure you're in the Configure IT Operations Management page.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

A dedicated integration account ensures third-party monitoring systems have secure, stable, and appropriately scoped access to push events into ServiceNow without relying on personal user accounts.

**Note:** Create an integration account user only if you plan to use basic authentication. This step is not required if you're using API keys or OAuth. If you prefer those methods, refer to the corresponding documentation for setup instructions.

6.  In the **Password** field, enter the password for the integration account.

7.  Select **Create account**.
