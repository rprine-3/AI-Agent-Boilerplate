# View patterns for event group creation

Event groups are sets of events that do not have a matching event rule. You can view the patterns in a group of events to learn the impact of creating a rule based on the event source and description patterns.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin, evt\_mgmt\_operator, or evt\_mgmt\_user

## About this task

Events are grouped according to their source and description.

**Note:** Use [Ignore automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-ignore-automation-sow-itom.md) and [Enrich automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/enrich-alert-sow-itom.md) in Service Operations Workspace, the updated way to automatically filter out irrelevant alerts, or to transform and standardize alert data for better response.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Event Rules**.

2.  Wait for the group calculation to complete and then click the created link.

    If there are not enough events, the calculation will not create groups.

3.  In the list of events, select an event.

4.  To change the pattern of an event, double-click the pattern, make your changes, and then click **Update**.
