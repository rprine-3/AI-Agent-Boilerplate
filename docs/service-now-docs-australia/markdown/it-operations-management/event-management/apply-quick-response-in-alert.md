# Apply a quick response in an alert

In an alert, use the `Quick Response` feature to apply remediation to the alert or to launch a web application.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

**Quick Response** is a feature that enables you to perform a quick action on the selected alert. The action is to apply remediation or to launch an application. If you have upgraded from Istanbul or earlier, this feature is a combination of the **Remediation** and **Launch an application** features.

If you select a remediation link when invoking a Quick Response, a workflow is executed according to the criteria specified in the alert management rule. Click a launch application link to launch the web application that was configured in the alert management rule. For further information, see [Migrate an alert action rule to an alert management rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/t_EMCreateAlertRule.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **All Alerts**.

2.  In the Alerts list, right-click the required alert and select **Quick Response**.
