# View an alert analysis by ServiceNow Otto in Express List

View an alert analysis created using generative AI. Alert analyses include a human-readable brief of the alert and technical information to help you investigate the alert more effectively.

## Before you begin

Install the ServiceNow Otto for ITOM plugin. For more information, see [Install the ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/install-now-assist-itom.md).

**Note:** Currently, ServiceNow Otto for ITOM only supports tag-based, CMDB, Log Analytics, Mixed, Automated, and Network Traffic-based alert groups. For all other alert group types, it only analyzes the parent alert.

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).
