The following items are installed with Event Management:

-   Roles
-   Scheduled jobs
-   Tables

For more information, see [Components installed with Event Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/r_InstalledWithEventManagement.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the ITOM AIOps application using the filter criteria and search bar.

    If you cannot find the application, request it from the ServiceNow Store.

3.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    Dependent plugins and applications are listed if they will be installed, are currently installed, or need to be installed. If any plugins or applications need to be installed, you must install them before you can install Event Management.

4.  If demo data is available and you want to install it, select the **Load demo data** check box.

    Demo data comprises sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

    **Important:** If you don't load the demo data during installation, it's unavailable to load later.

5.  Select **Install**.
