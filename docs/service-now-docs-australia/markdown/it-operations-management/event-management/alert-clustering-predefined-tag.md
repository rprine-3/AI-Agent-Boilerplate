# Attach a predefined tag to an alert grouping definition

Get started faster with alert clustering by attaching a predefined alert clustering tag to a tag-based alert clustering definition in Event Management. By associating a predefined tag, you ensure that alerts meeting the specified criteria are grouped effectively, facilitating quicker identification and response to related incidents.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

The Tag Based Alert Clustering Engine application comes with a set of predefined alert clustering tags. Attach a tag to a tag-based alert clustering definition to specify the conditions that must be met for alert correlation. This enables effective grouping of alerts based on shared characteristics, improving the accuracy and efficiency of incident response and management.

**Note:** To group alerts using tag-based grouping, create a grouping automation in Service Operations Workspace. For more information, see [Create Group automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/group-alert-sow-itom.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; ** Event Management ** &gt; **Tag Based Alert Clustering Engine ** &gt; **Alert Clustering Definitions**.

2.  Select a definition.

3.  Under the Tag Based Alert Clustering Definitions Tags M2M section, select **Insert a new row**.

4.  Use the search field to locate a predefined alert clustering tag, and then select the green check mark to confirm your selection.

    **Note:** Predefined tags are recognizable by their description, which includes “out of the box.” For a complete list of the available predefined tags, see [List of predefined alert grouping tags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/alert-clustering-predefined-tag-list.md).

5.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The predefined alert clustering tag is now attached to the tag-based alert clustering definition. This association enables the effective grouping of alerts based on the specified criteria, facilitating improved alert management and response efficiency.
