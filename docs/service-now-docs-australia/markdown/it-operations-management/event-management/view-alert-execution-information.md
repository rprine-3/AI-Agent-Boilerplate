# View alert execution information

You can click any link in the Alert Executions list to view the alert execution information of the referenced item. This information appears in the Alert Management Rule record only after an alert matched the filter in the rule and an action was performed.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Among the information shown in the Alert Executions list is:

-   The list of alerts that matched the filter of the rule.
-   The tasks, including incidents, that were opened.
-   Which remediation workflows ran and which subflows ran.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Alert Management Rules**.

2.  In the Alert Management Rules list, click the rule.

    If an alert matched the filter in the rule and an action was performed, the Alert Executions list appears in the Alert Management Rules record. The list appears irrespective of the stage of the selected alert management rule.
