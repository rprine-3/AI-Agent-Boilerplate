# Configure Event Management domain separation

You can configure Event Management for **domain separation** to create logically defined domains that limit unauthorized access to data. When domains are separated in Event Management, users can only see and manage alerts and events in their own \(tenant\) domain.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin and evt\_mgmt\_integration

## About this task

Activate the **Domain Support – Domain Extension Installer** plugin and configure the MID Server for Event Management.

The following Event Management features have limited domain separation support.

Event – alert flow

</td><td>

Supported. Separation is based on the domain user that sent events. User access is required for the credentials of the sending API events or in the configuration of the MID Server reporting events.

In a multi-domain environment, each MID Server can serve only one domain according to the integration user that it uses. In the configuration of the connector instance, make sure that the MID Server have same domain as Connector instance.

To configure pull connectors to support custom domain separation, see [Configure domain separation for pull connector events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/personalize-domain-separation-pull-connectors.md).
