# Integrate ThousandEyes with basic authentication

Integrate ThousandEyes with Event Management by adding a webhook in the ThousandEyes platform.

## Before you begin

Verify that the Event Management Connectors \(sn\_em\_connector\) plugin is installed on the ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

Discovery for ThousandEyes services is not supported, so you must create a CI manually in the ServiceNow instance for event binding to work.

Verify you have created a user with an **Identify Type** of **Machine** and the evt\_mgmt\_integration role.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Configure the Event Management environment for the collection of events from ThousandEyes by authenticating ThousandEyes as a data source. In your ThousandEyes platform, set your ServiceNow AI Platform instance as a rest endpoint using a webhook.

## Procedure

1.  In the ServiceNow instance, complete the following steps to create a CI.

    1.  From the navigation bar, navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CI Class Manager**.

    2.  Click **Hierarchy** and search for `HTTP(S) Endpoint`.

    3.  Select **CI List** and create a new CI.

2.  In the ThousandEyes platform, create a notification destination.

    1.  From the navigation bar, navigate to **Alerts** &gt; **Alert Rules**.

    2.  Click on any existing alert rule and select the **Notification** tab.

    3.  Select **Edit Webhook** and enter the following information.
