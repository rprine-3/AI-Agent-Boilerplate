# Mute a CI's alerts in Express List

Mute a CI's alerts in Express List to avoid alerts being issued when replacing or upgrading the CI.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, evt\_mgmt\_admin

**Note:** The evt\_mgmt\_user role is view-only and does not have permission to perform this action.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation bar, select the Express list icon \[Omitted image "express-list1.png"\].

3.  Select the alert row check box.

    **Note:** You can perform the action on up to 1,000 alerts simultaneously by selecting the **Select All** check box in the Active alerts list. \[Omitted image "el-select-all.png"\] Alt text: Select All check box.

4.  From the **Close** drop-down list, select **Put in Maintenance**.


## Result

Alerts are muted for the configuration items of that alert.

**Note:** The maintenance timeframe isn't provided in the **Put in Maintenance** action. Alert maintenance status is calculated based on whether the related CI is currently in maintenance, such as during an active change request or through a maintenance rule. The **Maintenance Calculation** scheduled job updates associated alerts when the CI enters or exits maintenance.
