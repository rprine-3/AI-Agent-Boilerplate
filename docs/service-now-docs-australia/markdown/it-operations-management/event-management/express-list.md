The Express List pane sortable alert list reduces the number of clicks necessary to access alert information. Selecting the check box of an alert opens a preview panel where you can view data that helps for prioritization, impact realization, and root cause analysis. You can easily modify the Express List pane to narrow down the display. Use the provided fields list to display additional alert information and to filter out or show matching alerts. You can also modify the displayed time range.

**Note:**

Exporting alerts is not supported from the Express List. To export alerts, open the list view in Service Operations Workspace.
