# Create event field mappings

Use event field mappings to map values from specific event fields to values in other fields to provide more comprehensive information in an alert. Use team-based integrations in event rules to make sure that connector ownership and execution of rules give precedence to global rules. Teams can maintain consistency and hierarchy while offering flexibility and customization options.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Create the rule to match the event by its class and original values. Also, specify the new values to replace the original values in the event.

For users familiar with the classic Event Management experience, enrich automations create event rules but with an easier interface and with better team support. For more information, see [Create Enrich automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/enrich-alert-sow-itom.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Event Field Mapping**.

2.  Select **New** or open an existing rule to edit and fill in the fields.

<table id="table_EventFieldMappingForm"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Event field mapping name.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source

</td><td>

Event monitoring software that generated the event, such as SolarWinds or SCOM. Maximum length: 100 characters.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Number to define the order in which this action should be processed. Actions with lower numbers are processed first.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

For Team-based integrations, select an assignment group. If no assignment group is defined in the event field-mapping rule, then this rule is considered global.

When the rules are running – first the global rules run and then the rules that belong to the assignment group that the event’s source instance belongs to.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Mapping type

</td><td>

Mapping mechanism that is used to change an event field value. -   **Map field and transform value \(Single field\)**:

Maps the **Source field** value to the matching value in the Transform value pairs \[em\_mapping\_pair\] table and populates the **Target field**. Source and Target fields may be event fields, additional info fields, or alert tags.

-   **Create or update field and set constant value \(Constant\)**:

Sets a constant value to a **Target field**. The **Target field** may be an event field, additional info field, or alert tag.

-   **Map field \(Copy field\)**:

Copies the exact value of a Source field to the specified Target field. The Source and Target fields may be Event field, Additional info field, or alert tags.

-   **Map field and transform value using regex**: Generically maps the value from the Source field to the matching value in the Transform value pairs table and populate the **Target field**. Source and Target fields may be event, additional info, or alert tags fields.
-   **Map field using regex**:

Copies the value from a generically defined **Source field** to the **Target field**. The Source field must be a field from the event additional info field. The Target field may be the field of event, additional info, or alert tag. With this type, you can generically find the name of the Source field by using a regular expression \(regex\).

-   **Map field and copy value from regex group**:

Copies part of the Source field value to the Target field. Source and Target fields may be event fields, additional info fields, or alert tags. Define a regex to specify what part of the **Source field** should be copied.

-   **Advanced mapping using script**:

Implements your own logic for event values transformation by using a script. When the 'Run after binding' check box is selected, the rule is executed after the CI binding phase. The dedicated script also has the sys\_id of the CI in the input parameters.

**Warning:** Complex scripts may affect event processing performance.

-   **Map field from reference table**

Use this rule type to extract a **Source field** value from the selected **Reference table** by matching the **Field to match**value to the **Matching alert field** value and then mapping the **Source field** value to the **Target field**. The **Matching alert field** and the **Target field** may be event fields, additional info fields, or alert tags.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter

</td><td>

A condition for event field mapping.Select **Add Filter Condition** or **Add "OR" Clause** to configure multiple conditions.

**Note:** The filter is case-sensitive.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Activates or deactivates the event field mapping. If possible, find and apply another event field mapping rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Run after binding

</td><td>

-   When selected, the rule is executed after the CI binding phase.

-   Use the relevant prefix to retrieve values from the CI record:

    -   **alert\_cmdb\_ci.** to retrieve a field from the CI record. For example: Use 'alert\_cmdb\_ci.assignment\_group’ to populate \(and transform\) an alert 'assignment\_group' field with the value of the CI’s assignment group. Dot-walk to a related record is also possible. For example, use alert\_cmdb\_ci.asset.model
    -   **alert\_cmdb\_ci\_key.** to retrieve a value from the CMDB Tags table. For example, alert\_cmdb\_ci\_key.subscription notes.
**Warning**: Using the 'Run after binding' feature may affect event processing performance.

 **Note:** This check box is displayed only for the following Mapping types: **Map field and transform value \(Single field\)**, **Map field \(Copy field\)**, **Map field and transform value using regex**, **Map field and copy value from regex group**, and **Map field from reference table**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    -   If you selected **Map field and transform value \(Single field\)**, fill in the fields as appropriate.

        **Note:** Map field and transform value \(Single field\) is supported in **Service Operations Workspace** &gt; **Enrich Automation**.

Field

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Source field

</td><td>

Event field to map - includes all event and additional info fields. Note: For Additional info fields use: "additional\_info.&lt;field name&gt;". When the 'Run after binding' check box is selected, you can use the **alert\_cmdb\_ci** and the **alert\_cmdb\_ci\_key** prefixes to receive CI related data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Target field

</td><td>

Event field where the mapping rule inserts or updates the value. When this field is identical to the **Source field**, the mapping rule updates the value in memory of the event field. Alert tags can also be defined by using the **&lt;t\_&gt;** prefix.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Run after binding

</td><td>

-   When checked, activates Event field mapping after CI binding.
-   Use the following prefix to retrieve values from the CI record:

    -   **alert\_cmdb\_ci.** to retrieve a field from the CI record. For example, use 'alert\_cmdb\_ci.assignment\_group’ to populate \(and transform\) an alert 'assignment\_group' field with the value of the CI’s assignment group. Dot-walk to a related record is also possible. For example, use alert\_cmdb\_ci.asset.model

## Example

The following values comprise a predefined rule that is applied to events in the Trap From Enterprise 9 class. If the events contain the `snmpTrapOID` element with a value of `iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.cisco.0.0`, the mapping rule changes the value to `reload` in the alerts. If the events contain the `snmpTrapOID` element, a value of `iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.cisco.0.1`, the mapping rule changes the value to `tcpConnectionClose` in the alerts.
