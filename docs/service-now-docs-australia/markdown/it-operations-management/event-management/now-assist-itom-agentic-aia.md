# Analyze alert impact agentic workflow

Use the analyze alert impact agentic workflow to investigate an alert and get the context that you need to respond efficiently.

## Analyze alert impact agentic workflow overview

The analyze alert impact agentic workflow uses AI agents to interact with observability tools, such as Dynatrace, Kentik, and New Relic. The agents surface information to help you do the following:

-   Understand the severity and impact of alerts.
-   Find potential root causes using insights, such as recent deployments.
-   Identify ownership by surfacing relevant services and responsible teams.
-   Support stakeholder communication with clear, actionable information.

Use the information on this page to learn about the agents related to the analyze alert impact agentic workflow. To modify the analyze alert impact agentic workflow, [duplicate it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md) and adjust the settings.

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.

## Analyze alert impact agentic workflow

Investigate an alert and get insights into its severity, impact, ownership, and root causes.

To access the agentic workflow in AI Agent Studio:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Select **Analyze alert impact**.

The Analyze alert impact page lets you manage the agentic workflow, including defining key requirements, defining security controls, and adding triggers.

**Important:** This agentic workflow is turned on by default. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

## AI agents used in the analyze alert impact agentic workflow

The analyze alert impact agentic workflow uses observability AI agents to gather information from alerts and request insights. The observability AI agents require additional configuration. For configuration procedures and detailed information about the data returned by these agents, see [Configure observability agents for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/configure-integration-agents-for-now-assist.md).

|AI agent|AI agent role|
|--------|-------------|
|Alert impact summary AI agent|Retrieves the alert impact summary for a specific alert.|
|Alert information retrieval AI agent|Gathers key observability details for a specific alert.|
|Observability agents|Retrieves data from the observability vendor associated with the alert. For details, see [Configure observability agents for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/configure-integration-agents-for-now-assist.md)|

## Generating the alert analysis

In the agentic workflow record:

1.  Review the information in the Define key requirements, Define security controls, and Add triggers screens, make the necessary updates, and then select **Continue**.
2.  In the Select channels and status screen:
    1.  Turn on the ServiceNow Otto panel display.
    2.  Select **Save and test**.
3.  Test the agentic workflow by asking a question, for example, `What is the impact of Alert0010056NR?`
4.  Select **Continue to Test Chat Response**.

    The page shows the chat responses, visualizes the AI agents involved, and lists the AI agent decision logs.


In AI Agent Studio, you get notified when the analysis is generated. You can then act on the information or ask more questions about the alert. For more information about using the agentic workflow in the ServiceNow Otto panel, see [Analyze alert impact in the ServiceNow Otto panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/now-assist-itom-use-aia.md).
