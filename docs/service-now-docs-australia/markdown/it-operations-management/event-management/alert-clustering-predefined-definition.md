# Activate a predefined alert clustering definition

Activate the predefined alert clustering definitions provided with the Tag-Based Alert Clustering Engine application before use. Utilizing these preconfigured definitions minimizes setup time and ensures a more efficient configuration process, allowing for quicker implementation and streamlined alert management.

## Before you begin

**Important:** If you are already using the Tag-Based Alert Clustering Engine application, all the predefined definitions are inactive and must be activated. In contrast, new customers will find several definitions active by default, allowing for immediate utilization of the alert clustering capabilities without additional setup.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

**Note:** To group alerts using tag-based grouping, create a grouping automation in Service Operations Workspace. For more information, see [Create Group automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/group-alert-sow-itom.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; ** Event Management** &gt; **Tag Based Alert Clustering Engine** &gt; **Clustering Definitions**.

2.  Select a predefined definition.

    **Note:** For a complete list of the available predefined definitions, see [List of predefined tag-based alert grouping definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/alert-clustering-predefined-definition-list.md).

3.  On the Tag Based Alert Clustering Definition form, select the **Active** check box.

4.  Select **Save**.


## Result

In the Tag Based Alert Clustering Definitions table, the **Active** field for the activated definition displays the value **true**. You can now associate an alert clustering tag with this definition, enabling effective grouping of alerts based on the defined criteria.
