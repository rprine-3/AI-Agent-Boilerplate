# MID Web Server

The MID Web Server is part of the common infrastructure of the MID Server.

The MID Web Server extension provides options for authentication and data security, and runs for as long as it is enabled. The extension starts a web server on the MID Server to handle web requests from external systems. The raw data is pushed to the extension, either from a client or with a customized script. The data is collected by the MID Server and is transmitted to the ServiceNow instance.

The MID Web Server extension supports MID Server clusters that are configured for failover. When selecting a MID Server cluster option, an algorithm determines which MID Server in the cluster runs the extension. The extension can run on only one MID Server. If the MID Server in the cluster that runs the MID Web Server extension goes down, the extension automatically starts to run on the secondary MID Server. The secondary MID Server is activated when the primary MID Server goes down.
