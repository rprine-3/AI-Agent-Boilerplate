# Analyze alert impact in the ServiceNow Otto panel

Learn how to use the analyze alert impact agentic workflow in the ServiceNow Otto panel. The agentic workflow helps you investigate an alert and get the context that you need to respond efficiently.

## Before you begin

Make sure ServiceNow Otto for ITOM is installed and observability agents are configured for third-party vendors. For more information, see [Install plugins for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/install-now-assist-feature-plugins.md) and [Configure observability agents for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/configure-integration-agents-for-now-assist.md).

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation bar, select the Express list icon \(\[Omitted image "express-list1.png"\]\).

3.  Select an alertfrom a source associated with an observability agent.

4.  Open the panel by selecting the ServiceNow Otto icon.

5.  Ask a tool-specific question about the alert.

    For example, for New Relic alerts, you can ask `Have there been recent deployments for this alert?`. To better understand the type of data you can query, see the **Overview of data returned** row in the corresponding vendor's table in [Configure observability agents for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/configure-integration-agents-for-now-assist.md).

    AI agents analyze your question and respond with a summary or insight. The first response for an alert might take several seconds to appear.


## What to do next

Use the information that you received to understand the alert impact and respond accordingly. You can also ask more questions about the alert.

**Note:** Your conversation in the ServiceNow Otto panel is specific to the alert that you selected in Step 3. To ask about a different alert, open that alert and select the ServiceNow Otto icon to start a new conversation.
