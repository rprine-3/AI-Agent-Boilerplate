# Create an alert correlation rule

Create an alert correlation rule to designate primary and secondary alerts. The primary alert is identified as the root cause of the alert group and the secondary alerts are grouped under the primary alert.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Grouping automation helps you manage alerts more effectively by collecting similar alerts together. This makes it easier to see patterns, quickly identify issues, and respond efficiently. For more information on how to group alerts easily, see [Create Group automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/group-alert-sow-itom.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Alert Correlation Rules**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For information on the fields, see [Alert correlation rule form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/alert-correlation-rule-form.md).

4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

A rule-based alert group is created when a new alert is generated. It is also created when the status of an existing alert changes from Closed or Flapping to Open or Reopened, provided the filter criteria are matched.
