## Domain separation properties for Event Management connectors

Properties provide the metadata to identify the domain.

You can change the values if you want to use any other table or fields for domain identification but make sure that the table is domain separated.

**Note:** When personalizing domain separation for event management connectors, all the properties can be overridden at the connector level as well.

There are three caches maintained for personalizing domain separation \(main, user\_access, missing\_domain\). You can create a few system properties to control them.
