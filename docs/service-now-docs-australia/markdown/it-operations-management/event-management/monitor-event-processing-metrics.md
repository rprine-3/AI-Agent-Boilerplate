# View event processing statistics

Extract statistics from your instance to ensure that performance is not affected and extract metrics related to event processes to monitor event processing status.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the **Event Management - Collect xmlstats** job is active. Configure this scheduled job by navigating to **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

You can control the processing of event statistics using the **evt\_mgmt.event\_processing\_stats\_period** property. For information about configuring this property, see [Configure statistics processing period](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/add-property-statistics-processing-period.md).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator

## About this task

You can view key metrics from the instance to ensure that performance is not affected and monitor the status of the processing of events. For more information about viewing self-health monitoring statistics, see [View Metric Intelligence self-health statistics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/metric-intelligence/xmlstats-oi-self-health.md).

## Procedure

1.  In a browser where the instance is running, run the XML Stats script by appending the following text to the instance URL: `xmlstats.do?include=XMLStatsEm`

2.  Press **Enter**.

3.  Monitor the event processing metrics that are reported to ensure that events are processed according to accepted benchmark values.


## Result

## Sample output after running the XML Stats script

```
<xmlstats created="Tue Oct 23 04:01:25 PDT 2018" includes="XMLStatsEm" version="2">
<itom_event_management>
<event_processing>
<processed count="47" max_process_time="10" mean_process_time="5" record_time="2018-10-23 11:00:41"/>
<ready count="7" oldest_ready_event="37" record_time="2018-10-23 11:00:41"/>
<error count="5" record_time="2018-10-23 11:00:41"/>
<total_created count="5" record_time="2018-10-23 11:00:41"/>
</event_processing>
</itom_event_management>
</xmlstats>
```

The event processing metrics in the report are described in the following table.

**Note:** The default processing cycle is events created in the last hour and updated in the last minute.
