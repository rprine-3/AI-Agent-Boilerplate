# Integrate Dynatrace with basic authentication

Integrate Dynatrace with Event Management by adding a standard webhook in the Dynatrace console.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the Event Management Connectors \(sn\_em\_connector\) plugin is installed on the ServiceNow AI Platform instance.

Ensure that configuration items for the hosts managed by Dynatrace exist in the ServiceNow AI Platform instance. These CIs can be physical or virtual and can be either manually created or discovered via IP discovery or Cloud Discovery.

Ensure you have created a user with an **Identify Type** of **Machine** and the evt\_mgmt\_integration role.

Roles required: evt\_mgmt\_integration and web\_service\_admin

## About this task

Configure the Event Management environment for the collection of events from Dynatrace by authenticating Dynatrace as a data source. In your Dynatrace console, set your ServiceNow AI Platform instance as the rest endpoint using a standard webhook.

## Procedure

1.  In your Dynatrace console, define Host Naming rules:

    1.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Process and contextualize** &gt; **Naming** &gt; **Host Naming**.

    2.  Define the Host Naming rules for each cloud provider \(Azure/AWS/GCP\) to uniquely identify a CI from ServiceNow.

    This ensures the ServiceNow CIs can be uniquely identified from the payload received from Dynatrace.

    **Note:** You do not need to create a Host Naming rule for VMware machines because Dynatrace manages them as physical servers.

2.  Define anomaly detection rules:

    1.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Analyze and alert** &gt; **Alerts** &gt; **Hosts**.

    2.  In the **Hosts** tab, define rules on when to create alerts on the managed hosts.

3.  Define the integration settings:

    1.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Analyze and alert** &gt; **Notifications** &gt; **Problem notifications**.

    2.  In the Set up custom integration form, add the Webhook URL: `https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/api/sn_em_connector/em/inbound_event?source=dynatrace`

        For basic authentication, select **Create basic authorization header**. You can see the username and password fields for the user.

    3.  Enter the user name and password of the relevant user.

        **Note:** Ensure the evt\_mgmt\_integration role is assigned to the selected user. To ensure proper authentication, use the least privileged user with the evt\_mgmt\_integration role, rather than a high privileged user.

    4.  In the Custom payload section, add in the following payload structure for the events that will be generated.

        It confirms that ImpactedEntities and ProblemDetailsJSONv2 are passed as JSON objects, not strings.

        ```
        { 
          "ImpactedEntities": {ImpactedEntities}, 
          "ImpactedEntity": "{ImpactedEntity}", 
          "PID": "{PID}", 
          "ProblemDetailsHTML": "{ProblemDetailsHTML}", 
          "ProblemDetailsJSONv2": {ProblemDetailsJSONv2},  
          "ProblemDetailsMarkdown": "{ProblemDetailsMarkdown}", 
          "ProblemDetailsText": "{ProblemDetailsText}", 
          "ProblemID": "{ProblemID}", 
          "ProblemImpact": "{ProblemImpact}",
          "ProblemSeverity": "{ProblemSeverity}",
          "ProblemTitle": "{ProblemTitle}",
          "ProblemURL": "{ProblemURL}",
          "State": "{State}",
          "Tags": "{Tags}"
        }
        ```

4.  Define the integration settings for the Grail problem event, which ServiceNow supports through its new payload.

    1.  Log in to the Dynatrace instance and, from the left-hand panel, select **Workflow**.
    2.  On the Workflow page, select **+ Workflow** to create a new workflow.
    3.  Create a blank workflow.
    4.  In the Select a trigger section, select **Problem trigger**.
    5.  In the middle workflow section, on the problem trigger tile, add the **Send ITOM event** task.
    6.  Select **+ Create a new connection**.
    7.  In the **Connection name** field, enter a name.
    8.  In the **ServiceNow ITOM Event API URL** field, paste the URL in this format:`https://<instance-name>.service-now.com/api/sn_em_connector/em/inbound_event?source=dynatrace`.
    9.  In the **Type** field, select **Basic Authentication**, and then select **Create basic authorization header**. The username and password fields appear.
    10. Enter the user name and password of the relevant user.

        **Note:** Ensure the `evt_mgmt_integration` role is assigned to the selected user. For proper authentication, use the least-privileged user with the `evt_mgmt_integration` role rather than a highly privileged user.

    11. Save the workflow and select **Run** to execute the workflow.

## Result

Alerts start flowing from the Dynatrace console into the Event Management plugin. The plugin extracts information from the original Dynatrace alert message to populate the required event fields and inserts the event into the database. In your ServiceNow AI Platform instance, navigate to **All Events** to see the events.

**Note:** By default, host binding is enabled for Dynatrace events for all providers \(Azure/AWS/Google\). If all hosts in the environment are discovered using Cloud Discovery by providing credentials and discovered resources are in the cmdb\_ci\_vm\_object list, then the VM binding may not occur. To resolve this, you must enable the **Dynatrace - General** event rule.
