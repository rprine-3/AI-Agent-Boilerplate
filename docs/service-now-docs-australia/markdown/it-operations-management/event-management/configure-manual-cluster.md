# Configure a manual cluster

Provide redundancy capabilities of an entire cluster in case of failure of one or more CIs in that cluster. By viewing the relative impact of a cluster member on the cluster information, you can better understand the source of alerts and take remediation steps.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

In a manual service that was not discovered automatically, you can manually group a specific CI or a generic CI class under a logical cluster. The relative impact of a cluster member on the cluster can be configured in the impact tree.

For more information, see [Alert impact calculation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/c_EMImpactCalculation.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Manual Clusters**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  In the **Select a Service containing this manual cluster** section, select an application service to contain the new manual cluster based on a specific CI or general CI class.

    The cluster number is automatically generated and appears in the **Number** field.

    1.  Select the Lookup using list icon \(\[Omitted image "search-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon\) in the **Service** field.

    2.  In the CMDB CI Service \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_discovered\] table, select a manually created service.

        To define a new application service, see [Manually create an application service in Event Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-an-application-service.md).

    3.  Preview the record by selecting the Preview this record icon \(\[Omitted image "info.png"\] Alt text: Preview this record icon\).

4.  In the **Select a Specific CI or generic CI class** section, in the **Defined As** field, select whether to define the manual cluster as a specific CI or as a generic CI class.

    A generic CI class applies to all CIs of that class.

    -   Specific CI - In the **Configuration item** field, select the Lookup using list icon \(\[Omitted image "search-icon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list icon\) and select the configuration item.
    -   Generic CI class – In the **Configuration item class** field, select the configuration item class.
5.  In the **Provide a Description** section, either provide a description in the **Description** field or leave it blank to contain an automatically generated description when you select **Save** or **Submit**.

    The **Description** field is automatically updated when you select **Save** or **Submit**. The automatically generated description consists of the configuration item name and the service name. For example: `CI <Alert Processing> in service <linuxApplService> (*** auto generated ***)`.

    To prevent an automatic update of the Description field and retain your changes, delete the \(\*\*\* auto generated \*\*\*\) suffix that appears as part of the description.

6.  Activate the cluster by selecting the **Activate** check box.

7.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The manual cluster is saved in the EM Impact Manual Cluster \[em\_impact\_manual\_cluster\] table. The impact calculation is recalculated automatically.
