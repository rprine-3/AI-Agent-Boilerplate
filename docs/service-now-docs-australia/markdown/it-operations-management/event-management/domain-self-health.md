# Monitor self-health with domain separation

Use domain separation to enable self-health to display Event Management health issues that are based on data, rules, and settings from the logged in user domain. The selected domain must not contain any child domains.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the Domain Support — Domain Extension Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\) plugin is activated and that the MID Server you’re connecting to is configured for Event Management.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Self-health monitoring is domain aware. If the Domain Support — Domain Extension Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\) plugin has been activated, then self-health displays health issues based on data, rules, and settings from the logged in user domain. If rules and settings aren’t defined for a child domain, then the settings of the parent are applied, recursively.

**Note:** To generate self-health monitoring events in the domain-separated instance, you must specify the domain of these generated events. This is done by specifying the `sys_id` of the required domain in the **evt\_mgmt.domain\_self\_monitoring** property.

When the Domain Support — Domain Extension Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\) plugin isn’t activated, adding, or removing a connector or MID Server is immediately reflected in the map.

When the Domain Support — Domain Extension Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\) plugin is activated, updates are done periodically according to the interval specifications of the Event Management — Insert Health Monitor scheduled job.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Scheduler** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  In the **Schedule** list, locate and select the Event Management — Insert Health Monitor job.

3.  In the Event Management — Insert Health Monitor job, under Related Links, select **Configure Job Definition**.

4.  Set the required periodic update time in the **Repeat Interval** field by specifying the required values.

    The default interval is one hour.

    \[Omitted image "self-health-repeat-interval.png"\] Alt text: Self-health repeat interval

5.  Select **Update**.


## Result

Further configuration is required for CI creation, receipt of events, and alert generation. The `sys_id` of the domain must be specified in the **Value** field of the **evt\_mgmt.domain\_self\_monitoring** property.

1.  Navigate to **System Properties** **All Properties**.
2.  Locate and select the **evt\_mgmt.domain\_self\_monitoring** property.

    \[Omitted image "domain-sysid-value.png"\] Alt text: Domain property sys\_id value

3.  In the **Value** field, specify the `sys_id` of the domain.
4.  Select **Update**.
