# Configure alert collection from SCOM

Alerts from the Microsoft System Center Operations Manager \(SCOM\) are collected using the SCOM connector instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

The SCOM connector instance requires configuration before receiving alerts and Metric Intelligence raw data from the SCOM server. You can limit the collection of SCOM alerts to only those alerts that belong to the SCOM group that you specify.

## Procedure

1.  Configure the SCOM connector instance.

2.  Configure the Microsoft System Center Operations Manager \(SCOM\) connector instance to receive alerts and Metric Intelligence raw data from the SCOM server.

3.  Limit collected SCOM alerts to specific SCOM groups.

Configure the Microsoft System Center Operations Manager \(SCOM\) connector to receive alerts and Metric Intelligence raw data from the SCOM server. SCOM event collection and metric collection are handled by two separate connector definitions: SCOM \(for alerts and bi-directional exchange\) and SCOM Metrics \(for Metric Intelligence raw data\).
