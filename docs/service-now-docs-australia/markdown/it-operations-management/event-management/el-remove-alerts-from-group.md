# Remove alerts from an alert group in Express List

Remove secondary alerts from an alert group directly from the Express List pane or from the preview panel.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, evt\_mgmt\_admin

**Note:** The evt\_mgmt\_user role is view-only and does not have permission to perform this action.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation bar, select the Express list icon \[Omitted image "express-list1.png"\].

3.  Remove a secondary alert from an alert group.

    You can remove alerts from a group regardless of whether you are working in the main pane or in the preview panel. The preview panel opens only when a single alert or alert group is selected.
