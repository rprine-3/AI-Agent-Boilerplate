# AI in Express List

ServiceNow Otto for ITOM provides generative AI skills and agentic workflows in Express List that help operators triage alerts, investigate incidents, and respond faster.

Express List includes several generative AI skills and agentic workflows. All features require ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) to be installed. For a summary of all AI features across ITOM AIOps, see [Install ITOM using ServiceNow Otto for Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/exploring-nowassist-setup-itom-aiops.md).

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

Alert analysis skill

</td><td>

Uses generative AI to generate a human-readable brief of an alert and additional technical information to support investigation. Analyses are provided in English regardless of the language used in the alert description.

</td><td>

An operator opens an alert in Express List and wants a quick summary of what the alert means and what to investigate next.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Alert group analysis skill

</td><td>

Uses generative AI to generate a simplified, human-readable description of an alert group and technical information to support investigation.

</td><td>

An operator selects an alert group in Express List and wants to understand the group's overall significance before deciding how to respond.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Alert group description generation skill

</td><td>

Uses generative AI to generate a comprehensive description of an alert group that encompasses all alerts within the group. The generated description replaces the original alert group description.

</td><td>

An operator wants to replace a system-generated alert group description with a meaningful, AI-generated summary that reflects the full scope of the group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Past incident analysis skill

</td><td>

Queries historical records to find related past incidents and analyzes their frequency, criticality, work notes, and resolution. Presents a summary of the most relevant incidents in the ServiceNow Otto panel, including resolution strategies and contact details for teams who resolved similar incidents.

</td><td>

An operator is investigating an alert and wants to know whether similar issues have occurred before and how they were resolved.

</td></tr><tr><td>

AI-generated incident creation skill

</td><td>

Creates an incident with a human-readable, AI-generated description directly from an alert in Express List.

</td><td>

An operator determines that an alert requires an incident and wants the incident description to be generated automatically rather than written manually.

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Analyze alert impact agentic workflow

</td><td>

Uses observability AI agents to investigate an alert and surface information about its severity, impact, ownership, and potential root causes. Integrates with observability tools such as Dynatrace, Kentik, and New Relic.

</td><td>

An operator selects an alert from an observability-connected source and wants to understand its blast radius, identify responsible teams, and find potential root causes before escalating.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Analyze potential impact agentic workflow

</td><td>

Analyzes how a change request might affect relevant servers and services. The agent verifies prerequisites, retrieves the change request, selects up to 10 affected servers, identifies matches with suggested services, and displays an impact analysis in the ServiceNow Otto panel. The analysis is also saved to the change request work notes.

</td><td>

An operator or change manager wants to assess the risk of a change request before approving it, without manually reviewing all affected CIs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow

</td><td>

Provides a unified AI-driven process that automates alert triage, impact analysis, and root cause investigation. Generates reports, summarizes key insights and possible next steps, and stores structured findings in the alert record. Also analyzes Health Log Analytics alerts in an alert group and can classify alerts as proactive or reactive.**Note:** Autonomous workflow is a simplified AI process elaborated in the AI Specialist. You can now activate and manage AI Specialist, controlling the groups it targets and the specific alert type it handles. Activating the AI Specialist automatically disables the Autonomous workflow.

</td><td>

An operations team wants alerts to be triaged, analyzed, and summarized automatically as they arrive, with AI insights available in Express List without manual intervention.
