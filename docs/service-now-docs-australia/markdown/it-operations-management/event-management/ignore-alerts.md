# Alert ignore automations

Configure ignore rules to automatically suppress alerts that are not actionable or relevant to your operations team.

Verify you have installed the ITOM AIOps and ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) plugins.

Ensure you are in the Configure IT Operations Management page.

Ignore rules help reduce alert noise by automatically suppressing alerts that match specific criteria. This allows operations teams to focus on actionable alerts while filtering out known non-critical events, maintenance notifications, or false positives.

1.  Navigate to **Configuration Summary** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Reduce Noise**.

2.  Expand **Reduce Noise**.

3.  Select **Ignore alerts**.

    A list of ignore alert automations appears.

4.  Select **+Create automation**.

    The Ignore alerts page opens.

5.  Follow the steps in [Create Ignore automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-ignore-automation-sow-itom.md).

6.  To complete the setup, select **Mark as configured**.
