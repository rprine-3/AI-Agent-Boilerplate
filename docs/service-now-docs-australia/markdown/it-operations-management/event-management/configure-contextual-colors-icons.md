# Configure contextual colors and icons

Use the **Contextual colors and icons** form to configure color, text, and icons to have different default or custom contexts, identified by a context ID.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

You can customize the colors or icons of elements in the **Contextual colors and icons** form to affect the displayed colors or icons of severities in related Event Management screens, either when accessibility mode is off or on. For more information about accessibility, see [Accessibility features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management-service-portal.md) .

In each color selection field, you have the option of entering the value of the color as any of the following Cascading Style Sheet \(CSS\) formats that determine how HTML elements should be displayed:

-   Name: predefined color names, for example, red, green, olive, blue, darkblue, or lightblue
-   RGB decimal: RGB\(102, 153, 204\)
-   RGB hex: \#223344

See the following websites for information about CSS color declarations \(including hex or RGB notation\):

-   [HTML Colors \(W3CSchools\)](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp) for more information on hex and RGB notation.
-   [HTML Color Names \(W3CSchools\)](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp) for valid color names.

The context IDs that are provided with the base instance are:

-   information\_severity
-   warning\_severity
-   minor\_severity
-   major\_severity
-   critical\_severity
-   topology\_connection
