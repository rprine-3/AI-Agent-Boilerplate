# Configure a pull connector

Configure a pull connector to schedule the frequency of event collection.

## Before you begin

Before starting this procedure:

-   Locate or define a connector definition.
-   Create the credentials to connect to the event source.
-   If the connector instance is to be used for the collection of Metric Intelligence metric data, the Metric Intelligence plugin must be activated.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

You can use a connector instance to control the location and manner in which events arrive from external sources. You can optionally select to collect Metric Intelligence information from the external sources that you are connecting to. The Metric Intelligence feature is for the analysis of trends, threshold definitions, and anomaly detection. You can run a test to confirm that connector instance parameters let the MID Server receive events from a supported external event source to the Event \[em\_event\] table. The test also confirms:

-   The MID Server is running.
-   The host is running on the IP address that is in the **Host IP** field.
-   Both the MID Server and the host are running in the same domain.
-   The connector instance value fields are valid.
-   A connection can be made to the event source, using API, to retrieve events.

[Integrations Launchpad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/integrations-launchpad.md), available in the Service Operations Workspace, consolidates all Event Management connector integrations in one place. Use it to pull or push events from external or internal devices, create or manage connector configurations from a single interface.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Connector Instances**.
