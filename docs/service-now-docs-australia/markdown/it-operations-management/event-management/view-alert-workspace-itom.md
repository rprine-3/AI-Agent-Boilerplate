# Alerts in Service Operations Workspace

The Service Operations Workspace interface displays an alerts list and details on specific alerts.

When you click an alert in the alerts list, the **Details** tab of the selected alert appears. The issue that caused the alert appears in the alert title. Only the sub tabs relevant to the alert appear on the resulting page. For example, the **Alerts in Group** option appears in the **Related Records** tab only for alert groups.

View the alerts that Azure grouped into the issue in the alert list. The **Source** column displays `A` for these alerts.\[Omitted image "em-related-record-azure-issue.png"\] Alt text: Azure monitor issue alerts

\[Omitted image "alert-details-tab-sow.png"\] Alt text: Details of an open alert.

The following table describes areas on the alert form.
