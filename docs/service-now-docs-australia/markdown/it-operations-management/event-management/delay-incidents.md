# Delay incidents

Configure delay rules to postpone incident creation for alerts that may resolve automatically or represent transient conditions.

## Before you begin

Verify you have installed the ITOM AIOps and ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) plugins.

Ensure you're in the Configure IT Operations Management page.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin or evt\_team\_operator

## About this task

Delay incident rules help reduce unnecessary incident creation by waiting for a specified period before generating incidents from alerts. This is particularly useful for flapping conditions or transient issues that may resolve automatically, preventing ticket creation for self-resolving problems.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Configuration Summary** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Reduce Noise**.

2.  Expand **Reduce Noise**.

3.  Select **Delay incidents**.

    A list of respond alert automations appears.

4.  To create an automation and set a wait time before incident creation, select **+Create automation**.

    The Respond to alerts page opens.

5.  Follow the steps in [Create Respond automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/respond-alert-sow-itom.md).

    **Note:** To modify the wait time in an existing automation, open the automation and update the wait time under **Create incident and other response actions**. Ensure you select **Create Incident \(Advanced\)** — the delay configuration form is only available through this option.

6.  To complete the setup, select **Mark as configured**.
