# Viewing links between alerts in alert groups in Express List

Gain a better understanding of the relationships between alerts in alert groups in the Express List by using Link View. Link View offers a visual representation of the relationships between the alerts in a group.

When Event Management generates an alert group, Link View shows how the attributes of the alerts in the group are linked. The colored tags represent configuration items \(CIs\) and other environment items in relation to the alerts.

The information shown in Link View is available without the need for a populated Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\). However, when the CMDB is populated, Link View offers additional value by providing the probable cause of the alerts and the service that the alert group impacts.

You can focus on your areas of interest by dragging the nodes in Link View to different positions. When you refresh an alert group, rearranged nodes appear in their original position again. Therefore, Link View is not refreshed automatically, but waits for you to do so manually.

If an alert on a CI impacts a service in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\), Link View shows the impacted service for quick triage.

A stacked node indicates that multiple nodes were mapped for the same tag. When the same key-value pair appears in more than one alert, the corresponding node is shown with a badge. For example, when the same key-value pair appears in two alerts, the badge on the node shows the number 2. See the Payment tracker node in the sample alert group figure. When a node has no badge, the key-value pair appears in only one alert. An active change request, a probable cause of the alert, is marked by a Change badge.

The Link View legend lists the meaning of the symbols and colors used and enables you to toggle between hiding and showing types of tags to reduce noise. In addition, the legend describes the meaning of the various lines linking the alert attributes. Attributes linked by a solid line share one or more alerts, whereas attributes linked by a dotted line are correlated by grouping criteria. For a description of each tag, see [Attributes in Express List Link View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/link-view-tags-icons-descriptions.md). Hovering over a node displays a tooltip that includes the name of the tag, its class, its severity, and the number of alerts in which it appeared. The tooltip also indicates whether the alert is primary or secondary or the probable cause of the alert, if applicable.
