# Generate an alert group description in Express List using ServiceNow Otto

Use AI to generate a meaningful description of an alert group in Express List that encompasses all the alerts within the group. The generated description replaces the original description of the group.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  Select the Express List icon \(\[Omitted image "express-list1.png"\] Alt text: Express List icon.\) in the navigation bar.

3.  In the Active alerts list, select the information icon \(\[Omitted image "info.png"\] Alt text: Information icon.\) for an alert.

4.  Below the displayed alert group description, select **Update description**.

    ServiceNow Otto generates a comprehensive new description of the alert group, which encompasses all the alerts within the group. If you select **Update**, the generated description replaces the original description of the alert group taken from the earliest, most severe secondary alert in the group.

5.  Restore the original alert group description by selecting the revert icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-revert.png"\] Alt text: Revert icon.\) next to **Update description** and then choosing **Restore**.
