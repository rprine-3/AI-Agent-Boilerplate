# MID Web Server and agent mTLS Authentication

Mutual authentication using the Transport Layer Security protocol \(mTLS\) is a secure, certificate-based authentication scheme. With mTLS, the server \(the MID Web Server extension\) and the client \(the agent\) authenticate each other.

TLS authentication occurs when a client \(such as a web browser\) authenticates the server it’s accessing by validating the certificate presented by the server. The client verifies that the certificate \(or certificate chain\) is signed by a trusted certificate authority \(CA\). The client must have access to a bundle of CA certificates, which it uses to validate the server certificate.

When mTLS is configured, the client presents a certificate or certificate chain to the server. The server authenticates the client in the same way that the client authenticates the server \(mutual authentication\).

In addition to verifying the certificate signature, some TLS implementations also check the revocation status of the certificate. In these cases, the Online Certificate Status Protocol \(OCSP\) is used. In this protocol, the verifying party sends a request to the OCSP responder set up by the CA that issued the presented certificate. \(The responder's address is typically embedded in the CA-issued certificates\). The response indicates whether the presented certificate is revoked.

Before enabling mTLS, you must first create keys and certificates, install the .pem file on your MID Server, and connect the agent to your MID Server.
