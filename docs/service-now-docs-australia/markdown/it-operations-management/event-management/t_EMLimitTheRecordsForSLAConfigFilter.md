# Limit the records for the SLA configuration filter

If too many records are returned by the SLA configuration filter, you can add a property to set the maximum number of records.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

By default, the size of dynamic CI group records is limited to 10,000 elements. Exceeding this limit can affect system stability. If the filter configuration for a specified dynamic CI group returns too many records, you can limit the number of records. Set the value of the sa.qbs.max\_num\_of\_cis property to control the limit. For more information, see [Create a Dynamic CI Group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/create-it-services.md).

## Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.list` in the application navigator.

2.  Add the following property:

    **sa.qbs.max\_num\_of\_cis**

3.  Set the value to an integer that represents the maximum number of records to return.
