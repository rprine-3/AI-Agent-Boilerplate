# Configure the Dynatrace analysis AI agent

Configure the Dynatrace analysis AI agent for the analyze alert impact agentic workflow. This configuration also supports the Dynatrace observability skill in the manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow.After you configure the agent, the workflows can surface information from Dynatrace to help you investigate alerts.

## Before you begin

**Important:** In the Australia release, the Dynatrace analysis AI agent is being prepared for future deprecation. To continue getting Dynatrace insights in agentic workflows, deactivate the Dynatrace analysis AI agent in AI Agent Studio and set up the Dynatrace MCP server agent. See [Configure observability agents for ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/configure-integration-agents-for-now-assist.md) for configuration details.

Before configuring the Dynatrace analysis AI agent, you must do the following:
