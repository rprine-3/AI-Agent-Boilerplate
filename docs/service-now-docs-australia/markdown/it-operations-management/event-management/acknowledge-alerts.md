# Acknowledge viewed alerts in Express List

Acknowledge alerts that you’ve viewed to remove clutter in the Express List pane.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, evt\_mgmt\_admin

**Note:** The evt\_mgmt\_user role is view-only and does not have permission to perform this action.

## About this task

Use Acknowledge to denote that the alert is known, and can temporarily be ignored. Do not use Acknowledge to mark an alert as needing attention.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation bar, select the Express list icon \[Omitted image "express-list1.png"\].

3.  Acknowledge selected alerts.

    You can acknowledge alerts regardless of whether you are working in the main pane or in the preview panel. The preview panel opens only when a single alert or alert group is selected.
