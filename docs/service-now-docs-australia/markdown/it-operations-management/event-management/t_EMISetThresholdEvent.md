title: Set a threshold to suppress alert generation
description: The event threshold is the rate upon which Event Management generates an alert. Receiving multiple events for a device over a short interval may warrant creating an alert, as the condition may be serious. However, receiving events over a longer interval may indicate a less serious situation which would not warrant creating an alert.

# Set a threshold to suppress alert generation

The event threshold is the rate upon which Event Management generates an alert. Receiving multiple events for a device over a short interval may warrant creating an alert, as the condition may be serious. However, receiving events over a longer interval may indicate a less serious situation which would not warrant creating an alert.

## About this task

**Note:** Use [Ignore automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-ignore-automation-sow-itom.md) and [Enrich automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/enrich-alert-sow-itom.md) in Service Operations Workspace, the updated way to automatically filter out irrelevant alerts, or to transform and standardize alert data for better response.

You can configure the properties in an event rule to create alerts, suppress alert generation, or close existing alerts according to a specified threshold. The threshold is based on the value of event fields or number of occurrences over a specified period.

**Note:** **Field Name** can be the name of any numeric field in the **Additional information** field of the event. Therefore, if `CPU` is an additional information field for a specific event, then `CPU` can be used as a **Field Name**.

Assume that you want to generate an alert when CPU utilization reaches or exceeds 80% three times with no more than 20 seconds between any two consecutive events. Create an event rule with these settings \(an explanation for each value is given in parentheses\):

-   **Create Alert Operator**: **&gt;=** \(operator to determine whether utilization of **Field Name** reaches or exceeds the specified value\)
-   **Field Name**: **CPU** \(events regarding high CPU usage\)
-   **Threshold Value**: **80** \(percent\)
-   **Occurs**: **3** \(three events occur where the CPU usage is at or above "&gt;=" 80%\)
-   **Over\(seconds\)**: **20** \(20 seconds or less between events\)

To demonstrate how the preceding settings are evaluated, assume that the following events are received:

<table id="table_z4f_42z_2gb"><thead><tr><th>

Scenario

</th><th>

Outcome

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Reported elapsed time and the CPU usage for each event:

-   First event elapse time 20, CPU=85
-   Second event elapse time 40, CPU=80
-   Third event elapse time 60, CPU=70

</td><td>

In this scenario, no alert is generated since one event has a CPU utilization that is under 80%.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reported elapsed time and the CPU usage for each event:

-   First event elapse time 20, CPU=85
-   Second event elapse time 40, CPU=90
-   Third event elapse time 70, CPU=95

</td><td>

In this scenario, an alert is not generated since the elapsed time in one event is over the specified 20 seconds.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Reported elapsed time and the CPU usage for each event:

-   First event elapse time 20, CPU=85
-   Second event elapse time 40, CPU=95
-   Third event elapse time 60, CPU=90

</td><td>

In this scenario, an alert is generated since in all events the elapsed time is within the specified time and the CPU usage is over 80%.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:**

-   When configuring an event rule to create or close alerts according to a threshold, events that arrive at the same second, as determined by the **time\_of\_event** field, are skipped. This occurs because these events are considered to be duplicates.
-   When threshold conditions are configured, alerts close when the **Close Alert Operator** condition is met, and not when an event is received with **Severity = Clear** or **Resolution state = Closing**.

To automatically filter out irrelevant alerts or transform and standardize alert data for better response, you can also use [Ignore automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/create-ignore-automation-sow-itom.md) and [Enrich automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/enrich-alert-sow-itom.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Event Rules**.

2.  Create or open an event rule.

3.  Click **Threshold**.

4.  Select **Active**.

    If **Active** is not selected, the fields on this page do not appear.

5.  In the **Create Alert Operator** field, select an operator.

    -   If you select **Count**, specify the corresponding **Occurs** and **Over\(seconds\)** fields.
    -   If you select any operator other than **Count**, the **Field name** and **Threshold value** fields appear. Specify the required values in these fields.

        **Note:** The value of the **Threshold value** property can be the name of any field in the **Additional information** of the event. For example, if `CPU` is a field in **Additional information** for a specific event, then `CPU` can be used as the **Threshold value**.

    -   In the **Occurs** field, specify the required value.
    -   In the **Over\(seconds\)** field, specify the required period.
6.  To automatically close alerts, in the **Close Alert Operator** field, select an operator.

    Extra fields appear according to your selection.

    -   If **Count** is specified as the operator for the **Create Alert Operator** field, then the selection in the **Close Alert Operator** field is either `None` or `Idle`. Specify the required value.
    -   If you select **Idle**, configure the **Over\(seconds\)** field.
    -   In the **Close Alert Operator** field, if you select an operator other than **Idle**, then configure the **Threshold value**, **Occurs**, and **Over\(seconds\)** fields.
7.  Click **Save** or **Submit**.


## Example

To create an alert when a specific event occurs 5 times in 10 minutes, in **Threshold**:

1.  In the **Field name** field, specify the name of any field that exists in the **Additional information** field in the event. The value of the field is irrelevant.
2.  In the **Create Alert Operator** field, select `Count`.
3.  In the **Occurs** field, specify `5`.
4.  In the **Over** field, `600` \(10 \* 60 seconds\).
5.  Click **Save** or **Submit**.

To create an alert when a specific event occurs 5 times in 10 minutes with a metric value greater than 55. Assume that “metric\_value” is a field in the **Additional information** of the event. Specify:

1.  Select the **Active** check box.
2.  In the **Create Alert Operator** field, select `>=`.
3.  In the **Field name** field, specify **metric\_value**.
4.  In the **Threshold value** field, specify `55`.
5.  In the **Occurs** field, specify `5`.
6.  In the **Over** field, specify `600` \(10 \* 60 seconds\).
7.  Click **Save** or **Submit**.
