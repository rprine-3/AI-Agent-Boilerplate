# Agent Health dashboard

The Agent Health dashboard provides visibility into the status and distribution of agents installed in your system. It allows you to quickly assess the number of deployed agents and their distribution, helping you prioritize your work more efficiently.

The following example shows the agents in your system that are currently up, which agents are configured to collect data, and which agents have stopped data collection due to having reached their CPU threshold \(Silent/Off\). It also displays the agents according to their version, OS, and connected MID Server.
