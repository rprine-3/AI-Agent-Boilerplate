# Kubernetes Explorer

Use the ServiceNow® Kubernetes Explorer to drill-down and view the Kubernetes environments and resources of your organization.

**Important:** Cloud Discovery Workspace is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. [Discovery Admin Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-admin-workspace.md) provides the latest experience for this functionality. For details, see the [Application/Plugin Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

\[Omitted image "cow-kubernetes-explorer.gif"\] Alt text: Cloud Resources Explorer.

The Kubernetes Explorer supports the following cloud providers:

-   Amazon Web Services \(AWS\): Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(EKS\)
-   Microsoft Azure Cloud: Azure Kubernetes Service
-   Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\): Google Kubernetes Engine \(GKE\)
-   OpenShift

**Important:** In the Kubernetes Explorer, any Kubernetes resource hosted on OpenShift is considered on-prem. Whereas, any Kubernetes resource hosted on Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) is considered cloud hosted.

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

The sn\_cloud\_ops\_ws.cloud\_ops\_admin role is required to view the Kubernetes Explorer.

## Access the Kubernetes Explorer

To open the dashboard, navigate to **All** &gt; **Cloud Discovery Workspace** &gt; **Kubernetes Explorer**.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Cloud Discovery Workspace is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances, but will continue to be supported. Discovery Admin Workspace provides the latest experience for this functionality. For details, see the [Application/Plugin Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

</table>## Indicators

-   **Clusters**

    A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. The Clusters indicator displays the daily total count and discovery trend of the Kubernetes clusters discovered across the Kubernetes deployments of your organization.

    The Kubernetes Explorer reads the Kubernetes Cluster Analytics \[sn\_cow\_k8s\_cluster\_analytics\] table to compute the Clusters indicator.

-   **Nodes**

    A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. The Nodes indicator displays the daily total count and discovery trend of the Kubernetes nodes discovered across the Kubernetes deployments of your organization.

    The Kubernetes Explorer reads the Kubernetes Node Analytics \[sn\_cow\_k8s\_node\_analytics\] table to compute the Nodes indicator.

-   **Namespaces**

    Kubernetes namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within the cluster. The Namespaces indicator displays the daily total count and discovery trend of the Kubernetes namespaces discovered across the Kubernetes deployments of your organization.

    The Kubernetes Explorer reads the Kubernetes Namespace Analytics \[sn\_cow\_k8s\_namespace\_analytics\] table to compute the Namespaces indicator.

-   **Services**

    Kubernetes service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them \(sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service\). The Services indicator displays the daily total count and discovery trend of the Kubernetes services discovered across the Kubernetes deployments of your organization.

    The Kubernetes Explorer reads the Kubernetes Service Analytics \[sn\_cow\_k8s\_service\_analytics\] table to compute the Services indicator.

    The Services indicator is also available on the Services tab of the Kubernetes Explorer.


## Breakdowns

-   Pod distribution: This breakdown displays the distribution of Kubernetes pods hosted on the on-prem infrastructure and the cloud infrastructure.

    You can filter the breakdown across the following dimensions:

    -   Region/Datacenter
    -   Geo Location
    -   Country
    The Pod distribution breakdown is available on the Overview tab of the Kubernetes Explorer.

-   Kubernetes services by platform or Kubernetes services by type: This breakdown displays the distribution of Kubernetes services across dimensions such as platform and type.
-   Nodes by region: This breakdown displays the distribution of the Kubernetes nodes across hosting regions.

## Filter

You can filter the list by interacting with the data visualizations such as donut and single score card.
