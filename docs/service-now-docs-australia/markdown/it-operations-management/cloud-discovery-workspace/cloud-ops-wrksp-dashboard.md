# Cloud Discovery Workspace dashboard

The ServiceNow® Cloud Discovery Workspace dashboard provides a summary of the cloud operations of your organization and shows the ServiceNow applications that you can use to manage them.

**Important:** Cloud Discovery Workspace is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. [Discovery Admin Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-admin-workspace.md) provides the latest experience for this functionality. For details, see the [Application/Plugin Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.
