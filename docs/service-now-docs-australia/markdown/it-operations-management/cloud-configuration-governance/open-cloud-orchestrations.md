# Open cloud orchestrations

Cloud orchestration records show you the orders that your instance processed for each attempted operation on a stack. They also show you the values of the fields that the user submitted through the Cloud User Portal. Use cloud orchestrations to troubleshoot issues that occur when a user provisions a cloud resource or runs another operation on an existing cloud resource.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_operator or sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

## Procedure

1.  On the instance \(not the Cloud User Portal\), enter the following text into the application filter:

    \[Omitted image "snmp-order-list.png"\] Alt text: Opening cloud orchestrations

    The list of Cloud Orchestrations appear.

2.  Sort and filter the list to find the error or other message you are looking for.

    For example, to sort the list by date, click the **Order Date** column. To show only errors that occurred, right-click **Error** in a cell and select **Show Matching**.

3.  Open a cloud orchestration record by clicking the **Order Date** field.

4.  Review the form fields:

    \[Omitted image "cloud-orchestration-form.png"\] Alt text: Cloud Orchestrations form

    The example form shows you the type of message you can see when an operation fails due to the incorrect credentials. The OrderForm Data field shows the Sys ID of the credential record and the service account ID.
