# Populate the datacenter in Terraform-based catalog items

In any request for a catalog item using Terraform templates, the required Location value specifies the datacenter or region where to provision the configuration items and stacks. You can use a variable named **region** in the Terraform template to map to the Location field on the request form.

## Before you begin

Role required: cloud\_designer

## Procedure

1.  In the template file that is the basis for the catalog item, define a variable named **region**.

    ```
    variable "region" {
                     type="string"
                   }
    ```

    -   The field defined for the **region** variable does not appear on the Provision section of the request form for the catalog item \(the Location field serves that purpose\).
    -   The value that the user specifies for the Location field on the request form configures the datacenter or region for the resource.
