# Add an AWS service account to the cloud account

During Cloud Provisioning and Governance Day 1 setup, you added one service account to the cloud account. To compartmentalize your infrastructure or to include different datacenters, you can add another service account. A particular datacenter, however, cannot be selected in more than one service account in a cloud account.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

## About this task

A service account is a secure record on your instance that stores the credential and access information for your provider account. Discovery uses the information to access your provider account to get data on each resource in each specified datacenter.

In this example, you added the service account named **ProviderB-ServiceAccount-1** and selected three datacenters to include in the cloud account:

**Important:** In a cloud account, you cannot select a particular datacenter in two different service accounts.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Admin Portal** &gt; **Service Accounts**.

2.  Click **New**, enter a unique and meaningful **Name**, and then fill in the form.

The credentials needed for ServiceNow applications to access this account. You may configure this field at a later stage, while configuring access to AWS accounts.

 -   If you [configured AWS credentials at ServiceNow AI Platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/aws-create-creds-cloud-mgt.md) , select the magnifying glass icon, and then select the name of the relevant AWS credential.
-   To use other AWS accounts to access this account, leave the field blank. For example, you don't need to specify the AWS credentials for accounts assuming IAM roles or member accounts using their management account for access.


</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

URL of the datacenter.

 This field is required for AWS China region and AWS GovCloud \(US\) accounts.

 For example:

-   AWS China region: `https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn`

See the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) for information on AWS Organizations.

**Note:** You will need to setup the correct permission in AWS or the Organization role for a standard credential.

    The system creates the service account and displays the list of all discovered datacenters.

4.  Repeat the process to add as many service accounts as needed.
