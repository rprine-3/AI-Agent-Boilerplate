# Add a datacenter to a cloud account

At any time, you can add a logical datacenter to the cloud infrastructure that is represented by a cloud account.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Cloud Accounts**.

2.  Open a cloud account, set the state to **Draft**, and then click **Configure** in the form header.

3.  Click the **Datacenters** tab and then select the **Service Account** that holds the credentials that enable access to the provider account that includes the datacenter to add.

    When you select the service account, the list of discovered datacenters for the service account appears.

    **Note:** If the expected datacenters do not appear, click **Discover Datacenters** to update the list. Discovery runs and displays all datacenters associated with the service account.

4.  Select the datacenters to add and then click **Save**.

    In the example, you select **ap-northeast-2**.


## Result

The datacenters are added to the cloud account and appear on the **Datacenters** tab. When Discovery runs, the resources in the datacenter appear on the Resources tab.
