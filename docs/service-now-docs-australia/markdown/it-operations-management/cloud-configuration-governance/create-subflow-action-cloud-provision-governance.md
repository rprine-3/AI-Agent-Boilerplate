# Create a response action for Cloud Provisioning and Governance

Create a subflow with the required input parameters that notifies Cloud Provisioning and Governance whether the flow completes successfully or not.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that you are familiar with the concepts of , [Subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/subflows.md), and [Action Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/actions.md).
-   Create a subflow that you intend to invoke for pre or post-provisioning.

Role required: flow\_designer, action\_designer, or admin

## About this task

Inform the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application, the execution status of steps in the subflow, by populating a response for each step.

-   Create a action with relevant input parameters.
-   Add a script to the action.
-   Pass a correlation id to the action in the subflow.

The response action communicates to the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application whether a step in the subflow, executes successfully or the step's condition fails and results in an error.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Flow Designer** &gt; **Actions** tab, select **New Action**.

    For more information, see Create an action.

2.  Fill in the Action Properties.

3.  Create and define action inputs to make data available to the action steps and outputs.

    Create the following input variables: error, log, output, and correlation id.

4.  Select and add a script action step to perform an operation on the action inputs.

5.  **Save** and **Publish** the action.

6.  In the **Flow Designer**, open the subflow you are invoking.

    **Note:** Ensure that the subflow input `flowcorrelationid` exists in the subflow.

7.  On the same subflow page, click **Actions** to expand and find **Actions**, **Subflow** or **Flow Logic**.

8.  Select Cloud Provisioning and Governance and, search and add the response action from the drop down.

9.  Select relevant values from the **Data Pill Picker**, for the inputs in the action.

    **Note:** Reuse the `flowcorrelationid` input from the **Data Panel** for every action in the subflow that has a logical end step.

10. If you are using the Terraform Connector for Terraform Enterprise, follow these steps.

    1.  To add actions, flows, subflows, or flow logic, click **Select to add an Action, Flow Logic, or Subflow**.

    2.  Select **Action** &gt; **Cloud Management: Terraform Connector**, and select a default action.

    The action you created sends a response to the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application, updating the order with the status of the subflow's step.


## What to do next

Test the subflow, and publish it when it is ready to be added to a flow or called from a script.

**Note:** You can only test or publish subflows that contain at least one action.
