# Reserve IP addresses for VMware vSphere VMs in InfoBlox

Create a policy to reserve IP addresses for VMware vSphere virtual machines in Infoblox, at the time of provisioning the virtual machines.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin.

## About this task

You can create a policy that is invoked when a VMware virtual machine is provisioned to get an IP address from Infoblox. Before the virtual machine is provisioned, the instance makes a call to Infoblox that creates a host record with the IP address.

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Govern** &gt; **Policies**.

    |Operation|Select **Virtual Server interface provision**.|
    |Moment|Select **Pre Operation**.|

3.  Click **Submit** to publish the policy.

4.  Create a policy rule for the policy.

7.  Click **Update**.

8.  In the **Policy Rules Action** related list, click **New** to create a policy action.
