# Cloud Provisioning and Governance Recipes

Multi-cloud recipes provide ready content for typical cloud deployment and common operations scenarios across cloud platforms.

## Recipes for Enterprise Workloads and Day-2 Operations

Cloud Provisioning and Governance recipes are ready-to-use catalog items built from sample CFT and ARM templates to support real-world cloud deployment use-cases. These recipes are ready for use in Proof of Concept as well as non-production environments. For production environments, ensure that the recipes are well tested and internally evaluated.
