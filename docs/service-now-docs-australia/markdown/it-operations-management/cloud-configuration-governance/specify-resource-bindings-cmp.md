# Specify the bindings for resource blocks

Bindings represent endpoint relationships. For example, a storage volume might implement an endpoint type of Block EP \(cmdb\_ci\_endpoint\_block\). A virtual server might consume an endpoint of that type. Bindings must support the Guest interface that is specified for the resource block.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Design** &gt; **Resource Blocks**.

2.  Select the resource block and then select **Draft** on the **Resource Blocks** form: \[Omitted image "draft-published-slider.png"\] Alt text: Draft.

3.  In the **Resource Bindings** related list, click **New**.

4.  On the **Resource Binding** form, the **Application** and the **Guest Resource** \(the resource block that you are currently configuring\) are already specified.
