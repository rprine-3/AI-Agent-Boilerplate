# Configuring Cloud Services Catalog Terraform Connector

Understand the high-level workflow for configuring the Cloud Services Catalog Terraform Connector application.

Perform the following steps to configure the Cloud Services Catalog Terraform Connector application:

1.  Install Cloud Services Catalog Terraform Connector. For more information, see [Install Cloud Services Catalog Terraform Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/install-cpg-terraform-connector.md).
2.  If you want to use a minor or patch version of Terraform Open Source, Terraform Enterprise, or Terraform Cloud, add the minor or patch version to the workload config provider record. For more information, see [Add support for minor or patch versions of the Terraform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/terraform-use-minor-patch-version-cli.md).
3.  To use Terraform Open Source as a config provider for Cloud Provisioning and Governance, do the following:
    1.  Assign Terraform capability to the MID Server. For more information, see [Configure MID Server capabilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureCapabilities.md).
    2.  Create a Terraform Open Source config provider. For more information, see [Create a Terraform Open Source config provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/setup-cpg-terraform-connector-for-terraform-open-source.md).
4.  To use Terraform Enterprise or Terraform Cloud as a config provider for Cloud Provisioning and Governance, do the following:
    1.  Assign Terraform Enterprise and REST capabilities to the MID Server. For more information, see [Configure MID Server capabilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureCapabilities.md).
    2.  Create a Terraform Enterprise or Terraform Cloud config provider. For more information, see [Create a Terraform Enterprise or Terraform Cloud config provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/setup-cpg-terraform-connector-for-terraform-enterprise.md).
5.  Discover resources from the Terraform environment.
