# Permissions management for Cloud Governance roles

Permissions are user group-level access rights to features in the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application and to specific records in the instance, such as blueprints or cloud accounts.

You can refine the actions that are allowed or prohibited for users based on user group. By default, each role includes access rights, but not all users with the same role can see or edit each others records. For example, by default users with the cloud\_designer role have full read and write access to their own blueprints, but they do not have read or write access to blueprints created by other cloud designers. If you want them to have access, you must put the users into a group that has the cloud\_designer role, then give that group read and write access to particular blueprints.

## Permission types

-   **Access \[Read\]**

    Users can see the record, but not edit or delete.

-   **Manage \[Create &amp; Update\]**

    Users can see the record and create and update new records in the same table, but cannot delete any records.

-   **Delete**

    Users can delete specified records or all records in the table.

-   **Execute**

    Users can execute an action on records in the table.

-   **All**

    Users have permissions on all records in the table.
