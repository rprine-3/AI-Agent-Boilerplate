# Cloud Admin Portal

The Cloud Admin Portal is a role-based portal. You can manage, design, govern, operate, and analyze all your cloud resources from a unified base.

Depending on the role you are logged in with, the Cloud Admin Portal displays different metrics. As an example, if you are logged in to the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application as a Cloud Service Designer, the Cloud Admin Portal displays only the **Design** metrics.
