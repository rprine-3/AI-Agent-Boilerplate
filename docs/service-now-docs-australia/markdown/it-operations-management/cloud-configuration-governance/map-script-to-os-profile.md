# Map a script to an OS profile

To execute scripted actions during VM provisioning, you can map a script to an OS profile. The script runs on VMs that are created based on the image template in the OS profile.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

You must have a cloud account with datacenters. You must run Discovery on the service accounts to populate the datacenters.

## About this task

In this procedure, you specify an existing script. See [Create cloud initialization script templates and a script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/create-cloud-init-template-and-script.md).

**Note:** Profile mappings that specify more details run first. For example, a mapping that specifies a blueprint, OS profile, and resource alias takes precedence over a mapping that specifies only an OS profile.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Resource Profiles**.

2.  In the **Profiles** list, select **OS Profile** and then open the profile.

3.  On the Cloud Script OS Profile Mappings related list, click **New** and then fill in the form.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Right-click the form header and select **Save**.

    The **Name** attribute `[scriptName]` appears in the OS Profile Mapping Overrides list.

5.  In the OS Profile Mapping Overrides list, enter an attribute name and value to use when the resource is provisioned.
