# Manage operation attributes

You can specify attribute values for catalog items help cloud users to correctly provision catalog items. You can configure and manage attributes for provision, pre-provision, and post-provision operations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_service\_designer.

## About this task

The attributes for provision, pre-provision, and post-provision operations are generated automatically. You can generate variables for these attributes and also create new attributes for the resource operation. You can also use the Pre-Provision Operation, Post-Provision Operation or Lifecycle Operations related lists to create variables for Orchestration attributes.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Design** &gt; **Cloud Catalog Items**.

2.  Open a catalog item and click the Pre-Provision Operation or Post-Provision Operation related list.

    The Operations Step page lists the operations.

3.  Click an operation to view its corresponding attributes.

4.  Configure the attributes for each operation.

    -   **Mapping**: View the auto-generated mapping values for each attribute. Mappings specify where to pull the information in the system. To modify the expression mappings, double-click the mapping value and enter new values. Then click the check mark icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-check-mark.png"\] Alt text: check mark icon\). Expressions can hold the values for information that's dynamically generated in the system, such as the values for the selections that users make in the Cloud User Portal. See [Using expressions in Cloud Provisioning and Governance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/expressions-cloud-mgt.md).
    -   **Generate Variable**: Generates a variable for an attribute. Double-click the value \(**false**\), select **True**, and click the check mark icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-check-mark.png"\] Alt text: check mark icon\).
5.  Click **Apply Changes** after you've made all the required changes.

    All the configurations you made to the attributes are saved and you're returned to the Cloud Catalog Items screen.
