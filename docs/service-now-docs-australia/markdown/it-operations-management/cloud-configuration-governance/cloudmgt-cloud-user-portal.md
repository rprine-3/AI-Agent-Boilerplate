# Cloud User Portal

The Cloud User Portal gives you immediate access to all day-to-day cloud activities.

## Cloud User Portal

Use the Cloud User Portal to perform the following actions:

-   Monitor your quota, costs, budget, life-cycle events, stack health, and requests.
-   Request stacks from the service catalog and track requests.
-   Request life-cycle operations for stacks and resources \(for example, stop, start, or deprovision\).
-   Create and track incidents.
