# Use multiple repositories structure with Terraform Connector app

You can now discover multiple Terraform configurations from one repository, at any folder level with Terraform Enterprise Config Provider.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

Perform the [Run the IaC Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/discover-terraform-config-installables-vcs-workspaces.md) steps and specify what repository, branches and folder paths have to be considered for discovering Terraform configurations with these steps.

## Procedure

1.  Add repositories and branches that you want to consider for discovering Terraform configurations.

2.  Use **&lt;Repository-Name&gt;::&lt;Branch-Name&gt;** format to include a branch from a repository.

3.  To specify multiple repository and branch mappings, use comma \(,\).

    Example: Repo1::Branch1, Repo2::Branch2.

    Leave the field bank if you want to discovery all the repositories and branches in that VCS.

4.  Select **Do you wish to specify sub-folder paths for Discovery** if you want to discover Terraform configurations from specific folder paths of the repository.

5.  In the **Folder Path List**, add the list of folder paths separated by comma\(,\) to discover terraform configurations from it.

    -   Folder path filter applies to all Repository Branches included in ‘Repo and Branch inclusion List’.
    -   All Terraform configurations you want to discover from a specific folder path needs to be in subfolders just one level below in folder hierarchy. Example:**/gcp/vm** folder path has one Terraform configuration for virtual machine,
    -   Specify **/gcp** in folder path list to discover vm Terraform configuration.
