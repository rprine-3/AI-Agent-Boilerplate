# \(Optional\) Add a Google Cloud Platform service account to the cloud account

During Cloud Provisioning and Governance Day 1 setup, you added one service account to the cloud account. To compartmentalize your infrastructure or to include different datacenters, you can add another service account. A particular datacenter, however, cannot be selected in more than one service account in a cloud account.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

## About this task

A service account is a secure record on your instance that stores the credential and access information for your provider account. Discovery uses the information to access your provider account to get data on each resource in each specified datacenter.

In this example, you added the service account named **ProviderB-ServiceAccount-1** and selected three datacenters to include in the cloud account:

\[Omitted image "cloud-acct-makeup.png"\] Alt text: A second service account with three selected datacenters

**Important:** In a cloud account, you cannot select a particular datacenter in two different service accounts.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Admin Portal** &gt; **Service Accounts**.

2.  Click **New**, enter a unique and meaningful **Name**, and then fill in the form.

3.  Fill in the remaining fields:
