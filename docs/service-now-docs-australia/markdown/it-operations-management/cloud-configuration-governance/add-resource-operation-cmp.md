# Add a resource operation to the execution plan

The base system includes a large set of predefined resource operations. Rarely, you might add a custom operation for a resource.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_service\_designer

## Procedure

1.  While working in the blueprint designer, click the **Operations** tab and select the appropriate blueprint operation.

    As an example, you may select the **Provision** operation.

2.  Click **Add**.

    The Add Resource Operation dialog box appears.

3.  Fill in the form fields \(as shown in the table\).

<table id="table_n2g_2dk_xy"><tbody><tr><td>

Resource

</td><td>

Select a resource to perform the operation on.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Interface

</td><td>

Select an interface for the resource.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Operation

</td><td>

Select an operation to perform for the step. By default, **Provision**, **Stop**, **Start** and **Deprovision** are provided. You at least need a provision operation for a user to order a cloud catalog item.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Click **Submit**.

    The new operation is added to the operation graph. The system adds the appropriate parameters for the operation.

5.  Click the **Create Form Parameter** check box to select a parameter.

    Parameters differ for each operation. Enter a mapping expression for the selected parameter in the **Mapping** field. See [Using expressions in Cloud Provisioning and Governance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/expressions-cloud-mgt.md).

6.  Click **Save**.
