# Example: Post-provision cloud script

This example shows a cloud script that runs after a user provisions a virtual machine.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: cloud\_admin
-   OS resource profile that is mapped to an image template. The user provisions a resource using the profile. You must add [basic authentication credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_BasicAuthCredentialsForm.md) to the image.
-   Compute resource profile that is mapped to a hardware type.

## About this task

In this example, you create a cloud init script, customize a resource block, and provision a VM from the Cloud User Portal.

## Procedure

1.  Create a cloud script template and a cloud script that refers to the template.

2.  Open the virtual server resource block, and then follow these steps:

    1.  Set the **Draft/Published** switch to **Draft**.

        \[Omitted image "virtual-server-rb.png"\] Alt text: Virtual Server

    2.  On the **Operations** tab, select **Virtual Server Interface** from the **Interface** list.

        \[Omitted image "virtual-server-interface.png"\] Alt text: Virtual Server Interface

    3.  In the **Operation** field, verify that these operations exist:

        -   **Block Until Ready**
        -   **Execute Script**: This operation tells the blueprint to run a script.
        \[Omitted image "blockuntilready-operation.png"\] Alt text: Block Until Ready

        \[Omitted image "execute-script-operation.png"\] Alt text: Execute Script operation

    4.  Click the **Input Parameters** tab to view the inputs for each operation.

    5.  On the **Steps** tab, add steps as needed.

    6.  For the **Script** parameter on each step, clear the **Script** check box and change the expression in the **Mapping** column to the following text: `$(CloudScript.scripts.scriptname)`, where `scriptname` is the name of the script, not the script template, that you created earlier.

        \[Omitted image "script-parameters-input-parameters.png"\] Alt text: Script parameter

3.  Publish the virtual server resource block, and use it in a blueprint that in turn is published to a catalog item.

4.  Launch a new stack to provision a VM and specify the OS profile and Compute profile that you created as a prerequisite.


## Result

The Stack Status page runs through the **CreateNode**, **BlockUntilReady**, and **ExecuteShellScript** operations. The last operation kicked off the script you created.
