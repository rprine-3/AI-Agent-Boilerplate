# Moving Cloud Provisioning and Governance content across environments

You can move the content in the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application from one environment to the other. For example, develop an application in an environment and then move the application and all its dependencies to another environment for testing or production.

## Content entities that can be moved

The Cloud Provisioning and Governance application consists of code, resources, content, and configurations.

You can move the following content entities across environments:

-   Blueprints
-   Resource blocks
-   Cloud APIs

Use the update sets to move the content entities. Update sets, which are XML files, group all the content into named sets and then moves these sets, as a unit, to other systems for testing or deployment. For information on how system update sets work, see [System update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets.md) .

## Content entity dependencies

Each of the content entities has some direct dependencies that are automatically moved with the content to the new environment.

The direct dependencies for each of these content entities are:
