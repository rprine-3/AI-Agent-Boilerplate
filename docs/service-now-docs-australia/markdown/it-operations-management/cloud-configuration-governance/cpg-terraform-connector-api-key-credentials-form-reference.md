# Cloud Services Catalog Terraform Connector API Key Credentials form reference

The Cloud Services Catalog Terraform Connector uses API key credentials to authenticate the requests sent to the Terraform Enterprise and Terraform Cloud and the version control systems provisioned in them.

To learn more about API key permissions and tokens, see [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens).

**Note:** The Terraform Connector integration requires an organization-level token. Organization-level tokens provide all the necessary permissions for the integration.
