# Create a variable set for Cloud Provisioning and Governance

Reduce the number of steps required to create and manage multiple catalog items and order guides by creating variable sets. With variable sets, you don't have to create variables individually for each catalog item.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_service\_designer

## About this task

Create a collection of structured variables that can be reused across multiple catalog items and order guides using variable sets.

Add a new variable set when you need specific request form variables for running actions such as post-provisioning. Variable sets also collect additional information such as custom tags.

You can modify the variable set and the changes are reflected across all the catalog items that are associated with the variable set. Variable sets also allow you to define catalog client scripts and UI policies that are applicable to the variables in the set.

When you generate a catalog item, two variable sets, **General Info** and **Provision**, are automatically created. Create as many variable sets as needed.

## Procedure

1.  Open a cloud catalog item and in the **Variable Sets** tab, click **New**.

    The Variable Set screen appears.

2.  Fill in the form details \(as shown in the table\).

<table id="table_rd1_4sf_pfb"><thead><tr><th>

</table>3.  Click **Submit**.

    The new variable set is created and appears in the **Variable Sets** tab. Open the new variable set and click **New** in the **Cloud Variables** tab to create variables for the set.
