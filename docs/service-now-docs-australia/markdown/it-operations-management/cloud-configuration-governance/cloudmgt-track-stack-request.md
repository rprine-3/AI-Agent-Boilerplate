# Track a stack request

The system generates a request when you submit the form to launch a stack.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_service\_user

## About this task

If no approval policy is defined, requests are auto-approved. If a policy is defined, then a user on the approver list must approve the request.

If the quota limit exceeds for you or your user group, then an error message appears or the system triggers a policy-based approval. For more information about the quota limits, see [Viewing resource quota limits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/resource-quota.md).

## Procedure

1.  Go to the **Activities** page or navigate to **Overview** &gt; **View Activities**, then select **Track** &gt; **Requests**.

    The following color codes show you the status of the request:

    -   Green: Completed or Approved.
    -   Orange: Processing.
    -   Red: Rejected, Error, or Canceled.
2.  In the **Requests** list, click an entry.
