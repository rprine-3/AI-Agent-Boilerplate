</td><td>

The catalog item, if any, that was involved in the execution.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Message

</td><td>

The error message or successful completion message. This could include items like the ID of the corresponding message in the Cloud API Trail record or the Cloud API that was invoked.

Details about the error, such as an HTTP error.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>An example of an error message detail is as follows:

```
Failed to list loadbalancer Failed : HTTP error code : 403
```

This indicate that the credentials were incorrect, and Discovery could not access the cloud resource. The load balancer interface throws the first error because the load balancer device is the first device that allows access to the cloud resource.

A corresponding error on the MID- Server is captured in the Cloud API Trail.

## Steps, stages, and components

Each Cloud Orchestration entry has identifying attributes that explain what the triggering transaction was about. Steps group these attributes together and identify the component in the system that was involved in the transaction and the stage at which the transaction took place.

You can configure the Cloud Orchestration Trail form to show the **Step** field if it is not already visible.
