# Specify a host resource for a resource block

Hosts that support the **Host interface** of a resource block are potential hosts for the resource block. You use the **Host interface** setting to further limit the options that are presented to the stack requester while selecting a host type.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Design** &gt; **Resource Blocks**.

2.  Select the resource block and then select **Draft** on the **Resource Blocks** form: \[Omitted image "draft-published-slider.png"\] Alt text: Draft.

3.  In the **Host Resource** related list, click **New**.

    On the **Resource Host** form, the **Application** and the **Guest Resource** \(the resource block that you are currently configuring\) are already specified.

4.  Specify the **Host Resource**.

    For example, for a virtual server, you might select **AWS Datacenter** or **Azure Datacenter** as potential host types.

5.  Click **Submit**.
