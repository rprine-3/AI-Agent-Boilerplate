# Export or import a cloud policy

To back up, move, or restore a policy, you can export and import the policy as an update set. The update set includes rules, conditions, actions, scripts, and script categories.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin or admin.

## Procedure

1.  On the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Govern** &gt; **Policies**.

2.  Perform the following action to export a policy:

    1.  Click the export icon for the policy.

        \[Omitted image "export-cloud-policy.png"\] Alt text: Export icon for a policy

        The instance generates an update set.

3.  To import a policy, install the update set as follows:

    1.  On the instance to import to, navigate to **System Update Sets** &gt; **Retrieved Update Sets**.

    2.  Click the **Import Update Set from XML** related link.

    3.  In the Import XML popup, click **Choose File**, select the file, and then click **Upload**.

    If a policy that you exported from the source environment exists in the target environment and both policies have the same sys\_id, then the policy in the target environment is updated.

    **Note:** If the policy that you exported from the source environment exists in the target environment, and the policies have different sys\_ids, then an error occurs during the import process. You must export a different policy from the source environment or delete the policy with the same name in the target environment.
