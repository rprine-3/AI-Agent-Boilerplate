# Create an action for an 'on Task Remediation' policy

The on Task remediation trigger fires when a user resubmits a failed request. A policy that is triggered by the on Task Remediation trigger can start approval subflows.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_governor or admin
-   Optional: [Create one or more cloud policy groups]().
-   [Configure a cloud policy rule]() and associated conditions.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Govern** &gt; **Policies**.

2.  Open a cloud policy and set the policy to the **Draft** state if needed.

3.  Open the rule that should perform the action and then click **New** on the Policy Rule Actions related list.

4.  On the popup, click **Create** for the type of action to perform.

5.  Select one of the following options.

    -   **Custom Approval** runs the subflow that you specify. The subflow should return a value of **approved** to complete the operation.
    -   **Service Now Approval** supports differing approvers based on the trigger for the policy:
        -   Manager Approval
        -   Assignment Group
        -   User \(lock\)
6.  On the Approval form, specify a unique and meaningful **Action Name**.

Manager Approval

</td><td>

One or all of the following:-   Select the **Manager Approval** check box to require the manager of the approver to also approve the request. The default approval subflow goes to the manager first, then to the group, and finally to the user.
-   Select a user group from the **Assignment Group** list.
-   Unlock the **User** lock, select a user from the list, then close the lock.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment group

</td><td>

Select the assignment group that can approve the request. Any user in the group can approve the action using the default subflow. The approval then goes to the users in the **User** field.**Note:** Users in an assignment group that do not have the itil role still receive an approval record and notification by default, but they cannot perform the approval. Assign the itil role to any users or user groups that must make operational and provisioning approvals.

</td></tr><tr><td>

User

</td><td>

Select one or more users to whom the approval action applies. All selected users must approve the action using the default subflow.
