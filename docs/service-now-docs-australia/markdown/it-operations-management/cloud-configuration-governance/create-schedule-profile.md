# Create a schedule profile

You map a schedule profile to an instance schedule. The schedule profile applies to all newly-provisioned resources that use the profile. For example, a schedule profile can specify the days of the week and times of day when a stack should start and stop.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

You must have a cloud account with datacenters. You must run Discovery on the service accounts to populate the datacenters.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Resource Profiles**.

2.  In the **Profiles** list, select **Schedule Profile**.

3.  Click **New**, enter a unique and descriptive **Name** and **Description**, fill in the form, and then click **Submit**.

See [Define a schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_DefineASchedule.md).
