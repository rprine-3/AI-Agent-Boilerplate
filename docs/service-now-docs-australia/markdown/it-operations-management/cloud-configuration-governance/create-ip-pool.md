# Create an IP pool

Create an IP pool to associate a cloud subnet with an IPAM provider instance.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin
-   Create [Infoblox credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/infoblox-creds.md) and [register an Infoblox server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/create-infoblox.md).
-   Run Discovery on the cloud account to find subnets or [manually create cloud subnets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-configuration-governance/create-subnet.md).

**Note:** This functionality is not supported with our template-based cloud catalogs.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Networks &amp; IPAM**.

2.  On the **IP Pools** tab, click **New**, enter a unique and descriptive **Name**, and then fill in the form.
