# Credential handling

Extend the workflow engine to manage processes and automate things outside of an instance with Orchestration. Use the appropriate credentials required by Orchestration SSH and PowerShell activity elements: SSH requires SSH and PowerShell requires Windows.

The Cloud Provisioning and Governance application generates credentials \(node credentials\) after a VM is provisioned. Node credentials are used to connect to a VM. In addition to node credentials, the system generates SSH/Windows credentials. These credentials are required for Orchestration, which provides the automation for workflows.

## Pre-existing VMs

Cloud Provisioning and Governance now generates SSH private key credentials and Windows credentials for all active pre-existing VMs provisioned through Cloud Provisioning and Governance.

## Delete credentials

When you deprovision or delete a VM, all associated credentials are deleted. This includes the node credential, SSH private key credentials, Windows credentials, and the credentials alias tag.
