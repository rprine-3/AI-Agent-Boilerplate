# Migrating a Health Log Analytics data input configuration between instances

Export a Health Log Analytics data input and source types configuration as an update set and import it to a different ServiceNow instance. In the target environment, you can use the migrated data input for streaming and processing log data. This functionality saves time and reduces possible errors by avoiding the need to configure the settings again on the target instance.

The migrated configuration includes mapping and all other relevant settings, except credentials. Depending on the data input that you're exporting, you may need to configure credentials in the target environment. For example, when exporting Amazon CloudWatch or Amazon S3 data inputs, you must configure Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) credentials.

This feature is supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 25.0.17 - November 2022 and later, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

Starting with Health Log Analytics Version 38.0.17 - December 2025, you can also export all source types related to one or more selected log sources to the update set together. For more information, see [Export source types by log source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-export-sourcetypes-by-source.md).

For general information about update sets in the ServiceNow AI Platform, see [System update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/system-update-sets.md).
