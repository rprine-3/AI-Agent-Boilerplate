# Administering Health Log Analytics

This section covers tasks involved in Health Log Analytics administration. It provides you with information needed to keep Health Log Analytics running efficiently.

-   **[Configure Health Log Analytics system properties for a single log source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-system-properties-configure-single.md)**  
Configure system properties for a specific log source if you need to alter the default values, which should not usually be necessary.
-   **[Enable or disable Health Log Analytics system features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-features-configure.md)**  
Customize the basic configuration of Health Log Analytics by enabling or disabling system features.
-   **[View log anomaly metrics in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-metric-data-table.md)**  
View and query all metrics that Health Log Analytics tracks from a single location.
-   **[Health Log Analytics alert notification in Slack or Microsoft Teams channels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-alert-notification-in-channel.md)**  
Health Log Analytics sends notifications for new anomaly alerts in real time to Slack or Microsoft Teams channels. This built-in functionality frees you from having to continuously monitor logs to prevent incidents.
-   **[Storage space for log retention in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-log-retention-space.md)**  
The Health Log Analytics base system typically provides 1,000 GB storage space for log source retention, although the storage capacity may vary depending on your license. The default retention time for logs is three days, but you can modify that period.
-   **[Scaling Health Log Analytics to stream logs at a higher rate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-scaling.md)**  
Stream log data to Health Log Analytics in a scalable, more stable way using the advanced ServiceNow infrastructure.
-   **[Enhancing the CMDB with host data Health Log Analytics found in logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-cmdb-enrich-concept.md)**  
When Health Log Analytics streams logs, it extracts host data from the log events. If host data is discovered that doesn't match the information in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\), the system creates a configuration item \(CI\) candidate. You can review the candidate based on the data found in the logs.
