# View log data for an alert in Health Log Analytics

View a chart of the frequency of anomalous log lines and the associated log data on the Log Viewer.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, or evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the **Log Viewer** tab using one of the following methods:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** and select the Log Viewer icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-log-viewer-sow.png"\] Alt text: Log Viewer icon.\).
    -   While viewing log entries for an alert on the **Surrounding logs** tab, select **Log Viewer**.
2.  Personalize the displayed data and how it is presented on the Log Viewer.

    -   [Filter search results on the Log Viewer in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-op-log-viewer-filter-sow.md) to show only the data you want to view.
    -   [Customize the Log Viewer table in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-op-log-viewer-table-sow.md) by adding or removing columns.
    These features are supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 20.0.11 - July 2021, and the Health Log Analytics Viewer application, Version 20.0.4 - July 2021, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

3.  Analyze log-based anomalies and added context to help you achieve faster mean time to repair \(MTTR\).

    For example, say you find a log line with errors found in a configuration file. On the **Anomaly** card, a sudden spike on the chart indicates where the configuration file is generating the errors. You can view additional key-value pairs extracted from the logs on the **Meaningful log properties** card and find the affected application services and their related service offerings on the **Impacted services** card. For greater context, you may want to [investigate the logs that surround the anomaly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-op-surrounding-logs-view-concept-sow.md), locate the configuration file, and find the time frame where the issues occurred.


## What to do next

Use additional features on the Log Viewer to refine your search or define alerts.

-   Modify the search query to fine-tune the search and save useful searches. See [Define, save, and share a log data search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-op-search-queries-manage-sow.md).
-   If you discover important relationships in the log data, select **Define alert** to define the kind of alert that should be triggered by the data. See [Define a custom Log Analytics alert rule in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-op-alert-rule-add-sow.md) for instructions.
