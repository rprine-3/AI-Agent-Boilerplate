# Set up integrations for Health Log Analytics from the Integrations Launchpad

Set up integrations from the Event Management Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM.

## Integrations Launchpad

The Integrations Launchpad tool provides a unified interface for convenient integration with connectors that feed raw log messages from external sources into your ServiceNow instance for processing and analysis. For more information, see [Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/integrations-launchpad.md).

## Integrations for Health Log Analytics

The Integrations Launchpad enables the following integrations for Health Log Analytics:

-   **Pull integrations**

    These integrations pull log data from external data sources and stream the data to your instance, typically via a MID Server. Select an integration in the table to open a page with the setup procedure.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

[Amazon CloudWatch]()

</td><td>

Streams log data from Amazon CloudWatch to your instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

[Amazon S3]()

</td><td>

Streams log data from Amazon S3 \(Simple Storage Service\) buckets to your instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**Note:** Only a single ServiceNow System Logs Retriever data input can exist in the system, and only users with the admin role can create and configure it.

</td></tr><tr><td>

[Splunk Poller]()

</td><td>

Pulls log data from Splunk to your ServiceNow instance periodically by query.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>-   **Push integrations**

    These integrations connect to external data sources that push log data to your instance, typically via a MID Server. Select an integration in the table to open a page with the setup procedure.

<table id="table_ezf_rh1_mcc"><thead><tr><th>

Integration

</th><th>

Description
