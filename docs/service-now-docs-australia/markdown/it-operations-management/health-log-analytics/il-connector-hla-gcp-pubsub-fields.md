# GCP PubSub integration configuration fields

Description of the fields on the GCP PubSub integration configuration forms for Health Log Analytics.

For the GCP PubSub integration setup procedure, see [Set up a GCP PubSub integration for Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/il-connector-hla-gcp-pubsub.md).

<table id="table_ptx_ylg_lgc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Integration Name

</td><td>

Unique name of this integration. For example: My GCP PubSub integration. This field is required.**Note:** When you fill in this field, the generic name displayed on the form adjusts automatically to match the name you entered.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service Instance

</td><td>

The service instance \(formerly the application service\) to which to bind the log data. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execute on

</td><td>

Option to select whether to use a specific MID Server or a MID Server cluster. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server name

</td><td>

\(Only when **Execute on** is set to Specific MID Server.\)

The MID Server to which the logs are streamed. **Note:**

-   You can only select a MID Server with log ingestion capability that supports basic authentication. MID Servers that support mTLS are not listed.
-   If log ingestion is not enabled on the selected MID Server, Health Log Analytics enables it automatically.
-   The default maximum number of data inputs streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. You can modify this number in the MID Server properties.

This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server cluster

</td><td>

\(Only when **Execute on** is set to Specific MID Server cluster.\)

The MID Server cluster to which the log data is pulled. This field is required.The data input runs on a single MID Server in the cluster until that MID Server fails. The system then moves all the data input tasks to the next available MID Server in the cluster according to the configured order.

**Note:**

-   Health Log Analytics supports only failover MID Server clusters. In these clusters, multiple MID Servers are grouped together for failover protection. When selecting a cluster from the data input or integration form, the MID Server clusters list displays only failover clusters.
-   Log ingestion must be enabled for each MID Server in the cluster. If log ingestion is not enabled for the active MID Server, Health Log Analytics enables it automatically.
-   The default maximum number of data inputs or integrations streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. A cluster passes capacity validation if it contains at least one MID Server with fewer than 10 data inputs or integrations running on it. This is true even when that MID Server is down.

For more information about MID Server clusters, see [Configure a MID Server cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureAMIDServerCluster.md).
