# Apache Kafka data input configuration fields

Description of the fields on the Apache Kafka data input configuration form.

## Basic configuration

<table id="table_vny_z2c_x4b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the new data input. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Description of the data input.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execute on

</td><td>

Option to select whether to use a specific MID Server or a MID Server cluster. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID

</td><td>

\(Only when the **Execute on** field is set to Specific MID Server\)

 MID Server to which log data from Apache Kafka is pulled. **Note:**

-   You can select only MID Servers that support basic authentication. MID Servers that support mTLS are not listed.
-   The default maximum number of data inputs streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. You can modify this number in the MID Server properties.
-   If log ingestion is not enabled for the selected MID Server, Health Log Analytics enables it automatically.

This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server Cluster

</td><td>

\(Only when **Execute on** is set to Specific MID Server cluster.\)

The MID Server cluster to which the log data is pulled. This field is required.The data input runs on a single MID Server in the cluster until that MID Server fails. The system then moves all the data input tasks to the next available MID Server in the cluster according to the configured order.

**Note:**

-   Health Log Analytics supports only failover MID Server clusters. In these clusters, multiple MID Servers are grouped together for failover protection. When selecting a cluster from the data input or integration form, the MID Server clusters list displays only failover clusters.
-   Log ingestion must be enabled for each MID Server in the cluster. If log ingestion is not enabled for the active MID Server, Health Log Analytics enables it automatically.
-   The default maximum number of data inputs or integrations streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. A cluster passes capacity validation if it contains at least one MID Server with fewer than 10 data inputs or integrations running on it. This is true even when that MID Server is down.

For more information about MID Server clusters, see [Configure a MID Server cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureAMIDServerCluster.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service instance

</td><td>

The service instance to which to bind the log data. **Note:** If no relevant service instance exists, [Create an service instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/create-it-services.md) and add CIs to it. Set the status of the new service instance to Operational.

This field is required.
