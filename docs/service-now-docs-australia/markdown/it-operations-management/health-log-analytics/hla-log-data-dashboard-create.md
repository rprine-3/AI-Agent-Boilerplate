# Create log data dashboards and visualizations in Health Log Analytics

Build Health Log Analytics log data dashboards and visualizations in real time for easier identification and understanding of issues.

## Before you begin

This functionality is supported in the Service Operations Workspace Log Analytics application, Version 21.2.7 - November 2022 and later, and has a dependency on the Platform Analytics Workspace, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

For detailed information about creating and working with dashboards, see [Dashboards in the Analytics Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/analytics-center-dashboards.md).

**Note:** As an alternative to defining your own dashboard, you can use the AIOps dashboards, which offer comprehensive visualizations of critical operational data. For more information, see [AIOps Dashboards in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/aiops-dashboards-sow-itom.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Platform Analytics Workspace**.

    This tab enables you to view all the dashboards you have rights to access on your instance. You can filter the dashboard tiles to limit the number that are visible.

    **Note:** If you want to use an existing dashboard, select the dashboard here to open it. Otherwise, create a dashboard as explained in the remainder of this procedure.

3.  Create a dashboard.

    1.  Select **Create new dashboard**.
    2.  In the New dashboard dialog, choose **In-line editor** and specify a name and optional description for the dashboard.

        **Note:** The in-line editor does not automatically save your work. Ensure that you save regularly.

    Various elements are available to help you organize and populate the information on the dashboard. For more information, see [Analytics Center dashboard elements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/ac-elements.md).

    1.  Select **Add new element**.

    2.  Select **Data visualization** from the available elements.

        The **Data visualization** element appears on the dashboard, where you can edit it.
