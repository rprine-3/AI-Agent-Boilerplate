# Viewing Health Log Analytics system health alerts on the service map

The ServiceNow Event Management service map includes a model of the Health Log Analytics core components and the system health alerts that affect them.

Health Log Analytics and the Event Management application form a single service. Viewing the configuration items \(CIs\) that comprise Health Log Analytics and their relationships helps you visualize the impact of HLA system health issues on the service.

Health Log Analytics uses self-health checks to monitor the health of its components. When it discovers a system health issue, a notification triggers an alert. System health alerts display on the affected CIs on the service map. A colored bar on an affected CI indicates the criticality level of the alert: A red bar signifies a critical alert, an orange bar a major alert, and a yellow bar a minor alert.

For example, the red bar indicates a critical alert on this CI:

If the alert impacts the parent object, the parent object has a bar of the same color. For more information, see [View an alert impact on CIs in a service map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/t_EMViewTopology.md).

You can drill down into an alert to view details about the issue and then address it by performing the action proposed in the notification. For more information, see [Health Log Analytics self-health checks, notifications, and proposed actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-self-health-notifications.md).
