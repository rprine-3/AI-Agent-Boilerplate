1.  Select a CI candidate record and review the information on the form.

For field descriptions, see [Log-based CI candidates fields in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-cmdb-enrich-fields.md).

2.  Add the CI candidate to the CMDB or delete it.
    -   If the CI candidate is appropriate, either add it to the CMDB as is or include more information in it before adding it to the CMDB.

        -   To add the CI candidate to the CMDB as is, select **Add to CMDB** and then select **Continue**.
        -   To add more information, select **Edit additional CI fields**. Enter data that was not extracted from the logs, such as the name of the company associated with the CI, and then select **Submit**.
The CI is added to the CMDB. In the CMDB table for the relevant class type, the discovery source for the new CI is Health Log Analytics. The CI candidate record is automatically deleted from the Log-based CI candidates table.

    -   If the CI candidate is irrelevant, delete it by selecting **Delete**.
