# Filter search results on the Log Viewer in Health Log Analytics

Apply filters on the **Log Viewer** to show only your desired data.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, or evt\_mgmt\_user, or evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

This feature is supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 20.0.11 - July 2021, and the Health Log Analytics Viewer application, Version 20.0.4 - July 2021, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

## Procedure

1.  Open the **Log Viewer** using one of the following methods:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** and select the Log Viewer icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-log-viewer-sow.png"\] Alt text: Log Viewer icon.\).
    -   While viewing log entries for an alert on the **Surrounding logs** tab, select **Log Viewer**.
2.  Define and run a search.

    For more information, see [Define, save, and share a log data search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-op-search-queries-manage-sow.md).

3.  Filter the search results in one of the following ways.

<table id="choicetable_ymv_1jg_ftb"><tbody><tr><td id="d389561e182">

**Add filters using the fields list**

</td><td>

1.  Select the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-lv-filters-sow.png"\] Alt text: Filter icon.\).

The Selected fields list includes the fields that currently display as columns in the **Log Viewer** table. By default, the table includes the following columns: Application service, Component, Host, Level, Message, Raw message, and Time. The Available fields list includes all remaining fields that the system has extracted from the log.

2.  Select a field in the list.

**Note:** You can search for a specific field using the search option.

The top five values the system has found in the records for this field are displayed, along with the percentage of their occurrence.

3.  Define a filter for a value in the field.
    -   To display only data that contains a value, select **Add** for it.

For example, to set the filter **\[Level\]\[is\]\[critical\]**, select **Add** for the value "critical" in the Level field.

    -   To create negative filters that exclude data that contains a value, select **Exclude** for it.

For example, to set the filter **\[Level\]\[is not\]\[critical\]**, select **Exclude** for the value "critical" in the Level field.
