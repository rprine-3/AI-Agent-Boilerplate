# Set up an OpenTelemetry Collector integration for Health Log Analytics

Set up an OpenTelemetry Collector integration to stream log data directly to your ServiceNow instance using the OpenTelemetry \(OTLP\) protocol, without a MID Server.

## Before you begin

Set up MID-less log streaming via ITOM Gateway. Choose the deployment method based on your expected log volume. For more information, see [MID-less log streaming via ITOM Gateway in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-midless-streaming.md).

As an alternative to the provided procedure, you can set up MID-less integrations for HLA from an AI-enabled MCP Client, without opening the ServiceNow UI. For more information, see [MID-less log ingestion for HLA from an MCP Client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-mcp-server-hla-ingest.md).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation pane, select the AIOps configuration center icon \[Omitted image "icon-itom-aiops-config.png"\] Alt text: ITOM AIOps configuration center icon.

    The ITOM AIOps configuration center page appears. The configuration center is a centralized workspace. Use it to configure and manage AIOps features from a single place.

3.  From the Integrate section, under Integrations, select **Add integration**.

    The Integrations Launchpad appears.

4.  In the **Browse integrations** tab, search for the OpenTelemetry \(MID-less\) integration and select its tile.

    **Note:** If you start an integration setup before meeting all prerequisites, a message appears. You can cancel the setup and complete the prior requirements first. Alternatively, you can continue in draft mode and complete the requirements later. Note that you can't activate the integration until you have completed all the prerequisites.

5.  On the **Provide details** form, fill in the fields and then select **Next**.

6.  On the **Set-up instruction** screen, follow the provided procedure to enable sending log data to ServiceNow using OpenTelemetry.

    1.  Copy the provided access token, endpoint, and integration ID to the clipboard.

        These credentials enable the collector to receive telemetry data and forwarding it to the ServiceNow ITOM Gateway.

        |Credential|Description|
        |----------|-----------|
        |Access Token|The JWT credential passed with every request.|
        |Endpoint|The address to which the data is sent: the ITOM Gateway.|
        |Integration ID|The ID with which the integration identifies to ServiceNow.|

    2.  In your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file, exporters section, add an OTLP exporter to forward telemetry data to ServiceNow.

        Typically, the configuration file is `otel-collector-config.yaml`.

        ```
        exporters:
          otlp/servicenow:
            endpoint: itomgw-prod-gateway-phxbwi.sncapps.service-now.com:443
            headers:
              # Reads the access token from the SERVICENOW_ACCESS_TOKEN env variable
              servicenow-access-token: ${SERVICENOW_ACCESS_TOKEN}
              servicenow-integration-id: f7452b23877c4b10ebdd4335dabb3553
        ```

        This step tells the collector where to send the data and how to authenticate with your instance.

        For more detailed instructions, see the [Configure an OpenTelemetry Collector or 3rd Party agent to send data to HLA \[KB2117238\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2117238) article in the Now Support knowledge base. For further assistance, contact your OpenTelemetry Collector administrator.

7.  Do one of the following.

    -   If you completed all the prerequisites before starting the configuration, activate the integration either with or without AI-powered capabilities. Select the appropriate option.

        -   **Activate with AI** enables AI-powered automatic parsing and mapping of log data to service instances and components for contextual alerts.

            When the integration is activated successfully, the **Overview** tab is displayed. ServiceNow Otto for ITOM collects and analyzes log data. An AI icon indicates that AI is active.

        -   **Activate** activates the integration without AI-powered mapping. The integration is activated and the **Overview** tab is displayed.
        On the Integrations Launchpad, the integration tile is available in the **Installed integrations** tab.

    -   If you didn't complete all the prior requirements, select **Save draft**.

        The system saves the integration as a draft in the Integrations Launchpad **Installed integrations** tab, under **Waiting for your action**. At a later time, complete the prerequisites and activate the installation. For more information, see [Activate a draft integration in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/il-connector-hla-activate-draft.md).


## What to do next

On the **Overview** tab, do the following:

-   Use the displayed information to refine how Health Log Analytics reads the log data. For more information, see [Review log streaming data and adjust integration settings in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/il-connector-overview-tab.md).
-   Use the More options menu \(\[Omitted image "more-options.png"\] Alt text: More options menu icon.\) to open the **Data Input Mapping**, **Source Type Structures**, or **Log Sources** pages with context from the integration. If your log data is not properly mapped, structured, or sourced, go back and adjust the configuration. If the Service Operations Workspace Log Analytics application is installed, the More options menu also provides direct access to the **Log Viewer**. Use the **Log Viewer** to review raw log messages ingested by the integration. For more information, see:
    -   [Log data auto-mapping and mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-automapping.md)
    -   [Source type structure adjustment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-source-type-structure-adjustment.md)
    -   [Review alert logs on the Log viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-op-logs-log-viewer-concept-sow.md)

If you activated the integration with AI, verify that AI correctly auto-mapped log data to service instances and components. To do this, select **View mapping** under **Log context mapping**. You can override the AI mapping by selecting a different log field from each list. For more information, see [Map logs to service instances, components, source types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/il-connector-hla-map-business-context.md).
