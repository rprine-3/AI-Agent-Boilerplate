# Configure an Elasticsearch data input in Health Log Analytics manually

Set up a data input for streaming log data from Elasticsearch indices to your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

-   Verify that a MID Server is installed and configured with the Log Ingestion capability enabled. For more information, see [MID Server system requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md).

    \[Omitted image "hla-mid-log-ingestion.png"\] Alt text: MID Server configuration with Log Ingestion capability enabled.

    **Important:** Health Log Analytics does not support IPv6. To work with the application, configure the MID Server to IPv4.

-   Unless the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, the MID Server must have a public IP address. This is required when its IP is exposed through network address translation \(NAT\), a load balancer, or a similar device. The public IP address enables external clients, such as Filebeat agents located outside its network, to reach the MID Server. Private IP addresses aren't routable over the internet. Without a public IP, external clients can't connect to the MID Server even if they are configured with its address. In the MID Server properties, add a property named **mid.public\_ip** with the public IP address as the value. For more information, see [Create a MID Server property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerProperties.md). If the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, connections can be made using the private IP address.

Health Log Analytics supports Elasticsearch versions above 7.10.2 and below 8.18.2.

**Note:** For advanced information about streaming log data from Elasticsearch indices to your instance, see the [Stream logs using Elasticsearch data input - Advanced guide](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1080162) \[KB1080162\] article in the Now Support knowledge base.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Data Input** &gt; **Data Inputs**.

2.  On the Data Inputs page, select **New**.

3.  Choose the Elasticsearch data input.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the fields, see [Elasticsearch data input configuration fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-elastic-ref.md).

5.  Select **Advanced** to set advanced configuration fields.

    For a description of the fields, see [Elasticsearch data input configuration fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-elastic-ref.md). For information about configuring the advanced settings later, see [Configure advanced settings for Elasticsearch data inputs in Health Log Analytics manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-adv-elastic.md).

6.  On the **Transport** tab, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the fields, see [Elasticsearch data input configuration fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-elastic-ref.md).

7.  On the **Query Settings** tab, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the fields, see [Elasticsearch data input configuration fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-elastic-ref.md).

8.  Select **Save**.

    Health Log Analytics adds the data input record to the Data Inputs table.

9.  Verify that the data input is configured correctly by selecting **Test connection**.

    Health Log Analytics tries to connect the MID Server to the data repository.

    If the data input is configured to run on a MID Server cluster, the system tries to connect all the MID Servers contained in the cluster to the repository. The cluster passes the test if at least one of its MID Servers gets connected. This feature is supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 26.0.17 - February 2023 and later, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

    -   If the connection was established, the **Test connection** button is turned off and the **Publish** button is enabled.
    -   If the connection failed, the reason for the failure displays in the **Error message** field. This field displays only when a streaming error has occurred.

        Resolve the issue, select **Save** if you modified the configuration, and then select **Test connection** to test the connection again.

        **Note:** You can only publish the data input configuration when the connection is created successfully.

    **Note:** You can revert to the last published configuration by selecting **Revert Changes**. This option is available only when you're modifying a configuration that has been published previously.

10. Select **Publish** to publish the data input to the MID Server.


## Result

The data input configuration process is complete. Health Log Analytics adds the data input record to the **Data Inputs** table and attaches the configuration file to the data input record. The data input starts streaming log data from Elasticsearch indices to your ServiceNow instance.

For more information about streaming logs using the Elasticsearch data input, see the [Stream logs using Elasticsearch data input - Advanced guide \[KB1080162\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1080162) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

**Note:** If the HLA engine is down and data has stopped streaming, a notification appears at the top of the data input configuration page. When this happens, contact ServiceNow support.
