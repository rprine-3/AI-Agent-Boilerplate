# Export source types by log source

Export all source types related to one or more selected log sources to an update set together in Health Log Analytics. You can then import the update set to the target environment.

## Before you begin

For an overview of this feature, see [Migrating a Health Log Analytics data input configuration between instances](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-migration.md).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Log Sources**.

2.  In the Log Sources list, select one or more log sources for which you want to export the related source types.

3.  From the **Actions on selected rows** drop-down menu, choose **Export Related Source Types**.

    The source types are exported to an update set.

    **Note:** An update set can act as the parent for multiple child update sets.

4.  In the **Related Source Type Exporter** screen, select **Download update set** to download the update set to the instance.

    The update set is downloaded as an XML file.


## What to do next

Import the update set to the required ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Import Health Log Analytics source types to a target instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-source-types-import.md).

**Note:** Only the related source types and tables for the selected log sources will be imported, not the data inputs.
