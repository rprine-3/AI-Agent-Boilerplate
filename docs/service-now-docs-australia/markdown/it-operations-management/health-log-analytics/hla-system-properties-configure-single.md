# Configure Health Log Analytics system properties for a single log source

Configure system properties for a specific log source if you need to alter the default values, which should not usually be necessary.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Changing Health Log Analytics system properties affects back-end processes and can produce unexpected results. Therefore, if you must make changes to these properties, keep a record of your adjustments. For example, note the value before and after a modification and the time of the change.

**Note:** To modify a Health Log Analytics system property whose **Requires restart** value is **true**, contact ServiceNow support to modify it for you.

For a complete description of all the Health Log Analytics system properties, see the [HLA System Properties \[KB0869842\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0869842) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Data Input** &gt; **Log Sources**.

2.  On the **Source properties** tab, right-click a property.

3.  Select **Override property value** from the pop-up menu.

4.  In the **Value** field, enter the appropriate value.

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The new value overrides the previous setting for the selected log source.
