# Elasticsearch data input configuration fields

Description of the fields on the Elasticsearch data input configuration form.

## Basic configuration

<table id="table_s33_1lb_smb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the new data input. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Description of the data input.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execute on

</td><td>

Option to determine whether to use a specific MID Server or a MID Server cluster.This feature is supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 26.0.17 - February 2023 and later, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID

</td><td>

\(Only when the **Execute on** field is set to Specific MID Server\)

 MID Server to which log data from Elasticsearch indices is pulled. **Note:**

-   You can select only MID Servers that support basic authentication. MID Servers that support mTLS are not listed.
-   The default maximum number of data inputs streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. You can modify this number in the MID Server properties.
-   If log ingestion is not enabled for the selected MID Server, Health Log Analytics enables it automatically.

This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server Cluster

</td><td>

\(Only when the **Execute on** field is set to Specific MID Server Cluster\)

The MID Server cluster to which the log data is pulled.The data input runs on a single MID Server in the cluster until that MID Server fails. The system then moves all the data input tasks to the next available MID Server in the cluster according to the configured order.

 This feature is supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 26.0.17 - February 2023 and later, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

 **Note:**

-   Health Log Analytics supports only failover MID Server clusters. In these clusters, multiple MID Servers are grouped together for failover protection. When selecting a cluster from the data input form, the MID Server Clusters list displays only failover clusters.
-   The MID Server cluster must include only MID Servers that support basic authentication. mTLS is not supported for log ingestion.
-   Log ingestion must be enabled for each MID Server in the cluster. If log ingestion is not enabled for the active MID Server, Health Log Analytics enables it automatically.
-   If Elasticsearch uses client certificate or CA certificate authentication, all MID Servers in the cluster must have the appropriate certificates.
-   The default maximum number of data inputs streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. A cluster passes capacity validation if it contains at least one MID Server with fewer than 10 data inputs running on it, even when that MID Server is down.

For more information about MID Server clusters, see [Configure a MID Server cluster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_ConfigureAMIDServerCluster.md).This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service instance

</td><td>

The service instance to which to bind the log data. This field is required.**Note:** If no relevant service instance exists, [Create an service instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/create-it-services.md) and add CIs to it. Set the status of the new service instance to Operational.

Example

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

From/To

</td><td>

From and to dates and time for reading the data.-   From: Don't read data older than this date.

**Note:** Setting this value to a past date might require the system to read large amounts of data, causing congestion.

-   To: Don't read data newer than this date. For live data, set this date far into the future.

</td><td>

From: 1970-01-01 15:59:59To: 2300-01-01 15:59:59

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use cross-cluster search

</td><td>

Option to search for data across Elasticsearch clusters.When this check box is selected, the **Clusters to search** field displays.

**Note:** Your settings in the **Use minimal privileges** check box and the **Delay in reading current timestamp \(seconds\)** field on the **Advanced configuration** form affect how data is collected across multiple clusters.

</td><td>

 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Clusters to search

</td><td>

The Elasticsearch clusters to search.This field displays only when the **Use cross-cluster search** check box is selected.

Do one of the following:

-   Leave this field empty or enter “\*” to search all the remote clusters defined in Elasticsearch.
-   Specify the clusters to search in a comma-separated list.

**Note:** To also search the local cluster, add a comma at the beginning or end, or add two commas in succession to the list. For example: “east,,west” or “,east,west” or “\*,”


</td><td>

east,west,south

</td></tr><tr><td>

Index prefix

</td><td>

Prefix for the Elasticsearch indices to read from. The data input reads only from indices with this prefix. This field is required.

</td><td>

only-read-these-indices-\*

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use minimal privileges

</td><td>

Option to read log data directly from the Elasticsearch indices with the configured prefix.-   When selected, the data input reads the log data directly from the Elasticsearch indices with the configured prefix. To perform this task, it needs only read privileges.

**Note:** When this check box is selected and you're using cross-cluster search, data is collected from all the clusters simultaneously.

-   When clear, the data input fetches all indices with the prefix, filters them, and reads the log data from the filtered indices. Performing this task requires additional privileges.

**Note:** Leaving this check box clear when using cross-cluster search affects how data is collected from the clusters. For more information, see the [Enabling and Using Cross-Cluster Search for Elasticsearch Data Inputs in Health Log Analytics \[KB1556079\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1556079) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Unique value per document to use as tiebreaker when sorting log entries by timestamp.

</td><td>

 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use search-after API

Option to toggle between using sliced-scrolling and search-after APIs. **Note:** Sliced-scrolling APIs are preferable when reading historical data, while search-after APIs are better for reading real-time data.

</td><td>

 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Index time-suffix format
