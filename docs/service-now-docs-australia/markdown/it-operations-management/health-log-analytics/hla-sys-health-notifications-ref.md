# Health Log Analytics system health notifications

Health Log Analytics system health notifications help to ensure that you're aware of potentially dangerous conditions. You can manually adjust the status of a notification as the issue is being addressed.

Health Log Analytics uses self-health checks to monitor the health of its components. When it discovers a system health issue, a notification is created and an email sent to all subscribers. The Health Log Analytics Administration **System Health - Notifications** list displays all HLA system health notifications, including those about internal errors. You can ask your admin to subscribe you to the system health notifications.
