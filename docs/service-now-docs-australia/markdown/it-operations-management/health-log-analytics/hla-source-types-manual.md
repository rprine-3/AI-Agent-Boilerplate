# Add a source type manually in Health Log Analytics

Create a source type manually to stream log data to a specific source type instead of using the source type automatically extracted by Health Log Analytics.

## Before you begin

This feature is supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 20.0.11 - July 2021, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Data Input** &gt; **Source Types**.

2.  On the Source Types page, select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_cwx_llc_lpb"><thead><tr><th>

</td><td>

The name of the source type.The name must be between 3-50 characters long. Acceptable characters are letters, numeric values, dashes, and underscores.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Option for indicating that Learning mode for the source type is ongoing. The AI engine must learn the format of log messages in each new log stream. In Learning mode, it learns the format of messages for this source type and extracts properties based on that knowledge.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Right-click the form header and select **Save**.

5.  Select **Load examples** to load the raw input samples for this source type that you provided in the **Examples** field.

    When loading the log samples is completed successfully, the **Examples** field and the **Load examples** buttons no longer appear on the form.

6.  Check how the AI engine has parsed the raw input samples by selecting the **Go to Source Type Structure** related link and modify the extracted properties if necessary.

7.  Click **Submit**.
