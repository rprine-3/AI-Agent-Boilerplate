# Health Log Analytics architecture

Health Log Analytics collects logs streaming into your ServiceNow instance from endpoints or data lakes, such as Splunk and Elasticsearch.

The ServiceNow instance receives the logs either via a [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-landing.md) connector instance or via MID-less Ingest, which supports integration with services such as Amazon Data Firehose. Health Log Analytics identifies and triages anomalies in your log data using unsupervised machine-learning \(ML\) models. It then groups the anomalies together and applies further algorithms to help identify the root cause of the issue.
