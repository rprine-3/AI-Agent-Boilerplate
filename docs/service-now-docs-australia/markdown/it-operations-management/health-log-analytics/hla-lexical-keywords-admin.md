# Add, edit, or delete lexical keywords in Health Log Analytics

Manage the keywords that Health Log Analytics looks for in your log data.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator or evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

In log data, terms like "crash" or "failed" are called lexical keywords because they indicate issues that can merit attention. When text in log data for a source matches a lexical keyword that exceeds a specified count threshold, the system identifies an anomaly and generates an alert.

**Important:** A lexical keyword differs from a key in a `key:value` pair in a log line. For example, Hostname is a key that takes on a value: the name or IP address of the host. In contrast, a keyword like Failed is important by itself and does not take on a value.

The application comes with many default global keywords. You can add, edit, and delete global keywords or phrases. These keywords apply to all source types.

**Note:** To add a specified keyword that is associated with a specific source type, see [Configure source type capabilities in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-source-types.md).
