# Elasticsearch integration configuration fields

Description of the fields on the Elasticsearch integration configuration forms for Health Log Analytics.

For the Elasticsearch integration setup procedure, see [Set up an Elasticsearch integration for Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/il-connector-hla-elasticsearch.md).

<table id="table_r45_gzv_mcc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Integration Name

</td><td>

Unique name of this integration. For example: My Elasticsearch integration. This field is required.**Note:** When you fill in this field, the generic name displayed on the form adjusts automatically to match the name you entered.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execute on

</td><td>

Option to determine whether to use a specific MID Server or a specific MID Server cluster.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID server name

</td><td>

\(Only when **Execute on** is set to Specific MID Server\)

The MID Server to which log data from Elasticsearch indices is pulled. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server Cluster

</td><td>

\(Only when **Execute on** is set to Specific MID Server Cluster\)

The MID Server cluster to which the log data is pulled. This field is required.When you select a cluster, the MID Servers in the selected cluster and their status are displayed.

The integration runs on a single MID Server in the cluster until that MID Server fails. The system then moves all the integration tasks to the next available MID Server in the cluster according to the configured order.

**Note:**

-   Health Log Analytics supports only failover MID Server clusters. In these clusters, multiple MID Servers are grouped together for failover protection. When selecting a cluster from the integration form, the MID Server Clusters list displays only failover clusters.
-   The MID Server cluster must include only MID Servers that support basic authentication. mTLS is not supported for log ingestion.
-   Log ingestion must be enabled for each MID Server in the cluster. If log ingestion is not enabled for the active MID Server, Health Log Analytics enables it automatically.
-   If Elasticsearch uses client certificate or CA certificate authentication, all MID Servers in the cluster must have the appropriate certificates.
-   The default maximum number of integrations streaming logs to a single MID Server is 10. A cluster passes capacity validation if it contains at least one MID Server with fewer than 10 integrations running on it, even when that MID Server is down.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service instance

</td><td>

The service instance to which to bind the log data. This field is required.**Note:** If no relevant service instance exists, [Create an service instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/create-it-services.md) and add CIs to it. Set the status of the new service instance to Operational.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Data source

</td><td>

The source of the log data that the integration pulls to your ServiceNow instance: Elastic. This field is read-only.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

Option to add a brief description of the integration to help identify it.

</td></tr></tbody>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Server URL

</td><td>

The URL used to access the cluster. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Authentication method

</td><td>

The authentication method used to authenticate the integration to Elasticsearch. Default is none.When you select the authentication method, the corresponding credentials fields display on the form.

**Note:** As an admin, you can create an authentication method by navigating to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Authentication Methods** and selecting **New**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Index prefix

</td><td>

Prefix prepended to the names of the Elasticsearch indices from which you want to read data. The integration only reads data from indices that match the configured prefix. For example: network-logs-\* matches indices such as network-logs-2024.01.01. This field is required.This setting ensures that HLA only ingests data from the relevant indices.

For example: only-read-these-indices-\*

</td></tr><tr><td>

Document timestamp field

</td><td>

Timestamp field in documents stored in the read indices. This field is required.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Timestamp field format

</td><td>

Format of the timestamp field in the documents.If no format is specified, the default Unix epoch time format is used, in milliseconds. For example: 1684168407 \(May 15, 2023 4:33:27 PM\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

Term filters

</td><td>

JSON map of the terms to filter. **Note:** Avoid using the term query for text fields. If the target field is mapped as both text and keyword, reference the keyword by using fieldname.keyword.

For example: \{"severity": \["error", "warning"\]\}

</td></tr></tbody>
</table><table id="table_mkn_prw_mcc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Max connections per route

</td><td>

The maximum number of connections to be opened per node.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max scroll slices

</td><td>

The number of shards configured for the relevant index in Elasticsearch.This number tells Elastic how many parallel queries to execute in each polling request.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Proxy host

</td><td>

Host name of the HTTP proxy through which requests are sent.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Proxy port

</td><td>

Port of the HTTP proxy through which requests are sent.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use MID certificate policy check

</td><td>

Option to enable the MID certificate policy check.Select this option if you want to ship your logs encrypted using SSL TLS. Then navigate to **All** &gt; **MID Server** &gt; **MID Security Policy** and add the MID certificate policy check to the table. For more information, see [MID Server certificate check policies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-security-checks.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use cross-cluster search

</td><td>

Option to search for data across Elasticsearch clusters.When this check box is selected, the **Clusters to search** field displays.

**Note:** Your settings in the **Use minimal privileges** check box and the **Delay in reading current timestamp \(seconds\)** field on the **Advanced configuration** form affect how data is collected across multiple clusters.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Clusters to search

</td><td>

The Elasticsearch clusters to search.This field displays only when the **Use cross-cluster search** check box is selected. Do one of the following:

-   Leave this field empty or enter “\*” to search all the remote clusters defined in Elasticsearch.
-   Specify the clusters to search in a comma-separated list.

**Note:** To also search the local cluster, add a comma at the beginning or end, or add two commas in succession to the list. For example: “east,,west” or “,east,west” or “\*,”


</td></tr><tr><td>

Use minimal privileges

</td><td>

Option to read log data directly from the Elasticsearch indices with the configured prefix.-   When selected, the integration reads the log data directly from the Elasticsearch indices with the configured prefix. To perform this task, it needs only read privileges.

**Note:** When this check box is selected and you're using cross-cluster search, data is collected from all the clusters simultaneously.

-   When clear, the integration fetches all indices with the prefix, filters them, and reads the log data from the filtered indices. Performing this task requires additional privileges.

**Note:** Leaving this check box clear when using cross-cluster search affects how data is collected from the clusters. For more information, see the [Enabling and Using Cross-Cluster Search for Elasticsearch Data Inputs in Health Log Analytics \[KB1556079\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1556079) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Search-after tie breaker

</td><td>

Unique value per document to use as tiebreaker when sorting log entries by timestamp.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use search-after API

</td><td>

Option to toggle between using sliced-scrolling and search-after APIs.**Note:** Sliced-scrolling APIs are preferable when reading historical data, while search-after APIs are better for reading real-time data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Index time-suffix format

</td><td>

Format of the time suffix when using time-based index names, such as \[logstash-\]YYYY.MM.DD.When using aliases, leave this field empty.

For example: uuuu.MM.dd
