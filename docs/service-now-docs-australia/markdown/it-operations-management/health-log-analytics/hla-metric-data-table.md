# View log anomaly metrics in Health Log Analytics

View and query all metrics that Health Log Analytics tracks from a single location.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

The Metric Data table provides a centralized view of every metric that HLA collects and monitors. It includes pattern metrics, custom metrics, and raw metrics. Use the table for the following tasks:

-   Query metrics by log source, integration, source type, and metric type to narrow down which metrics HLA is tracking for a data input or environment.
-   Review anomaly detection statistics to see how often HLA detects anomalies for a given metric.
-   View metric baselines to understand what HLA records as normal behavior.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Log Anomaly Detection** &gt; **All Metrics**.

    The **Metric Data** table displays a record for each metric that HLA is collecting. For a description of the columns in the table, see [Metric Data table columns in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-metric-data-table-ref.md).

2.  Filter the table by log source, integration, source type, or metric type.

    Filtering enables you to narrow the results to the metrics relevant to a specific data input or environment.

3.  Select a metric record to view its details.
