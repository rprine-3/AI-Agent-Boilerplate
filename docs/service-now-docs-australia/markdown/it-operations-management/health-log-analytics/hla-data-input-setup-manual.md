# Set up data inputs in Health Log Analytics manually

Set up your Health Log Analytics data inputs for Health Log Analytics manually. Data input configuration is an essential step in setting up the Health Log Analytics application.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Consider using the Health Log Analytics data input guided setup, which ensures that you have the minimum required setup for the data input process. For more information, see [Set up data inputs in Health Log Analytics using guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-setup-guided.md).

-   Verify that a MID Server is installed and configured with the Log Ingestion capability enabled. For more information, see [MID Server system requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md).

    \[Omitted image "hla-mid-log-ingestion.png"\] Alt text: MID Server configuration with Log Ingestion capability enabled.

    **Important:** Health Log Analytics does not support IPv6. To work with the application, configure the MID Server to IPv4.

-   Unless the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, the MID Server must have a public IP address. This is required when its IP is exposed through network address translation \(NAT\), a load balancer, or a similar device. The public IP address enables external clients, such as Filebeat agents located outside its network, to reach the MID Server. Private IP addresses aren't routable over the internet. Without a public IP, external clients can't connect to the MID Server even if they are configured with its address. In the MID Server properties, add a property named **mid.public\_ip** with the public IP address as the value. For more information, see [Create a MID Server property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/r_MIDServerProperties.md). If the MID Server and external clients are on the same network, connections can be made using the private IP address.
-   For shipping your logs encrypted using SSL TLS, see the [Streaming Data With Rsyslog &amp; Filebeat Using SSL \[KB0866319\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0866319) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   For MID Server proxy requirements, see [MID Server proxy preconditions for streaming logs to Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-mid-proxy-configure.md).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin. For the ServiceNow System Logs data input: admin.

## Procedure

1.  Setup a data input manually by performing the relevant procedure described in the product documentation.

</table>    **Note:** Testing the connection to the MID Server at the end of the data input setup procedure ensures that your data input is configured correctly. You can only publish a data input configuration when the connection between the MID Server and the data repository has been established.

2.  Identify and address streaming issues to confirm that the data input is streaming log data to the MID Server from all sources.

    For more information, see [Identify and resolve a log streaming issue in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-streaming.md).

3.  Edit raw log data before Health Log Analytics maps and structures it.

    For more information, see [Edit your raw log data before processing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-preprocess.md).

4.  Determine how Health Log Analytics handles raw log data that is streaming into your instance.

    By default, every incoming log line is auto-mapped to the correct tag. If properties aren't discovered automatically, map the data input sources manually by defining a JavaScript function. For more information, see [Map the raw data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-mapping.md).

5.  Tweak the source type structure to make sure that Health Log Analytics extracts and classifies all properties correctly.

    For more information, see [Refine the source type structure in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-source-type-structure-refine.md).

6.  Perform additional data input setup tasks.

    For more information, see [Additional data input setup tasks in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-setup-extra.md).
