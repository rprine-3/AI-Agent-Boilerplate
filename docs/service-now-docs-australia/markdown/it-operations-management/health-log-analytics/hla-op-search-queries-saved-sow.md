# Use or modify a saved log data search in Health Log Analytics

Use a saved search of log data to better understand the causes of an alert. As the owner of a saved search, you can modify the search values and save your changes.

## Before you begin

**Note:** If you're not the owner of the saved search, save the search with a different name. You can then update search values, save your changes, and share the search with others.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator or evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the **Log Viewer** using one of the following methods:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** and select the Log Viewer icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-log-viewer-sow.png"\] Alt text: Log Viewer icon.\).
    -   While viewing log entries for an alert on the **Surrounding logs** tab, select **Log Viewer**.
2.  Use a saved search.

    1.  Select the selection icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-selection-sow.png"\] Alt text: Selection icon.\) and then select **Load search**.

    2.  In the Load search dialog box, select the name of the search to load.

    The system returns the full list of log lines that match the search values and displays the information in the Results over time chart.

3.  Update the saved search.

    1.  Select the selection icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-selection-sow.png"\] Alt text: Selection icon.\) and then choose **Manage my searches** from the drop-down list.

    2.  Modify the settings.
