Transport

</td><td>

The Edge Delta destination used for streaming log messages to the ServiceNow instance. The options are:-   TCP - Frequently used for handling large volumes of log data.

If you select TCP, you must provide the MID Server and port.

When choosing the TCP transport option, create a TCP destination in Edge Delta. Use the same MID Server host and port you configured for the Edge Delta data input.

**Note:** For TCP, TLS/SSL is not supported.

-   HTTP: Frequently used for sending smaller logs via RESTful APIs, HTTP, or HTTPS for secure transmission.

**Note:** For the HTTP protocol, authentication is used.

If you select HTTP, you must provide the MID Web Server that is running on the MID Server. The system then populates the MID Server and port fields automatically, based on the provided MID Web Server.

Depending on the MID Web Server configuration, you can send logs using either HTTP or HTTPS. If the **Secure Connection** check box on the MID Web Server extension form is clear, use HTTP. If it is selected, use HTTPS. For more information, see [Event Management MID Web Server extension form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/configure-midwebserver-extension-form.md). In addition, if the **Authentication Type** on the MID Web Server extension form is Basic, provide Basic authentication details in the Authorization header. If the **Authentication Type** is API Key, provide the key as “Key Api\_Key".

When choosing the HTTP transport option, create an HTTP destination in Edge Delta and enter the Endpoint URL in the following format: http://\{MID\_SERVER\_IP\}:\{MID\_WEB\_SERVER\_PORT\}/api/mid/hla/raw. In Advanced Settings, create two headers to be attached to the HTTP request:

    -   An Authorization header with the MID Web Server API key value or basic credentials as MID Web Server configured.
    -   A Content-Type header named with the application/json value.
