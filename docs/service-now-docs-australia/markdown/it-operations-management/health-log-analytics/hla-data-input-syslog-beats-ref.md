Content pack

</td><td>

\(Linux using Filebeat only\) The content pack to use.Content packs contain default source types and mapping script templates. Health Log Analytics activates the selected pack automatically and uses its mapping script for mapping the data input sources. For more information, see [Health Log Analytics content packs for quicker time to value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-content-packs.md).
