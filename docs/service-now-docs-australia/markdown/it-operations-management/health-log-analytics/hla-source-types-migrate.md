Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Source Types**.

2.  In the Source Types list, select one or more source types that you want to export.

3.  From the **Actions on selected rows** drop-down menu, choose **Export Source Types**.

    The source types are exported to an update set.

    **Note:** An update set can act as the parent for multiple child update sets.
