# Delete a log source in Health Log Analytics

## About this task

When you delete a log source, Health Log Analytics automatically deletes its related log data. You can also delete a source while keeping the log data. The associated data will then be deleted according to the log retention policy. For more information, see [Storage space for log retention in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-log-retention-space.md).

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Log Sources**.

2.  Open a source record.

3.  Delete the log source in one of the following ways:

    -   Delete the source and its related data by selecting **Delete**.
    -   Delete the source without its related data by selecting the **Delete without logs** related link.
