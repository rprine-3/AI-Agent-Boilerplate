# Health Log Analytics alert notification in Slack or Microsoft Teams channels

Health Log Analytics sends notifications for new anomaly alerts in real time to Slack or Microsoft Teams channels. This built-in functionality frees you from having to continuously monitor logs to prevent incidents.

The notifications include the number of the alert, its description, severity, configuration item, state, and priority group. You can filter the alerts for which notifications are sent to your channel. For example, you may only want to receive alerts of a Major severity or a High priority group. By default, no notifications are sent on secondary alerts.

To support channel notification, the channel must be configured to receive Health Log Analytics notifications.

Starting with Version 33.0.27 - August 2024, Health Log Analytics uses the Microsoft Teams Graph spoke application to send notifications on new anomaly alerts. The application replaces the Microsoft Teams spoke plugin, which will be deprecated. If you're using an HLA version earlier than 33.0.27, follow the setup procedure in [Set up Health Log Analytics alert notifications in channels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-notifications-in-channel.md). Otherwise, see [Set up Health Log Analytics alert notifications in a Microsoft Teams channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-notifications-in-ms-teams.md).
