# Configure advanced settings for MID Server data inputs in Health Log Analytics manually

Configure advanced settings for data inputs that are used for collecting and streaming MID Server log messages.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

You can set system parameters for reading log data that determine the actions that the system performs on log data arriving on the MID Server. For example, you can set the time zone to use if a log lacks a timestamp. If no advanced settings are configured, the system uses the default values.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Data Input** &gt; **Data Inputs**.

2.  Open a MID Server data input record from the Data Inputs table.

    The data input configuration displays.

    **Note:** The number of log sources that the data input has created is shown in the **Sources count** field. For more information about data input sources, see [Log data auto-mapping and mapping in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-automapping.md).

    **Note:** If the HLA engine is down and data has stopped streaming, a notification appears at the top of the data input configuration page. When this happens, contact ServiceNow support.

3.  Select **Advanced**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the fields, see [MID Server data input configuration fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-mid-server-ref.md).

5.  In the Streaming Sources related list, verify that this data input is streaming log data from all relevant endpoint devices.

    For more information about streaming sources, see [Identify and resolve a log streaming issue in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-streaming.md).

6.  Select **Update**.


## Result

Health Log Analytics updates the system parameters.
