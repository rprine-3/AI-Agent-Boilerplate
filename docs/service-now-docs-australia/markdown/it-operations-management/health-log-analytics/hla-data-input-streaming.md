# Identify and resolve a log streaming issue in Health Log Analytics

Find and address log streaming issues to verify that your data inputs are streaming log data to your instance properly.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Health Log Analytics** &gt; **Streaming Sources**.

    The Streaming Sources page shows all data inputs and the MID Servers that are receiving logs from them.

    **Note:**

    -   When **Look up hostnames** is selected in the [advanced data input configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-adv-configuration.md), the Streaming Sources page shows the hostname of devices that use an Rsyslog or a Filebeat shipper. For Elasticsearch indices, it displays the index name.
    -   Streaming Sources is also available as a related list on the data input form. The related list displays only the endpoint devices that are relevant to that data input.
    -   If the HLA engine is down and data has stopped streaming, a notification appears at the top of the Streaming Sources page. When this happens, contact ServiceNow support.
2.  Select a data input record to view the streaming data of its sources and identify streaming issues and their possible cause.

    For example, if the last recorded event time for a data input's endpoint server is yesterday, that server might be down or configured incorrectly. A streaming issue might also be caused by the data input configuration file not being installed on the endpoint.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

The status of the source. A red bullet indicates that this source has not streamed data in the last hour.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Last event time

</td><td>

The last recorded time an event arrived at the MID Server in the last one-minute interval.Health Log Analytics continuously updates the last event time. If the last event time is not up to date, data is not streaming.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Raw log lines/sec

</td><td>

The average number of raw log lines that streamed to the MID Server per second in the last one-minute interval. **Note:** This value represents the number of raw log lines before preprocessing.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Preprocessed log lines/sec

</td><td>

The average number of preprocessed log lines that streamed to the MID Server per second in the last one-minute interval. **Note:** This value can differ from the number of raw log lines per second. For example, the difference can be a result of logs having been dropped during preprocessing.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Investigate and resolve any data streaming issues.

    **Note:** If you experience permissions-related issues with streaming log data from Elasticsearch, refer to the [Granting privileges for data streams from Elasticsearch \[KB0967366\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=9648a9281b61b4100b8a9979b04bcb04) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.


## What to do next

When the logs are streaming properly, proceed to [map your raw log data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-mapping.md).

**Note:** You can choose to [edit incoming raw log data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-data-input-preprocess.md) before Health Log Analytics processes it. For example, preprocessing enables you to discard log portions or remove sensitive data from your logs. This task is optional.
