The log samples used for testing your JavaScript function, ordered by sources and source types.The **Test Outcome** list displays the number of log samples for each source-source type combination, and is updated when the log samples are refreshed and you start testing your script.

The list links to samples in the **Mapping Samples** table, which shows the outcome of the JavaScript function for each sample.

This feature is supported in the Health Log Analytics application, Version 26.0.17 - February 2023 and later, available from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

**Source Type Structures**

</td><td>

The source type structures for this data input.Reviewing the source type structures can help you gain a better understanding of the data flow.

The **Last event time** column on this tab shows the last date and time the AI engine processed a log for the source type structure. The system refreshes this information every 5 minutes. Knowing when the last log was processed for this source type structure makes it easier to verify that log data is streaming.
