# Monitor visualized log data on a predefined dashboard in Health Log Analytics

Use visualizations to monitor log data on the built-in Operational Dashboard in Service Operations Workspace Log Analytics and address issues as they occur in the system.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator or viz\_admin

**Important:** From the Vancouver release onward, this feature is deprecated and replaced with the AIOps [HLA Operational dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/hla-operational-dashboard.md). For more information about AIOps dashboards, see [AIOps Dashboards in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/aiops-dashboards-sow-itom.md). You can also build a custom dashboard per your needs. For more information, see [Create log data dashboards and visualizations in Health Log Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/health-log-analytics/hla-log-data-dashboard-create.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open the **Log Viewer** using one of the following methods:

    -   Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** and select the Log Viewer icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-log-viewer-sow.png"\] Alt text: Log Viewer icon.\).
    -   While viewing log entries for an alert on the **Surrounding logs** tab, select **Log Viewer**.
2.  Select the selection icon at the top right of the **Log viewer** tab, and then choose **Manage my dashboards** from the drop-down list.

    The **Operational Dashboard** tab displays.

    By default, the dashboard visualizes log data that was ingested in the last 24 hours.

3.  Change the time range for which data is shown by selecting the required range from the **Date** drop-down.

    You can specify a custom range by selecting **Custom** and then selecting the required start and end dates.

4.  Monitor the visualized log data and use it to identify and address issues.
