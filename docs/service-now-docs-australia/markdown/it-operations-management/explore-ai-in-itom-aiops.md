# AI in ITOM AIOps

AI features in ITOM AIOps help operators triage alerts, investigate incidents, analyze service health, and improve service reliability using generative AI and agentic workflows.

AI features in ITOM AIOps span several products. The following tables summarize all available AI features by type and product.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## Agentic workflows

ServiceNow Otto for ITOM includes agentic workflows that use AI agents to complete alert management and investigation tasks autonomously or with minimal operator input.

Analyze alert impact agentic workflow

</td><td>

Uses observability AI agents to investigate an alert and surface information about its severity, impact, ownership, and potential root causes. Integrates with observability tools such as Dynatrace, Kentik, and New Relic.

</td><td>

An operator selects an alert from an observability-connected source and wants to understand its blast radius, identify responsible teams, and find potential root causes before escalating.

Manage alerts autonomously agentic workflow

</td><td>

Provides a unified AI-driven process that automates alert triage, impact analysis, and root cause investigation. Generates reports, summarizes key insights and possible next steps, and stores structured findings in the alert record. Also analyzes Health Log Analytics alerts in an alert group and can classify alerts as proactive or reactive.

</td><td>

An operations team wants alerts to be triaged, analyzed, and summarized automatically as they arrive, with AI insights available in Express List without manual intervention.

Event Management, Express List

</td><td>

Analyze potential impact agentic workflow

</td><td>

Analyzes how a change request might affect relevant servers and services. The agent verifies prerequisites, retrieves the change request, selects up to 10 affected servers, identifies matches with suggested services, and displays an impact analysis in the ServiceNow Otto panel. The analysis is also saved to the change request work notes. Includes Service Mapping Candidate and Service Mapping Candidates Impact skills.

</td><td>

An operator or change manager wants to assess the risk of a change request before approving it, without manually reviewing all affected CIs.

</table>## AI agents

Standalone AI agents in ITOM AIOps run autonomously on a schedule or in response to a trigger, without requiring user input.

|Product|AI feature|Description|Use case|Resources|
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
|Service Reliability Management|SLO creator agent|Runs every 14 days and processes up to 25 services or CIs that do not already have auto-generated SLOs. Analyzes historical alerts, incidents, and outages to generate one SLO per service or CI with up to 10 service level indicators \(SLIs\). Generated SLOs are active by default. Email notifications are sent to team managers when SLOs are generated and when the error budget falls to 25% or lower. Requires ServiceNow Otto for ITOM and Service Reliability Management.|A team wants to adopt SLOs without manually defining them, using historical incident and alert data to generate a starting point for each service.|[Generating service level objectives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-level-objective-management/now-assist-itom-slo-generation.md)|

## Generative AI skills

Generative AI skills in ITOM AIOps are discrete, on-demand capabilities that operators invoke to generate analyses, summaries, or descriptions for a specific alert, group, or service.
