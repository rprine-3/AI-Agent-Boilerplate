# AIOps Value Realization dashboard

The AIOps Value Realization dashboard uses Performance Analytics to offer comprehensive visibility into the business outcomes of alerts, events, and incidents. It features metrics such as noise reduction \(events to alerts compression\), average MTTR for incidents created by Event Management\[var.event-mgmt\], and the most critical services impacted by hours.

The AIOps Value Realization dashboard includes a calendar feature that enables users to select various date ranges such as custom dates, the last 3 months, the last 30 days, the last 6 months, the last 7 days, the last year, today, and year-to-date \(YTD\). You can specify a custom start and end date and apply these selections to view reports specifically for the chosen date range. This feature facilitates tailored analysis and reporting based on specific time periods of interest.

The AIOps Value Realization dashboard offers key insights and metrics crucial for operational efficiency and business impact assessment. It includes features such as noise reduction to enhance focus on critical issues by reducing event-to-alert conversions. Tracking average MTTR for incidents and measuring downtime on critical services aids in improving operational efficiency and prioritizing resolutions. The dashboard is categorized into Operational Excellence and Business Impact sections. It provides detailed coverage on alerts grouping, swift resolution of critical incidents reported by users, and quantifying service impacts by severity to optimize operational stability.
