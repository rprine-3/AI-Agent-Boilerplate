# AWS Marketplace pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds active AWS Marketplace subscriptions on your cloud environment. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

The Amazon AWS - Marketplace \(LP\) pattern discovers the following AWS Marketplace products:

-   Amazon Machine Images \(AMI\)
-   SaaS

\[Omitted image "aws-marketplace-data-model.png"\] Alt text: Amazon AWS - Marketplace \(LP\) pattern data model.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

-   **Verify the AWS discovery prerequisites**

    For more information, see the prerequisites section in [AWS discovery using patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/data-discovered-aws-patterns.md).

-   **Verify that the us-east-1 region is activated on your instance**

    The pattern connects to the AWS Marketplace APIs through us-east-1, regardless of your account's configured region.


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the Amazon AWS - Marketplace \(LP\) pattern.
