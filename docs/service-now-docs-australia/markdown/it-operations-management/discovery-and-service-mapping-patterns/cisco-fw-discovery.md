# Next-Generation Cisco Firewall discovery

The ServiceNow Discovery application uses the Next Generation Cisco Firewall pattern to find Cisco firewalls. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

The discovery pattern uses a set of SNMP calls to find the Cisco firewalls. Discovery uses the pattern to run horizontal discovery.

You can use this pattern on the ServiceNow AI Platform® using the Madrid release or later.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   Ensure that your network firewall device has SNMP access.
-   On the ServiceNow instance, configure SNMP credentials. For more information, see [SNMP credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_SNMPCredentials.md).
-   Add the SNMP system OID record for the Cisco device to the ServiceNow instance. Update the following:
    -   Classifier: Cisco Firewall
    -   Class: Cisco Firewall Device
-   Deploy the pattern as follows:
    1.  Download and install [Firewall extension classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models-fw.md) from the ServiceNow Store. The app adds the new CMDB classes required for network firewall discovery.
    2.  Download and install the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).
    3.  Sync the pattern with the appropriate MID Server.

## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the Next Generation Cisco Firewall pattern.
