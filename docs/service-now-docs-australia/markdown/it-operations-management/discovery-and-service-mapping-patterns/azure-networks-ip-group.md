# Azure Networks IP Group pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds Azure services on your cloud environment. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

-   **Verify the Microsoft Azure discovery prerequisites**

    For more information, see the prerequisites section in [Microsoft Azure Cloud discovery using patterns]().

-   **Remove resources from the Resource Inclusion List table**

    Verify that the relevant resource isn't listed in the Resource Inclusion List \[sa\_cloud\_inventory\_resource\_whitelist\] table to avoid duplicate discovery. For more information on removing resources from the Resource Inclusion List, see [Microsoft Azure resource inventory discovery]().

-   **Enable the relevant pattern**

    The pattern for this service is disabled by default. Starting with Visibility Content version 6.28.0, activating or deactivating a pattern won't be considered a customization, and it will continue to receive updates. Patterns that were previously activated or deactivated will reset to the latest predefined version after upgrading while retaining the last active field value. For more information on enabling patterns, see [Activate a disabled pattern]().

-   **Configure the Discovery schedule to support GovCloud**

    Discovering Azure GovCloud \(US\) accounts requires using a datacenter URL when setting up an Azure service account. For more information, see [Set up Azure service accounts]().


Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in both CMDB and non-CMDB tables.

## Data stored in non-CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the non-CMDB table when running the Azure - Networks IP Group - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

You can review the non-CMDB Azure tables by navigating to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Azure**. You can also search the navigation filter for the specific pattern name.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Location \[location\]|The geographic region where the resource is hosted.|
|Object Id \[object\_id\]|A unique identifier for the resource within Azure.|
|Resource Group \[resource\_group\]|Name of the resource group.|
|Subscription ID \[subscription\_id\]|The subscription ID.|
|Tenant ID \[tenant\_id\]|The identifier for the Azure Active Directory tenant associated with the resource.|
|Configuration Item \[configuration\_item\]|References the Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\] table.|

## Data stored in CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the CMDB when running the Azure - Networks IP Group - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Install Status \[install\_status\]|Install status of the resource. Default value is Installed.|
|Location \[location\]|The geographic region where the resource is hosted.|
|Name \[name\]|The name assigned to the resource.|
|Object ID \[object\_id\]|A unique identifier for the resource within Azure.|
|Operational status \[operational\_status\]|Operational status of the resource. Default value is Operational.|
|Resource type \[resource\_type\]|Type of resource. The value is set to **microsoft.network/ipgroups**.|

## CI relationships

The pattern creates these relationships to support discovery.

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|Resource Group \[cmdb\_ci\_resource\_group\]|Contains::Contained by|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|
|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|Hosted on::Hosts|Azure Datacenter \[cmdb\_ci\_azure\_datacenter\]|
|Azure Networks - IP Group \[cmdb\_azure\_networks\_ip\_group\]|References|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|

## Azure tag discovery

The pattern collects tags and populates them in the Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\] table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Key \[key\]|Tag name.|
|Value \[value\]|Tag value.|
