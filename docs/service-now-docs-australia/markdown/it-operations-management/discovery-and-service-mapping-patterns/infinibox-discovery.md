# InfiniBox Discovery

ServiceNow Discovery uses the InfiniBox pattern to find and map instances. Discovering these resources requires installing the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

Discovery uses multiple patterns to find InfiniBox storage system data. Discovering these resources requires installing the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns and the CMDB CI Class Models applications from the ServiceNow Store, as each application is dependent on the other. You can use the patterns for discovering the InfiniBox components on the ServiceNow AI Platform using the Paris release or later.

The InfiniBox enterprise storage array delivers faster-than-all-flash performance, high availability, and multi-petabyte scale for mixed application workloads.​ The InfiniBox hardware redundancy design enables rapid recovery from any component failures.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

**Note:** Discovery of 'Hosts' and 'Clusters' associated to the InfiniBox system are not supported from version 1.0.83 of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns \(sn\_itom\_pattern\) plugin.

-   Install the following plugins:
    -   CMDB CI Class Models plugin \(Version 1.28.0 or later\)
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns plugin \(Version 1.0.81 or later\)
-   Set Basic Auth credentials for the InfiniBox storage system
-   Set a credential alias and associate it with the InfiniBox system credential record.

-   Set discovery schedule type to Serverless.

-   Make sure that the MID server has access to the target device.


-   **Authentication**

    Configure the credentials of the Basic Auth type for authenticating the REST API calls. They are used for discovery of the CI types associated with the InfiniBox Storage system.​

    1.  Navigate to **Connections &amp; Credential Aliases**.
    2.  Create a new **Credential** record.
    3.  Create a new **Basic Auth** credential record from the Credentials related list form. Configure the **Basic Auth** parameters:

        ​​

        \[Omitted image "connectionandcredentialaliases.png"\] Alt text: Connection &amp; Credential Aliases.


\[Omitted image ""\] Alt text: Basic Auth Credentials.

Configure the credentials of the **Basic Auth** type and the credential Alias associated with the credential record.

You can make the same configuration from the credential record form where you previously created the Credential alias. Associate the Connections and Credential Alias records respectively.

-   **Discovery schedule**
    1.  ​Create the Discovery schedule with the Serverless Discovery type.

        \[Omitted image "discoveryschedule.png"\] Alt text: Discovery Schedule.

    2.  For the Discovery schedule with the Discover type of Serverless, configure the InfiniBox Storage System LP pattern within the Serverless Execution Patterns tab.
    3.  Set the Run Child Patterns to True.

        This enables the system to trigger all the patterns associated Child Patterns with the InfiniBox Storage System \(LP\). This is necessary due to the Large Payload \(LP\) mechanism. This is used for the discovery of the InfiniBox storage system and all the corresponding CI types.


\[Omitted image "serverlessexecutionpatterns.png"\] Alt text: serverless execution patterns.

Apply the values for **ip\_address** and **credential\_alias** from the Serverless Execution Pattern related section. These serve as input parameters for triggering the discovery schedule and the associated InfiniBox discovery pattern.

Apply the IP Address of the InfiniBox system and the ID of the previously created Connections &amp; Credential Aliases record. These are related to the InfiniBox credential **Basic Auth** type record.
