# Amazon Route 53 pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds Amazon Route 53 domain name systems \(DNS\) and aliases on your cloud environment. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

Verify the AWS discovery prerequisites section in [AWS discovery using patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/data-discovered-aws-patterns.md).

## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the Amazon AWS Route53 pattern.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name \[name\]|The DNS domain name for the hosted zone.|
|IP Address \[ip\_address\]|The IP address resolved from the DNS name.|

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name \[name\]|The alias name for the DNS record set.|

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Object ID \[object\_id\]|The unique identifier \(ID\) for the cloud service account.|
|Account Id \[account\_id\]|The unique ID for the cloud service account.|

## CI relationships

The Amazon AWS Route53 pattern creates these relationships to support Amazon Route 53 discovery.

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|DNS Name \[cmdb\_ci\_dns\_name\]|Used by::Uses|DNS Alias \[cmdb\_ci\_dns\_alias\]|
|DNS Name \[cmdb\_ci\_dns\_name\]|Hosted on::Hosts|Cloud Service Account \[cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_service\_account\]|
