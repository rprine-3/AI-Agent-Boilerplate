# GCP Events pattern-based discovery

Discovery uses event patterns to update GCP component data in near real-time. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

Verify the GCP discovery prerequisites section in [Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) Cloud discovery using Patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/gcp-cloud-discovery-patterns.md).

## Events discovered by Discovery during horizontal discovery

When GCP components change state, events are created. Discovery uses event patterns to detect these changes and update the CMDB.

|Pattern|CI|
|-------|---|
|Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) - Networking - Events|Cloud Service Account \[cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_service\_account\]|
|Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) - Networking Firewall - Events|Cloud Service Account \[cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_service\_account\]|
|Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) - Subnetwork - Events|Cloud Service Account \[cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_service\_account\]|
