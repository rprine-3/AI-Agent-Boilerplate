# Apache Kafka and Apache Zookeeper discovery

ServiceNow Discovery uses the Kafka and Zookeeper discovery pattern to find Kafka data built on the Zookeeper synchronization service.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **CMDB CI Class Models store app**

    Verify the CMDB CI Class Models store app \(version 1.20.0\) is installed.

-   **Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns store app**

    Verify the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns store app \(version 1.0.72\) is installed.

-   **Certificate Authority process**

    Ensure that the CA process is up and running on the host machine.

-   **Discovery credentials**

    Ensure you have the credentials for running Discovery on the host machine running the CA process​.


Kafka and Zookeeper process should be running on the host.

**Note:** Kafka Broker Discovery should run first followed by Zookeeper. In the Zookeeper Configuration file, the order of nodes forming the cluster should be consistent across all of the nodes in the cluster.
