# Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) resource inventory discovery with Patterns

The ServiceNow Discovery application uses the Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) Resource Inventory pattern to find GCP resources and policies. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

The pattern provides visibility for services supported by the Asset Inventory API, as well as collecting inventory data on the deployed GCP services and updating the CMDB.

The pattern collects inventory data either for all GCP-supported resources or for a preconfigured inclusion list of resources. The Cloud Inventory Resource Inclusion List contains all resource types supported by GCP Cloud Asset Inventory, except for Compute Engine resources and IAM policies. You can expand the inclusion list with additional resource types per your requirements. For more information about Google Cloud assets, see [https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

Starting with Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns version 1.18.1, you can discover the GCP storage by two types of discovery: Serverless and Cloud Discovery. Running Cloud Discovery schedules enables you to run one schedule per all your GCP projects without manually configuring separate schedules. You can also continue using Serverless discovery as before.

The enhanced Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) asset inventory pattern runs queries to check the configurations on your system and trigger a discovery according to your configurations. The queries by order:

1.  If you have the **Discovery Pattern Launcher Parameters** configured, the pattern triggers a Serverless discovery schedule.

2.  If the former query carries no results, the pattern continues to query if you have the **mid.gcp\_resource\_inventory\_bucketpath** MID Server property configured. If you do, the pattern runs a Cloud Discovery schedule by cloud accounts.

3.  If the former query carries no results, the pattern continues to query if you have the **mid.gcp\_resource\_inventory\_bucketpath.default** MID Server property configured. If you do, the pattern triggers a default Cloud Discovery schedule.

4.  If none of these properties are configured, the pattern terminates gracefully.

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify the store apps are up to date**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   Visibility Content
-   **GCP authorization for Discovery to use the Cloud Asset API**
    -   API endpoint: https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/projects/&lt;account\_id&gt;:exportAssets
    -   Required one or more of the following IAM permissions on the specified resource parent:
        -   cloudasset.assets.exportResource
        -   cloudasset.assets.exportIamPolicy
-   **Service Account user for the cloud storage API**

    The ServiceNow Cloud Service Account need to have a read-only permission from GCP to access the API endpoint - https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1.

    **Note:** You can use the headers on the Encryption page to do the following:

    -   Download an object that is encrypted by a customer-supplied encryption key.
    -   Get object metadata with content hashes.
-   **Permission to read and write to a Cloud Storage Bucket**
    -   Storage Object Creator
    -   Storage Object Viewer
    -   Storage Object Admin
-   **Create a cloud storage bucket using Google Cloud console**
    1.  Go to the **Google Cloud console**.
    2.  From the **Navigation menu**, select **Cloud Storage** &gt; **Buckets**.
    3.  To create a new bucket, select **+ Create**.

-   **Cloud inventory resource inclusion list**
    -   To collect inventory data for resources supported by GCP, in ServiceNow AI Platform, navigate to **Cloud Inventory Resource Inclusion List** and clear all GCP table records.

        \[Omitted image "GCP-inclusion-list.png"\] Alt text: GCP Inclusion List

    -   Fine-tune GCP resource discovery using the Cloud Inventory Resource Inclusion List.

        If your deployment has custom patterns for GCP discovery, ensure that you do not discover GCP resources twice:

        1.  Ensure that the application scope is Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns:
            1.  Navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Developer**.
            2.  Select `Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns` from the **Application** list.
        2.  Navigate to **System Definitions** &gt; **Tables**.
        3.  Open the Cloud Inventory Resource Inclusion List \[sa\_cloud\_inventory\_resource\_whitelist\] table.
        4.  Under **Related Links**, click **Show List**.
        5.  Select resource types for which you have custom patterns, and select `Delete` from the **Actions on selected rows** list.
        The Cloud Inventory Resource Inclusion List is predefined with common services. You can expand the list with additional resource types that you want the pattern to discover, as follows:

        **Note:** If you modify the list provided in the base system, it is no longer updated automatically in application updates. You need to maintain customized lists yourself.

        1.  Open the Cloud Inventory Resource Inclusion List \[sa\_cloud\_inventory\_resource\_whitelist\] table.
        2.  Click **New**.
        3.  Fill in the form, and then click **Submit**.

            **Note:** The names of additional resource types must conform to the appropriate vendor naming conventions.

            |Field|Description|
            |-----|-----------|
            |Cloud Vendor|The vendor of the resource type: GCP.|
            |Resource Type|The GCP resource type value.|
            |Application|The application scope: Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns.|

        The changes are applied the next time you run the pattern.


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

This pattern discovers data that provides visibility for all GCP services in your organization. The discovered data includes the following tables and fields.

|Table and field|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|Main CI \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|
|object\_id|The ID of the item. The item is accessed with this URL.|
|name|The name of the resource.|
|resource\_type|The asset resource type, according to the data in the JSON file.|
|Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\]|
|Key|The GCP tag key name.|
|Value|The GCP tag value name.|

The Dependency Views map shows the discovered Configuration Items \(CIs\) in your organization and the relationships between them. Here, the only meaningful relationship between the CIs is the one that helps Discovery identify them.

Each GCP Inventory CI is related either to a Logical Datacenter \(LDC\) CI or to a Cloud Service Account CI. In this example, the Inventory CI is related to a Cloud Service Account CI.

## CI relationships

These relationships are created to support GCP asset inventory discovery:

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|For Global Resources:|
|Main CI \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|Contained by::Contains|Cloud Service Accounts|
|For Regional Resources:|
|Main CI \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|HostedOn::Hosts|Logical Datacenter \(LDC\)|
