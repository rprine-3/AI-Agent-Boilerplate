# Red Hat JBoss EAP Host Controller pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns uses the Red Hat JBoss - Enterprise App Platform Host Controller pattern to find JBoss Enterprise Application Platform \(JBoss EAP\) Host Controller instances running on Windows servers. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

-   **Verify that the following applications are up to date**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   Visibility Content
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
    -   ITOM Content Service
-   **Create Windows credentials**

    For more information, see [Windows credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_WindowsCredentialsForm.md).

-   **Verify read access to the application module files on the application server**

    Verify you have permission for the following command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Get-ChildItem '{process.environmentVariables.JBOSS_HOME.value}\modules' -Recurse -Filter MANIFEST.MF | Where-Object { $_.FullName -like '*org\jboss\as\product*' } | ForEach-Object { Select-String -Path $_.FullName -Pattern 'JBoss-Product-Release-(Name|Version)' }"`.

-   **Schedule a horizontal discovery**

    For more information, see [Schedule a horizontal discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_CreateADiscoverySchedule.md).


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the Red Hat JBoss - Enterprise App Platform Host Controller pattern.

If you have the Software Asset Management Core \(com.snc.sam.core\) or Software Asset Management \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\) plugins, Discovery also populates the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name \[name\]|Name of the application in the following format: **Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Host Controller@\{hostname\}**.|
|Product \[product\]|Product name. The value is set to **JBoss Enterprise Application Platform**.|
|Publisher \[publisher\]|Publisher of the application. The value is set to **Red Hat**.|
|Component \[component\]|Component of the application. The value is set to **Host Controller**.|
|Installation directory \[install\_directory\]|Installation directory of the application.|
|Version \[version\]|Version of the application.|
|Software Install \[software\_install\]\*|References the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table.|

\* Populated only when a Software Asset Management plugin is activated.

## CI relationships and references

The Red Hat JBoss - Enterprise App Platform Host Controller pattern creates the following relationships and references to support Red Hat JBoss EAP Host Controller discovery. References link to records in other tables and don't appear in the CI Relationship \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\] table.

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|Application \[cmdb\_ci\_appl\]|Runs on::Runs|Windows Server \[cmdb\_ci\_win\_server\]|

|CI|Field|Referenced CI|
|---|-----|-------------|
|Application \[cmdb\_ci\_appl\]|Software Install \[software\_install\]|Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\]\*|

\* Populated only when a Software Asset Management plugin is activated.
