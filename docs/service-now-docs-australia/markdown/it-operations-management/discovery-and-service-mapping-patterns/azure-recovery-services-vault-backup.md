# Azure Recovery Services Vault Backup Item pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds Azure services on your cloud environment. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

-   **Verify the Microsoft Azure discovery prerequisites**

    For more information, see the prerequisites section in [Microsoft Azure Cloud discovery using patterns]().

-   **Remove resources from the Resource Inclusion List table**

    Verify that the relevant resource isn't listed in the Resource Inclusion List \[sa\_cloud\_inventory\_resource\_whitelist\] table to avoid duplicate discovery. For more information on removing resources from the Resource Inclusion List, see [Microsoft Azure resource inventory discovery]().

-   **Enable the relevant pattern**

    The pattern for this service is disabled by default. Starting with Visibility Content version 6.28.0, activating or deactivating a pattern won't be considered a customization, and it will continue to receive updates. Patterns that were previously activated or deactivated will reset to the latest predefined version after upgrading while retaining the last active field value. For more information on enabling patterns, see [Activate a disabled pattern]().

-   **Configure the Discovery schedule to support GovCloud**

    Discovering Azure GovCloud \(US\) accounts requires using a datacenter URL when setting up an Azure service account. For more information, see [Set up Azure service accounts]().


Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in both CMDB and non-CMDB tables.

## Data stored in non-CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the non-CMDB table when running the Azure - Recovery Services Vault Backup Item - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

You can review the non-CMDB Azure tables by navigating to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Azure**. You can also search the navigation filter for the specific pattern name.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Object Id \[object\_id\]|The unique identifier of the Azure resource.|
|Kind \[kind\]|The specific kind or sub-type of the resource.|
|DC Location \[location\]|The Azure region where the resource is deployed.|
|Resource Group \[resource\_group\]|The name of the resource group containing the resource.|
|Subscription Id \[subscription\_id\]|The unique identifier of the Azure subscription.|
|Tenant Id \[tenant\_id\]|The unique identifier of the Azure Active Directory tenant.|
|Backup Management Type \[backup\_management\_type\]|The method or platform by which backups are managed.|
|Configuration Item \[configuration\_item\]|References the Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\] table.|
|Last Backup Status \[last\_backup\_status\]|The result or outcome of the most recent backup operation.|
|Policy Name \[policy\_name\]|The name of the backup policy associated with the resource.|
|Protection State \[protection\_state\]|The operational state of backup protection on the resource.|
|Protection Status \[protection\_status\]|The current protection status assigned to the resource.|
|Virtual Machine Id \[virtual\_machine\_id\]|The unique identifier of the associated virtual machine.|
|Workload Type \[workload\_type\]|The type of workload or application being protected by the backup.|

## Data stored in CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the CMDB when running the Azure - Recovery Services Vault Backup Item - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Object ID \[object\_id\]|The unique identifier of the Azure resource.|
|Name \[name\]|The name of the Azure resource.|
|Location \[location\]|The Azure region where the resource is deployed.|
|Comments \[comments\]|The unique identifier of the backup vault associated with the resource.|
|Install Status \[install\_status\]|Install status of the resource. Default value is Installed.|
|Operational status \[operational\_status\]|Operational status of the resource. Default value is Operational.|
|Resource type \[resource\_type\]|Type of resource. The value is set to **microsoft.recoveryservices/vaults/backupfabrics/protectioncontainers/protectedItems**.|

## CI relationships

The Azure - Recovery Services Vault Backup Item - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern creates these relationships to support Azure Recovery Services Vault Backup Item discovery.

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|Resource Group \[cmdb\_ci\_resource\_group\]|Contains::Contained by|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|
|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|Hosted on::Hosts|Azure Datacenter \[cmdb\_ci\_azure\_datacenter\]|
|Azure Recovery Services - Vault Backup Item \[cmdb\_azure\_recovery\_services\_vault\_backup\_item\]|References|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|
