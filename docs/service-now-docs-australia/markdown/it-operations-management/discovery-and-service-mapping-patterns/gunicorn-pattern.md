# Gunicorn pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds Gunicorn WSGI HTTP server instances running on Linux servers. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify that the applications are up to date**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   Visibility Content
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
-   **Verify Gunicorn is installed and running on the Linux server**

    Verify the Gunicorn software is installed and running on a Linux server. The Gunicorn process must be active at the time of discovery.

-   **Verify `sudo` access to run network commands**

    Verify the discovery credentials have permission to run the following command: `sudo netstat -tulnp`.

-   **Create SSH credentials**

    For more information, see [SSH credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).

-   **Schedule a horizontal discovery**

    For more information, see [Schedule a horizontal discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_CreateADiscoverySchedule.md).


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the GUNICORN pattern.
