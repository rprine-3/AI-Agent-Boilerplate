# Compare pattern versions

If you have multiple versions of the same pattern, you can compare them to decide which pattern version to use for discovery.

## Before you begin

Role required: pd\_admin

## About this task

Service Mapping and Discovery use patterns in their discovery process. Every time you modify and save a pattern, you create a version of this pattern.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Pattern Designer** &gt; **Discovery Patterns**.

2.  Click the required pattern.

    The form for this pattern opens.

3.  Click the **Pattern** tab.

4.  Scroll down to the **Versions** section.

    The state of the active pattern version that Service Mapping and Discovery use is **Current**.

5.  Click the previous pattern version, which you want to compare to the current version.

6.  Click **Compare to Current** under **Related Links**.

7.  In the Compare to Current window, click the **Pattern text** pane either under **Selected Version** or **Current Version**.

    \[Omitted image "CompareToCurrent.png"\] Alt text: Click the Pattern text pane to open the text comparison window.

    The text comparison view opens showing the text of the selected pattern version and the current pattern version side by side. The step containing a difference appears highlighted.

    Highlight colors indicate the type of change:

    -   Updated step — purple
    -   New line or characters — green
    -   Deleted line or characters — red
8.  Review the differences in the pattern versions.

9.  If necessary, click **Revert chunk** to replace the step in the current version with the step from the previous version.

    \[Omitted image "CompareToCurrentRevertChunk.png"\] Alt text: Click Revert chunk to replace the step in the current step with the step from the previous version.

10. Click **OK** when done.

11. If you copied any steps from the previous version and want to save the change, click **Save Merge**.
