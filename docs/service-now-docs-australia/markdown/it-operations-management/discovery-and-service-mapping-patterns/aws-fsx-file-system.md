# Amazon FSx File System pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds Amazon FSx File Systems on your cloud environment. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

-   **Verify the AWS discovery prerequisites**

    For more information, see the prerequisites section in [AWS discovery using patterns]().

-   **Remove resources from the Resource Inclusion List table**

    Verify that the relevant resource isn't listed in the Resource Inclusion List \[sa\_cloud\_inventory\_resource\_whitelist\] table to avoid duplicate discovery. For more information on removing resources from the Resource Inclusion List, see [AWS Resource Inventory discovery with Patterns]().

-   **Enable the relevant pattern**

    The pattern for this service is disabled by default. Starting with Visibility Content version 6.28.0, activating or deactivating a pattern won't be considered a customization, and it will continue to receive updates. Patterns that were previously activated or deactivated will reset to the latest predefined version after upgrading while retaining the last active field value. For more information on enabling patterns, see [Activate a disabled pattern]().


Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in both CMDB and non-CMDB tables.

## Data stored in non-CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the non-CMDB table when running the Amazon AWS - FSx File System - Extended Inventory \(LP\) pattern.

You can review the non-CMDB AWS tables by navigating to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **AWS**. You can also search the navigation filter for the specific pattern name.

</table>## Data stored in CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the CMDB when running the Amazon AWS - FSx File System - Extended Inventory \(LP\) pattern.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name \[name\]|The ID of the file system, used as the display name.|
|Object ID \[object\_id\]|The ARN of the file system.|
|Resource type \[resource\_type\]|Type of resource. The value is set to **AWS::FSx::FileSystem**.|
|Install Status \[install\_status\]|Install status of the resource. Default value is Installed.|
|Operational status \[operational\_status\]|Operational status of the resource. Default value is Operational.|

## CI relationships

The Amazon AWS - FSx File System - Extended Inventory \(LP\) pattern creates the following relationships and references to support Amazon FSx File System discovery. References link to records in other tables and don't appear in the CI Relationship \[cmdb\_rel\_ci\] table.

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|Hosted on::Hosts|AWS Datacenter \[cmdb\_ci\_aws\_datacenter\]|

|CI|Field|Referenced CI|
|---|-----|-------------|
|AWS FSx File System \[cmdb\_aws\_fsx\_file\_system\]|Configuration Item \[configuration\_item\]|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|
|Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\]|Configuration item \[configuration\_item\]|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|

## AWS Tag discovery

The Amazon AWS - FSx File System - Extended Inventory \(LP\) pattern collects tags and populates them in the Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\] table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Key \[key\]|Tag name.|
|Value \[value\]|Tag value.|
|Configuration item \[configuration\_item\]|References the Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\] table.|
