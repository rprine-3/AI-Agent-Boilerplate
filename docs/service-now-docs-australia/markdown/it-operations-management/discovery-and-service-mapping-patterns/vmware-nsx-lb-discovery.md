# VMware NSX Advanced load balancer discovery

The ServiceNow Discovery application uses the VMware NSX Advanced load balancer discovery pattern to find VMware NSX load balancers. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

The pattern uses a set of REST APIs to find the load balancers. It is triggered by the NSX HTTP classifier that responds to the **HTTP - Classify** probe. For more information, see [HTTP device discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/http-discovery.md).

**Note:** There are two patterns available. The legacy VMware NSX Load Balancer pattern is for the S series. The new VMware NSX-T Load Balancer pattern is for the T series. The functionality and collected information remain the same.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Enable NSX Basic Authentication**

    In VMware NSX, enable NSX Basic Authentication.

-   **Verify that the applications are up to date**
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
    -   Visibility Content
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
-   **Configure basic authentication credentials**

    On the ServiceNow AI Platform, configure basic authentication credentials. The credentials must have the following API permissions:

    -   NSX:
        -   /api/4.0/edges
        -   /api/4.0/edges/&lt;edge\_id&gt;loadbalancer/config
    -   NSX-T: /api/v1/edge-clusters
    For more information about basic authentication credentials, see [Basic authentication credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_BasicAuthCredentialsForm.md).

-   **Verify HTTP discovery is triggered against the NSX Main Controller IP**

    The HTTP discovery is triggered only if SSH or SNMP discovery is unsuccessful.

-   **Create a discovery schedule**

    Create the discovery schedule for VMware NSX load balancer discovery or run a quick discovery on the IP address of the NSX Main Controller. For more information about running a quick discovery, see [Run a Quick Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_CreateADiscoverySchedule.md).

## CI relationships

Discovery creates these relationships to support the VMware NSX load balancer discovery.

## Troubleshooting

If the mapping process does not proceed as you expected, follow the following suggestions.

<table id="table_ggn_ypj_yhb"><thead><tr><th>

Symptom

</th><th>

Cause

</th><th>

Solution

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Discovery fails. The discovery message contains the information about an error caused by the REST timeout.

</td><td>

There are many CIs sending the REST call response in the deployment. The MID Server cannot process the REST call response without exceeding the time limit controlled by the **mid.sa.cloud.request\_timeout** parameter.

</td><td>

By default, the **mid.sa.cloud.request\_timeout** parameter is set to 30000 milliseconds. Increase the value of this parameter on the relevant MID Server and run discovery again.

**Note:** If the **Configuration Parameters** related list for the relevant MID Server does not show this parameter, you may need to add it.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Pattern Designer fails during a debug session. The Pattern Designer message contains information about an error caused by a timeout.

</td><td>

The Pattern Designer fails because of a timeout during pattern debugging \(and not during discovery\).

</td><td>

By default, the **sa.debugger.max\_timeout**parameter is set to 240 seconds.Increase the value of this parameter on the relevant MID Server.
