# Cohesity storage system discovery

The Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application uses the Cohesity Storage System pattern to find clusters, nodes, and chassis for the Cohesity DataPlatform. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

Cohesity develops software that are used to consolidate and simplify data management, and it includes analytics capabilities. Their software also solves the problem of mass data fragmentation with data that extends across multiple systems or cloud providers.

The company's main product, DataPlatform, is a hyper-converged software that allows businesses to consolidate a variety of workloads onto a single cloud-native platform. These workloads include backups, archives, test, development, and analytics data. It works with physical servers as well as virtual machines.

Cohesity extends backup capabilities to NoSQL workload distributed databases like MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Couchbase, and Apache HBase. It also supports Apache Hadoop data on Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\) datastores.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify that the applications are up to date**
    -   CMDB CI Class Models, from version 1.37.0
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns, from version 1.0.91
-   **Verify MID Server configuration**

    Verify the MID Server is set to Active and is reachable to the Cohesity storage cluster.

-   **Verify API permissions**

    Verify you have a basic authentication account configured with proper permissions for the following API calls:

    -   `https://" + ${cluster_ip} + "/irisservices/api/v1/public/cluster?fetchStats=true`
    -   `https://" + ${cluster_ip} + "/irisservices/api/v1/nexus/cluster/status`
    -   `https://" + ${cluster_ip} + "/irisservices/api/v1/public/nodes?fetchStats=true`
    -   `https://" + nodeIp + "/irisservices/api/v1/nexus/node/hardware_info`
-   **Create an alias for the basic authentication credential**

    For more information, see [Create an alias for a basic authentication credential for Cohesity storage system discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/create-alias-basic-auth-cred-cohesity.md).

-   **Create a serverless discovery schedule**

    For more information, see [Create a serverless schedule for Cohesity storage system discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/create-serverless-schedule-cohesity.md).


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the Cohesity Storage System pattern.
