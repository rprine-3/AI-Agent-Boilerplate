# Next-Generation Fortinet Network Firewall SNMP-based discovery

The Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application uses the Next Generation Fortinet Network Firewall pattern to find Fortinet firewalls through a series of SNMP calls. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

The Next Generation Fortinet Network Firewall pattern uses a set of SNMP calls to find the Fortinet firewalls. Discovery uses the pattern to run horizontal discovery.

**Note:** Only the REST-based Fortinet firewall discovery method finds FortiGate VDOMs. The SNMP-based Fortinet firewall discovery method doesn't discover them. For information on REST-based Fortinet firewall and FortiGate Virtual Domains \(VDOMs\) discovery, see [Fortinet firewall and FortiGate VDOM REST-based discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/fortinet-fw-vdoms-rest-discovery.md).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

To learn about Fortinet firewalls and their versions that you can discover, refer to [Detailed information on products discovered by ITOM Visibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/r_SupportedApplications.md).

## Fortinet Firewall data model

The Next Generation Fortinet Network Firewall pattern introduces the following CI classes that extend an existing CMDB class.

|CI class|Extends from|
|--------|------------|
|Fortinet Firewall Cluster \[cmdb\_ci\_firewall\_cluster\_fortinet\]|Firewall Cluster \[cmdb\_ci\_firewall\_cluster\]|
|Fortinet Firewall Device \[cmdb\_ci\_firewall\_device\_fortinet\]|Firewall Device \[cmdb\_ci\_firewall\_device\]|

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify the applications are up to date**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
-   **Ensure SNMP access**

    Ensure that your Fortinet firewall device has SNMP access.

-   **Configure SNMP credentials**

    On the ServiceNow instance, configure SNMP credentials. For more information, see [SNMP credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_SNMPCredentials.md).

-   **Add SNMP system OID record to ServiceNow instance**

    Add the SNMP system OID record for the Fortinet device to the ServiceNow instance. Update the following:

    -   Classifier: Fortinet Firewall
    -   Class: Fortinet Firewall Device
-   **Run a horizontal discovery**

    For more information, see [Running discoveries in your network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/running-discoveries.md).
