# Microsoft Azure Application Gateway discovery with Patterns

The ServiceNow Discovery application uses the Azure Application Gateway \(LP\) pattern for discovering this product, while the Service Mapping application discovers Application Gateway using the Azure Application Gateway TD \(LBS\) pattern. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Azure Principal credentials**

    On the ServiceNow platform, create a service account for cloud discovery. Set the account Id to the Azure Service Principal as it appears at the Microsoft Azure Console.

-   **Privileges**

    On the Microsoft Azure Console, provide a user a user with the reader role.

</table>## Connections discovered by Service Mapping during the top-down discovery

Service Mapping performs the top-down discovery of the Azure Application Gateway in the context of application services. Service Mapping discovers the outgoing http connections from Azure Application Gateway service to pool members, such as virtual machines.
