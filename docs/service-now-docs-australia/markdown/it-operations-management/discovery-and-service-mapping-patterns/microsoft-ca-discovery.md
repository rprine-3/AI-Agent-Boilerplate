# Microsoft Certificate Authority \(CA\) certificates discovery

The ServiceNow Discovery application can discover Microsoft Certificate Authority \(CA\) certificates using the Microsoft CA - Certificate Management pattern. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

Starting with version 1.27.0, Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns supports discovering the subject alternative name \(SAN\) for both the all request IDs and the template ID discovery methods.

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify the following applications are up to date**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
-   **Verify the certificate Authority process**

    Ensure that the CA process is up and running on the host machine.

-   **Verify previous Windows discovery**

    Verify a Windows host was discovered during a previous horizontal discovery. For more information, see [Windows discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/r_DataCollDiscoWindowsComputers.md).

-   **Create a serverless discovery schedule**

    Create a discovery schedule to perform targeted discovery of Microsoft CA certificates using the host on which the CA process is running. For more information, see [Create a serverless schedule for Microsoft CA discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/create-serverless-schedule-ms-ca.md).


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the Microsoft CA - Certificate Management pattern.
