# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) discovery

ServiceNow Discovery uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) discovery patterns to provide real-time elasticity for enterprise applications by combining Oracle autonomous services, integrated security, and cloud compute. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

Starting with version 1.29.0, Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns supports the discovery of OCI GovCloud accounts.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify that the following applications are installed**

    Verify that the following applications are installed and up to date:

    -   Cloud Access Interface \(starting from version 1.0.0\)
    -   Visibility Content
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
-   **Configure Oracle API credentials**

    Ensure that your OCI credentials are configured and that your private and public keys are converted to the RSA format. For more information, see [Create Oracle API credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/create-oracle-api-credentials.md).

-   **Create OCI service account**

    For more information, see [Create OCI service accounts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/create-oci-service-accounts.md).

-   **Create a cloud discovery schedule**

    To run a cloud discovery at scale, see [Create an OCI Discovery schedule in Discovery Admin Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/create-oci-schedule-DAW.md).

    Create a discovery schedule to run LDCs on.

    1.  Navigate to **Discovery** &gt; **Discovery Schedules**.
    2.  Select **Cloud Discovery**.
    3.  In the **Provider** field, select **OCI**. Fill in the form to create an account or select an existing one. For more information, see [Create OCI service accounts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/create-oci-service-accounts.md).
    4.  On the **Select Datacenters** page, filter which LDCs you want to run the discovery.
    5.  When you're finished, navigate to the **Create Schedule** page and select **Finish and Run**.
-   **\(Optional\) Populate Service Account and Logical Datacenter fields in cloud CIs**

    Starting with Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns version 1.30.2, you can improve query performance by populating Service Account and Logical Datacenter fields directly in cloud CIs. For more information, see [Improved query performance with direct field population in CI tables]().


## Verify the REST API Permissions

Download the [Cloud Discovery patterns spreadsheet](https://downloads.docs.servicenow.com/resource/enus/api/servicenow-discovery-patterns-api-details.xlsx) so you can grant user permissions required for running the Discovery patterns. In addition to permissions, the spreadsheet also includes useful information such as pattern names, types, CI Classes, and links to vendor documentation. New patterns are available quarterly, so check periodically to be sure you have the latest version of the spreadsheet.

## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

The discovered Oracle configuration data includes the following table and fields.

-   Autonomous DB
-   Exadata DB
-   Image
-   Network
-   NIC
-   Storage Volume
-   Account
-   Subnet
-   Virtual Machine
