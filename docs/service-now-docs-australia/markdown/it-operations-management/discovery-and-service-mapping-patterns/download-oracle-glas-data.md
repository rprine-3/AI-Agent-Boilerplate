# Download Oracle Global License Advisory Services \(GLAS\) data

Download Oracle GLAS data in CSV format to get detailed information on patterns and configuration items. You can also download reports for Oracle Database, Middleware, Oracle Java, VM, and vCenter hardware information.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or glas\_admin

## About this task

ServiceNow maintains regular verification with Oracle GLAS to provide you with insights on licensing data for your Oracle estate. The following Oracle GLAS reporting versions are currently verified:

-   Database: 25.2
-   Middleware: 23.2
-   Java: 24.4

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Oracle GLAS Data Collection** &gt; **Download GLAS Data Collection**.\[Omitted image "oracle-glas-download.png"\] Alt text: Oracle GLAS download page

2.  Download the following reports for Oracle GLAS data:

    -   For downloading Oracle Database, Middleware, and Java reports, navigate to **Step 1: Download GLAS Data Collection** and select your data collection options.
    -   For downloading vCenter hardware information based on your environment setup, navigate to **Step 2: Download vCenter Hardware Information**.
    -   For downloading VM information, navigate to **Step 3: Download VM Information**.
3.  Select the download icon \(\[Omitted image "download-icon.png"\] Alt text: Download icon\).

4.  In the Enter email address dialog box, enter the email address where you want to receive a notification when the report is ready.

5.  Select **OK**.

    After the report creation status message appears, you can check the status of the download job by selecting the link provided in the message.

    \[Omitted image "report-creation-msg.png"\] Alt text: Message for report creation status

    The Oracle GLAS Report Job Log \[sn\_itom\_oracleglas\_job\_log\] table opens in a new window. After your report is successfully created, the status of the report changes to Complete in the Oracle GLAS Report Job Logs table.

6.  Select a job log record to view its details, including the unique number, name, status, and description.

    The record also shows the date and time when the job log was created and updated.

7.  On the Oracle GLAS Report Job Log form that opens, download your report by navigating to **Manage Attachments** and selecting **download**.

    -   Depending on your selection in **Step 1: Download GLAS Data Collection**, the following folders are downloaded:

        -   **Oracle Database**
            -   DB folder – contains the following CSV files:
                -   `ORCL_V$SESSION.csv`
                -   `ORCL_OPTIONS.csv`
                -   `ORCL_DBA_USERS.csv`
                -   `ORCL_DETAIL.csv`
                -   `ORCL_V$LICENSE.csv`
                -   `ORCL_OVERVIEW.csv`
            -   CPUQ folder – contains CPUQ files, vCenter Hardware, and VM information
        -   **Oracle Middleware**

            The following files are exported, where the file name reflects your server name and Oracle product:

            -   ORCL\_OVERVIEW.csv
            -   `Collection-<Server Name>_<Oracle Product>.tar.bz` with the files and directories of the format FMW/u01/app/oracle/config/domains/soa\_domain/config/config.xml in it
        -   **Oracle Java**
            -   Java folder – contains Java installation information

                **Note:** The report that you download for Oracle Java GLAS includes only Java deployments from the Oracle publisher. Java deployments from non‑Oracle publishers are excluded from the report.

            -   CPUQ folder – contains CPUQ files, vCenter Hardware, and VM information
    -   If you selected **Step 2: Download vCenter Hardware Information**, one hardware inventory CSV file is downloaded per vCenter in your environment.
    -   If you selected **Step 3: Download VM Information**, one VM information CSV file is downloaded per vCenter in your environment.
    **Note:** For V1, you can also download the CSV files for Oracle Database by navigating to **Oracle GLAS Data Collection** &gt; **Oracle GLAS Data**. From the list that opens, select the table that you want to download and then select **Download GLAS Report**.


## Result

The downloaded files appear in the location that you select.

If the files are empty or contain an error message, check their sizes to verify that they haven't exceeded the limits set in the following properties. Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties** to find the following properties.
