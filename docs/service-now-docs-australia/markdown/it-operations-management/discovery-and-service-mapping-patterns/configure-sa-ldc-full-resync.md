# Trigger a full CI table resync for direct field population

Trigger the **Populate Service Account and LDC IN CMDB** scheduled job to reprocess all configuration item \(CI\) records. Configure the **sn\_itom\_pattern.populate\_saldc\_full\_resync** system property when service accounts or logical datacenters have incorrect or corrupted values for a CI.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have at least version 1.35.0 of Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns.

Role required: admin

## About this task

The scheduled job normally processes only CI records created since its last run. Setting the **sn\_itom\_pattern.populate\_saldc\_full\_resync** property to true configures the next job run to reprocess all CI records. The system automatically resets the property to false after the resync completes.

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  In the **Name** field, search for `sn_itom_pattern.populate_saldc_full_resync`.

3.  Select the **sn\_itom\_pattern.populate\_saldc\_full\_resync** property.

4.  In the **Value** field, enter `true`.

5.  Select **Update**.


## What to do next

Wait for the next scheduled run of the **Populate Service Account and LDC IN CMDB** job, or execute it immediately.
