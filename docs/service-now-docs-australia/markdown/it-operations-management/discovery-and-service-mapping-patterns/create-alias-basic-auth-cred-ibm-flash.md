# Create an alias for a basic authentication credential for IBM Flash System discovery

Create an alias for a basic authentication credential to run IBM Flash System discovery.

## Before you begin

-   Verify you have a basic authentication account with read-only access configured on the IBM Flash System array.
-   Verify that you have at least version 1.35.0 of Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns.
-   Select the Application scope icon \[Omitted image "application-scope-icon.png"\] and verify that the scope is set to **Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns**. The pattern launcher only resolves credentials created in the **Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns** scope.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

The IBM Flash System pattern uses basic authentication credentials to authenticate with the storage system. The pattern exchanges the username and password for a session token, which it uses for all subsequent REST calls to retrieve storage data.

## Procedure

1.  Create an alias.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  Enter a unique name for the alias and select **Credential** for the alias type in the **Type** field.

    4.  Select **Submit**.

2.  Configure a basic authentication credential for the new alias.

    1.  Navigate to **Discovery** &gt; **Credentials**.

    2.  Select **New**.

    3.  Select **Basic Auth Credentials**.

    4.  Unlock the **Credential alias** field and select the alias you created.

    5.  Configure the rest of the **Basic Auth Credentials** form fields.

        For more information about Basic Auth Credentials form fields, see [Basic authentication credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_BasicAuthCredentialsForm.md).

    6.  Select **Submit**.
