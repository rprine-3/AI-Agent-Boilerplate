# Reference the main CI on discovered IP addresses

Populate the **Owned By Configuration Item** field on discovered IP address records with a direct reference to the main CI, instead of requiring a dot-walk through the network adapter. Populating the reference is supported only for AIX Server discovery.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have at least version 1.35.0 of Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

By default, the relationship between a discovered IP address and its main CI is available only through a dot-walk via the Network Adapter \[cmdb\_ci\_network\_adapter\] table \(nic.configuration\_item\). When the **add.owned.by.attribute** system property is set to true, the **Owned By Configuration Item** field on the IP Address \[cmdb\_ci\_ip\_address\] table is populated with a direct reference to the main CI. The default value is false. When enabled, any existing **Owned By Configuration Item** references are cleared and recreated for the discovered IP addresses.

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  In the **Name** column, search for `add.owned.by.attribute`.

3.  Select the **add.owned.by.attribute** system property.

4.  In the **Value** field, enter `true`.

    To revert to the default behavior and leave the **Owned By Configuration Item** field unpopulated, set the value to `false`.

5.  Select **Update**.


## What to do next

Run Discovery again to apply the change.
