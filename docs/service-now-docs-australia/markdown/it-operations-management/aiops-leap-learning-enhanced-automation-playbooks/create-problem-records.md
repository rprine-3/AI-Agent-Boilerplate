# Create LEAP problem records

Create problem records for LEAP from available incident clusters, also known as automation opportunities, for further analysis.

## Before you begin

Role required: LEAP admin

## About this task

The problem record creation process automatically transfers critical information from incidents to problem records. When a problem record is created, LEAP includes all relevant information. This information includes:

-   incident group description
-   incident group link
-   resolution steps

The automated data transfer is characterized with:

-   **Root cause documentation**

    LEAP populates the cause notes section of the problem record with the same details as available in existing incident records.

-   **Incident attachment**

    All incidents associated with the group are automatically linked to the problem record for comprehensive tracking.

-   **Async processing**

    Problem records are generated efficiently without manual intervention even during high-volume scenarios.


## Procedure

1.  Select **Workspaces** &gt; **LEAP**.

2.  On the LEAP landing page, select an automation opportunity.

3.  If resolution steps don't appear in the Overview section, select **Generate resolution steps**.

4.  Select **Actions** &gt; ******Create problem record** button to create a record for further in-depth analysis.
