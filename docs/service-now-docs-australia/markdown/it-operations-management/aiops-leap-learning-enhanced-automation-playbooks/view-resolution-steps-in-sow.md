# View LEAP resolution step recommendations in SOW

Use LEAP to view AI-generated resolution step recommendations that match the incident description in SOW to resolve incidents more efficiently.

## Before you begin

Role required: LEAP agent

## About this task

When you work on an incident in SOW, LEAP compares the incident short description against existing resolution steps. Only the steps relevant to the incident description appear in the **Recommendations** tab under LEAP Resolution Steps. Steps that don't match the incident description are filtered out. If fewer steps appear than expected, this indicates successful filtering of irrelevant steps.

**Note:** AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies. Review all recommended resolution steps before applying them to verify their accuracy and suitability for your environment.

## Procedure

1.  Open an incident in SOW.

2.  In the insights panel, select the **Recommendations** tab.

    LEAP displays resolution steps that match the incident's short description.

3.  Review the recommended resolution steps.

    If fewer steps appear than expected, LEAP filters out steps that don't match the incident description.

4.  Apply the resolution steps to resolve the incident.
