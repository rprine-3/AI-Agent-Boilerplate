# AI in LEAP

AI-powered features in LEAP help administrators generate resolution steps, create problem records, publish knowledge base articles, build playbooks, and discover and execute Ansible automations.

LEAP includes several AI-powered features. All features require ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) to be installed.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

AI-generated resolution steps

</td><td>

Uses generative AI to analyze grouped incidents and generate structured resolution steps for each automation opportunity. Resolution steps can be reviewed and modified before use.

</td><td>

A LEAP administrator wants to produce actionable resolution guidance for a recurring incident pattern without manually authoring steps from scratch.

</td></tr><tr><td>

LEAP AI agent

</td><td>

Uses automation opportunities created by LEAP analysis to generate artifacts — problem records, AI-enhanced knowledge base articles, or playbooks — based on user requests. The agent is turned on by default.

</td><td>

A LEAP administrator wants to convert a recurring incident pattern into a problem record, a structured knowledge base article, or a playbook without manually authoring each artifact.

Ansible discovery agent

</td><td>

Analyzes automation opportunities and uses AI-powered semantic matching to identify relevant Ansible job templates from Ansible Automation Platform. Presents discovered templates to the LEAP administrator for step-to-job mapping.

</td><td>

A LEAP administrator wants to find the most relevant Ansible job templates for an automation opportunity without manually searching the Ansible catalog.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ansible execution agent

</td><td>

Automatically launches mapped Ansible job templates during incident remediation in the Service Operations Workspace. Reports execution status back to the incident responder.

</td><td>

An incident responder wants to trigger an Ansible automation directly from the Service Operations Workspace during active incident resolution, without switching to the Ansible platform.
