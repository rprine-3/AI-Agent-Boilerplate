# Generate and modify resolution steps in LEAP

Learn how to generate, edit, and track AI-generated resolution steps for automation opportunities in LEAP.

## About this task

Resolution steps are actions that resolve issues identified by an automation opportunity. During the initial run, GAF generates these steps by analyzing work notes and historical resolutions.

The **Generate resolution steps** button creates resolution steps as required. As your system processes new incidents and records, regenerate these steps to maintain solution accuracy. LEAP provides three search capabilities: AI search, KB search, and web search.

-   AI search: Scans records within your existing instance to identify relevant resolutions.
-   KB search: Searches knowledge base resources external to your organization to suggest more effective resolution steps.
-   Web search: Queries web resources beyond your organization's systems to find comprehensive solutions, broadening the scope of potential resolutions.

**Note:**

-   Regenerating resolution steps incurs chargeable transactions. Exercise caution and careful planning before using the regenerate button to avoid unexpected costs.
-   Only a system administrator or a LEAP admin with system administrator access can enable these additional sources of searches. Users with agent or viewer access must contact their administrator to activate these features. Once enabled, LEAP expands its search capabilities to deliver more comprehensive and effective resolution steps.

Resolution steps are generated only for automation opportunities that match the **Default resolution steps filter** configured in LEAP settings. The default filter is set to Critical priority \(`automation_priority=40`\). Items are processed in batches in the background, so performance is not affected during generation. To change the priority filter, update the condition builder in [LEAP settings fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/aiops-leap-learning-enhanced-automation-playbooks/aiops-leap-settings-fields.md).

## Before you begin

Role required: LEAP admin

## Procedure

1.  Select **Workspaces** &gt; **LEAP**.

2.  On the LEAP landing page, select the required automation opportunity.

3.  If resolution steps are unavailable in the Overview section, select **Generate resolution steps**.

4.  If resolution steps are available, and you want to get alternative resolution steps, then use the **Regenerate** button.\[Omitted image "regenerate-resolution-steps-gradient.png"\] Alt text: Regenerate resolution steps

    **Note:**

    -   The Regenerate button is turned off while manual editing is in progress.
    -   Resolution steps are generated based on the capability enabled either using AI search or Knowledge Base or Web search.
5.  To manually modify resolution steps, select the edit icon.

    Each update to the resolution steps is recorded in the LEAP Outcome Snapshots table for traceability.

6.  To revert to the last generated resolution steps, use the **Revert to AI generated steps** button.
