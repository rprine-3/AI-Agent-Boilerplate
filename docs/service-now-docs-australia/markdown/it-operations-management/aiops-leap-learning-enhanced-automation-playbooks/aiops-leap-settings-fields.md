# LEAP settings fields

LEAP settings page field values help estimate cost and time savings when automation is used. These settings support cost predictability.

## LEAP settings fields

Overhead factors are multipliers that are used for critical priority incidents and represent hidden costs.

<table><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Cost per work note \($\)

</td><td>

Represents the cost for each work note, including labor and operational expenses for every incident. This value calculates total cost savings when automation reduces the number of work notes.

 Example: If your organization spends an average of $50 per work note entry, including analyst time and overhead, enter 50.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Time per work note \(hrs\)

</td><td>

Average time spent on each work note entry and helps estimate the total time impact across incidents.

 Example: If analysts spend an average of 30 minutes on each work note, enter 0.5. For a cluster of 100 incidents with 4 work notes each, LEAP estimates 200 hours of time savings when automation is applied.

</td></tr><tr><td>

 

</td><td>

Priority 1 incidents often require more coordination, communication, and escalation — beyond just the direct work notes. For P1 incidents, the base cost is multiplied by 1.8 to reflect the additional impact.

 Example: If the base cost per work note is $50 and a P1 incident has 4 work notes, the adjusted cost is $50 × 4 × 1.8 = $360.

</td></tr><tr><td>

P2 - High priority incidents

</td><td>

For priority 2 incidents, the base cost is multiplied by 1.4 to reflect the additional impact.

 Example: If the base cost per work note is $50 and a P2 incident has 4 work notes, the adjusted cost is $50 × 4 × 1.4 = $280.

</td></tr><tr><td>

P3 - Moderate priority incidents

</td><td>

For priority 3 incidents, the base cost is multiplied by 1.1 to reflect the additional impact.

 Example: If the base cost per work note is $50 and a P3 incident has 4 work notes, the adjusted cost is $50 × 4 × 1.1 = $220.

</td></tr><tr><td>

P4 - Low priority incidents

</td><td>

For priority 4, the base cost is multiplied by 0.8 to reflect the additional impact.

 Example: If the base cost per work note is $50 and a P4 incident has 4 work notes, the adjusted cost is $50 × 4 × 0.8 = $160.

</td></tr><tr><td>

P5 - Planning incidents

</td><td>

For priority 5, the base cost is multiplied by 0.4 to reflect the additional impact.

 Example: If the base cost per work note is $50 and a P5 incident has 4 work notes, the adjusted cost is $50 × 4 × 0.4 = $80.

Grouping configuration

</td></tr><tr><td>

Large group threshold

</td><td>

Groups that have more incidents than the threshold set are marked as large groups. The default value set is 100 incidents. The threshold helps LEAP prioritize high-volume clusters for automation analysis.

 **Example:** If the threshold is set to 200, any group containing more than 200 incidents is flagged as a large group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Initial run: Groups with resolution steps

</td><td>

The maximum number of groups for which resolution steps are generated in the first run of LEAP. The default is 500. Increasing this value generates broader coverage but may extend processing time.

 **Example:** If set to 500, LEAP generates resolution steps for up to 500 groups in the first run.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Remapping eligibility threshold

</td><td>

The minimum ratio of incidents to group size required for a group to be eligible for remapping. The default is 0.2, which represents 20% of the group size. Higher values result in more selective remapping. Increasing this value limits remapping to only well-populated groups, reducing noise from small or transient clusters.

 **Example:** If set to 0.2, a group must contain at least 20% of the expected group size before it's eligible for remapping.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default resolution steps filter

</td><td>

A condition builder filter that determines which automation opportunities are eligible for resolution step generation. The default filter is `automation_priority=40`, which corresponds to Critical priority. Update the filter using the condition builder to change the priority scope.

Problem creation agent

</td></tr><tr><td>

Problem agent: Minimum incident count

</td><td>

Minimum number of incidents a cluster must contain before the LEAP Problem creation agent autonomously creates a Problem record. The default value is 15.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Problem agent: Severity

</td><td>

Automation opportunity severity levels that make a cluster eligible for problem record creation by the LEAP Problem creation agent. You can select multiple severity levels. The default values are Critical and High.

</td></tr><tr class="sub-head"><td colspan="2">

Knowledge base agent

</td></tr><tr><td>

KB agent: Minimum incident count

</td><td>

Minimum number of incidents a cluster must contain before the LEAP AI agent autonomously creates a knowledge base article. The default value is 15.

</td></tr><tr><td>

KB agent: Severity

</td><td>

Automation opportunity severity levels that make a cluster eligible for knowledge base article creation by the LEAP AI agent. You can select multiple severity levels. The default values are Critical or High.

</td></tr><tr class="sub-head"><td colspan="2">

Knowledge base routing

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default knowledge base

</td><td>

The knowledge base where articles created automatically by the LEAP AI agent are stored. This field is mandatory. You cannot save settings without selecting a value.

 Articles created through the ServiceNow Otto panel are also routed to this knowledge base.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default category

</td><td>

The category within the default knowledge base where articles created by the LEAP AI agent are stored. The available categories are filtered based on the selected default knowledge base.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Eligible knowledge bases

</td><td>

The knowledge bases that users can select from when manually creating a knowledge base article from an automation opportunity using **Actions** &gt; **Draft KB article**.

 When specific knowledge bases are selected, only those appear in the knowledge base selection dialog. If this field is not configured, all active knowledge bases are shown.
