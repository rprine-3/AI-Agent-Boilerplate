# Set up the Microsoft Azure DevOps console

Set up the Microsoft Azure DevOps console as the first step before you run Discovery and order a catalog item in the Cloud Services Catalog application.

## Before you begin

1.  Add a deploymentID variable to the Microsoft Azure DevOps pipelines in your organization. The Microsoft Azure DevOps integration discovers pipelines with a deploymentID variable only.
2.  Tag all the provisioned resources with a deploymentID key in the pipeline so that you can discover the resources after provisioning.

The subscriptionID isn’t required for Azure DevOps and Ansible templates.

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Name a pipeline variable deploymentID that you can use for pointed Discovery to update the resources in CMDB.

2.  Create a Personal Access Token \(PAT\) credential that you can use in Azure DevOps Discovery.

3.  In the **Update variable** dialog box, override the pipeline variables by selecting the **Let users override this value when running this pipeline** check box.

    \[Omitted image "update-variable.png"\] Alt text: Update variable dialog box that has two options that you can select. Keep the value secret or override the value when you run the pipeline.

    The pipeline works with the CSC DevOps Integration catalog item. The Microsoft Azure DevOps integration discovers pipelines with the deploymentID variable.
