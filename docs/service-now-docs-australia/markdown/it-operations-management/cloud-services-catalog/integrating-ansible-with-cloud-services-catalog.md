# Integrating Ansible with Cloud Services Catalog

Integrate Ansible with Cloud Services Catalog as a Day 1 activity. With this activity, you can deploy an Ansible job template via a ServiceNow catalog item.

As a cloud\_service\_user, you can access the config provider and job templates and deploy a job template through a catalog item.
