## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Admin** portal and select **Manage****Credentials**.

2.  Add the **API key** credential that you created with the Personal Access Token \(PAT\) credential.

    For more information on setting PAT privileges, see [Azure DevOps permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-services-catalog/ado-permissions.md).

3.  Prefix the Personal Access Token \(PAT\) with a colon and encode it to base64 format.

    1.  Add a colon before your PAT value.

        Format: `:PAT`

    2.  Encode the string to base64 format.

        The result is an encoded string.

4.  Prefix the encoded base64 string with `Basic` \(include a space after Basic\).

    Format: `Basic (encoded_base64_string)`

5.  Add a required alias.
