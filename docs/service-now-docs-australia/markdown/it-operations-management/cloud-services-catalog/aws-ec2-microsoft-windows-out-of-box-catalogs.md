# Amazon Web Services EC2 Microsoft Windows Out Of Box Catalog items

Cloud Services Catalog Windows VM, up to 10 additional disks on EC2 or with security groups.

This is a fully functional sample catalog item that can be used to request a Windows instance of any instance type from Amazon EC2. These mandatory steps are required for provisioning:

1.  In the Terraform box, add the private key pem file used for provisioning.
2.  Copy the path of the PEM file from Terraform box and update that path in the default value of the Management keypath variable.

Features

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Order a Microsoft Windows virtual machine on EC2. Cloud configuration scan is run for compliance checking.

</td><td>

For instance types other than t2.nano and t2.micro, approval is needed from administrator, by policy. The work-flow automation runs a CCG scan on the deployed Linux instance and checks the policy rule with the configuration of the VM.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order a Windows virtual machine on EC2 and specify up to 10 additional disks. For up to two disks, no approval is necessary, but for anything beyond that, approval will be required.

</td><td>

This catalog item form allows ordering up to 10 additional disks \(volumes\) attached to the VM of varying sizes and types. If more than two additional disks are added to the request, seek approval from administrator, by policy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order a secure Windows virtual machine on EC2, assign security groups. Select as many required for the highest level of security.

</td><td>

This catalog item form allows capability to assign one or more security groups \(firewall-port rules\) to the compute instance so that the network access to the VM is restricted. Security groups are listed for the selected VPC and subnets.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>**Note:**

Tag \(key-value\) is assigned to all deployed resources. Example: VM, network, storage as present in the stack. The key-value is updated only in the cmdb\_key\_value table, not in public cloud at this time. This will be fixed in future releases to update the tags in cloud.

The provisioning work-flow will notify the windows admin password to the requester via email. It can take a minimum of four minutes to obtain the windows admin password from Amazon Web Services.
