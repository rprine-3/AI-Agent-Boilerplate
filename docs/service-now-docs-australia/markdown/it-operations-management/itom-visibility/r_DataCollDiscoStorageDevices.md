## Storage relationships

Discovery establishes the correct relationships between Network-Attached Storage \(NAS\) storage devices and remotely mounted client servers that consume the storage. Discovery maps NAS file shares. It maps by taking the IP or hostname of a remote mounted disk on the client computer. It then matches it to the IP or hostname of the storage server providing the exported file system.

Discovery creates the following relationships for storage CIs running on Storage Area Networks.

|Parent Component|Relationship|Child Component|
|----------------|------------|---------------|
|Storage Volume \[cmdb\_ci\_storage\_volume\]|Exports to::Imports from|Fibre Channel Disk \[cmdb\_ci\_fc\_disk\]|
|Storage Volume \[cmdb\_ci\_storage\_volume\]|Exports to::Imports from|iSCSI \[cmdb\_ci\_iscsi\_disk\]|

Discovery maps NAS file shares. It maps by resolving the hostname of a remote mounted disk on the client computer to an IP address. It then matches it to the IP address of the storage server that provides the exported file system. Discovery extracts the hostname or IP address from the NAS path to determine the identity of the storage server. If the hostname is an actual hostname, the system immediately resolves that value into an IP address. It also stores it in the **nas\_ip\_address** field of the NAS File System \[cmdb\_ci\_nas\_file\_system\] table.

Discovery creates the following relationships for storage CIs running on Network Attached Storage \(NAS\). These relationships are the same between Linux and Windows operating system hosts.

|Parent Component|Relationship|Child Component|
|----------------|------------|---------------|
|NAS File System \[cmdb\_ci\_nas\_file\_system\]|Allocated from::Allocated to|Storage File Share \[cmdb\_ci\_storage\_fileshare\]|
