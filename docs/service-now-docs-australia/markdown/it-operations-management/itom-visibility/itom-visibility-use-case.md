# ITOM Visibility and CMDB tables

ITOM Visibility manages and uses CMDB tables. Several ServiceNow products benefit from and add value to ITOM Visibility.

## Tables that ITOM Visibility manages

\[Omitted image "csdm-v5-tables-managed-by-itom-vis.png"\] Alt text: CSDM tables managed by ITOM Visibility.

-   **Mapped application service tables**

    The tables that ITOM Visibility manages depend on the method used to map the service instance \(the label for the table was formerly application service\) . You can use the Application Service wizard to populate an application service.

    -   Map the Service instance using top-down discovery of CI connections. This method requires Service Mapping, the sm\_admin role, and the current domain must be a leaf domain. This is the best option for accuracy and complete mapping. ITOM Visibility manages the Mapped Application Service table \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_discovered\]
    -   Map the service instance using a tag list or tag family. This method requires Service Mapping and is preferred for public or private cloud where tags are typically used. ITOM Visibility manages the tag-based maps table \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_by\_tags\].
    -   Manually map the service instance. This method requires that you select specific CIs — no automation is used. ITOM Visibility manages the service maps table \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_manual\].
    -   Use Dynamic Service to synchronize manually-created CI relationships to a Service Map view.
-   **Configuration items \(CIs\) tables \[cmdb\_ci\_\*\]**

    -   Application table \[cmdb\_ci\_appl\]
    -   Server table \[cmdb\_ci\_server\]
    -   Virtual machines table \[cmdb\_ci\_vm\_instance\]
    -   Load balancer table \[cmdb\_ci\_lb\]
    -   Network gear table \[cmdb\_ci\_netgear\]
