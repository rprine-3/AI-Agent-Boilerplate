# AI in ITOM Visibility

AI features in ITOM Visibility help administrators automate service maps, diagnose discovery issues, manage certificates, and resolve incidents using generative AI.

AI features in ITOM Visibility span several products. The following tables summarize all available AI features by type and product.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## MCP servers

MCP servers in ITOM Visibility expose instance data to external AI clients through the Model Context Protocol, giving those clients structured, ACL-enforced access to live CMDB and service data.

Service Mapping

</td><td>

Service Mapping MCP server

</td><td>

Exposes five read-only tools through the CMDB MCP Server. The tools give AI clients such as Claude structured access to live application service data, including full service topology, server impact graphs, and unmapped CIs. Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens and enforces the same ACLs as standard instance API calls.

</td><td>

A Service Mapping administrator or operator wants to query service topology, identify mapping gaps, or assess server impact. They do so by using natural language in an AI client, without navigating the instance UI.

</table>## Agentic workflows

Agentic workflows in ITOM Visibility use AI agents to complete investigation and management tasks autonomously or with minimal administrator input.

Discovery

</td><td>

Pattern diagnostic agentic workflow

</td><td>

Investigates missing CI attributes in pattern-based discovery. The workflow identifies the attribute gap, parses discovery logs, determines the root cause, and suggests a remediation — all from the ServiceNow Otto panel. Uses two agents: the Pattern diagnostic agent and the EF Remediation Agent.

</td><td>

A discovery administrator notices that a CI attribute is missing and wants to identify the root cause and a fix without manually navigating discovery logs and tables.

Firewall Audits and Reporting

</td><td>

Firewall Management Task Creation agentic workflow

</td><td>

Uses AI to accept natural-language firewall rule requests, extract required parameters, run a risk analysis, and create a rule task. The risk level determines whether the task is created automatically or requires confirmation.

</td><td>

A firewall administrator wants to request a new firewall rule by describing it in plain language rather than filling out a form manually.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service Mapping

</td><td>

Analyze potential impact agentic workflow

</td><td>

Analyzes how a change request might affect relevant servers and services. The agent verifies prerequisites, retrieves the change request, selects up to 10 affected servers, identifies matches with suggested services, and displays an impact analysis in the ServiceNow Otto panel. The analysis is also saved to the change request work notes.

</td><td>

An operator or change manager wants to assess the risk of a change request before approving it, without manually reviewing all affected CIs.

LEAP

</td><td>

Ansible discovery agent

</td><td>

Analyzes automation opportunities and uses AI-powered semantic matching to identify relevant Ansible job templates from Ansible Automation Platform. Presents discovered templates to the LEAP administrator for step-to-job mapping.

</td><td>

A LEAP administrator wants to find the most relevant Ansible job templates for an automation opportunity without manually searching the Ansible catalog.

LEAP

</td><td>

Ansible execution agent

</td><td>

Automatically launches mapped Ansible job templates during incident remediation in the Service Operations Workspace. Reports execution status back to the incident responder.

</td><td>

An incident responder wants to trigger an Ansible automation directly from the Service Operations Workspace during active incident resolution, without switching to the Ansible platform.

</table>## AI agents

Standalone AI agents in ITOM Visibility run autonomously on a schedule or in response to a trigger, without requiring user input for each operation.

Service Mapping

</td><td>

Service Mapping AI Agent

</td><td>

Autonomously creates service maps from ML-powered Application Service Candidates \(ASCs\). The agent evaluates candidates, filters noise such as monitoring clients and operating system processes, and creates the service topology in the CMDB. Created service maps are set to non-operational by default for administrator review. Runs automatically every 15 minutes after activation.

</td><td>

A Service Mapping administrator wants to process a large volume of ML-powered candidates and create service maps automatically, without reviewing each candidate individually.

Business App Mapping AI Agent

</td><td>

Automatically creates CSDM "Uses::Used by" relationships between Business Applications and discovered Application Services using AI semantic search. High-confidence matches are connected automatically. Medium-confidence matches are saved to a staging table for administrator review.

</td><td>

A Service Mapping administrator wants to connect discovered application services to their business application context in the CSDM without manually mapping each relationship.

Certificate Inventory and Management

</td><td>

Certificate renewal AI agent

</td><td>

Uses AI to automatically renew a single TLS certificate through a conversational prompt. The agent guides the user through the renewal process and provides a link to the task record when complete.

</td><td>

A PKI administrator wants to renew a certificate without manually navigating the renewal workflow.

LEAP

</td><td>

LEAP AI agent

</td><td>

Uses automation opportunities created by LEAP analysis to generate artifacts — problem records, AI-enhanced knowledge base articles, or playbooks — based on user requests. The agent is turned on by default.

</td><td>

A LEAP administrator wants to convert a recurring incident pattern into a problem record, a structured knowledge base article, or a playbook without manually authoring each artifact.
