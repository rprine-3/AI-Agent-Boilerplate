# Discovery of storage area networks \(SAN\)

Discovery collects information about storage area networks from specialized devices, such as storage arrays and Fibre Channel \(FC\) switches. It creates specific references between the tables in the SAN schema.

## ServiceNow SAN schema

This diagram shows the tables in the SAN schema and the default references defined between them.

## Multipath SAN storage example

This diagram shows the relationship of SAN storage volumes to a host computer.Storage accessible to the Linux host consists of two physical fibre channel \(FC\) disks, mpatha and mpathb, connected to the host via a multipath FC SAN. The two HBAs on the host interface are connected with two fibre cables each to separate FC switches for failover capability. The FC fabric switches are connected to two FC storage processors on the storage server. In this example, each storage processor is connected to the storage volume's, **LUN 1** and **LUN 2**.
