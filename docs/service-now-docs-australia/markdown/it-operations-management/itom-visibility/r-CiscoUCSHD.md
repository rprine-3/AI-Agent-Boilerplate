# Cisco Unified Computing System \(UCS\)-HD device discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application uses the to find Cisco UCS equipment, including chassis and blades. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

**Note:** For information on Probe to Pattern migration see the knowledge article [KB0694477](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0694477).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Create SNMP credentials**

    For more information, see [SNMP credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_SNMPCredentials.md).

-   **Create applicative credentials**

    Create applicative credentials for the **Cisco UCS Equipment \[cmdb\_ci\_ucs\_equipment\]** CI type. For more information, see [Applicative credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/applicative-creds.md).

-   **Verify network connectivity**

    Verify that the MID Server has HTTPS access to the UCS Manager on port 443 and is able to reach the management IP address of the UCS equipment.

-   **Verify UCS Manager account requirements**

    Verify that the account has at least the **read-only** role in UCS Manager and has permissions to execute XML API queries for the following object classes:

    -   `computeRackUnit`
    -   `equipmentChassis`
    -   `computeBlade`
    -   `mgmtIf`
    -   `topSystem`
    -   `versionEp`
    -   `equipmentFan`
-   **Classifier, pattern, and OIDs**

    The UCS classifier uses HorzontalDiscoveryProbe to launch the UCS - HD pattern. The classifier also uses these SNMP OIDs, which specify the Cisco UCS Equipment `[cmdb_ci_ucs_equipment]` table:

    |OID|Manufacturer|Model|Table|
    |---|------------|-----|-----|
    |1.3.6.1.4.1.9.12.3.1.3.847|Unified Computing Cisco UCS 6120XP 20-Port Fabric Interconnect|1.4\(3u\)\(NX-OS\) 5.0 Aggregation Switch|Cisco UCS Equipment|

    |1.3.6.1.4.1.9.12.3.1.3.1062|Unified Computing Cisco UCS 6248UP 48-Port Fabric Interconnect|2.0\(1t\)\(NX-OS\) 5.0.2 Aggregation Switch|Cisco UCS Equipment|
    |1.3.6.1.4.1.9.12.3.1.3.1063|Unified Computing Cisco UCS 6296UP 96-Port Fabric Interconnect|2.0\(1t\)\(NX-OS\) 5.0.2 Aggregation Switch|Cisco UCS Equipment|


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the UCS - HD pattern pattern. Only B-series devices are discovered. The UCS - HD pattern does not find C, S, or E series devices.
