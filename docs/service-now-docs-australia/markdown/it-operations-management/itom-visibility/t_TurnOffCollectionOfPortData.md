# Turn off collection of port data for SNMP network devices

In some environments you may not want to collect the port data for SNMP network devices.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Network devices can contain an extremely large number of ports. If individual port information is not critical to overall device management, you may not want to collect port data for SNMP network devices. This would affect records from being created in the Switchports table \(dscy\_switchport\). This process only impacts probe discovery.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Probes**.

2.  Go to the **SNMP - Switching** probe.

3.  In the **SNMP Fields** tab, find the field named **ports**, double-click the value in the **Active** column, and change the value to **false**.

    The collection and processing of ports information for switches is then disabled. The **ports** field for the switch CI should have the correct ports count even though the related list **switchports** is empty.

4.  Click the check mark to save the change.
