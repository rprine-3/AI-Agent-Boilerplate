# TCP connection discovery

Discovery identifies and classifies information about TCP connections using the ADM and ADME probes.

Discovery populates this data in the TCP Connections \[cmdb\_tcp\] table.

## Standard ADM probes

Discovery launches these probes with standard ADM discovery:

Includes these sub-probes

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

AIX - ADM

</td><td>

Queries for information about active \(running\) AIX processes and active connections - the information required to perform application dependency mapping.

</td><td>

-   AIX - Active Connections
-   AIX - Active Processes

</td></tr><tr><td>

HP-UX - ADM

</td><td>

Queries for information about active \(running\) HP-UX processes and active connections - the information required to perform application dependency mapping.This probe requires that lsof be installed and the UNIX - Active Connections probe be activated, which is inactive by default.

</td><td>

-   UNIX - Active Connections
-   HP-UX - Active Processes

</td></tr><tr><td>

Solaris - ADM

</td><td>

Queries for information about active \(running\) Solaris processes and active connections - the information required to perform application dependency mapping. This probe is triggered by the Solaris Zones probe. The system triggers an ADM probe for each local zone contained in a global zone.This probe requires that lsof be installed on the global zone.

</td><td>

-   Solaris - Active Processes
-   Solaris - Active Connections

</td></tr><tr><td>

UNIX - ADM

</td><td>

Queries for information about active \(running\) UNIX processes and active connections - the information required to perform application dependency mapping.

</td><td>

-   UNIX - Active Connections
-   UNIX - Active Processes

</td></tr><tr><td>

Windows - ADM

</td><td>

Queries for information about active \(running\) Windows processes and active connections - the information required to perform application dependency mapping.

</td><td>

-   Windows - Active Connections
-   Windows - Active Processes

</td></tr><tr><td>

UNIX - ADM netstat

</td><td>

Performs the same functions as the UNIX ADM probe relying on netstat to support continuous TCP-based discovery. Service Mapping uses this probe for traffic-based discovery.

</td><td>

-   UNIX - Active Connections with Netstat. This probe retrieves TCP connections to populate the cmdb\_tcp and cmdb\_tcp\_connection tables.
-   UNIX - Active Processes. This probe retrieves TCP processes and populates the cmdb\_running\_process table.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Enhanced ADM probes

Discovery launches these probes when enhanced ADM is activated:

|Probe|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Windows - ADM Enhanced|Performs the same functions as the Windows ADM probe with additional parameters to control continuous TCP-based discovery. This probe is compatible with WinRM and non-WinRM supported MID Servers. Configure your MID Server using the `mid.windows.management_protocol` parameter. See [MID Server parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-parameters.md) for the values you can use for this parameter.|
|UNIX - ADM Enhanced|Performs the same functions as the UNIX ADM probe with additional parameters to control continuous TCP-based discovery.|

Use these probe parameters with the enhanced ADM probes:
