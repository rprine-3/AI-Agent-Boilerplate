# Exchange MailBox discovery

Discovery creates or updates a CMDB record when it detects a running instance of Exchange Mailbox.

**Note:** For information on Probe to Pattern migration see the knowledge article [KB0694477](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0694477).

## Prerequisites

The `Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell` module must be installed on the server that you want to discover.

The service `winRM` must be running on the host machine. Run the following command in the Powershell window to verify: `New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri "http://$hostname/PowerShell/" -Authentication Kerberos`

## Pattern

By default, Discovery uses the **MailBox On Windows** pattern to discover Exchange MailBox.

## Credentials

Configure these credentials:

</td><td>

The user must be able to run Powershell commands against the Exchange hosts. Use **Exchange Mailbox** as the CI type for the applicative credential.

**Important:** Do not use the **Exchange Mailbox server** CI type.
