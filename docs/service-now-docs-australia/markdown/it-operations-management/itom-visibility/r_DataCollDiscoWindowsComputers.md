# Windows discovery

Discovery identifies and classifies information about Windows computers that use IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, or both.

**Note:** For information on Probe to Pattern migration see the knowledge article [KB0694477](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0694477).

**Note:** admin$ share access is required for Windows discovery from Madrid P3 and later. A Remote Access role must be configured in the target Windows Server to enable connectivity with ServiceNow Discovery.

## Supported Windows versions

For IPv4 discovery:

-   Windows Workstation 7, 8, 10
-   Windows Server versions:
    -   2008
    -   2008R2
    -   2012R2
    -   2016
    -   2019
    -   2022
    -   2025

For IPv6 discovery:

-   Windows 2019 \(10.0.17763\)
-   Windows Server 2016
-   Windows Desktop 10
-   Windows 2019 Datacenter

**Note:** For fiber channel discovery on a Windows 2008 host, the Microsoft Fibre Channel Information Tool \(`fcinfo.exe`\) must be installed on that machine. The `fcinfo` executable should be available on the environment path. The Microsoft Fibre Channel Information Tool tool is available for download at [http://www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com).

## IPv6 supportability limitations

The following device types haven’t been verified for IPv6 discovery:

-   Printers
-   Network Storage \(NFS, CIFS, NAS, FC, ISCSI\)
-   Azure virtual machines \(IPv6 native mode isn’t supported by Microsoft\)

## Requirements

-   **Verify PowerShell support**

    ServiceNow now supports PowerShell 3.0 up to 5.1.

-   **Configure Windows credentials**

    For more information, see [Windows credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_WindowsCredentialsForm.md).

-   **Verify user access**

    Verify that the user configured for the credential has the following permissions:

    -   Local admin access to the Windows machine.
    -   Access to the WMI service to the current namespace and subnamespaces.
    -   Access to the PowerShell service.
    -   Membership in the Distributed COM Users local security group.
-   **\(Optional\) Populate Virtual Machine Object field in Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] table**

    Starting with Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns version 1.30.2, you can improve query performance by populating the Virtual Machine Object field in the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] table. For more information, see [Improved query performance with direct field population in CI tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/query-service-account-ldc-fields.md).

-   **Set the preferred IP address version for network adapter discovery**

    Starting with Visibility Content version 6.32.0, if your network adapters support both IPv4 and IPv6, the IPv4 address is populated by default in the IP address \[ip\_address\] field on the Network Adapter \[cmdb\_ci\_network\_adapter\] table. To control which IP version is populated, see [Set the preferred IP version for network adapter discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/set-network-adapter-preferred-ip.md).

</table>\*These probes aren't active on the classifier, as Discovery uses patterns by default for these discoveries.

^These probes remain active by default, even when Discovery uses pattern discovery.

To use patterns, verify that the correct pattern is specified in the horizontal pattern probe on the classifier. See [Add the Horizontal Pattern probe to a classifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c-UsingPatternsForHorizontalDiscovery.md) for instructions.

\* Core counts and threads per core might not be accurate, due to issues with Microsoft reporting.

\*\* The value in the **disk\_space** field is an aggregation of the total capacity \(to include used space\) for all non-removable disks, including both directly attached and SAN storage.

\*\*\* Starting with Visibility Content version 6.32.0, for network adapters that support both IPv4 and IPv6, the IPv4 address is populated by default. Before this release, the populated value was selected randomly. To control which IP version is populated, see [Set the preferred IP version for network adapter discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/set-network-adapter-preferred-ip.md).

## The Windows registry

Discovery can find software that has been installed on a Windows machine by looking at the Windows Registry. Discovery can find the following attributes of discovered software:

-   **Product Name**: Combination of name and version, such as Windows Imaging Component 3.0.
-   **Name**: Name of the product only without the version.
-   **Version**: Version of the product.
-   **Uninstall String**: Path to the uninstaller, such as `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\uninstall.exe`.
-   **Part of**: Update for which this registry is a part, such as Windows Internet Explorer 8 - Software U.
-   **Install Date**: The date the software was installed. The Windows - Installed Software sensor appends a timestamp of 00:00:00 to the install\_date retrieved from the registry. The installation time of all Windows software is independent of the time zone and is set to midnight of the day it was installed. For example, an install date of **2.19.2017** in the Windows registry appears as **2.19.2017 00:00:00** in the CMDB.
-   **Installed on**: The name of the asset on which the software is installed.
