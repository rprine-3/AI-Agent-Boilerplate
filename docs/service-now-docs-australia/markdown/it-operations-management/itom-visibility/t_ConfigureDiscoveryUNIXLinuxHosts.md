# Configure Discovery for UNIX or Linux hosts with attached storage

Discovery can find information about a UNIX or Linux host and attached storage.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin

## Procedure

1.  On the host, assign elevated privileges to the account that Discovery will use.

2.  On the ServiceNow instance, [add credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_CreateCredential.md) to the Discovery Credentials table.

3.  Create a Discovery Schedule for each host IP address.

4.  Create a behavior that uses a functionality definition with a wbem port probe to make the initial port-scanning phase \(Shazzam\) more efficient.

5.  Run network discovery.

    **Note:** If the host also connects to a NAS or SAN storage array, set up the [SMI-S Provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/t_ConfigDiscoForStandaloneStorage.md) and [CIM credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_CIMCredentialsForm.md).
