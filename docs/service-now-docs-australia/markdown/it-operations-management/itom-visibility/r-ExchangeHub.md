# Exchange Hub Transport Servers discovery

Discovery creates or updates a CMDB record when it detects a running instance of Exchange Hub.

By default, Discovery uses the Hub Transport Server On Windows pattern to discover Exchange Hub Transport Servers.

**Note:** For information on Probe to Pattern migration see the knowledge article [KB0694477](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0694477).

## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

Discovery populates the data in the CMDB when running the Hub Transport Server On Windows pattern.
