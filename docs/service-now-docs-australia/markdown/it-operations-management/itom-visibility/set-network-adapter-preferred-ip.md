# Set the preferred IP version for network adapter discovery

Control which IP version Discovery populates on a Network Adapter CI during Linux, Windows, and Solaris discovery.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have at least version 6.32.0 of Visibility Content.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

When a network adapter supports both IPv4 and IPv6, Discovery populates the IP Address \[ip\_address\] field on the Network Adapter \[cmdb\_ci\_network\_adapter\] CI with one IP address. Before Visibility Content version 6.32.0, Discovery selected the value randomly. Starting from this release, IPv4 is populated by default. Use the **network\_adaptor\_preferred\_ip\_version** MID Server property to specify which IP version to populate.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **MID Server** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  In the **Name** column, search for `network_adaptor_preferred_ip_version`.

3.  Select the **network\_adaptor\_preferred\_ip\_version** property.

4.  In the **Value** field, enter the accepted value for the IP version to populate.

    Values are case-sensitive. Use only the accepted values listed in the table.

    |IP version|Accepted values|
    |----------|---------------|
    |IPv4|ipv4, IPv4, or v4.|
    |IPv6|ipv6, IPv6, or v6.|

5.  Select **Update**.


## What to do next

Run discovery again or wait for the scheduled run to apply the changes.
