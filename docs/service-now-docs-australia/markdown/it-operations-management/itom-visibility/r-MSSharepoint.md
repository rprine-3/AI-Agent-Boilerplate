# Microsoft SharePoint discovery

Discovery creates or updates a CMDB record when it detects a running instance of Microsoft SharePoint.

For information on supported Microsoft SharePoint versions, see [Detailed information on products discovered by ITOM Visibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/r_SupportedApplications.md).
