# IBM App Connect Enterprise and HTTP listener discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application uses the WMB patterns to discover Integration Bus \(formerly WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus\) and HTTP listeners running on both Linux and Windows. Discovering some of these resources might require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request new or enhanced Patterns on the ServiceNow® Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/06a71b1367e4130051c9027e2685ef1e/1.6.0?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%26q%3DPatterns&sl=sh) to view all the available updates and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

By default, Discovery uses the following patterns to perform the discovery:

-   WMB On UNIX
-   WMB On Windows
-   WMB HTTP Listener On UNIX
-   WMB HTTP Listener On Windows

For a list of privileged commands that you need for Discovery and Service Mapping, see [Service Mapping commands requiring a privileged user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/r_CommandsnCredentials.md). This list includes commands that require elevated rights to discover and map Unix-based hosts in your organization.

**Note:** For information on Probe to Pattern migration see the knowledge article [KB0694477](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0694477).

To learn about IBM WebSphere Message Broker \(WMB\) and WMB HTTP Listener components and versions that you can discover, see [Detailed information on products discovered by ITOM Visibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/r_SupportedApplications.md).
