# F5 BIG-IP load balancer discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping can find F5 BIG-IP load balancers via SNMP, SSH, and through the REST API.

**Note:** For information on Probe to Pattern migration see the knowledge article [KB0694477](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0694477).

**Important:** Discovery treats load balancers as licensable entities and attempts to discover them primarily using SNMP. If a load balancer in your system, running on a Linux host, has SNMP and SSH ports open, Discovery might classify it based on the SSH port. This classification has priority over SNMP. To ensure that Discovery properly classifies your hardware load balancers, create a Discovery behavior for load balancers that includes SNMP but not SSH. Software load balancers are treated as applications.

You can download VMware images of BIG-IP with a free 90-day trial from [https://www.f5.com/trial](https://www.f5.com/trial).

For F5 Global Traffic Manager \(GTM\) BIG-IP load balancers, Discovery resolves DNS names for the F5 GTM hardware and all associated servers that receive distributed traffic. To view this data, navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Load Balancers** &gt; **LB Hardware**, open the F5 load balancer record, and select the **DNS Names for CIs** related list. [Service Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/c_ServiceMappingOverview.md) uses this information to map F5 relationships.

**Note:** If your F5 BIG-IP device is part of a failover cluster, it can be associated with two cluster nodes. In this case, one of the nodes appears as Operational in the **Operational Status** field, and the other appears as Non-Operational.

## Prerequisites

-   Verify that the following applications are up to date:
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
    -   Visibility Content
    -   CMDB CI Class Models
-   To successfully discover the load balancer pool members, set the **display service names** option \(**bigpipe.displayservicenames**\) of the load balancer to **false** on the F5 load balancer.
-   For F5 Load Balancer pattern:
    -   Configure [SNMP credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_SNMPCredentials.md) on the ServiceNow AI Platform.
    -   \(Optional\) If there are iRules or SNMP community credentials aren't enough for discovering outgoing connections, configure [SSH credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).

        **Note:** If you don't want to use SSH credentials, you can use the REST API to create a connection to F5 BIG-IP devices.

        Service Mapping uses the SSH credentials to retrieve connections that aren't from CMDB. Discovering connections using the SSH protocol is a failover mechanism for the SNMP-based discovery.

-   For F5 Load Balancer SSH pattern:
    -   Configure [SSH credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/r_SSHCredentialsForm.md).
    -   Verify permissions for the following SSH commands. In newer versions of F5 BIG-IP, only A-type GTM pools are supported.
        -   `list auth partition all`
        -   `list sys global-settings`
        -   `show sys hardware`
        -   `list sys db failover.state`
        -   `list net self one-line`
        -   `show sys mac-address | grep interface`
        -   `show net interface field-fmt`
        -   `show net self | grep -e 'Mac Address' 'IP:'`
        -   `list ltm pool | grep -e 'pool' 'mode'`
        -   `list ltm pool /<partition_name>/* | grep -e 'pool' 'mode'`
        -   `show ltm pool | grep -e 'Ltm::' 'Total Connections'`
        -   `show ltm pool /<partition_name>/* |grep -e 'Ltm::' 'Total Connections'`
        -   `list sys db bigpipe.displayservicenames | grep value`
        -   `show /net vlan | grep -e 'Interface Name' 'Mac' 'Tag'`
        -   `show ltm virtual detail | grep -e 'Server:' 'State' 'Pool:' 'Destination' 'Total Connections'`
        -   `show ltm virtual detail /<partition_name>/* | grep -e 'Server:' 'State' 'Pool:' 'Destination' 'Total Connections'`
        -   `show gtm wideip | grep -e 'WideIp' 'State'`
        -   `list wideip a /<partition_name>/* | grep -e 'WideIp' 'State'`
        -   `show gtm wideip all | grep -e 'WideIp' 'State'`
        -   `list gtm wideip`
        -   `list gtm wideip all`
        -   `list gtm pool one-line`
        -   `list gtm pool a one-line`
        -   `list gtm pool /<partition_name>/* one-line`
        -   `list gtm pool a /<partition_name>/* one-line`
        -   `list gtm server one-line`

## F5 cluster discovery

The horizontal discovery process can find F5 clusters. To discover clusters, the credentials must have read permission to traffic groups. For SNMP, this is the regular read permission. For SSH, you need to have **Traffic Management Shell \(TMSH shell\)** enabled and accessible.

**Note:** Because F5 clusters share the same virtual IPs and addresses for all devices, the horizontal discovery process cannot find specific IP addresses for each device.

## Classifier, patterns, and probes

Discovery uses these classifiers, probes, and pattern for F5 discovery:

F5 BIG-IP Load Balancer

Horizontal discovery probe: launches patterns

</td><td>

These patterns are used for standard horizontal discovery including identifying clusters:

-   F5 Load Balancer
-   F5 Load Balancer SSH
-   F5REST
-   F5 REST OAuth 2.0 authentication

 **Note:** The F5 Load Balancer and F5 Load Balancer SSH patterns include the extension section that discovers [F5 certificates.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/f5-certificate-discovery.md)

</td></tr><tr><td>

F5 HTTP

</td><td>

The F5 HTTP classifier does not use a trigger probe. It triggers the F5 Load Balancer REST pattern to perform data collection via REST.

</td><td>

These patterns use iRules to get information via REST. Service Mapping uses these patterns for top-down discovery:

-   F5 Load Balancer REST
-   F5 BigIP GTM
-   F5 BigIP LTM

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>To use patterns, verify that the correct pattern is specified in the horizontal pattern probe on the classifier. See [Add the Horizontal Pattern probe to a classifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c-UsingPatternsForHorizontalDiscovery.md) for instructions.

## Connections discovered by Service Mapping during the top-down discovery

Service Mapping performs the top-down discovery of the GTM BIG-IP load balancer in the context of application services. It discovers configured URLs of the GTM BIG-IP load balancers.
