Line graph

</td><td>

The compression rate from events to alert creation. The higher the number, the fewer alerts are being created.

Line graph

</td><td>

The percentage of alerts aggregated into grouped alerts over time.

</table>## Most impacted Configuration Items

The Most Impacted Configuration Items section of the Event and Alert dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the configuration items \(CIs\) that are most impacted by the issue. This section lists key details such as the name of each CI, the number of associated alerts, their classification \(such as application service\), and location. Additionally, it identifies the owner and support group responsible for each CI, facilitating targeted and efficient incident resolution. By highlighting the most impacted CIs, this section helps prioritize critical assets and resources. This ensures that the most significant issues are addressed promptly to maintain system stability and performance.
