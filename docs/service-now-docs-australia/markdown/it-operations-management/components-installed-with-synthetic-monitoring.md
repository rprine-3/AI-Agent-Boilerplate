Table

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Check

 \[sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\]

</td><td>

Configuration information for synthetic checks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Check Execution Location

 \[sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\_execution\_location\]

</td><td>

Execution location configuration for synthetic checks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Single API

 \[sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\_single\_api\]

</td><td>

Additional configuration information and last run results for single API synthetic checks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Single API Header

 \[sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\_single\_api\_header\]

</td><td>

Key value pairs of requests headers for single API synthetic checks.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Single API to Policy

 \[sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\_single\_api\_policy\]

</td><td>

Single API synthetic test data and its corresponding Agent Client Collector \(ACC\) policies.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Single API Result

 \[sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\_single\_api\_result\]

</td><td>

Results from each synthetic check run.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_sow\_synthetics\_recommendation\_state

</td><td>

Per-endpoint creation state, idempotency\_key, error tracking

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_sow\_synthetics\_recommendation\_telemetry

</td><td>

Aggregate workflow metrics: card\_shown, endpoints\_discovered, monitors\_created, workflow\_status

</td></tr><tr><td>

Synthetic Private Locations

 \[sn\_sow\_synthetics\_private\_location\]

</td><td>

Definitions of the ACC Agent Proxy Clusters available for synthetic monitoring. Extends the Proxy Agent Cluster \[sn\_agent\_cluster\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_sow\_synthetics\_bulk\_job

</td><td>

Provides async bulk job tracking.

</td></tr><tr><td>

`sn_sow_synthetics_location`

</td><td>

Stores the top-level execution locations used to run synthetic monitors. Each location represents a network vantage point and can be one of the following:-   Hosted
-   Mid Server
-   ACC location

</td></tr><tr><td>

`sn_sow_synthetics_mid_location`

</td><td>

Represents a logical grouping of one or more MID Servers that act as a named execution location for synthetic monitors. This record provides the name and description for a Mid Server-based location. The actual MID Server assignments are stored in \`sn\_sow\_synthetics\_mid\_location\_member\`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

`sn_sow_synthetics_mid_location_member`

</td><td>

Stores the actual Mid Server assignments are saved in this table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

`sn_sow_synthetics_check_single_api_sysauto_script`

</td><td>

Extends the platform \`sysauto\_script\` \(Scheduled Script Execution\) table to associate a scheduled background job with a specific Single API check. Each record represents the scheduled job responsible for periodically triggering a synthetic monitor run for its linked check. Records are automatically created, updated, and deleted by the application when a check's location or configuration changes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\_alert

</td><td>

A join table that links a synthetic check to an Event Management alert. When a synthetic monitor detects a failure, the platform creates a record here to track the relationship between the failing check and the alert it generated. Records are cascade-deleted when either the check or the alert is removed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_sow\_synthetics\_check\_single\_api\_policy

</td><td>

A joint table that maps a Single API check to its associated ACC agent policy. This relationship is used when a check runs via an ACC Proxy Cluster location and the policy governs what the ACC agent is authorized to execute. Records are cascade-deleted when the linked check is removed, and the application automatically manages this table when ACC-based checks are created or updated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_sow\_synthetics\_bulk\_job\_governance

</td><td>

Defines governance metadata for rate limiting and auditing for bulk jobs.
