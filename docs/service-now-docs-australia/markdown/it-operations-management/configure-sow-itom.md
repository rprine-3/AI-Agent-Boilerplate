# Configuring Service Operations Workspace for ITOM

Configure Service Operations Workspace for ITOM so that you can manage IT alert volumes efficiently and customize the workspace to enhance service delivery and operational visibility.

The Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) for ITOM is a centralized hub designed to optimize IT Operations Management by focusing on the handling and resolution of alerts. By leveraging this workspace, administrators can streamline the process of monitoring, triaging, and resolving alerts, thus enhancing service delivery and operational efficiency.

**Note:** Installing the AIOps Experience application \[sn\_sow\_aiops\] provides you with Service Operations Workspace for ITOM.

If you want information regarding subscriptions for ITOM SOW, check the ITOM AIOps subscription at [Subscription for ITOM Health](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-license-module.md).

When setting up the Service Operations Workspace, it's crucial to configure both IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) for managing alerts and IT Service Management \(ITSM\) for resolving incidents and delivering services. This integrated setup ensures access to the full range of features, facilitating comprehensive management of IT operations and service quality.
