# Automated certificate management for TLS certificates

From Certificate Inventory and Management version 1.3.8, you can automate the request flow for new certificates, renewals, and revoking certificates.

Certificate Inventory and Management automatically fetches certificates from Certificate Authorities \(CAs\) without requiring manual intervention from the PKI team. Starting in Version 2.1.0, this feature supports DigiCert and Entrust CA Gateway for seamless automatic fulfillment flows, with the limitation that only OV DigiCert certificates can be requested. Version 2.3.2 introduces support for the Microsoft CA. For automated flows with DigiCert or Entrust CA Gateway in Certificate Inventory and Management, you must have permissions to request, renew, and revoke certificates.

For provider-specific requirements, see the following documentation:

-   Microsoft CA: For information about configuring and administering a Microsoft certification authority, go to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/) and search for the "Active Directory Certificate Services documentation" article.
-   DigiCert: For information about API access and certificate order management, go to the [DigiCert developer portal](https://dev.digicert.com/) and search for the "CertCentral APIs" documentation.
-   Entrust: Refer to your Entrust CA Gateway documentation.

The Microsoft CA user requires the following permissions:
