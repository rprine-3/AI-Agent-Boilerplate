# Attest or reject certificate ownership via Email

Attest or reject ownership of a certificate from your certification attestation email notification.

## Before you begin

-   Verify that your system is configured to send certificate attestation notifications. For more information, see [Configure certificate attestation reviews](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/configure-certificate-attestation.md)
-   Role required: pki\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Select **Review CIs** in your email notification.

2.  Select each certificate by selecting the check box next to it.

3.  Select **Attest**.

4.  Select all certificates you want to reject.

5.  Select **Reject**

6.  In the text box that appears, explain why you are rejecting the certificate.

7.  Select **Submit**.

8.  In the Submit Attestation confirmation window, select **Submit**.


## Result

For the certificates that you attest ownership, you receive further notifications at monthly intervals, unless otherwise configured. For the certificates that you reject ownership, you no longer receive certificate attestation notifications.
