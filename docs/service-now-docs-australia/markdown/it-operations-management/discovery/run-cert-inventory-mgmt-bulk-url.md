# Use bulk certificate upload

In Certificate Inventory and Management version 1.2.0 and later, you can import up to 5000 SSL certificates in bulk using a single .xlsx file.

## Before you begin

Role required: pki\_user or pki\_admin

The default admin is assigned both the pki\_user and pki\_admin roles. The users with the following roles have access to bulk certificate upload.

-   sn\_disco\_certmgmt.pki\_user
-   sn\_disco\_certmgmt.pki\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Certificate Management** &gt; **Bulk Upload Certificates**.

2.  From the Bulk Upload page, select **Download Template File** \(.xlsx\) link to download the `sample_cmdb_ci_certificate.xlsx` file.

3.  Open the downloaded `sample_cmdb_ci_certificate.xlsx` file.

4.  Refer to the sample values in the columns as a guide, and add the SSL certificate's properties into the corresponding columns.

    Each entry in the Excel sheet corresponds to a CI certificate. Ensure the following mandatory columns are filled in.

    -   root\_issuer
    -   issuer
    -   subject\_common\_name
    -   issuer\_common\_name
    -   fingerprint
    -   issuer\_distinguished\_name
    -   subject\_distinguished\_name
    -   fingerprint\_algorithm
    -   valid\_to: Cannot be less than valid\_fom. By milliseconds. For example, 1586789478000 represents 13 April 2020 14:51:18
    -   valid\_from: By milliseconds. For example, 1586789478000 represents 13 April 2020 14:51:18
    -   signature\_algorithm
    -   key\_size
    -   state: issued, installed, revoked, retired, or other
    **Note:** For maintaining the certificate’s chain relationship, every certificate must have the fingerprint of its root certificate in the **root\_issuer** column and the fingerprint of its issuer in the **issuer** column. For self-signed certificates, both **root\_issuer** and **issuer** must have the value of the certificate's fingerprint.

5.  Save the `sample_cmdb_ci_certificate.xlsx` file.

6.  Navigate to **Certificate Management** &gt; **Bulk Upload Certificates**.

7.  Select **Browse File** and choose the complete `sample_cmdb_ci_certificate.xlsx` file.

8.  Select **Upload**.


## Result

If any errors occur while uploading, a warning message and link to the error logs appears. Only users with the admin role can view these logs. Errors can occur when a mandatory field is left empty or a valid\_from epoch value is greater than that of valid\_to.

After the file is successfully uploaded, you can see a success message displayed with a **View All** redirect link. You can view a list of the certificates that were added to the Unique Certificate \[cmdb\_ci\_certificate\] table.
