# Configuring Kubernetes Visibility Agent

Set up Kubernetes Visibility Agent by performing the described procedures.

For information about advanced configuration options, see the [Administrating and Troubleshooting Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(formerly CNO for Visibility\) \[KB1532614\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1532614) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   **[Prepare for Kubernetes Visibility Agent deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/cnov-deploy-prepare.md)**  
Prepare your ServiceNow instance and the Kubernetes cluster for Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) deployment.
-   **[Install Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) Informer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/cnov-deploy-install.md)**  
You can install Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer using either a Helm chart or the Kubernetes YAML file.
-   **[Enabling container image scanning with Syft scanner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/enabling-software-decomposition-tool.md)**  
Container image scanning with Syft scanner provides visibility into software packages within container images, helping you identify installed software for compliance, licensing, and security purposes without requiring a MID Server.
-   **[Enabling application service maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/enabling-application-service-maps.md)**  
Application service maps give you visibility into how workloads communicate in a Kubernetes cluster, helping you detect dependencies and monitor traffic flows in real time.
-   **[Pulling additional resources from Kubernetes clusters into the CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/cnov-config-pulling-extra-resources.md)**  
You can configure the Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer to pull extra resources from Kubernetes clusters into the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\), in addition to the resources it sends to the database by default. By pulling in additional resources beyond the default set, you can enhance visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.
-   **[Upgrade Kubernetes Visibility Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/acckv-upgrade.md)**  
You can upgrade Kubernetes Visibility Agent using either a Helm chart or the Kubernetes YAML file.
