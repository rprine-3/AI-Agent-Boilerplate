# Discover root certificates hosted outside servers

Collect information about root certificates stored outside your server. Create a specialized Discovery schedule.

## About this task

To discover root certificates stored outside your server, create a special Discovery schedule to target them.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Discovery Schedules**.

2.  From the Discovery Schedule page, select **New**.

3.  On the Discovery Schedule form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Discovery schedule form table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-schedule-form-table.md).

4.  Save this record by selecting **Update**.

5.  Select the **Serverless Execution Patterns** tab.

6.  Create a Serverless Execution Pattern.

    1.  Select **New**.

    2.  In the New Record page, select the search icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-search-sow.png"\] Alt text: Search icon\) in the **Pattern** field.
