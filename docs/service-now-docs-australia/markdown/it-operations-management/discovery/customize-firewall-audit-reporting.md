# Customize Firewall Audits and Reporting

Change Discovery properties to customize some of the aspects of Firewall Audits and Reporting.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin or admin

## About this task

[Discovery properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_DiscoveryProperties.md) manage various aspects of the horizontal discovery process. This procedure explains how to assign default policy owner group and approval group names for approving firewall rule tasks.

## Procedure

1.  To edit [Discovery properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_DiscoveryProperties.md), navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Properties**.

    For more information on properties, see [Discovery properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_DiscoveryProperties.md).

    -   sn\_disco\_firewall.default.rule.task.policy.owner.group: Your default task owner group name
    -   sn\_disco\_firewall.default.rule.task.approval.group: Your default approval group name
2.  Edit the properties as required.

    -   sn\_disco\_firewall.default.rule.task.policy.owner.group: Your default task owner group name
    -   sn\_disco\_firewall.default.rule.task.approval.group: Your default approval group name
    These feature saves time by automatically filling in your default owner group and approval group in requests.
