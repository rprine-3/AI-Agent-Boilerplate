# Deactivate continuous discovery in Kubernetes Visibility Agent

Switch off continuous discovery by Kubernetes Visibility Agent if all you need is periodic snapshots of your cluster resources. If you have multiple clusters with frequent changes, deactivating continuous discovery reduces the load on your instance.

## Before you begin

## Procedure

1.  Do one of the following:

    -   When using a Helm chart, in the Helm install command, add the following command line argument: `--set continuousDiscovery=false`

    -   When using the k8s\_informer.yaml, enter the value “false” in the line under CONTINUOUS\_DISCOVERY.
