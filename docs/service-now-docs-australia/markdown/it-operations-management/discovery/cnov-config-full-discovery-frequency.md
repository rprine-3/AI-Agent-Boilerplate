# Change the full discovery frequency in Kubernetes Visibility Agent

Customize how often you want the Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer to run a full discovery.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

By default, the Informer runs a full discovery every 24 hours \(1440 minutes\). You can change this frequency by performing the following procedure. For example, change the value to 2880 to make Kubernetes Visibility Agent run a full discovery every 48 hours \(2880 minutes\).

**Note:** When the auto-retirement feature is enabled, the system checks for inactive clusters during each full discovery cycle. Clusters with Informers in the Down state that have not been updated for the configured period are automatically retired. For more information, see [Enable automatic retirement for inactive Kubernetes cluster CIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/remove-inactive-cis.md).

## Procedure

1.  Do one of the following:

    -   When using a Helm chart: In the Helm install command, add the following command line argument:

        `--set fullDiscoveryMin=<Frequency in minutes>`

    -   When using the k8s\_informer.yaml: Replace the default value with the required one in the line under FULL\_DISCOVERY\_MIN.
