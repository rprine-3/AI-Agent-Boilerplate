# Discovery properties

Discovery properties allow you to control several aspects of the horizontal discovery process.

For information about the Discovery properties that Agent Client Collector uses, see [Using push-based and horizontal IP-based Discovery together](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/agent-client-collector/using-enhanced-discovery-and-agent-less-discovery-together.md).

Edit the following Discovery properties by navigating to **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Properties**.

**IP properties**

<table id="table_r25_f2l_hhb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

glide.discovery.exclude\_ip\_sync\_classes

</td><td>

Defines CI classes whose IP addresses shouldn’t be substituted if the address returned by Discovery doesn’t match one of the devices' NICs. Use a comma-separated list to define multiple classes. By default, the system uses the management IP of a load balancer returned by Discovery in the CI record, rather than substituting it for the IP address of one of the load balancer's NICs.-   Type: string
-   Default value: cmdb\_ci\_lb

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.discovery.enforce\_unique\_ips

</td><td>

Enforce unique IP addresses: Ignores the IP address after Discovery encounters subsequent devices that use the same IP address. Each time a computer, printer, or network device with a valid IP address is discovered, the IP address field is cleared on any other device sharing that address. If inactive, stores the IP address for each device.

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value false

</td></tr></tbody>

<table id="table_cgw_s2l_hhb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

glide.discovery.bgp\_router\_disable

</td><td>

BGP router exploration disable: Disables running the SNMP – Routing probe or pattern when discovering a router running the BGP protocol. This exploration is inactive by default because BGP routing tables are large. These routers typically operate at the edge of large networks, where further network discovery is not relevant. Set this value to false if your organization uses BGP routers as edge routers between relatively small networks. For example, between buildings on a single campus.

 If you must populate the \[discovery\_device\_neighbors\] table during horizontal layer 2 discovery of the bgp-enabled devices, set the **BGP router exploration disable** property to **No**. Notice that enabling this property can cause performance issues including out-of-memory issues on the MID Server.

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: true

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.discovery.debug.network\_discovery

</td><td>

Network discovery debugging: Enables extensive logging of all Network Discovery activities on the instance.

 -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: true

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.discovery.discoverable.network.max.netmask.bits

</td><td>

Maximum netmask size for discoverable networks \(bits\): The maximum number of bits in a regular netmask for networks that are discovered by Network Discovery. A regular netmask is a netmask that can be expressed in binary as a string of ones followed by a string of zeroes. For example, 255.255.255.0 is regular and 255.255.255.64 is irregular. Regular networks are commonly expressed like: 10.0.0.0/24, which means a network address of 10.0.0.0 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0. Larger bit numbers mean networks with smaller numbers of addresses in them. For example, the network 10.128.0.128/30 has four addresses in it: one network address \(10.128.0.128\), one broadcast address \(10.128.0.131\), and two usable addresses \(10.128.0.129 and 10.128.0.130\). Small networks are commonly configured in network gear to provide loopback addresses or networks used strictly by point-to-point connections. Since these sorts of networks generally don't need to be discovered by Network Discovery, it would be useful to filter them out. By setting this property to a value of 1 through 32, you can limit the sizes of regular networks that are discovered. Setting it to any other value causes all networks to be discovered. Irregular networks are always discovered. The default value is 28, which means that regular networks with 8 or fewer addresses cannot be discovered.

 -   Type: integer
-   Default value: 28

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.discovery.network\_owner\_method

</td><td>

Network router selection method: This property controls the method used to decide \(during Network Discovery\) which router should be selected as the router to be associated with a given IP Network. The possible values are:

 -   First Router: The first router that discovers the network is associated
-   Last Router: The last router that discovers the network is associated
-   Most Networks: The router with the most attached networks is associated
-   Least Networks: The router with the least attached networks is associated

 -   Type: choice list
-   Default value: Most Networks
-   Additional options: First Router, Last Router, Least Networks

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.discovery.physical\_interface\_types

</td><td>

Physical interface types: A comma-separated list of interface types that are considered physical for the purposes of network discovery. If a router \(or device capable of routing\) has an interface of this type, the networks connected to that interface are considered locally connected to that device. The default interface types include Ethernet, 802.11, and Token Ring types. Interface type numbers are defined in the SNMP MIB-2, specifically in OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.-   Type: string
-   Default value: 6,117,9,71,209

</td></tr><tr><td>

glide.discovery.switch\_interface\_types

</td><td>

Switch interface types: A comma-separated list of interface types that are considered. Interface type numbers are defined in the SNMP MIB-2, specifically in OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3. Devices with any interface types that do NOT appear in this list are classified as routers, when they have routing. A complete list of the interface type numbers may be found on the [IANA web site](http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers), in the section "ifType definitions".-   Type: string
-   Default value: 7,8,9,26,53,62,69,71,78,115,117,209
