# Firewall Admin Workspace dashboard

## Firewall Insights tab

The **Insights** tab offers a snapshot of firewall policies and associated devices, showcasing trends in policies without owners over time. Track new and unaudited policies, and view the distribution of device manufacturers and models within the network.
