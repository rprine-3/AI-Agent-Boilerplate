# Configure domain-separated Discovery schedules

Configuring the "Run as" user in a Discovery schedule directs discovered Configuration Items \(CIs\) to the correct domain and maintains data isolation.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

In domain-separated environments, the domain of the user who creates a Discovery schedule typically determines where the discovered data is stored. Assigning a "Run as" user enables the discovery process to run under a different user’s domain and permissions. This enables administrators to control which domain stores the data and what resources the discovery process can access, regardless of who created the schedule.

**Note:** This procedure applies only to existing Discovery schedules. For information about creating a Discovery schedule, see [Schedule a horizontal discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_CreateADiscoverySchedule.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Discovery Schedules**.

2.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the schedule you want to configure.

3.  Double-click the **Run as** field to perform inline editing.

    By default, the **Run as** column doesn’t display in the Discovery Schedules \[discovery\_schedule\] table. For information about customizing columns in tables, see [Personalize a list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/c_PersonalLists.md).

4.  Enter the name of the user that you want the schedule to run as.

5.  Select the check mark \(\[Omitted image "icon-check-mark.png"\] Alt text: check mark icon\) icon.
