# Discovery performance metrics

This Discovery enhancement collects performance metrics on probe/pattern and sensor processing times and then aggregates that data over time. You can use the roll-up data to monitor the performance of specific discoveries or to compare performance between versions after an upgrade.

## Metrics

Discovery provides these individual performance metrics:

-   Probe and pattern processing time.
-   Sensor processing time.
-   Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) processing time for Discovery patterns. This processing time is already included in the sensor processing time, but is isolated here to provided more insight into the identification and reconciliation of pattern payloads.

Discovery can aggregate individual metrics for these attributes:

-   Builds/versions
-   Discovery status
-   Target IP address

## How metric aggregations are triggered

Metric roll-ups are initiated as follows:

-   **Aggregated by build**: Implemented by the **Aggregate Discovery Probe And Sensor Metrics By Build** scheduled job. This job runs at 0200, local time.
-   **Aggregated by status**: Implemented by the **Rollup Probe/Sensor Metrics by Status** Script Action, which is triggered by the **discovery.complete** or **discovery.cancelled** registered events.
-   **Aggregated by target**: Implemented by the **Rollup Probe/Sensor Metrics by Target** Script Action that is triggered by the **discovery.device.complete** registered event.

**Note:** If Discovery execution is cancelled before it completes, Discovery cannot update the IP target metric aggregation table. This is because the **discovery.device.complete** event that triggers aggregation does not run. IP target data for an interrupted Discovery is collected when subsequent discoveries run successfully on the target. Cancelling Discovery execution does not affect the aggregation of other metrics, which are triggered differently.

## Tables

Discovery performance metrics data is stored in these tables:

|Table|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Individual\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\]|Stores the individual performance metrics for probes/patterns, sensors, and IRE processing times.|
|Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Aggregate\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\_rollup\]|This is the base table for the metric aggregations and does not store data itself. The three roll-up tables, by-build, by-status, and by-target all extend this table.|
|Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Aggregated by Build\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\_rollup\_by\_build\]|Stores the aggregated performance metrics for probes/patterns, sensors, and IRE by build and version.|
|Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Aggregated by Status\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\_rollup\_by\_status\]|Stores the aggregated performance metrics for probes/patterns, sensors, and IRE by Discovery status.|
|Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Aggregated by Target\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\_rollup\_by\_target\]|Stores the aggregated performance metrics for probes/patterns, sensors, and IRE by IP address.|

## Discovery properties

Performance metrics properties control whether or not aggregation occurs, but not what data is included in the aggregation. Status and IP target data is collected as follows:

-   Rollups for status always contain new data. Discovery continuously collects data on all probes and sensors during the discovery execution for that discovery status and stores it in the Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Individual\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\] table. Aggregation rolls up all probe and sensor data for that particular status after **discovery.cancel** and **discovery.complete** events are fired for that status, but only if the aggregation property for status roll-ups is enabled.
-   Discovery continuously collects data on IP targets and stores it in the Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Individual\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\] table. Aggregation rolls up all existing IP target data after the **glide.discovery.perf.metrics.rollup\_by\_target** property is enabled and creates records in the Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Aggregated by Target\) \[discovery\_perf\_metric\_probe\_sensor\_rollup\_by\_target\] table.

These properties control the gathering of probe and sensor metrics:

</table>## View Discovery performance metrics for probes, sensors, and patterns

By default, Discovery tracks the performance of individual probes, sensors, and patterns by measuring the processing time. When patterns are used, Discovery measures the Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\) processing time.

### Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin or admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Discovery Performance Metrics** &gt; **Probe/Sensor \(Individual\)**.

2.  Sort the list by Discovery status to see the list of probes and patterns that ran in a specific Discovery.

3.  You can view the metrics for each probe, sensor, or pattern in the list or open the record.

    All probe and sensor metrics data are read-only.

    The Probe and Sensor Metrics \(Individual\) form provides these fields:

    |Field label|Field name|Description|
    |-----------|----------|-----------|
    |Build/version|build\_version|Build on which the Discovery was run.|
    |Discovery status|discovery\_status|ID number of the Discovery status from which the metrics were collected.|
    |Target IP address|target\_ip|IP address of the target for this Discovery.|
    |ECC queue input|ecc\_queue\_input|Identifies a particular ECC input record in the ECC queue table.|
    |ECC queue topic \*|ecc\_queue\_topic|Identifies the Java class in the MID Server that executes the probe.|
    |ECC queue name \*|ecc\_queue\_name|Identifies the probe/pattern evaluated for performance in this aggregation.|
    |Probe \*|probe|Name of the probe used for this Discovery.|
    |Probe processing time|probe\_time|Interaction time of the MID Server with the target, including construction of the payload that is sent back to the instance. The time is in milliseconds.|
    |IRE processing time|ire\_time|Time required to process the pattern payload on the instance by the Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\). IRE time is useful because it shows the part of the sensor time used by the pattern. The time is in milliseconds.|
    |Sensor processing time|sensor\_time|Time it took the sensor to process the payload on the instance for a Discovery. The time is in milliseconds.|

    \* Used to uniquely identify a probe/pattern and accompanying sensor when gathering metrics for a Discovery.
