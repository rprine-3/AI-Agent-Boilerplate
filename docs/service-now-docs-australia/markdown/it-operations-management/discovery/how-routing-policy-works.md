# Routing policy details

Routing policies define specific criteria, such as CA and environment, for automated certificate management in TLS certificates.

There are three different scenarios for how routing policies work for automated certificate management for TLS certificates.

-   Scenario 1: A single routing policy matches and manual approval is required. The approver can verify the task details and approve the certificate request. Once approved, this triggers the automated flow.
-   Scenario 2: No routing policy matches OR there are multiple routing policies that match. The approver can verify the task details and select Choose Routing Policy &amp; Approve. The approver needs to manually select the routing policy. The updated routing policy then displays. The approver selects the routing policy which then triggers the automated flow.
-   Scenario 3: A single routing policy matches, manual approval is not required, and Approval Required flag is inactive. This triggers the automatic flow.

**Note:**

If the approver has rejected the certificate request task, the task is marked as Failed. A single approval is enough for triggering the automated flow progress.
