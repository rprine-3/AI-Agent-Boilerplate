# Discovery Admin Workspace Schedules

The Schedules page provides a single place to monitor Discovery performance, efficiently manage schedules and statuses, and set up new IP-based or Cloud Discovery schedules.

To access the Discovery Admin Workspace Schedules page, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Schedules**.

**Note:** The capabilities described here are available starting with Discovery Admin Workspace v1.19.0. Specific version requirements are noted for individual features where applicable.

## Key features

-   **Quick Discovery option**

    Enables you to perform an IP-based discovery in just a few steps. You can select an IP range, choose the MID selection method, pick the MID Server, and run the discovery all within one interface. This option is available from any tab on the **Schedules** page.

-   **New Discovery option**

    Enables you to choose how you want to discover your resources, either through IP-based or Cloud-based discovery. This option is available from any tab on the **Schedules** page.

    Enables you to choose how you want to discover your resources, through IP-based, Cloud, or Certificate discovery. This option is available from any tab on the **Schedules** page.

    **Note:** Certificate discovery is available in Discovery Admin Workspace starting with v1.20.0 and requires the Brazil, Australia, or Zurich release starting with patch 8.

-   **Overview tab**

    The **Schedules overview** section enables you to make data-driven decisions through powerful visualizations.

    **Note:** You can configure the time scale reflected in the displayed counts on the [Settings]() page.

    Select the **More Options** icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-menu-sow.png"\]\), then select **Refresh** to refresh the data for each visualization in this section.

</table>-   **IP-based discovery tab**

    Provides a centralized view for monitoring and managing IP‑based Discovery schedules and coverage.

    Depending on your IPv6 IP Address Management \(IPAM\) integration, items that require attention are displayed. These items include IPs not covered by Discovery schedules and schedules that were auto-created from IPAM that require activation. Select **Review missing coverage** to access the [CMDB Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-coverage.md) page where you can view coverage analysis results and create Discovery schedules from IP Ranges. If you haven't enabled auto-created Discovery schedules via IPAM, select **Review in Settings** to access the [Discovery Admin Workspace Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md) page. When auto‑created schedules are enabled, a notification displays the number of Discovery schedules that require activation. Select **View and activate schedules** to open the Auto‑created schedules page. For details on activating these schedules, see [Activate auto-created Discovery schedules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/activate-auto-disco-schedule.md). For more information about IPv6 IPAM integration, see [IPAM Discovery integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/ipv6-ipam-disco-integration.md).

    Select **View Inventory** to open the IP inventory page. On the IP inventory page, you can manage the IP ranges, networks, and IPAM data that Discovery relies on. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace IP inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/daw-ip-inventory.md).

    Select a Discovery schedule from the table to view extensive details and update schedule field parameters. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace schedule details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c_daw-disco-schedule-details.md).

-   **Cloud discovery tab**

    Gives you quick access to all of your cloud-based Discovery schedules.

    Select a Discovery schedule from the table to view extensive details and update schedule field parameters. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace schedule details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c_daw-disco-schedule-details.md).

-   **Certificate discovery**

    Provides a centralized view for monitoring and managing certificate Discovery schedules. Depending on the state of your schedules, items that require attention are displayed. Select **Review that list of IP-based schedules** to open the IP-based discovery tab. To resolve certificate schedule errors, select **Review schedules** to open the [Diagnostics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-admin-workspace-diagnostics.md) page. To review discovered certificates, select **Go to Certificate Management Workspace** to access the Certificate Inventory and Management Workspace.

    Discovery Admin Workspace offers two methods for certificate discovery:

    -   Port scans: Collects certificates from devices that have listening ports found during your existing IP-based Discovery schedules. For more information, see [Run Certificate Discovery via port scans in Discovery Admin Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/daw-discover-certs-port.md).
    -   URL scans: Collects certificates from a list of URLs that you specify in a new certificate Discovery schedule. For more information, see [Run Certificate Discovery via URL scans in Discovery Admin Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/daw-discover-certs-url.md).
    Select a Discovery schedule from the table to view extensive details and update schedule field parameters. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace schedule details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c_daw-disco-schedule-details.md).

    **Note:** Certificate discovery is available in Discovery Admin Workspace starting with v1.20.0 and requires the Brazil, Australia, or Zurich release starting with Patch 8.

-   **Discovery status tab**

    Shows the status of scheduled discoveries. You can select a Discovery status number to view detailed information. For more details, see [Discovery Admin Workspace status details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/daw-disco-status-details.md).
