# Deploy a MID Server

Deploying a MID Server lets ServiceNow securely communicate with systems inside a private network by installing and validating a trusted runtime that performs discovery, integrations, and automation tasks without requiring inbound network access.

## Before you begin

Verify the following:

-   You're using the Zurich Patch 8 or later version of the ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   You have installed the ITOM Visibility plugin. For more information, see [Install ITOM Visibility using ServiceNow Otto for Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/install-nowassist-setup-itom-visibility.md).
-   You have installed the ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) plugin. For more information, see [Install ServiceNow Otto for ITOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/install-na-itom.md).
-   You're on the Configure IT Operations Management page of the Configuration Console. For more information, see [Access the ITOM Configuration Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/access-itom-config-console-disco.md).
