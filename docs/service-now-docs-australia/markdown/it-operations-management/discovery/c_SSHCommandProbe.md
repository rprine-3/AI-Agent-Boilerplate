# SSHCommand probe

A probe using the ECC queue topic name SSHCommand executes a shell command on the target host, and returns the resulting output to the sensor.

Discovery supports Bourne Shell \(sh\) and Bourne-again Shell \(bash\) commands. Enter shell script commands in the probe's ECC queue name field. The shell script can use variables and file operations supported by the target UNIX shell.

-   The SSH engine is active by default on new instances.
-   Customers on upgraded instances can manually enable ServiceNow SSH for a particular probe by setting the use\_snc\_ssh parameter to true. Alternatively, enable it for all probes on the MID Server by setting the MID Server parameter mid.ssh.use\_snc to true.

**Note:** To discover network devices, such as routers and switches, use [SNMP credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/c_SNMPCredentials.md) credentials, not SSH credentials.

-   **[SSHCommand parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_Parameters.md)**  
Several parameters are available for the SSHCommand probe.
-   **[SSHCommand path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c_SSHCommandPath.md)**  
The SSHCommand probe computes the default path from the following sources.
-   **[Shell script options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_ShellScriptOptions.md)**  
The SSHCommand probe supports the following scripting options in the ECC queue name field.
-   **[Non-privileged SSH commands during probe-based discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-ssh-probe-commands.md)**  
These tables display the SSH commands run by Discovery probes on target devices during horizontal discovery. These SSH commands don’t require elevated privileges to run.
-   **[Privileged SSH commands for probe-based discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-ssh-command-require-priv.md)**  
These tables display the SSH commands run by Discovery probes during horizontal discovery. These SSH commands require elevated privileges to run.
