# Upgrade Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informers remotely

Upgrade Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer pods in Kubernetes clusters remotely from the ServiceNow Instance to avoid dependence on your Kubernetes admin. You can upgrade a single Informer or multiple Informers together.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Kubernetes Visibility Agent** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  In the **Kubernetes Visibility Agent Image** field, set the image to which you want to upgrade Informers that are currently running, and then select **Save**.

    Use the following format: repository:tag. For example: `servicenowdocker/informer:2.1.1`.

3.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Kubernetes Visibility Agent** &gt; **Home**.

4.  In the Kubernetes Informers list, perform the relevant steps to upgrade one Informer or several Informers concurrently.

    **Note:** Only Informers with the value Upgrade Pending in the **Upgrade Status** field can be upgraded. The running status of the Informers must be either Up or Paused.
