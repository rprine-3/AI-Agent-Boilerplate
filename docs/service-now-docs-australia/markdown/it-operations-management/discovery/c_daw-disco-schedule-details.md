# Discovery Admin Workspace schedule details

Discovery Admin Workspace enables you to conveniently view, edit, and run Discovery schedules conveniently within a single interface.

To access Discovery schedule details in Discovery Admin Workspace, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Schedules** &gt; **Discovery schedules**.

**Note:** The capabilities described here are available starting with Discovery Admin Workspace v1.8.0. Specific version requirements are noted for individual features where applicable.

After selecting a schedule name from the table, the schedule header displays key information such as Discovery details, MID Server details, and anomaly severity when anomaly detection is enabled. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md).

The actions available in the schedule header depend on the discovery type:

-   For an IP-based Discovery schedule, select **Save** to save your changes, or select **Quick ranges** to create a range of IP addresses to discover.
-   For a cloud or certificate Discovery schedule, select **Edit** to update the schedule. To run any Discovery schedule on demand, select **Discover now**.

**Note:** Certificate discovery is available in Discovery Admin Workspace starting with v1.20.0 and requires the Brazil, Australia, or Zurich release starting with Patch 8.

## Key features

-   **Overview**

    The **Overview** tab includes visualizations that provide detailed information about the Discovery schedule. These visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the schedule's performance and status, showing key metrics like the number of discoveries completed, success rate, and any errors encountered. Additionally, the visualizations highlight trends over time, enabling you to quickly identify patterns and potential issues. For a full list of the visualizations available on this tab, see [Schedule details data visualizations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_dawScheduleDetailsOverview.md).
