# Discovery for Alibaba Cloud

Alibaba Cloud discovery is one of the overall Cloud discovery offerings within the IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) Visibility framework. It’s an automated process used to scan and identify Alibaba Cloud resources within your organization's cloud infrastructure. This discovery process is critical for maintaining an accurate and trustworthy data foundation—the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

## Pattern-based cloud discovery

Using Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns to perform horizontal discovery enables you to find and map your organization's Alibaba Cloud resources. You can discover Alibaba Cloud metadata including:

-   Cloud service accounts.
-   Datacenters.
-   Availability zones.
-   Hardware types.

Patterns also support OS level discovery, for example OS images.

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns create configuration items \(CIs\) for your Alibaba Cloud resources. Additionally, patterns discover the relationships between your organization's Alibaba Cloud resources, such as Hosted On :: Hosts.

See [Alibaba Cloud discovery using patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery-and-service-mapping-patterns/alibaba-cloud-discovery-pattern.md) to learn about all Alibaba Cloud resources you can discover using Patterns.

## Verify the REST API Permissions

Download the [Cloud Discovery patterns spreadsheet](https://downloads.docs.servicenow.com/resource/enus/api/servicenow-discovery-patterns-api-details.xlsx) so you can grant user permissions required for running the Discovery patterns. In addition to permissions, the spreadsheet also includes useful information such as pattern names, types, CI Classes, and links to vendor documentation. New patterns are available quarterly, so check periodically to be sure you have the latest version of the spreadsheet.

## Alibaba Cloud discovery configuration

The basic steps to configure pattern-based discovery for Alibaba Cloud involve preparation on the ServiceNow AI Platform side like installing necessary plugins and setting up credentials. The discovery\_admin role in ServiceNow AI Platform is required for creating Alibaba Cloud API credentials and service accounts.

The discovery process requires configuration within Alibaba Cloud, like setting up Identity and Access Management roles. The discovery permissions of Alibaba Cloud users are determined by their access levels within Alibaba Cloud.

To promote proper discovery, the Alibaba Cloud user must have at least read-only access to the necessary Alibaba Cloud services.

|Alibaba Cloud user|Discovery permissions|
|------------------|---------------------|
|Root Account \(Master Account\)|Full access to all Alibaba Cloud resources and services, including Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\), Object Storage Service \(OSS\), Relational Database Service \(RDS\), and Resource Access Management \(RAM\). Can create and manage RAM users, assign permissions, and perform billing operations.|
|RAM user|Access to specific Alibaba Cloud resources and services based on assigned policies. Can be granted read-only access for discovery purposes.|
|RAM Role \(AssumedRoleUser\)|Temporary access to Alibaba Cloud resources and services based on assumed role policies. Useful for cross-account access, temporary access, or access by ECS instances.|
