# Download a software bill of materials \(SBOM\)

Download a software Bill of Materials \(SBOM\) to gain visibility to the components of the container image such as the operating system packages that are installed.

## Before you begin

The SBOM must have been configured. For more information, see [Configure the SBOM generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/enable-sbom.md).

Role required: discovery\_admin

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, type `sn_itom_pattern_container_image_scan_status_list.do`.

2.  Choose the image for which you need the SBOM in the Container Image Scan Status list.

    If the scan status is **None** rather than **Scanned**, wait for the status to change before selecting the image record.

3.  Download the SBOM by selecting **download** in the **Manage attachments** section.
