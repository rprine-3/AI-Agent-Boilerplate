# Create a MID Server user

Create a user account with the mid\_server role so MID Servers can authenticate and communicate with the ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

Verify the following:

-   You're using the Zurich Patch 8 or later version of the ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   You have installed the ITOM Visibility plugin. For more information, see [Install ITOM Visibility using ServiceNow Otto for Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/install-nowassist-setup-itom-visibility.md).
-   You have installed the ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) plugin. For more information, see [Install ServiceNow Otto for ITOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/install-na-itom.md).
-   You're on the Configure IT Operations Management page of the Configuration Console. For more information, see [Access the ITOM Configuration Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/access-itom-config-console-disco.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

MID Servers require a MID Server user account to authenticate with the instance. Assigning the mid\_server role allows the MID Server to connect and pass validation checks. ServiceNow monitors MID Server user settings to help prevent validation failures. You can use a dedicated user per MID Server or share a user across multiple MID Servers.

**Note:** Using the same logged‑in user across multiple MID Servers can generate issue records when more than one MID Server is **Up**. Configure a unique logged‑in user per MID Server. See [\(KB1552863\) MID Server Unique Logged In User](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1552863) for more information and remediation steps.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Configuration Summary** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Platform foundations**.

2.  Expand **Platform foundations**.

3.  Select **MID server user**.

4.  Select **Create user**.

    The Create MID server user page displays.

5.  Complete the following fields.

Enter a user name for the MID Server user. This name is specified in the **mid.instance.username** parameter of the configuration file that the MID Server installer creates. For details, see [MID Server parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-parameters.md).

 **Note:** Avoid using the same MID Server logged in user across multiple MID Servers.

</table>6.  Select **Create user**.

    You're returned to the MID server user page.

    **Note:** The MID Server user is limited to MID Server setup. To complete Discovery setup through the ITOM Configuration Console, you must have the discovery\_admin role.
