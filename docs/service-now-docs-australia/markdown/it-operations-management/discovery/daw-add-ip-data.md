# Add IP data

Use the New IP data dialog in the IP inventory page to add IP addresses, ranges, networks, or range sets to your discovery configuration.

## Before you begin

Confirm the following:

-   Discovery Admin Workspace v1.19.0 is installed.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform is running on the Brazil, Australia, or Zurich release starting with Patch 8.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

The New IP data dialog is shared across the **IP Address Lists**, **IP Ranges**, **IP Networks**, and **Discovery Range Sets** tabs. When you open the dialog from a tab, the check box for that tab is selected automatically. The system removes duplicate entries automatically.

For collection types and format details, see [Discovery IP address configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-ip-address-configuration.md). To view and manage your entries, see [Discovery Admin Workspace IP inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/daw-ip-inventory.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Schedules** &gt; **IP-based discovery**.

2.  Select **View inventory** from the IP inventory section.

3.  Select the tab that contains the IP data to add, such as **IP Address Lists**.

4.  Select **New**.
