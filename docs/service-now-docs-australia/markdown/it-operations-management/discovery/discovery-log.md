# Discovery log details

Discovery logs contain information on the horizontal discovery process based on probes and patterns.

## Discovery log related list

The Discovery Log related list contains information about the horizontal discovery based on probes.

The Discovery Log provides the following information:

<table id="table_itd_wfl_rx"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Input value

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Created

</td><td>

Timestamp of the Discovery activity. Each timestamp defines the approximate time of the activity. Several Discovery events may occur in random order within a second.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Level

</td><td>

Classifies the activity into one of the following levels for general sorting:-   Error
-   Information
-   Warning

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short Message

</td><td>

Informative message detailing the outcome of the activity or the Discovery progress. Look here for the result of a classify probe or for authentication failure.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ECC queue input

</td><td>

The related input record from the ECC queue for this discovery. You can also view these records from the **ECC Queue** related list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

CI

</td><td>

Names a device for which a matching CI was found in the CMDB. Select the link to view the CI record for the device.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source

</td><td>

Names the particular activity, such as the Shazzam probe or a UNIX classify probe.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Device

</td><td>

Lists the IP address of the CI discovered. All devices identified by IP address appear in the log, even if they refused all invitations to communicate. Any port activity from a device places it into the log, even if all subsequent efforts to identify it fail. Select the IP address of the device to view the events associated with discovering that device.
