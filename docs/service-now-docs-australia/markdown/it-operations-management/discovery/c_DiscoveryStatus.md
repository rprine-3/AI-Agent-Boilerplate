# Discovery status

The Discovery status provides a summary of a Discovery launched from a schedule. You can also cancel a Discovery that is in progress from the status form.

**Note:** Discovery schedules that have no status updates for a over a defined number of minutes are analyzed automatically by the Discovery Status Monitor job. By default, this job applies to Discovery schedules that discover configuration items. For more information, see the [Discovery Status Monitoring Job](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=c2a6f4bf935a1ed0f538fb2d6cba10be) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To access the Discovery Status form, navigate to **Discovery** &gt; **Status** and open the status record for a Discovery.

Each record in the Status list represents the execution of a Discovery by a schedule and displays such high-level information as the date of the Discovery, the mode, the number of probe messages sent to devices, and the number of sensor records that were processed. A status record contains data that can help you troubleshoot a failed discovery. Use this data to troubleshoot the behavior of individual probes and sensors or even run those elements separately. Use the status controls to enter probe/sensor threads at any point for a specific Discovery, and then follow the process in either direction. You can also clearly see which classification probe ran and discovered a particular device by viewing the classification probe column in the device list.

-   **Refresh**: Refreshes the related tabs, including the **Discovery Log** and **ECC Queue** for discoveries still in progress.
-   **Discovery timeline**: The Discovery timeline is a graphical display of a discovery, including information about each probe and sensor that was used.
-   **Discovery log entries**: The Discovery Log shows information such as classification failures, Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) updates, and authentication failures. A Discovery Log record is created for each action associated with a discovery status.
-   **ECC queue entries**: Entries in the ECC queue provide you with a connected flow of probe and sensor activity, as well as the actual XML payload that is sent to or from an instance.
-   **Device history**: The device history provides a summary of all the devices scanned during discovery, and what action sensors took on the CMDB.

**Note:** By default, only 30 days of Discovery records are displayed in the status list at a time.

The following Discovery status record shows the discovery of a load balancer using a pattern.

</table>-   **[Cancel a Discovery from a Discovery Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_CancelDiscoveryStatus.md)**  
You can manually cancel a discovery while it is in progress from the Discovery Status record.
-   **[Discovery timelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c_DiscoveryStatusTimelines.md)**  
A Discovery timeline generates a graphical display of a Discovery Status record, including information about each probe and sensor that was used in the discovery.
-   **[The ECC queue for Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_DiscoveryStatusECCQueue.md)**  
The External Communication Channel \(ECC\) Queue is a connection point between your ServiceNow instance and other systems that integrate with it, most commonly a MID Server.
-   **[Discovery device history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_DiscoveryStatusDevices.md)**  
The **Devices** Related list in the Discovery Status form provides a summary list of all the devices scanned.
