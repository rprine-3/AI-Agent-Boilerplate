To find the cause of this error, identify the **Short Message** field of the error record. This field shows the name of the probe for which the sensor is missing.

## Procedure

1.  Depending on the application you're using, do one of the following:

    -   To identify the cause of the error using Cloud Discovery Workspace, navigate to **Cloud Discovery Workspace** &gt; **Cloud Discovery** &gt; **Diagnostics** &gt; **Discovery Log**.
    -   To identify the cause of the error using Discovery, navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Output and Artifacts** &gt; **Discovery Log**.
2.  Filter the **Level** column by **Error**.
