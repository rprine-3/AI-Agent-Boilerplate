# Discovery Home page

The Discovery Home page provides a summary of discoveries that were triggered by cloud and non-cloud schedules. You can view any errors that occurred during a Discovery and find remediation suggestions. Use the Home page view to examine the cloud resources discovered for the service accounts you selected in a cloud schedule.

To open the Discovery Home page, navigate to **Discovery** &gt; **Home**. The Home page shows the Discovery totals for each of the following categories. Select a tile to view details for that category.

**Note:** Discovery Admin Workspace provides an updated experience for monitoring discoveries, managing schedules, and resolving errors. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace Home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-admin-workspace-home.md).

### Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin

**Note:** You can also investigate and resolve Discovery errors in Discovery Admin Workspace. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace Error Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/daw-error-details.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Home**.

    The summary page for all schedules appears.

    \[Omitted image "DiscoHomeSummary.png"\] Alt text: CI schedule summary

2.  View the errors, using one of these methods:

    -   Select the **Errors** tile to see the errors by category for all configuration item \(CI\) discovery schedules.
    -   Select the **Schedules** tile to display the errors for a single schedule.
        1.  In the summary screen, select the schedule that you want to investigate for errors.

            If you have numerous schedules, you can filter by location, using the location drop-down list, or filter by the schedule name in the **Search by name** field.

            \[Omitted image "CIScheduleMgrFilter.png"\] Alt text: CI schedule results

        2.  After you select the schedule, select the **Errors** tile.
        3.  Scroll down to view the errors by category.

            \[Omitted image "CIScheduleMgrErrorbyCat.png"\] Alt text: Errors by category for a schedule

3.  Select a category tile to display the specific error codes that occurred in that category.

4.  Select the tile for the error code you want to investigate.

    \[Omitted image "CIScheduleMgrCategories.png"\] Alt text: Errors by category

    The list displays all occurrences of that error code, either for a single CI schedule or for all schedules, depending on the path you took to view the errors. The list shows the IP address of each instance that experienced the error and the error status **Active error**. The **Recommended Actions** pane on the right contains the recommended action for the selected error. The **ACTION ON ALL** pane contains operations you can execute on all the errors in the list.

    \[Omitted image "CIScheduleMgrErrorControls.png"\] Alt text: Automation Error Messages filter

5.  Select **View instructions** to see details and remediation suggestions for the error code.

    \[Omitted image "CIScheduleMgrErrorInst.png"\] Alt text: Error details and remediation instructions

6.  To begin work, either select the check box next to an error to resolve that specific error or select an action for **ALL** to resolve that error code for all instances of that error.

    In this example, the system recommends creating new Windows credentials to resolve this error code.

    \[Omitted image "CIScheduleMgrErrorDetail.png"\] Alt text: Error detail and recommended actions

7.  Complete the suggested remediation tasks before attempting to retry Discovery.

    In this example, the **Create new Windows Credentials** link opens a form for creating and testing new Windows credentials.

    \[Omitted image "CIScheduleMgrWinCred.png"\] Alt text: Create new Windows credentials

8.  After all the recommended tasks are complete, select **Retry Discovery**.

    A possible course of action might be to retry discovery for **ALL** instances after creating the credentials. The new credentials might solve the issue for all the instances experiencing this error code.

9.  Check the **Error Status** column to see the results of your remediation efforts.

    Single retries complete quickly. Retries for large numbers of IP addresses can take several minutes.

    An error can have one of these statuses:

    -   **Active error**: Unresolved error. This is the default status of all new errors.
    -   **Resolved**: Resolved error. The recommended actions show Error successfully resolved.
    -   **Assigned**: Task assigned to resolve this error. Select **Create a task** to assign a user to a task for all active errors. Assigned errors are considered **Active errors**, and actions can still be performed on them.
    -   **Pending Discovery**: Waiting for Discovery to start after you execute the **Retry Discovery** action on all errors.
    -   **In Discovery**: Discovery is currently active.
