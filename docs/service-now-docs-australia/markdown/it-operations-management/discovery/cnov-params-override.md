# Override Informer parameters from the Instance

Control Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer execution parameters from the ServiceNow Instance to avoid dependence on your Kubernetes admin.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

The Informer execution parameters are configured during deployment using the Kubernetes Yaml file or the Helm command. You can change these settings later directly from the Instance. This avoids having to ask your Kubernetes team to update or reinstall the deployment.

When you add or modify a parameter, it is synchronized with the informer through the ECC Queue. Depending on the parameter, the Informer pod may need to restart. Parameters requiring a restart must have the SELF\_PATCHING\_ALLOWED environment variable set to true for changes to be effective upon restart. If this variable is set to false, the Informer is not restarted and continues to use the old values.

**Note:** Informer-specific parameters only affect a specific Informer. If you add a parameter without assigning it to an Informer, it defaults to a global parameter and affects all Informers in the system. When both global and Informer-specific parameters are present, Informer-specific parameters take precedence.

You can update the following parameters from the Instance:

|Parameter|Restart upon change|
|---------|-------------------|
|VERBOSE\_LOGGING|No|
|OPENSHIFT|Yes|
|CREATE\_SERVER\_CI|No|
|INCLUDE\_LABELS\_AND\_ANNOTATIONS|No|
|EXCLUDE\_LABELS\_AND\_ANNOTATIONS|No|
|FULL\_DISCOVERY\_MIN|Yes|
|SEND\_INTERVAL\_SEC|Yes|
|CONTINUOUS\_DISCOVERY|Yes|
|CLUSTER\_RESOURCE\_ID|No|
|CLUSTER\_NAME|No|

The **CREATE\_CONTAINERS** parameter determines which Docker containers are deployed to the instance. It is managed automatically and is not exposed in the Configuration Parameters list. A new system property, **sn\_itom\_pattern.bring\_discovery\_container**, which is available when the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns plugin is installed, governs **CREATE\_CONTAINERS** automatically. When **sn\_itom\_pattern.bring\_discovery\_container** is set to `true` \(default\), **CREATE\_CONTAINERS** is set to `non-init-containers`. When set to `false`, **CREATE\_CONTAINERS** is set to `none` and no Docker containers are brought to the instance. Each change triggers the ECC Queue sync to propagate the updated value with the Informer.

For information about the purpose of each parameter, see the [Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(formerly CNO for Visibility\) Advanced Configuration Options \[KB1648891\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1648891) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Kubernetes Visibility Agent** &gt; **Configuration Parameters**.

2.  Select a parameter in the **Kubernetes Informer Parameters** list.

3.  Change the configured value as needed, and then select **Update**.
