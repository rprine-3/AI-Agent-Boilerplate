# Add IP data to a range set

Use the IP inventory page in Discovery Admin Workspace to add IP ranges or networks to a new or existing range set.

## Before you begin

Confirm the following:

-   Discovery Admin Workspace v1.19.0 is installed.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform is running on the Brazil, Australia, or Zurich release starting with Patch 8.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

The **Add to Range Set** action is available on the **IP Ranges** and **IP Networks** tabs of the IP Inventory page in Discovery Admin Workspace. Select it to add existing IP data to a new or existing range set. The system removes duplicate entries automatically.

**Note:** To avoid performance issues, limit Discovery schedules to a maximum range of /16 \(approximately 65,536 IPs\). For better performance, consider splitting the range into smaller segments.

For collection types and format details, see [Discovery IP address configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-ip-address-configuration.md). To view and manage your range sets, see [Discovery Admin Workspace IP inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/daw-ip-inventory.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Schedules** &gt; **IP-based discovery**.

2.  Select **View inventory** from the IP inventory section.

3.  Select the tab that contains the IP data to add, such as **IP Ranges**.

4.  Select the check box for each row to add.

5.  Select **Add to Range Set**.

    The Add to Range Set dialog displays.

    The Add to Range Set dialog closes.
