# Create a Discovery CI classification

A CI classification allows Discovery to discover most common operating systems, network devices, and processes.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Warning:** Adding SNMP OID classifications with a Net-SNMP module OID starting with 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2 or a Windows OS OID starting with 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.1.3 can result in misclassification of devices and incorrect model names and is no longer allowed. These are template system OIDs that can remain on a device if the manufacturer fails to replace them with OIDs specific to their own model. For example, a Check Point Smart-1 3050 Firewall, which uses Linux as its OS, might have the OID for a Linux server, 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.10. This results in the firewall being classified incorrectly. If two or more devices have the same OID, configure classification criteria that differentiate the devices from one another. For details, see [KB0751287](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0751287).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **CI Classification**.

2.  Select the type of classification to create.

3.  Click **New** in the list of classifications for the type you selected.

4.  Complete the form using the fields in the table.

<table id="table_amr_qbq_tw"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Input Value

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the configuration item \(CI\).

</td></tr><tr><td>

OID

</td><td>

SNMP system OID for matching this device. When the OID value matches that of an SNMP device, Discovery uses the information to populate the CMDB with the specified manufacturer, model, and classifier.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Operator

</td><td>

Operator for determining how to match and SNMP OID. The choices are **Is** and **Starts with**. This field is available only for SNMP System OIDs classifiers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Enables or disables this classifier. When a classifier is disabled, the system stops classification at this level and does not launch classifiers of a lower order. For example, when the classifier for Windows 2008 Server is disabled, the system stops Discovery at this point and does not launch the Windows 2012 Server classifier.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order \(sequence\) in which the platform runs this classifier.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

Table for this classification. For example, if this record classifies a Linux server, select the Linux Server \[cmdb\_ci\_linux\_server\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Classifier

</td><td>

Classification of an SNMP device, such as **A10 Load Balancer**. This field is available only for SNMP System OIDs classifiers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Relationship type

</td><td>

Type of relationship for this classifier, such as **Runs on::Runs**. This field is available only for application and process classifiers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Match criteria

</td><td>

Criteria that must match to classify this device. The choices are**Any** of the parameters or **All** of the parameters.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Manufacturer

</td><td>

Name of the manufacturer of a network device. This field is available only for SNMP and SNMP System OIDs classifiers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Model

</td><td>

Model number of a network device. This field is available only for SNMP and SNMP System OIDs classifiers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

On classification script

</td><td>

Script that runs if classification criteria are met. Use this script to perform any special tasks after a device is classified. It is possible to use the `g_probe_parameters` hashmap from within a classification script to set probe parameters for any configured, triggered probes. For example, this code sets a '**node\_port**' parameter to 16001 for all triggered probes:```
(JS), g_probe_parameters['node_port'] = 16001; //
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

Classification Criteria

</td><td>

Criteria formed from specific parameters and the values that they must contain to match devices that Discovery finds in the network with CIs in the CMDB. For a detailed discussion of these parameters, see [Discovery classification parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/classification-parameters.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

SNMP OID Classifications

</td><td>

Unique "fingerprints" of all the SNMP devices that ship with the base Discovery product. Users can add OIDs for SNMP devices not in this list. This related list is available only for SNMP devices.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Triggers probes

</td><td>

Exploration probes that Discovery launches to gather detailed information about a CI that it has classified in the network. If you want to use patterns for horizontal discovery, add the [Horizontal Pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r-HorizontalPatternProbe.md) probe in the **Probe** column, and then specify your pattern in the **Pattern** column.

**Warning:** Do not specify your pattern in **Probe** column. Choose the Horizontal Pattern probe, which launches the specified pattern.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Versions

</td><td>

Lists versions of this classifier. A new version is created whenever you modify the classifier record. To revert to a previous version, open that record and select **Revert to this version** under **Related Links**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    This example shows a completed CI classification form with the Horizontal Pattern probe defined. For instruction on creating probes, see [Discovery probes and sensors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/c_DiscoveryProbesAndSensors.md). Probes that are defined are launched when the device is properly classified, unless Discovery is configured to stop after classification.
