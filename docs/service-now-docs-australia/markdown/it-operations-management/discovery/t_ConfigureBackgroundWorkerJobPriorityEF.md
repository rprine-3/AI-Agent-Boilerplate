# Configure background worker job priority for Event Framework

Configure the job priority of background workers to help prevent noncritical tasks from preempting important work, which promotes system efficiency and stability.

## Before you begin

Confirm the following:

-   You're using Discovery Admin Workspace v1.9.0 or later.
-   You're using the Xanadu Patch 9, Yokohama Patch 4, or later version of the ServiceNow AI Platform®.
-   The **discovery.use.event.processing** system property is turned on. For more information, see [Configure Discovery to use Event Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/t_ConfigureDiscoveryEventFramework.md).
-   The **com.glide.queue.discovery.sensors.processing\_jobs.priority** and **com.glide.queue.discovery.cloud.sensors.processing\_jobs.priority** system properties are configured. For more information, see [Add a system property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

By default, Event Framework jobs have a priority of 100. If Discovery is preempting more important work, you can use the **com.glide.queue.&lt;queue\_name&gt;.processing\_jobs.priority** property to adjust the priority.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties**.

2.  Choose one or more job types for which you want to adjust the priority.

    |Job type|Action|
    |--------|------|
    |**IP-based**|Select **com.glide.queue.discovery.sensors.processing\_jobs.priority** from the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table.|
    |**Cloud-based**|Select **com.glide.queue.discovery.cloud.sensors.processing\_jobs.priority** from the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table.|

3.  In the **Value** field, enter `110`.

    **Note:** Increasing the number in the **Value** field lowers the job's priority, while decreasing the number raises it.

4.  Select **Update**.
