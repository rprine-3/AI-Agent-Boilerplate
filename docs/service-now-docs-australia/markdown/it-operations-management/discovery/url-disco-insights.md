</table>**Note:** Daily aggregation jobs update domain-level metrics, including total page views and last accessed time. Data may not reflect activity from the current day until the job has run.

## Targeted URLs visited

This section lists the targeted URLs visited across managed devices since a given date. Targeted URLs are those configured for monitoring in **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **URL Discovery**. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md).

Select a URL from the list to open its domain details page, which displays domain-level usage metrics including total page views, total accessed time, last accessed time, and the number of distinct users.

**Note:** These metrics are aggregated per domain by the daily aggregation job and may not reflect current-day activity until the job runs.

Select the filter icon \(\[Omitted image "filter-icon-daw.png"\] Alt text: filter icon\) to apply filters to the table.

## Other URLs visited

The Broad URLs visited list displays URLs accessed on managed devices that aren't in the targeted URLs list and is populated only when broad URL discovery is enabled. The list includes the URL and the number of hits recorded for each domain. To add a URL to your targeted discovery list, select the check box next to the URL and select **Add to targeted discovery**. In the dialog, enter the following information:
