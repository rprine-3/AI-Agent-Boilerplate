## About this task

Validating a MID Server establishes trust between ServiceNow and the MID Server. A validated MID Server can securely access credentials and perform automation and Discovery tasks, and prevents untrusted systems from executing work on behalf of the instance.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Configuration Summary** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Platform foundations**.

2.  Select **Validate MID server**.

3.  Select the Application manager icon \(\[Omitted image "application-manager-icon.png"\]\).

    The ITOM Infra Services Workspace displays.

4.  In the Total MID Servers list, select the check box next to the MID Server you want to validate.

5.  Select the **Server Actions** drop-down list and select **Validate**.

6.  Select **X** to close the window and return to the Configuration Console.

7.  To complete the setup, select **Mark as configured**.
