# Create routing policies for EJBCA ACME certificates

Automate your EJBCA ACME workflows by creating a routing policy that aligns with your Certificate Signing Requests \(CSRs\) to request, renew, and revoke certificates.

## About this task

Streamline your certificate life-cycle workflow by filling out a routing policy form. This form configures your routing policy fields to make sure your Certificate Signing Request \(CSR\) aligns with the correct Certificate Authority \(CA\) routing policy.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Certificate Management** &gt; **Certificate Routing Policies**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the Certificate Routing Policy form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Certificate routing policy form for EJBCA ACME](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/certificate-routing-policy-form-table.md).

    **Warning:** For your automated workflow to work, you must fill in every field in your routing policy form. If you don’t, your CSR requires manual steps. You can see all the fields and values at the [Certificate routing policy form for EJBCA ACME](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/certificate-routing-policy-form-table.md).

## What to do next
