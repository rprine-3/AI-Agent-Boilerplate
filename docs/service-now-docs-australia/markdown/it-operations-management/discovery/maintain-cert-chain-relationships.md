# Maintaining certificate chain relationships

Maintaining certificate chain relationships via certificate import verifies the integrity and security of digital certificates, validating their authenticity in a system.

To maintain the certificate chain relationships, the industry standard .txt extension is used. Certificate chain relationships aren't maintained with any other file extensions. The expected order of certificates in a .txt certificate chain file is: Server certificate, Intermediate certificate, and Root certificate.

Use cases:

-   If two or more certificates are found in formats like .cert or .pem, only the first certificate is considered. The other certificates aren't processed and no certificate chain relationships are maintained.
-   If there is a .txt extension containing only one certificate, it is considered as a server certificate and no certificate relationship are maintained.
-   If there is a .txt extension containing two certificates, the first certificate is considered as server certificate and the second certificate is considered as root certificate. There are no intermediate certificates.

**Note:** The certificate chain relationship is dependent on the latest URL/IP Discovery run. Importing a file without certificate chain relations disrupts any existing chain relationships associated with the same certificate \(fingerprint\).
