# Java KeyStore and Windows Certificate Store discovery

Discovery uses the **Collect Certificates** extension section of the **Linux Server** and **Windows OS – Servers** patterns to discover certificates stored in the Java KeyStore or Windows Certificate Store. Discovering the certificate information requires installing and updating Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns and Certificate Inventory and Management.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Verify that the following plugins are up to date**
    -   Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns \(sn\_itom\_pattern\), at least 1.12.0
    -   Certificate Inventory and Management \(sn\_disco\_certmgmt\), at least 3.4.0
-   **Verify that the pattern is enabled**

    The **Collect Certificates** pattern extension is disabled by default. On the **Discovery Patterns** list, verify that the **Collect Certificates** pattern extension has the **Active** field set to **true**.

-   **Verify the configuration of the Java KeyStore credentials**

    In the **Discovery Credentials** module, select **jks credentials**. Make sure you configured the Discovery IP Affinity. In the **Type** field, insert `java_keystore`. For more information, see [Get started with credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/credentials-getting-started.md)

-   **Verify the configuration of the Discovery schedule**

    For more information, see [Running discoveries in your network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/running-discoveries.md)


## Data collected by Discovery during horizontal discovery

The **Collect Certificates** extension section of the **Linux Server** and **Windows OS – Servers** patterns support discovery of the following table and fields.

Subject Alternative Name \[subject\_alternative\_name\]

</td><td>

A list of references to alternative host names used by the server.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Issuer \[issuer\]

</td><td>

In this field, there’s a reference to the certificate record. The issuer is the entity that signed and issued the certificate. The reference is available if the issued certificate is a part of the same payload.
