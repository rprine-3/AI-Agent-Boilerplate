# Kubernetes Visibility Agent support matrix

The Kubernetes Visibility Agent component is supported on several versions of Kubernetes and OpenShift and in various Kubernetes environments.

**Note:** To deploy KVA in the OKE \(Oracle Kubernetes Engine\) environment, you need to create a Kubernetes Cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For more information, see the [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/) documentation.

For the latest information, see the [Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(formerly CNO for Visibility\) Support Matrix \[KB1700730\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1700730) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## FIPS-140 compliance

In regulated markets that require FIPS-140 compliant code, the Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer provides the following compliance:

-   The main informer image is FIPS-140 compliant.
-   The daemonset image used for traffic discovery is FIPS-140 compliant.

-   **[Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) Performance Benchmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/kva-p-benchmark.md)**  
Performance tests are available for Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) to help you estimate load, memory, and CPU on the Instance and Kubernetes cluster.
-   **[Discovering Kubevirt Virtual Machines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discover-KVM.md)**  
KubeVirt provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications in both Application Containers and Virtual Machines.
-   **[Running Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) at Scale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/running-kva-at-scale.md)**  
When you run Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) \(formerly CNO for Visibility\) on more than 100 clusters, configure your system properties to help prevent loss of data from the informers.
