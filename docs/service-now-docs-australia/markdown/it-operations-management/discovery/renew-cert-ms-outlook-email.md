# Renew certificates via email

Certificate renewal notifications are sent to users configured in the **Certificate notification policy** table via email 60 days before a certificate expires or after a certificate expires.

## Before you begin

-   You must have certificate CSR information to paste or in a .csr or .pem format. If you don’t have one, you can instruct the system to generate a new one or use a previous one.
-   Role required: pki\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Open the email and select Renew through email.

    Opening the link triggers a new email. It’s the request to renew the certificate.

2.  Open the renewal email.

3.  Add the CSR in one of the following ways:

    -   Attach a CSR file in .csr or .pem format.
    -   Paste the CSR directly.
    -   To generate a new CSR, replace the text in the subject line called &lt;Renewal Option&gt; with the text `AUTO-CSR`.

        **Note:** This generates a new CSR and the private key is stored securely in your vault.

    -   To use the previous CSR, replace the text in the subject line called &lt;Renewal Option&gt; with the text `RP-CSR`.

        **Note:** The system reuses the CSR from the previous certificate request.

4.  Select **Send**.

    Your manager receives an email notification for final approval or rejection of the certificate renewal.

5.  To approve the certificate renewal request, select **Click here to approve** in the email.


## Result

The certificate renewal is complete.
