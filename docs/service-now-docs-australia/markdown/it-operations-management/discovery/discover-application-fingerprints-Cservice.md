# Discover applications using application fingerprints or ITOM Content Service

Discover applications using suggestions based on ServiceNow Predictive Intelligence or ServiceNow ITOM Content Service to create configuration items.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

Review application suggestions based on application fingerprints or ITOM Content Service and add them to discovery.

-   Fingerprint-based discovery uses algorithms to identify running processes and organizes them into groups. These process groups become suggested applications or candidates. You review suggested applications and choose which ones to discover. The list of suggested applications is refreshed every hour. To learn more, see [Discover applications based on fingerprints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/discover-application-based-process.md).
-   ITOM Content Service identifies the products that you’re currently using and delivers new product suggestions every week. To learn more, see [ITOM Content Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/discovery-content-services.md).
