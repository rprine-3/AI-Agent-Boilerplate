# Create cloud credentials

Create cloud credentials to manage access to cloud-based applications, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Discovery uses these credentials to connect to your cloud provider accounts and discover cloud resources.

## Before you begin

Verify the following:

-   You're using the Zurich Patch 8 or later version of the ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   You have installed the ITOM Visibility plugin. For more information, see [Install ITOM Visibility using ServiceNow Otto for Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/itom-visibility/install-nowassist-setup-itom-visibility.md).
-   You have installed the ServiceNow Otto for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) plugin. For more information, see [Install ServiceNow Otto for ITOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/install-na-itom.md).
-   You're on the Configure IT Operations Management page of the Configuration Console. For more information, see [Access the ITOM Configuration Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/access-itom-config-console-disco.md).

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

Cloud credentials store the authentication information that Discovery needs to access your cloud provider accounts. Before you create cloud credentials, verify that you have the required access and permissions configured in your cloud provider environment. The specific configuration requirements vary by cloud provider.

For more information about cloud provider setup and permissions, see [Discovery for cloud environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/cloud-discovery-wizard.md).
