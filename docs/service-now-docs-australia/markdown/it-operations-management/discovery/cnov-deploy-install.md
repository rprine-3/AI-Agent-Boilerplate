# Install Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) Informer

You can install Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer using either a Helm chart or the Kubernetes YAML file.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## About this task

This procedure describes the standard Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer installation process. Typically, you would use a Helm chart to perform the installation, but you can also configure and run the Kubernetes YAML file provided by ServiceNow.

Kubernetes Visibility Agent supports Helm 4. Existing releases created with Helm 3 can be upgraded to Helm 4.

## Procedure

1.  Install Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer using either a Helm chart or the Kubernetes YAML file provided by ServiceNow.

    -   Install Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer using a Helm chart.

        1.  Edit the Helm install command.
            1.  In the following command, replace NAMESPACE, INSTANCE\_NAME, and CLUSTER\_NAME with the relevant values and replace the HELM\_URL with the URL of the most recent version, provided in the [Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(formerly CNO for Visibility\) Helm Chart and Kubernetes YAML file releases \[KB1564347\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1564347) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

                ```
                helm install -n NAMESPACE --set acceptEula=Y --set instance.name=INSTANCE_NAME --set clusterName="CLUSTER_NAME" {--set image.repository=COMPANY_REPO --set image.tag=COMPANY_TAG} {--set proxyUrl=http://proxy_host:proxy_port} k8s-informer HELM_URL
                ```

                **Note:**

                -   The curly brackets indicate that the code segments they surround are optional. Use these code segments if the image must be pulled from your organization’s image repository or if outgoing traffic from your cluster flows through a proxy.
                -   By passing `--set acceptEula=Y`, you agree to the End-User License Agreement. You can read the End-User License Agreement by extracting the EULA.pdf from informer-helm-&lt;VERSION\_NUMBER&gt;.tgz.
                -   If the Informer is installed in OpenShift, add the **openShift** parameter to the command and set it to `true`:

                    ```
                    helm install -n NAMESPACE --set acceptEula=Y --set instance.name=INSTANCE_NAME --set clusterName="CLUSTER_NAME" {--set image.repository=COMPANY_REPO --set image.tag=COMPANY_TAG} {--set proxyUrl=http://proxy_host:proxy_port} **\{--set openShift=true\}** k8s-informer HELM_URL
                    ```

                    **Note:** If the Informer is not installed in OpenShift, there is no need to set this parameter.

                -   If you use the Hybrid service maps to map resources both inside and outside the Kubernetes cluster, set the following parameters:

                    ```
                    --set bringIngressAddresses=true --set bringNodeExternalIPs=true --set discoverK8sServiceExternalIps=true --set openShift=true
                    ```

                -   Upgrading Existing Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer from Helm 3 to Helm 4: When Helm 4 is installed on your system and you want to migrate an existing Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer from Helm 3 to Helm 4, use the Server-Side Apply flag:

                    ```
                    helm upgrade k8s-informer <CHART_URL> --server-side=true [other flags] -n $NAMESPACE
                    ```

                    The `--server-side=true` flag explicitly migrates the Informer to Helm 4's Server-Side Apply model for improved conflict resolution.

            2.  In the command, configure additional settings as needed:

                -   [Change the full discovery frequency in Kubernetes Visibility Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/cnov-config-full-discovery-frequency.md)
                -   [Deactivate continuous discovery in Kubernetes Visibility Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/cnov-config-continuous-discovery-off.md)
                -   Suppress frequent changes in the Kubernetes cluster to reduce the load on your instance. When this feature is active, the Informer does not report changes before the configured threshold rate back to the instance. For more information, see the [Suppressing frequent changes in Kubernetes clusters reported by Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(formerly CNO for visibility\) \[KB1580745\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1580745) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
                -   Control the maximum number of full discoveries that informers can run on multiple clusters at the same time. For more information, see the [Scheduling Full Discoveries in Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(formerly CNO for Visibility\) \[KB1580250\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1580250) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
                -   [Enabling application service maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/enabling-application-service-maps.md)

        2.  Run the command.
    -   Install Kubernetes Visibility Agent Informer using the Kubernetes YAML file.
        1.  Download the Kubernetes YAML ZIP file provided in the [Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(formerly CNO for Visibility\) Helm Chart and Kubernetes YAML file releases \[KB1564347\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1564347) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
        2.  Extract the k8s\_informer.yaml and EULA.pdf files from the ZIP file.
        3.  Edit the k8s\_informer.yaml file.
            -   Change the value of ACCEPT\_EULA to `"Y"`, as follows:

                ```
                - name: ACCEPT_EULA
                  value: "Y"
                ```

                **Note:** By changing the value to `"Y"`, you agree to the End-User License Agreement included in the EULA.pdf file.

            -   Replace all occurrences of &lt;NAMESPACE&gt; with the namespace in which you want to install the Informer.
            -   Replace all occurrences of &lt;INSTANCE\_NAME&gt; with the name of your instance, without the domain name.
            -   Replace &lt;CLUSTER\_NAME&gt; with the name of your cluster as it appears in the CMDB.
            -   If the Informer is installed in OpenShift, change the value of the OPENSHIFT environment variable to `true`.
            -   [Enabling application service maps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/enabling-application-service-maps.md)
        4.  If you use the Hybrid service maps to map resources both inside and outside the Kubernetes cluster, set the following parameters:

            ```
            - name: BRING_INGRESS_ADDRESSES value: "true" - name: BRING_NODE_EXTERNAL_IPS value: "true" - name: DISCOVER_K8S_SERVICE_EXTERNAL_IP value: "true" - name: OPENSHIFT value: "true" 
            ```

        5.  Run the command:

            ```
            kubectl apply -f k8s_informer.yaml
            ```


## Result

Kubernetes Visibility Agent is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster and begins to stream data into your instance.
