# Cloud Resources Explorer

Use the ServiceNow® Cloud Resources Explorer to filter and visualize the distribution of resources across your multi cloud estate. Gain insight into operational information such as stale resources and cloud event inflow rates.

**Important:** Starting with the Zurich release, Cloud Discovery Workspace is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances, but will continue to be supported. For similar reporting, refer to the [Cloud asset explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/cloud-account-management/viewing-cloud-asset-explorer.md) in the Cloud Discovery store application.

The Cloud Resources Explorer supports the following cloud providers:

-   Amazon Web Services.
-   Microsoft Azure public clouds.
-   VMware vCenter.
-   Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) \(Supported with Performance Analytics Content Pack for Cloud Resources version 1.2.1 and higher\).

## Required ServiceNow AI Platform roles

The sn\_cloud\_ops\_ws.cloud\_ops\_admin role is required to view the Cloud Resources Explorer.

## Access the Cloud Resources Explorer

To open the Cloud Resources Explorer, navigate to **All** &gt; **Cloud Discovery Workspace** &gt; **Cloud Resources Explorer**.

## Use cases

For examples of how different people in your organization would use this dashboard, see these use cases.

-   Gain insight into the cloud resources inventory count and the current size of the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\), and how many objects are under the purview.
-   Gain insight into fault-related information such as Cloud Discovery errors.
-   Gain insight into operational information such as the inflow and processing rate of the event.
-   Gain insight into the health of your CMDB.
-   Gain insight into the distribution of resources across the on-prem cloud and the public clouds.

</table>## Indicators

-   **Cloud Discovery errors**

    Total Cloud Discovery errors encountered over time.

-   **Stale CIs &gt; 30 days**

    If a CI isn't updated in the last 30 days, it's considered as a stale CI.

    A stale CI indicates that the CI exists in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\), but it may or may not exist in the datacenter. Identifying the stale CIs is important for maintaining a healthy CMDB.

    Here are some of the scenarios that leads to the creation of stale CIs:

    -   The cloud resource doesn't exist, but its deletion isn't updated in the CMDB.
    -   The device may still be on the network, but the automated discovery process can't connect to the device to rediscover it.
    -   The device exists on the network and it's accessible, but the identification process isn't recognizing it uniquely. Therefore, Cloud Discovery has created a duplicate CI in the CMDB.

This report displays the count of the top 10 CI classes discovered over time.You can select a report entry from the Configuration item classes report to view the analytics table on which the report entry is based. If you've selected a specific cloud provider, then the analytics table of that specific CI appears. Otherwise, the parent analytics table for that CI type appears.

 For example, selecting Google from the Cloud resources filter and the Storage Volume bar opens the dedicated Google Storage Volume CI analytics table. If you select All Platforms from the Cloud resources filter and select the Storage Volume bar from the report, the parent analytics table of the storage volume CI appears.

</table>To populate the Cloud Analytics \[sn\_disco\_cd\_analytics\] table, the Cloud Resources Explorer uses the same set of scheduled jobs as the Performance Analytics Content Pack for Cloud Resources. For more information on the scheduled jobs, see [Cloud Resources dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/cloud-resources-dashboard.md).

To view the details of the OS images discovered in the AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP clouds, Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns store app version 1.0.87 or later must be installed in the instance. Also, the **sn\_cmdb\_ci\_class.use\_single\_cloud\_os\_image** property must be set to `true`.

Cloud resources filter

</td><td>

Choice-based filter

</td><td>

Use the cloud resources filter to select and visualize the cloud resources data of interest.

 By default, the Cloud Resources Explorer displays data for all the cloud resources across the cloud providers of your organization. Only the cloud providers that you've selected in the Cloud provider selection page of the Cloud Discovery Workspace app appear in the cloud resources filter.

 You have the choice of the following cascading filters:

-   Platform: Select the cloud provider with the resources data that you want to visualize.
-   Region: Select the region or datacenter with the resources data that you want to visualize.
-   Service account: Select the service account with the resources data that you want to visualize.
-   CI class: Select the CI class with the resources data that you want to visualize.
-   Resource group: Select the resource group with the resources data that you want to visualize.

This field is available only when `Azure` is selected from the Platform drop-down list.


 You can filter the Incoming events report based on the Platform filter only. The data displayed in the Cloud Discovery errors indicator isn't affected by the criteria selected in the Cloud resources filter.
