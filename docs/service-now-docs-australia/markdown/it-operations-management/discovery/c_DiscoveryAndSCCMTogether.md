# Discovery and SCCM together

Use these guidelines to avoid common issues when you use Discovery and System Center Configuration Manager \(SCCM\) together.

You must decide if you will use Asset Intelligence \(AI\) or non-AI software data sources. Because the software correlation data is tracked differently for each of these data sources, you should avoid switching back and forth between the two. If you must switch between data sources, remove all the software installation records imported by SCCM before the switch occurs.

When Software Asset Management is not enabled, software installation records are stored in the Software Instance \[cmdb\_software\_instance\] table. When Software Asset Management is enabled, software installation records are stored in the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table.

**Note:** If records aren't removed before the switch, duplicate records may exist. In the event that AI and non-AI data becomes mixed, clear the Software Installation table.

## Overview of Service Graph connector for Microsoft SCCM

Use the Service Graph connector for Microsoft SCCM to pull data from SCCM into your ServiceNow instance. See [Service Graph connector for Microsoft SCCM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-integration-sccm.md) for more details.

**Note:** If you upgrade your instance to a version of the ServiceNow AI Platform that does not provide support for your version of SCCM, you can continue to use that version. However, all new instances require the use of a supported SCCM version.

## Upgrading to a later version

The ServiceNow SCCM integrations are self-contained and can exist independently. They each use their own import set tables, data sources and transform maps. However, all SCCM integrations will transform data into the same tables within the ServiceNow CMDB. To avoid the data being overwritten by another source:

-   Use one SCCM integration and disable all other SCCM scheduled imports.
-   Perform a [full import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/how-sccm-integration-works.md) to clear the cmdb\_software\_instance table, the cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install table, and other tables of old SCCM data.

## Collect software data with either SCCM or Discovery

When Discovery and SCCM are both enabled on a system, the software records found through both tools could overwrite each other.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

To determine how software data is collected, configure the **glide.discovery.software\_sccm\_managed** property.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Discovery Definition** &gt; **Properties**.

2.  Set the **Windows software is SCCM managed** property \(**glide.discovery.software\_sccm\_managed**\) appropriately.

    If this property is set to **Yes**, software for computer CIs is populated in the CMDB by SCCM. An internal process determines that the computer is managed by SCCM, and Discovery does not populate the software records for Windows software data. The following information level message is written to the Discovery log file.

    `Skipping software population because the CI is managed by SCCM`

    If the check box is cleared, the property is set to **No**, and the system manages software data with Windows.

3.  Click **Save**.

    **Important:** If SCCM Integration is active before Discovery is enabled and the property is enabled, Discovery ignores the population of software for any CIs that are also imported through SCCM. If Discovery is enabled before the SCCM Integration, it is possible for software installation data from both sources to be mixed.


### What to do next

Use these Discovery properties to avoid software data discrepancy between Discovery and SCCM: **glide.discovery.enable.software\_simplify** and **glide.discovery.enable.software\_simplify\_sccm**. See [Discovery properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_DiscoveryProperties.md) for more information.
