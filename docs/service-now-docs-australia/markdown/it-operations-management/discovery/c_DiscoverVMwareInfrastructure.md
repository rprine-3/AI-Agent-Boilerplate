# Discovery for VMware virtualization

A Discovery schedule for VMware virtualization discovers vCenter and ESX hosts and individual ESXi hosts that manage VMs and related components without a vCenter.

The following options are available for discovering VMware vCenter data:

-   Discovery runs the [VMware - vCenter Datacenters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/r_ListOfDiscoveryProbes.md) probe when it identifies a VMware vCenter process running on a Windows machine or detects activity with the vmapp port probe.
-   [Classic Orchestration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/r-orchestration.md) runs any of the vCenter probes from a workflow.

Use standalone ESXi discovery to discover VMware data without a vCenter.

**Note:** See the knowledge article [KB0687582](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0687582) for information on model\_id and manufacturer.
