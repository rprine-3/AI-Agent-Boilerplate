# Cloud Discovery schedules dashboard in Cloud Discovery Workspace

The Cloud Discovery schedules dashboard displays information about the selected discovery run.

By default, the list shows all the Cloud Discovery schedules in alphabetical order, regardless of their current running status. Use the schedule filter to filter the Cloud Discovery schedules. You can filter the schedules by cloud provider, schedule name, or both. You can also sort the filtered list by any one of the following criteria:-   **Alphabetically**: Sort the schedule names alphabetically.
-   **Errors**: Sort by the count of errors encountered during the discovery.
-   **Discovery in progress**: Sort by status of the discovery.

 After filtering the schedule, select the discovery run from the Report drop-down list to visualize its data in the schedules dashboard displayed on the **Results** tab.

 **Note:**

Only the last 10 discovery runs appear in the Report drop-down list.
