# Schedule details data visualizations

When you select a schedule from the Schedules page in Discovery Admin Workspace, the schedule details page opens. The **Overview** tab of that page displays data visualizations showing key metrics for the schedule, such as total runs, CI counts, errors, and run duration.

**Note:** For certificate discovery schedules, the Total CIs and CIs discovered count visualizations are replaced by the Total Certificates Discovered and Certificates discovered count visualizations, respectively. Certificate discovery is available in Discovery Admin Workspace starting with v1.20.0 and requires the Brazil, Australia, or Zurich release starting with Patch 8.
