# Configure Dynatrace metric pull connector

Configure metric pull connectors that require a script, connector definition, and connector instance to pull metrics from external sources. These connectors automate the data retrieval process, ensuring the seamless integration of external metrics into your system for efficient monitoring and performance analysis.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

Configure the Dynatrace API Key credential from **All** &gt; **Connections and Credentials** &gt; **Credentials**. For more information on how to configure Dynatrace API Key credential, see [API key credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/API-key-credential-form.md).

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation pane, select the AIOps configuration center icon \[Omitted image "icon-itom-aiops-config.png"\] Alt text: ITOM AIOps configuration center icon.

    The ITOM AIOps configuration center page appears. The configuration center is a centralized workspace. Use it to configure and manage AIOps features from a single place.

3.  On the ITOM AIOps configuration center page, under the **Setup** &gt; **Integrations** section, select **Manage Installed integrations**.

4.  In the **Browse Integrations** tab, select the **All integrations** drop-down list and select **Metrics** &gt; **Pull**.

    \[Omitted image "sow-metricintegration-pull.png"\] Alt text: Metric pull integrations.

    Only metric pull connector tiles are displayed.

5.  Select the **Dynatrace Metrics** connector tile.

6.  In the **Provide details** section, enter the following information and select **Next**.

    -   In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the connector type.
    -   In the **Data source** field, the external source for retrieving metrics is auto-populated based on the tile type you select.

        In this case, select **Dynatrace**.

    -   In the **Description** field, enter brief information about this connector.
7.  In the **Set data retrieval method** section, enter the following information:

    -   In the **Hostname/Host IP** field, enter the IP address that is related to the Dynatrace server.
    -   From the **Credentials** drop-down list, select the valid credentials to access the metrics source host.

        Select the credential.

    -   In the **Metric collection schedule \(in seconds\)** field, enter the time interval \(in seconds\) at which the connector retrieves metrics from the source host.

        The default value is 60 seconds.

    -   In the **MID Server** field, select a MID Server that collects metric data from external tools and securely sends it to ServiceNow.

        If none are available, ensure one is installed, running, and has the required capabilities. If none are available, ensure one is installed, running, and has the required capabilities. For example, the **Metric Intelligence Context** must be running on the same MID Server that you are configuring.

        **Note:** You can select multiple MID Server. The system randomly assigns one as the primary and uses the others as backups.

8.  If you want to customize configurations to meet specific requirements, select **Advanced settings** and fill in the form.

    For more information on fields, see [Dynatrace advanced settings fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/dynatrace-advanced-settings-fields.md).

9.  Test the connector before activating it by selecting **Test and Save**.

10. To save the connector, select **Save**.

11. To activate the pull connector, select **Activate**.

    The metric pull connector is activated and its tile is displayed in the **Installed Integrations** tab. When you open the tile, you can find the **Overview**, **Details**, and **Data retrieval method** tabs.

    The **Overview** tab allows you to verify that the connector is running and collecting data. It also offers options to improve system settings, such as refining alert definitions or enhancing binding configurations.

    The **Details** tab allows you to update the connector's general information \(such as name or description\) and displays any errors encountered during its operation.

    The **Data Retrieval Method** tab contains the connector settings \(such as host, port, and credentials\) and may provide additional details for issues like MID Server errors.
