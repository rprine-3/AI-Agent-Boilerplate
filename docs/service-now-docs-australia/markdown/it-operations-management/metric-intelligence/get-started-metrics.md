# Get started with Metric Intelligence

Complete the following setup and initial configuration steps to start using Metric Intelligence.

## Before you begin

Activate the Metric Intelligence plugin \(com.snc.sa.metric\).

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin

## About this task

Metrics have an expiration date. You can continue receiving data without interruption when a metric’s expiration date arrives by pushing ahead the expiration date. For details, contact customer support.

Metric Intelligence guided setup provides a sequence of tasks that help you configure Metric Intelligence on your ServiceNow instance. To open Metric Intelligence guided setup, navigate to **Guided Setup** &gt; **ITOM Guided Setup**, and click **Continue**. Then scroll to **Metric Intelligence**, and click **Continue**. For more information about using the guided setup interface, see [Using guided setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/guided-setup.md).
