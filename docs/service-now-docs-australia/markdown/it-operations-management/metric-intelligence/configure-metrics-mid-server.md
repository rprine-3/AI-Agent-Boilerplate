2.  Click the MID Server that you want to configure for Metric Intelligence.

3.  Add the Metric Intelligence application:

    1.  At the center of the MID Server form, click **Supported Applications**.

    2.  In the **Supported Applications** section, click **Edit**.

    3.  In the slushbucket, select **OperationalIntelligence** and click the **&gt;** add button.

    4.  Click **Save**.
