# Set up Azure service accounts

Create and configure cloud service accounts at ServiceNow AI Platform for the corresponding Microsoft Azure accounts.

## Verify the REST API Permissions

Download the [Cloud Discovery patterns spreadsheet](https://downloads.docs.servicenow.com/resource/enus/api/servicenow-discovery-patterns-api-details.xlsx) so you can grant user permissions required for running the Discovery patterns. In addition to permissions, the spreadsheet also includes useful information such as pattern names, types, CI Classes, and links to vendor documentation. New patterns are available quarterly, so check periodically to be sure you have the latest version of the spreadsheet.

## Before you begin

-   **Ensure the configuration of Azure credentials**

    For more information, see [Create Azure cloud credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/create-azure-cloud-credentials.md) and [Configuration steps for Azure Service Principal User and Credentials \(KB2202765\)](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2202765)

-   **Ensure that you are familiar with the hierarchy of the Azure service accounts in your environment.**

    Set up the service accounts at ServiceNow AI Platform to reflect the hierarchy of your environment. You can set up the Azure service accounts for the following Azure account types:

    -   Management group.
    -   Subscription.

Role required: discovery\_admin

## About this task

A service account is a secure record on your instance that stores the credentials and access information for your provider account. Discovery uses the information to access your provider account to get data on each resource in each specified datacenter. A cloud account is the logical representation in cloud management of all or part of your managed cloud infrastructure. A cloud account can include multiple service accounts—even service accounts from different providers. For each service account, you specify which datacenter to include in the cloud account.

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, enter `cmdb_ci_cloud_service_account.list`.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields by the following order:

    1.  Select the datacenter.
    2.  Select the check box of the **Is management account** if your are creating a service account for a management group.
    3.  Select **Should pull events** to preform event-based discovery. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Alert driven discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/microsoft-azure-alert-driven-discovery.md)
