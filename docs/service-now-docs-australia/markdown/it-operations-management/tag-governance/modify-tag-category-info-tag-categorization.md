# Modify tag category information for Tag Categorization

Modify tag category definitions to support Tag Categorization and ensure that tag categories align with your requirements for data management and classification.

## Before you begin

Verify that you have installed version 1.16.3 of Service Mapping Plus to access to the CI tag category and CI tag key tables. For more information, see [Install Service Mapping Plus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/service-mapping/install-service-mapping-plus.md).

Role required: tag\_governance\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Tag Governance** &gt; **Tag Categories**.

2.  Verify that you're in the leaf domain.

    1.  In the page header, select the globe icon \(\[Omitted image "globe-icon.png"\]\).

    2.  Select **Domain scope**, and choose the appropriate leaf domain.

3.  Select the category definition for the tag category you want to modify.

4.  In the **Regex** field, modify the definition.

    You can delete an existing value \(regex\) or add a new value \(regex\) in this field.

5.  Enter a value in the **Priority** field to set a priority for this tag category.

    Because a tag key can belong to multiple categories. setting the priority ensures that Tag Categorization maps CIs to the correct category.

6.  Select **Update** to save the changes.

7.  If you want to apply your changes immediately rather than waiting for the automatic update within 24 hours, select the **Re-Categorize Tags** button.
