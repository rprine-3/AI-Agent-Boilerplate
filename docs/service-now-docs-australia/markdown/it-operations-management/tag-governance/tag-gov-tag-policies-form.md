# Tag Policies form

You use the Tag Policy form to configure tag compliance and health policies that are used in tag audits runs on discovered cloud resources or CIs.

<table id="table_nwh_ghs_21c"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Unique and descriptive name for the policy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short Description

</td><td>

A short summary that describes the policy.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Policy Type

</td><td>

Policy type selection for the tag compliance and health audit.-   Tag Count Policy: Check for a specific count of tags for CIs.
-   Tag Key Policy: Check for tags with specific values \(string expressions\).
-   Tag Key &amp; Value Policy: Check for key-value pair and value strings.
-   Tag Category Policy: Check for tags with a specific category.

**Important:** You must work in a leaf domain to use the Tag Category Policy.


Based on your selection, you will specify additional values.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Expected Tag Count

</td><td>

This field appears only when the **Tag Count Policy** policy type is selected.

CIs with fewer tags than the specified number are considered as failed or non-compliant. CIs that meet the value are considered certified against this policy.For example, if you specify `4`, the policy checks whether the CIs have at least four tags specified.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Expected Tag Keys

</td><td>

This field appears only when the **Tag Key Policy** policy type is selected.

Policy that checks discovered CIs for the tags specified in the **Expected Tag Keys** field. Specify multiple tags or string expressions in a comma-separated list.

For example, if you specify `prod,finance,cost center` the policy checks whether the CIs have all the specified tags. CIs that have all the specified tags as certified or fully compliant. If CIs are missing any of the listed tags, they’re considered failed or non-compliant.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Tag Key &amp; Value Checks

</td><td>

Execute this policy to check discovered CIs for the tag key and values specified in the **Tag Keys &amp; Value Checks** field.You can specify multiple tag key &amp; value pairs or specify a script to check for a collection of values.

For example, you can specify `user` in the **Key** field, and `admin` in the **Value** field.**Note:**

The **Script** field appears only when **Tag Key &amp; Value Policy** is selected in the **Policy Type** field. Use the **Script** field to specify multiple values to return a string set.

Example code

```
// The script should
        return a string set to tagValues variable.

         // the code sets the
        tagValues array with name of the CI

        // by this the check will
        be done for the tag to match the CI’s name
  
        tagValues =  [ci.name.toString()];

```
