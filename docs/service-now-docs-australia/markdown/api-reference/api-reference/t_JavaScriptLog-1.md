# Access the JavaScript log

## About this task

The steps to access the JavaScript debug window depend on which UI version you're using.

**Note:** The JavaScript debug window is not supported with Next Experience. For more information about supported features in Next Experience, see [Considerations for activating Next Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-adoption-paths.md).
