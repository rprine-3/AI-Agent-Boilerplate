# Script Debugger Scripts - Background support

The Scripts - Background module does not support setting breakpoints directly in the script field. You can however, set breakpoints in the script objects called or triggered by the Scripts - Background module.

While running arbitrary JavaScript code in the **Scripts - Background** module, the Script Debugger can only pause scripts when you:

-   Call a script include containing breakpoints.
-   Trigger a business rule containing breakpoints.
-   Trigger a script action containing breakpoints.
