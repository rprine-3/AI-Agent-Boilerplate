# Context menu in the syntax editor

View the context menu for script includes, Glide APIs, and tables in the JavaScript syntax editor.

In the syntax editor, bold font is used for tokens that have a context menu. Right-click the token to view context menu options. With the context menu options, your users can navigate to:

-   Script include definitions
-   Glide API documentation
-   System and custom table definitions and data
