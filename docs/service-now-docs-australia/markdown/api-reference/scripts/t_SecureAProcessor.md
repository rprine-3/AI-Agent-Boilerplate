# Secure and protect a processor

You can protect your processor against unauthorized use by using role restrictions, and protect it by requiring a CSRF token.

## About this task

**Note:** This feature is deprecated. While legacy, existing custom processors continue to be supported, creating new custom processors has been deprecated. Instead, use the [Scripted REST APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).

You can re-use a table's user role restrictions to protect it from access by your processor. This protection method assumes the processor will access table data.

## Procedure

1.  Create or select a user role that has access to the table the processor script calls.

2.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Processors**.

3.  In **Script**, add the following code block.

    ```
    var now_GR = new GlideRecord('your_table_name');
    // canRead() compares the table’s ACL to the user making this request, and returns true if the logged-in user has read access to this table
    if(gr.canRead())  
    { 
      // Perform table query here  
      g_processor.writeOutput('Success!'); 
    } else { 
      g_processor.writeOutput('You do not have permission to read table your_table_name'); 
    }
    ```

4.  Update the code block to use other access restrictions as needed.

    Available access functions include:

    -   canCreate\(\)
    -   canRead\(\)
    -   canWrite\(\)
    -   canDelete\(\)
5.  Click **Update**.
