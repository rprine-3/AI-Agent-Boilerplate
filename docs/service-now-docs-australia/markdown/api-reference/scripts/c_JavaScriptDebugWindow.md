# JavaScript debug window

The JavaScript debug window appears in a bottom pane of the user interface when an administrator turns on debugging.

**Note:** The JavaScript debug window is not supported with Next Experience. For more information about supported features in Next Experience, see [Considerations for activating Next Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-adoption-paths.md).

Use the debug window to access these tools.

-   JavaScript Log: JavaScript that runs on the browser, such as client scripts, can include a call to jslog\(\) to send information to the JavaScript log.
-   Field Watcher: a tool that tracks and displays all actions that the system performs on a selected form field.

The JavaScript debug window enables access to the JavaScript Log and the Field Watcher tools.
-   **[Watching fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_FieldWatcher.md)**

To write to the debug log in your client-side JavaScript, or UI policies, make a call to the global function `jslog()`.
