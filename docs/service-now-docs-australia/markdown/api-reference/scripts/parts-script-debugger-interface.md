# Script Debugger user interface

The Script Debugger user interface \(UI\) displays information about breakpoints set, the call stack and line number of the currently executing script line, details about variables and transactions, and status of console.

\[Omitted image "script\_debugger\_paused.png"\] Alt text: Script debugger paused

|User interface element|Description|
|----------------------|-----------|
|Breakpoints|Displays a list of the breakpoints set by script type, script name, and line number. The debugger updates this list as you add and remove breakpoints.|
|Call stack|Displays a list of script calls that preceded or invoked the current line number. This information is only visible when the debugger pauses on a breakpoint.|
|Transaction details|Displays information about the current transaction. This information is only visible when the debugger pauses on a breakpoint.|
|Status|Displays if the debugger is waiting for a breakpoint, paused on a breakpoint, or has encountered an exception.|
|User|Displays the name of the user who is running the current debugger session.|
|Coding pane header|Displays the script type and name of the script in the coding pane.|
|Breakpoint icon|Indicates the line number where the debugger pauses when evaluating the current script.|
|Pause debugging button|Stops any current debugging session, and disables the Script Debugger for the current user. The Script Debugger doesn't pause on breakpoints for the current user until it's restarted.|
|Console|Displays a command line interface used for evaluating expressions during runtime. The console is available only when the script execution is paused.|
|Resume script execution button|Advances from the current breakpoint to the next breakpoint. If there are no other breakpoints, the script runs to completion.|
|Step over next function call button|Advances past the method that's about to be called, executing the method as a single step.|
|Step into next function call|Advances to the first line of executed code within a method call. Stepping into a method updates the current position within the call stack. If the user doesn't have read access to the method call, then this control acts like step over instead.|
|Step out of current function|Exits from current method call and returns to the calling script from the call stack. If the user isn't within a method call, then this control acts like step over instead.|
|Local|Displays a list of local scope JavaScript variable names and their values. This information is only visible when the debugger pauses on a breakpoint.|
|Closures|Displays a list of global scope JavaScript variable names and their values set by function closure. This information is only visible when the debugger pauses on a breakpoint.|
|Global|Displays a list of global scope JavaScript variable names and their values. This information is only visible when the debugger pauses on a breakpoint.|

## Session Log page

|User interface element|Description|
|----------------------|-----------|
|Transactions|Transaction ID. Displays information about the current transaction.|
|Filter for log text|Field to enter text to filter the logs that contain a specific text.|
|Debug Output|Option to filter logs based on the dynamically loaded debug output types. For example, **Security Rule**.|
|Apps|Option to filter logs based on the dynamically loaded apps. For example, **Service Management Integrations**.|
|Message Type|Option to filter logs based on the dynamically log levels. For example, **Info**.|
|Clear log|Clears all logs.|
|Download log|Download the logs in HTML file format.|
|Settings|Session debug options. For information about the debug options, see [Session debug](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_SessionDebug.md).|

-   **[Script Tracer and debugging scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/script-tracer.md)**  
The Script Tracer can help you filter your debugging search to quickly narrow down script problems. You can identify lines of scripts in the Glide record that have undergone change during execution. Finding those specific lines of scripts rather than doing a wide search helps save time and improves productivity.
-   **[Script Debugger status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/script-debugger-status.md)**  
The Script Debugger status determines what debugging actions are available and what information it can display.
-   **[Transaction details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/transaction-details.md)**  
The Script Debugger displays transaction details for the current paused user session.
-   **[Script Debugger step-through and console controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/step-through-controls.md)**  
After the Script Debugger pauses a script, use the step-through controls to move between script lines and move between scripts in the call stack. Use the Console controls to expand console, collapse console, clear console, and rerun expressions.
