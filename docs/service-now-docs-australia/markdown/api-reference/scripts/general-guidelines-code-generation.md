# General guidelines for code generation

Use these general guidelines for code generation to get better code suggestions and create useful and accurate scripts.

## Writing prompts

-   **Write clear and specific but concise prompts**

    Specify the expected outcome and context clearly. Include important details like task requirements, specific APIs if you know them, and any limitations.

-   **Experiment with different prompts**
    -   Consider adjusting your task instructions and incorporating examples. Observe how the code suggestions change with different prompt styles and levels of detail.
    -   Keep track of your prompts, along with any modifications and instructions for generating prompts that meet your specifications.
-   **Character limit of the prompts**

    Short and concise prompts generate better outcomes.

    On reaching 200 characters, a message appears to inform you that short, focused, task-oriented directions yield the best results.

    Input beyond 300 characters isn’t allowed.

</table>## Reviewing code

-   **Review code**

    Implement strict and detailed reviews of the AI-generated code to determine its accuracy, efficiency, and how well it adheres to your coding standards.

-   **Test code**

    Validate the code by running it against test cases in controlled environments to verify that it functions according to your requirements.
