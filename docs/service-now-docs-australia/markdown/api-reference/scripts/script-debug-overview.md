# Debugging scripts

Debug scripts using session logs and ServiceNow AI Platform debugging tools such as a walk-through script debugger and error messages that display in the UI.

## Debugging server-side scripts

Use the Script Debugger and session logs to debug server-side code. For more information, see [Script Debugger and Session Log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/script-debugger.md).

You can also use session debug to display error messages related to a server-side script that runs as a result of a client-side change. For more information, see [Debugging sessions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_SessionDebug.md).

GSLog is a script include that simplifies script logging and debugging by implementing levels of log output, selectable by per-caller identified sys\_properties values. For more information, see [GSLog API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/GSLogBoth.md).

## Debugging client-side scripts

Use session debug to display debugging messages in the user interface. For more information, see [Debugging sessions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_SessionDebug.md). Use the session log to view logging information for script includes and custom UIs, such as Agent Workspace.

You can also debug client-side scripts using browser-based developers tools.

## Debugging applications and scopes

Use the application debugging options to understand how a script's application scope might affect your application, table, or record. You may need to update cross-scope privileges to troubleshoot scope access issues. See [Debugging applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_DebuggingApplications.md).

-   **[Script Debugger and Session Log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/script-debugger.md)**  
The Script Debugger enables users with the script\_debugger role to debug server-side JavaScript. Users with the log\_debugger role can use the Session Log to view and download required logs.
-   **[Debugging sessions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_SessionDebug.md)**  
Enable session debugging to display debugging messages in the user interface.
-   **[Debugging applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_DebuggingApplications.md)**  
Application developers can display debug messages about configuration records to help them troubleshoot issues. The Debug Scopes module provides information about the system switching between custom applications to run server-side scripts.
-   **[Debugging business rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/r_DebuggingBusinessRules.md)**  
Debugging business rules can be achieved with resources available in the ServiceNow product.
-   **[Debugging classifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/r_DebuggingClassifications.md)**  
You must add a system property to enable classification debugging.
-   **[JS Code Coverage Debug](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/js-code-coverage-debug.md)**  
JS Code Coverage Debug allows administrators and application developers to log the server-side scripts triggered during a user session and then review which lines of code the system ran.
-   **[JavaScript debug window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_JavaScriptDebugWindow.md)**  
The JavaScript debug window appears in a bottom pane of the user interface when an administrator turns on debugging.
