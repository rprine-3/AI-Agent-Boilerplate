# Configure certificate and create an OAuth Entity

You must configure your ServiceNow instance to accept and exchange a JSON Web Token \(JWT\) for an OAuth access token. To enable this functionality you must install a certificate that matches the JWT provider’s private key on the ServiceNow instance that you will use as the JWT Token consumer and create an OAuth Entity on that instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  If not already configured, configure your ServiceNow instance as an OAuth JWT provider.

    For details, see [Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients \(machine to machine integration\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-jwt-endpoint.md).

2.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Certificates**.

3.  Select **New** and then create a new public certificate as shown in the following image.

    \[Omitted image "mobile\_sdk-image-x509-cert.png"\] Alt text: Mobile SDK iOS X.509 certificate

    For details on creating this certificate, see [Update your X.509 certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/update-cert-whois.md).

4.  Create an OAuth Entity.

    For details, see [Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients \(machine to machine integration\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-jwt-endpoint.md).

5.  Add and select the **Public Client** field to the form.

    **Note:** This field is not shown by default.

6.  Save the record.

7.  Add a JWT Verifier Map entry.

    After the record is saved, a new section called **Jwt Verifier Maps** appears at the bottom of the form.

    1.  Add a name in the **Name** field, this can be whatever name you choose, and select the certificate that was added.

        The other fields, **Kid** and **Shared key**, can be left blank, as they are auto-filled.

8.  Ensure that the form contains information similar to the following once you are finished with your configuration:
