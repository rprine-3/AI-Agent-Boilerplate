# Download and install the Mobile SDK library

Before you can create mobile applications that interact with your ServiceNow instance, you must first download and install the ServiceNow Mobile SDK Android library.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

Before you start the download and installation process, ensure that your development environment meets the following minimum requirements:

-   ServiceNow instance must be Washington DC or later.
-   Android version must be API 29 or later.

## Procedure

1.  Download the Mobile SDK Android library, called NowSDK, from the ServiceNow Store.

    You can find the Android libraries in the following locations:

    -   Mobile SDK: [https://store.servicenow.com/sn\_appstore\_store.do\#!/store/application/52821846803120101040fe43e5b9ee8c](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/52821846803120101040fe43e5b9ee8c)
    -   Android library: [https://store.servicenow.com/sn\_appstore\_store.do\#!/store/application/f06b29b487ea3014970e2178cebb3511](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/f06b29b487ea3014970e2178cebb3511)
    For details on installing applications on your instance, see [Administering applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/administering-applications.md).

2.  Unzip the NowSDK file into a temporary folder.

3.  Use Android Studio IDE to import the NowSDK as a module into your project.

    1.  In Android Studio IDE, select **File -&gt; New -&gt; Import Module**.

        \[Omitted image "mobsdk-and-AS-import\_mod.png"\] Alt text: Android Studio IDE Import Module

    2.  When prompted for the source path, select **nowsdk**.

        \[Omitted image "mobsdk-and-AS-select-nowsdk.png"\] Alt text: Android Studio IDE select nowsdk

        As the project is imported, the IDE will report a build error.

    3.  To resolve any build errors, make sure the following key-value pairs are added inside the nowsdk module’s  `build.gradle` file.

        This information defines the versions for each of the transitive dependencies of the NowSDK.

        ```
        ext {
            kotlin_version = "2.1.0"
            hilt_version = "2.55"
            navigationVersion = '2.8.5'
            mapsKtxVersion = '3.4.0'
            mapsComposeVersion = '2.11.0'
            androidxCoreVersion = '1.13.1'
            recyclerViewVersion = '1.3.2'
            appCompatVersion = '1.6.1'
            constraintLayoutVersion = '2.2.0'
            lifecycleVersion = '2.8.7'
            roomRuntimeVersion = '2.6.1'
            roomRxJavaVersion = '2.6.1'
            timberVersion = '5.0.1'
            rxAndroidVersion = '3.0.2'
            rxJavaVersion = '3.1.10'
            rxKotlinVersion = '3.0.1'
            daggerVersion = '2.55'
            androidxAnnotationVersion = '1.9.1'
            materialVersion = '1.9.0'
            retrofitVersion = '2.11.0'
            okhttpVersion = '4.12.0'
            cardViewVersion = '1.0.0'
            gsonVersion = '2.11.0'
            firebaseBomVersion = '33.7.0'
            exifinterfaceVersion = '1.3.7'
            kotlinxCoroutinesVersion = '1.10.1'
            moshiVersion = '1.15.2'
            androidxBrowserVersion = '1.8.0'
            composeBomVersion = '2025.01.00'
            composeViewmodelVersion = '2.5.1'
            composeActivityVersion = '1.9.3'
            jsoupVersion= '1.18.3'
            cameraxVersion = '1.2.3'
            lottieVersion = '6.6.1'
            fragmentKtxVersion = '1.5.2'
            coroutinesCoreVersion = '1.5.1'
            coroutinesAndroidVersion = '1.5.1'
        }
        ```

    4.  In the nowsdk module’s  `build.gradle`  file, ensure that the following section is added to include the NowSDK repositories.

        ```
        rootProject.allprojects {
          repositories {
            flatDir { dirs rootProject.rootDir.path + "/nowsdk/libs" }
          }
        }
        ```

    5.  In the app level `build.gradle` file, add the NowSDK as a dependency.

        ```
        dependencies {
          // NowSDK
          implementation project (":nowsdk")
        
        ```

        Once `gradle` syncs, you should be able to reference the NowSDK APIs.
