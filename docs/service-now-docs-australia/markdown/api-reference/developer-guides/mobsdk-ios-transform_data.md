# Transform data

The NowData framework provides the ability to easily transform data into records.

Using the [NowRecord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/cllent-mobile-api-reference/NowRecordiOSAPI.md) convenience structure, which contains the properties `sysId` and `fields`, you can easily transform data into a record. Whenever you obtain a `Data` wrapping `Result` or `Publisher`, you can easily transform it into a `NowRecord` wrapping `Result` or `Publisher` using the convertToRecord\(\) and convertToRecords\(\) methods. For additional information, see [NowTableService class - iOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/cllent-mobile-api-reference/NowTableServiceiOSAPI.md).

**Note:** While NowRecord makes it very easy to quickly obtain data, depending on your use case, the Codable methods might be preferable as a strongly typed Codable structure provides more flexibility than a collection of "any" fields.
