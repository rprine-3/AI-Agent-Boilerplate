# Archive your application for publishing

It is important to disable **rebuild from bitcode** when archiving your application for publication for release.

To disable rebuild from bitcode, either set **ENABLE\_BITCODE** to `NO` in your project settings or clear the **Rebuild from Bitcode** check box when using Xcode to distribute your application.
