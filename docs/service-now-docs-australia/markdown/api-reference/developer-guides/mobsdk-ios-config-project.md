# Configure your project

Before writing any application that leverages the Mobile SDK for iOS, you must configure your project to use the SDK.

## Procedure

1.  Add the Mobile SDK to your project.

    1.  In Xcode, drag the NowKit folder from Finder on to your Project Navigator pane \(⌘+1\). Xcode recognizes the folder as a Swift package and displays a folder icon next to **NowKit**.

    2.  Add the Mobile SDK to your target in the **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section of the project’s general settings by pressing the **+** icon and selecting the **NowKit** framework from the presented list.

2.  Update your project settings.

    The SDK uses several device features which require user permissions. You’ll need to add SDK feature grouped entries to your project’s Info.plist for the following keys:

    -   NowChat
        -   NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
        -   NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
        -   NSMicrophoneUsageDescription
        -   NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription
    -   NowWeb
        -   NSCameraUsageDescription
        -   NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
    Ensure that you provide messages that are helpful to customers, such as the following:

    ```
    … 
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key> 
    <string>[Your App] requires permission to access your camera to take attachment photos and scan barcodes.</string> 
    <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key> 
    <string>[Your App] requires permission to upload your photos to a record.</string> 
    …
    ```
