# Read the inserted incident

Use a GET request to view a record.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, web\_service\_admin, or rest\_api\_explorer

## About this task

Use the REST API Explorer to send the following request:

`GET https://instance.service-now.com/api/now/v1/table/incident/{sys_id}`

Use the sys\_id from the POST response Location header to run a GET request.

## Procedure

1.  In the top-left of the REST API Explorer, click **Retrieve a record \(GET\)**.

2.  In the Path Parameters section, select the incident table.

3.  In the **sys\_id** field, enter the sys\_id of the record you created.

    The record sys\_id appears as a 32-character string at the end of the POST response Location header.

4.  Click **Send**.

    The response body contains a text representation of the record. You can control the format of the response, such as JSON or XML, using the **Response Format** field.

    The response also indicates the **Status code** and **Execution time** \(in milliseconds\) of the request.
