# Configure a scripted REST API to require an ACL

Requests to scripted REST APIs respect platform ACLs, and the requesting user must meet any table ACL requirements to access instance data. Additionally, you can configure the scripted REST API to require a specific ACL.

## Before you begin

Role required: web\_service\_admin

## About this task

The ACLs selected in this task apply to all API endpoints.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **Scripted REST APIs**.

2.  Select a scripted REST API.

3.  In the **Default ACLs** field, select one or more ACLs that meet the security needs for the API. Select only those ACLs that have a **Type** of **REST\_Endpoint**.

    A requesting user must satisfy at least one of the selected ACLs. It is not necessary to satisfy all selected ACLs.

4.  Click **Update**.


## What to do next

You can override the API security settings for each individual API resource/endpoint. For details, see [Configure a scripted REST API resource to require an ACL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/t_WbSvcOpRqACL.md).

-   **[Configure a scripted REST API resource to require an ACL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/t_WbSvcOpRqACL.md)**  
By default, API resources/endpoints inherit security settings from the parent API. Define custom Access Control Levels \(ACLs\) for a specific resource/endpoint to override the inherited settings.
-   **[Add a path-based ACL for a scripted REST API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/add-a-path-based-acl-for-a-scripted-rest-api.md)**  
Path-based Access Control Levels \(ACLs\) enable you to define access control rules for scripted REST API endpoints using their resource path. This can be done independently of the ACL references on the operation record. Path-based ACLs enable more flexible security configurations, especially for read-only APIs and guest user experiences.
