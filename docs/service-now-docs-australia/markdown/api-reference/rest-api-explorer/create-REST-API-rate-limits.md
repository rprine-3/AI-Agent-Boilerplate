# Create an inbound REST API rate limit

Create rate limit rules to limit the number of inbound REST API requests processed per hour.

## Before you begin

Role required: rate\_limit\_admin

## About this task

Set rate limits for all users, users with specific roles, or all users.

**Note:** As requests reach an instance, each node maintains a rate limit count per user. Every 30 seconds, the count is committed to the database. As a result, a rate limit rule may not take effect for up to 30 seconds.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **REST** &gt; **Rate Limit Rules**.

2.  Click **New** and enter the following field values.

<table id="table_y41_qgq_hdb"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Request limit per hour

</td><td>

Maximum number of requests allowed per hour.**Note:** Whenever you update the value of this field, the ServiceNow AI Platform resets the count of requests to 0 and deletes all violations for the current hour.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Users restricted by this rule:-   **Single user** applies the rate limit to a specific user.
-   **Users with role** applies the rate limit to all users with a specific role.
-   **All users** applies the rate limit to all users.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Click **Submit**.

    The new rate limit goes into effect.


## What to do next

After you submit the rule, the ServiceNow AI Platform adds the following related lists to the rule record:

-   **Rate Limit Counts**

    Lists, by user, the number of inbound REST API requests affected by this rate limit rule.

-   **Rate Limit Violations**

    Lists, by user, the violations of this rate limit rule.
