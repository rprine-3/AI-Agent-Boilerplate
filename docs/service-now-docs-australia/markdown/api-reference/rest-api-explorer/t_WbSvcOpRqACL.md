# Configure a scripted REST API resource to require an ACL

By default, API resources/endpoints inherit security settings from the parent API. Define custom Access Control Levels \(ACLs\) for a specific resource/endpoint to override the inherited settings.

## Before you begin

Role required: web\_service\_admin or admin

## About this task

The ACLs defined using the procedure in this document are only checked for authenticated users.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **Scripted REST APIs**.

2.  Select a scripted REST API.

3.  In the **Resources** related list, select a resource.

4.  In the **Security** tab, select the **Requires authentication** check box.

    You must select this check box to require an ACL for the resource. If you clear this check box, the resource becomes public and requires no credentials. Clear this check box only if you want to enable unauthenticated requests to access the resource, even if the parent REST service requires an ACL.

5.  Select the **Requires ACL authorization** check box.

6.  In the **ACL** field, select one or more ACLs that meet the security needs for the endpoint.

    Select only those ACLs that have a **Type** of **REST\_Endpoint**. Only users who have roles defined in the selected REST\_Endpoint type ACL are granted access to this resource.

    Selecting an ACL for a resource overrides any ACLs selected for the parent web service. Leave this field empty to use the ACLs selected for the parent web service.
