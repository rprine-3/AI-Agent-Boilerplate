# Monitor inbound REST API rate limit counts and violations

To determine if you have set a rate limit rule appropriately, monitor the counts and violations for inbound REST API requests that are restricted by the rule.

## Before you begin

Role required: rate\_limit\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **REST** &gt; **Rate Limit Rules**.

2.  Select the rate limit rule for which you want to monitor rate limit counts and violations.

3.  View the information in the following related lists:

    -   In the Rate Limit Counts related list, view the count of inbound REST API requests limited by the rule. This list is cleared daily.
    -   In the Rate Limit Violations related list, view the number of inbound REST API requests that exceeded the **Request limit per hour** value for the rule. This list is cleared biweekly.
