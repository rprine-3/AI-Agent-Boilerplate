# DynamicTranslation- Client

The DynamicTranslation API provides methods that translate text, in real time, into multiple languages using translation service providers. This API is available for both standard clients and Angular-based Service Portal clients.

In addition, you can use this API to detect the language of a specific string and check whether the DynamicTranslation methods are enabled for a translation service. Use this API to create a seamless localization experience for your user interface, enabling one interface to service multiple countries.

Currently this API supports two translation service providers: Microsoft Azure Translator Service and Google Cloud Translator Service. You can also configure other translation services within your instance and then use the DynamicTranslation API to translate your text.

To use this API you must activate the Dynamic Translation plugin. For information on this plugin and additional information on Dynamic Translation, refer to [Dynamic translation overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-translation.md). Also, to use this API in a Service Portal widget, you must inject the dynamicTranslation service into the widget client script function.

**Note:** The name of the class to use in Service Portal clients is dynamicTranslation, while the name of the class to use in standard clients is DynamicTranslation.

**Parent Topic:**[Client API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/api-client.md)

## DynamicTranslation - getDetectedLanguage\(String text, Object parms\)

Detects the language of the passed in text.

If you pass in a translator, the method uses that translation service to detect the source language. Otherwise, the detection is performed by the default translation service. Ensure that the text strings that you provide contain enough verbiage to enable proper language detection.

In addition to the detected language, the response contains a confidence level of the detection, along with other possible language alternatives. If a translator is not passed in, the method also returns the default translation service used to detect the language.

## DynamicTranslation - getTranslation\(String textToTranslate, Object parms\)

Translates the passed in text to one or more languages.

The method uses translation services, such as Microsoft Azure Translator Service and Google Cloud Translator Service, to perform the translation. If you do not pass in translation parameters, the method uses the system default.

## DynamicTranslation - getTranslations\(Array texts, Object parms\)

Translates the passed in text strings to one or more languages.

The method uses translation services, such as Microsoft Azure Translator Service and Google Cloud Translator Service, to perform the translation. If you do not pass in translation parameters, the method uses the system default.

When calling this method from a portal client script, use the class name dynamicTranslation; such as dynamicTranslation.getTranslations\(\). When calling it from a platform client script, use the class name DynamicTranslation; such as DynamicTranslation.getTranslations\(\).

## DynamicTranslation - isEnabled\(String translator\)

Determines whether the various methods in the DynamicTranslation API are enabled for a translation service.

If you pass in a specific translation service, the method checks the method activation for that translation service; otherwise the method checks the default translation service.

When calling this method from a portal client script, use the class name dynamicTranslation; such as dynamicTranslation.isEnabled\(\). When calling it from a platform client script, use the class name DynamicTranslation; such as DynamicTranslation.isEnabled\(\).
