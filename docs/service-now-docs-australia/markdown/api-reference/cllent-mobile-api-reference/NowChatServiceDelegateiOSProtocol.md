## NowChatServiceDelegate - chatService\(\_chatService: NowChatService, didRequestOpenUrlurl: URL\)

Callback that notifies the host application that the specified chat service received a request to open a URL. This callback is usually triggered by a user tapping on a link in the chat UI. It is the host application's responsibility to handle opening the URL or ignore the request.

|didRequestOpenUrl url|URL|URL that the service has requested to open.|

The following code example shows how to call this function.
