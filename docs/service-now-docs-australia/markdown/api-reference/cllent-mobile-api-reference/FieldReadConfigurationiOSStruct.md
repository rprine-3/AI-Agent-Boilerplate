# FieldReadConfiguration structure- iOS

The FieldReadConfiguration structure enables you to configure which fields to fetch from a ServiceNow instance table and in which format.

Array

</td><td id="mobile_sdk_ios-options-entry">

List of the types of fields to return.Possible values:

-   actualValues: Returns the values actually stored in each of the fields, including the sys\_ids for referenced records. Use this setting if dates need to be decoded in Codable models using Date.
-   description: Returns the description of the parameter.
-   displayValues: Returns the [display values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DisplayValues.md), if available, for the selected fields. For example, user names typically contain a reference link \(sys\_id\) to the user record. If you request the display value, the person's name is returned instead of the sys\_id that is stored in the associated field.

**Note:** Display values returned by a ServiceNow instance are formatted and internationalized based on the user profile configuration of the authenticated user. This may differ from the device language and locale settings on the device.

-   excludeReferenceLink: Does not return any data that is defined as reference links within the table.
-   rawValue: Returns the raw value of the parameter.

The following code example shows how to call this function.

```
/// The configuration for what to fetch from the Table API.
lazy var fetchConfiguration: FetchConfiguration = {
  let includeFields = [
    // Case details
    "number",
    "short_description",
    "priority",
    "state",
    "opened_at",
            
    // Account details
    "account.name",
    "account.number",
    "contact.name",
    "contact.email",
    "contact_type",

    // Assignment
    "assignment_group.name",
    "assigned_to.name"
  ]
  let readConfiguration = FieldReadConfiguration(includeFields: includeFields, options: .actualValues)
  let filter = Filter(criteria: [], sortBy: [.desc("opened_at")], queryCategory: nil)
  return FetchConfiguration(filter: filter, limit: 10, readConfiguration: readConfiguration)
}()
```
