# GlideElement- Global

The GlideElement API provides a number of convenient script methods for dealing with fields and their values. GlideElement methods are available for the fields of the current glide record.

**Parent Topic:**[Server API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/api-server.md)

## GlideElement - canCreate\(\)

Determines if the user's role permits the creation of new entries in the associated field.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

<table id="table_xln_v51_kt" class="returns"><thead><tr><th>

Type

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Boolean

</td><td>

Flag that indicates whether the current user has permissions to create new entries in the associated field.Possible values:

-   true: User can create new entries.
-   false: User cannot create new entries.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The following example shows how to determine if the user has permissions to create entries for the three most recent records in the Problem \[problem\] table.

```
var gr = new GlideRecord('problem');

// Get records in new state in Problem Table
gr.addQuery('state','101');

// Sort records in order of recent to earlier Created Date
gr.orderByDesc('sys_created_on');

// Limit the query to three records
gr.setLimit(3); 
gr.query();

while(gr.next()){
  if(gr.short_description.canCreate()){ ///check to see if the current user is allowed to create the record
  gs.info("I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - " + gr.number);
  }
}
```

Output:

```
I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - PRB0000004
I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - PRB0001000
I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - PRB0001001
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the canCreate\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [canCreate\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - canRead\(\)

Determines whether the user's role permits them to read the associated GlideRecord.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the field can be read, false otherwise.|

The following example shows how to get a list of active Incident records with a readable Short Description field.

```
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addEncodedQuery("active=true"); //Query the Incident table for active incidents
grIncident.orderByDesc('number');
grIncident.setLimit(3); // limit to three results for example
grIncident.query();

while (grIncident.next()) {
    if (grIncident.short_description.canRead()) { //check to see if the current user is allowed to read the record
        gs.info('You have permission to read the short description of: ' + grIncident.number + ' ' + grIncident.short_description);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
*** Script: You have permission to read the short description of: INC0009009 Unable to access the shared folder.
*** Script: You have permission to read the short description of: INC0009005 Email server is down.
*** Script: You have permission to read the short description of: INC0009001 Unable to post content on a Wiki page
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the canRead\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [canRead\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - canWrite\(\)

Determines whether the user's role permits them to write to the associated GlideRecord.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the user can write to the field, false otherwise.|

The following example shows how to get a list of active Incident records with a writeable Short Description field.

```
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addEncodedQuery("active=true"); //Query the Incident table for active incidents
grIncident.orderByDesc('number');
grIncident.setLimit(3); // limit to three results for example
grIncident.query();

while (grIncident.next()) {
    if (grIncident.short_description.canWrite()) { //check to see if the current user is allowed to write to the record
        gs.info('You have permission to write to the short description of: ' + grIncident.number + ' ' + grIncident.short_description);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
*** Script: You have permission to write to the short description of: INC0009009 Unable to access the shared folder.
*** Script: You have permission to write to the short description of: INC0009005 Email server is down.
*** Script: You have permission to write to the short description of: INC0009001 Unable to post content on a Wiki page
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the canWrite\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [canWrite\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - changes\(\)

Determines if the current field has been modified. This functionality is available for all available data types, except Journal fields.

**Note:** The changes\(\) method is not supported within ACL scripts.

**Note:** If the GlideRecord on which you are performing this method has only been initialized and read, and has not been written, the underlying before-and-after values are the same. In this case, the method returns "false", as there has been no change to the data store.

-   **Business rule execution**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform invokes business rules \(**BEFORE** or **AFTER**\) before resetting the internal previous values for columns \(GlideElement objects\) to the current values.

    This sequence enables the following actions:

    -   Triggering an **AFTER** business rule on &lt;column&gt;.changes conditions.
    -   Accessing the previous GlideRecord object in the script section.
    Even in **AFTER** business rules, `current.<field>.changes()` returns `true` because the internal previous values haven’t been reset yet. The condition `current.<field>.value != previous.<field>.value` also returns `true`.

    Previous values are only reset after the following activities:

    -   The database update is complete.
    -   All **AFTER** business rules have been processed.
    Inside an AFTER business rule, the changes\(\) method still returns `true` if the field value was modified, even though the rule executes after the update.


|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the field has changed, false otherwise.|

The following example from a business rule shows how to create an event in the EventQueue if the value of the **assigned\_to** field changes. For a comprehensive example, see [Sample scripts from the change events business rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_ChangeEventsSampleScripts.md).

```
if (!current.assigned_to.nil() && current.assigned_to.changes()) {
  gs.eventQueue('incident.assigned', current, current.assigned_to.getDisplayValue(), previous.assigned_to.getDisplayValue());
}
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the changes\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [changes\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - changesFrom\(Object value\)

Determines if the previous value of the current field matches the specified object.

**Note:** If the GlideRecord on which you are performing this method has only been initialized and read, and has not been written, the underlying before-and-after values are the same. In this case, the method returns "false", as there has been no change to the data store.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|value|Object|An object value to check against the previous value of the current field.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the previous value matches the parameter, false if it does not.|

```
if (theState.changesTo(resolvedState)) {
  operation = 4; //Resolved
}
else if (theState.changesTo(closedState)) {
  operation = 11; //Resolution Accepted
}
else if (theState.changesFrom(resolvedState) || theState.changesFrom(closedState)) {
  operation = 10; //Re-open
}
else {
  operation = 6; //Update
}
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the changesFrom\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [changesFrom\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - changesTo\(Object value\)

Determines if the new value of a field, after a change, matches the specified object.

**Note:** The changesTo\(\) method is not supported within ACL scripts.

**Note:** If the GlideRecord on which you are performing this method has only been initialized and read, and has not been written, the underlying before-and-after values are the same. In this case, the method returns "false", as there has been no change to the data store.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|value|Object|An object value to check against the new value of the current field.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the new value matches the parameter, false if it does not.|

```
if (theState.changesTo(resolvedState)) {
  operation = 4; //Resolved
}
else if (theState.changesTo(closedState)) {
  operation = 11; //Resolution Accepted
}
else if (theState.changesFrom(resolvedState) || theState.changesFrom(closedState)) {
  operation = 10; //Re-open
}
else {
  operation = 6; //Update
}
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the changesTo\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [changesTo\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - dateNumericValue\(\)

Returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT for a duration field. Does not require the creation of a GlideDateTime object because the duration field is already a GlideDateTime object.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Number|Number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.|

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.get('17c90efb13418700cc36b1422244b05d');
gs.info(inc.calendar_duration.dateNumericValue());
```

Output: 98000

### Scoped equivalent

To use the dateNumericValue\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [dateNumericValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - debug\(Object o\)

Debugs the object and adds debug messages using setError\(String\).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|o|Object|An object to debug.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|None| |

## GlideElement - getAttribute\(String attributeName\)

Returns the value of the specified attribute from the dictionary.

For Boolean attributes, you can use the getBooleanAttribute\(\) method to return the value as a Boolean instead of a string.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|attributeName|String|Name of the attribute. The attribute name is listed in the Dictionary Entries \[sys\_dictionary\] table.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Value of the specified attribute.|

The following example shows how to get the value of the **tree\_picker** attribute in the **location** column of the User \[sys\_user\] table as a string.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
now_GR.query("user_name","admin");

if (now_GR.next()) {
   gs.info("The value of the tree_picker attribute in the location column is " + now_GR.location.getAttribute("tree_picker"));
}
```

Output:

```
The value of the tree_picker attribute in the location column is true
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the getAttribute\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [getAttribute\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - getBaseTableName\(\)

Gets the base table of the field.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Name of the base table. This name might be different from the table that the field is defined on. See [Table extension and classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/table-extension-and-classes.md) in the product documentation.|

The following example shows how to the base table for the Assignment Group field of an Incident record.

```
var gr = new GlideRecord('incident');

//query the Incident Records which have category as Inquiry/Help
gr.addQuery('category','inquiry');

// sort them in the order of earlier to recent created date
gr.orderBy('sys_created_on');
gr.query();

if(gr.next()){ //If at least any one record exists matching this query

  //Print the base table for the Assignment Group field
  gs.print("The Base Table for the field Assignment Group is - " + gr.assignment_group.getBaseTableName()); 
};
```

Output:

```
The Base Table for the field Assignment Group is - task
```

## GlideElement - getBooleanAttribute\(String attributeName\)

Returns a specified Boolean-type attribute from the dictionary as a Boolean value.

To return the attribute value as a string, use the getAttribute\(\) method.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|attributeName|String|Name of the attribute. The attribute name is listed in the Dictionary Entries \[sys\_dictionary\] table.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|Specifies the value of the attribute as Boolean true or false.|

The following example shows how to get Boolean values of the **ignore\_filter\_on\_new** attribute for two fields.

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.query();

if (inc.next())
 {
   // opened_by field has attribute "ignore_filter_on_new = true"
   gs.info(inc.opened_by.getBooleanAttribute("ignore_filter_on_new"));

  // short_description field does not have attribute ignore_filter_on_new
   gs.info(inc.short_description.getBooleanAttribute("ignore_filter_on_new"));
 }
```

Output:

```
true
false
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the getBooleanAttribute\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [getBooleanAttribute\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - getChoices\(String dependent\)

Generates a choice list for a field. Returns the choice values from the base table only, not from the extended table.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|dependent|String|Optional. Field within the associated record on which the choice list field depends.|

|Type|Description|

gr.orderByDesc('sys_created_on'); 

// limit the query to 4 records
gr.setLimit(4); 
gr.query();

while(gr.next()){
 //Printing the choice label for those records
 gs.print("The label of the current priority '"+ gr.priority+"' for the change request - " + gr.number + " is - "+ gr.priority.getChoiceValue()); 
}

inc_gr.get('985f53d82fab301032e8808cf699b6e8'); // Get a particular Incident

var field_element = inc_gr.getElement('cmdb_ci'); // Get the Configuration Item element
var dependent_field = field_element.getDependent(); // Read the dependent field
gs.info("Dependent field: " + dependent_field);
if(dependent_field)
  {
    var dependent_field_value = inc_gr.getValue(dependent_field);  
    if(!dependent_field_value)
      {
        var base_table = field_element.getRefRecord(); // Retrieve the reference record
        var dependent_field_value = base_table.getValue(dependent_field); // Read the parent field value
      }
    inc_gr.setValue(dependent_field, dependent_field_value); // Update the parent field on the Incident
    inc_gr.update();
  }
```

Output:

gr.query();

if (gr.next()) {
    var field_element = gr.getElement('model_id'); // Get the model_id field element
    var dependent_table = field_element.getDependentTable(); // Get the table that drives filtering

    gs.info("Field: " + field_element.getLabel());
    gs.info("Dependent table: " + dependent_table); // cmdb_model_category

    if (dependent_table) {
        // Use the dependent table to query what's controlling the filter
        var dep_gr = new GlideRecord(dependent_table);
        if (dep_gr.get(gr.getValue('model_category'))) {
            gs.info("Controlling record: " + dep_gr.getDisplayValue());
            gs.info("Only models belonging to category '" + dep_gr.getDisplayValue() + "' are valid for this CI");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Field: Model ID
Dependent table: null
```

## GlideElement - getDisplayValue\(Number maxChar\)

Returns the formatted display value of the field.

Display values are manipulated based on the actual value in the database and user or system settings and preferences.

The display value that is returned is dependent on the field type.

-   Choice fields: The database value may be a number, but the display value will be more descriptive.
-   Date fields: The database value is in UTC format, while the display value is based on the user's time zone.
-   Encrypted text: The database value is encrypted, while the displayed value is unencrypted based on the user's encryption context.
-   Reference fields: The database value is sys\_id, but the display value is a display field of the referenced record.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|maxChar|Number|Optional. Maximum number of characters to return.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Display value of the field.|

```
var fields = current.getFields();

  var field = fields.get(i);
  var name = field.getName(); 
  var value = field.getDisplayValue(); 
  gs.print(i + ". " + name + "=" + value); 
}
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the getDisplayValue\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [getDisplayValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## GlideElement - getDisplayValueExt\(Number maxChar, String nullSub\)

Returns the formatted display value of a field, or a specified substitute value if the display value is null or empty.

Display values are manipulated based on the actual value in the database and user or system settings and preferences.

The display value that is returned is dependent on the field type.

The following example shows how to display the two most recent active records in the Incident \[incident\] table.

```
var gr = new GlideRecord('incident');
gr.addQuery('active', true);      // get the active records
gr.orderByDesc('sys_updated_on'); // sort the records from most recent to oldest updated date
gr.setLimit(2);                   // limit the query to 2 records
gr.query();

while(gr.next()){ // Printing the Display Value of the Configuration Item field. 
  // If the Display Value is Null/Empty, then it will be substituted with Default value "I with Null/Empty Display Value"
  gs.info("The Display Value of the Configuration Item for the incident - "+ gr.number+ " is " + gr.cmdb_ci.getDisplayValueExt(40, " CI with Null/Empty Display Value"));
}
```

Output:

The Display Value of the Configuration Item for the incident - INC0007001 is  CI with Null/Empty Display Value
The Display Value of the Configuration Item for the incident - INC0000069 is NYC RAC
```

## GlideElement - getDisplayValueLang\(String language\)

Gets the display value of the field in the language passed as a parameter.

The result is only applicable to translatable field types such as **Choice**, **Translated Field**, and **Translated Text**. For other field types, the result defaults to [getDisplayValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

You must have the corresponding language plugin to retrieve a translated value. For information, see [Activate a language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateALanguage.md).

See also [Scoped GlideElement - getLabelLang\(String language\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|language|String|Language tag conforming with IETF BCP-47.|

|Type|Description|

If you select 
My Contacts only in step 6, replies will be sent 
only to contacts that exist in your Contacts folder.



Using Rules With Automatic Replies
It is also possible to use rules to manage your messages while you are out of office. For example, you can create rules to automatically move or copy messages to other folders, to delete messages, to send custom replies, and so on.

Click the 
File tab.
Click 
Automatic Replies.
Click 
Rules, and then click 
Add Rule.
Under 
When a message arrives that meets the following conditions, specify the conditions that the message must meet for the rule to be applied. If you want to specify more conditions, click 
Advanced, enter or select the options that you want, and then click 
OK.
If you want to specify that this rule must be applied last, select the 
Do not process subsequent rules check box.
Under 
Perform these actions, select the actions that you want. You can select more than one action.
Click 
OK three times.

NOTES:

Automatic Replies rules can also be edited by following the above procedure.
To turn Automatic Replies rules on or off, in the Automatic Reply Rules dialog box, select or clear the check box of the rule that you want to turn on or off.

  now_GR.work_notes.setJournalEntry("Content of the journal entry.", "abel.tuter");  
  now_GR.update();
}
```

## GlideElement - setValue\(Object value\)

Sets the value of a field.

**Note:** Before calling this method, the element must already exist by querying an existing record or by using the now\_GR.initialize\(\) method to initialize a new record.

-   **Not for authentication with password2 fields**

    The setValue\(\) method passes password2 data as clear text, which results in an error about expecting encrypted data. Additionally, using the setValue\(\) method for password2 fields exposes data that should be encrypted.

    For password2 authentication, use the setDisplayValue\(\) method instead.
