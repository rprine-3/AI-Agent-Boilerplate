# LeadAPIValidationUtilOOB - Scoped

The LeadAPIValidationUtilOOB script include provides methods that are called by the lead REST API to validate lead records and associated lead line item records when they are created \(POST\) or updated \(PATCH\).

If you want to customize how lead records are validated when the [lead API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/lead-api.md) methods are called, override the methods in this script include in the LeadAPIValidationUtil script include. The names of the methods that you are overriding in the LeadAPIValidationUtil script include must be the same as those in the LeadAPIValidationUtilOOB script include file.

This API is provided within the `sn_lead_mgmt_core` namespace. To access the API, the Lead Management Data Model \(sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\) plugin must be activated on the instance, and the calling user must have the sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core.lead\_integrator role.

For additional information on Lead Management, see [Using Lead Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/lead-management-using.md).

## LeadAPIValidationUtilOOB - validateLeadObjectForPatchCall \(Object leadObject\)

Validates the passed fields for a specified lead and its associated line items when updating a lead record using the `PATCH` endpoint of the lead API.

This method is triggered by the processUpdateLead\(\) method in the LeadAPIValidationUtilOOB script include. This method performs various validations, such as:

-   Checks for mandatory fields
-   Checks that the phone number and email address have the proper format.
-   Checks choice and reference fields, ignoring any invalid values.
-   Validates the stage and throws an error if the user attempts to qualify a lead.
