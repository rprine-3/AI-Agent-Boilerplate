# IPAddress - Scoped, Global

The IPAddress API provides methods that enable you to check for various states of a specified IP address, such as whether it is routable, unicast, multicast, public, or reserved. It also enables you to get the canonical \(shortened/standard\) and expanded forms of an IP address.

Access the global IPAddress class and its associated methods in the `SNC` global namespace.

In this API, some of the methods are static and some are non-static. The [isV4\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/IPAddressAPIBoth.md) and [isV6\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/IPAddressAPIBoth.md) methods provide both static and non-static implementations. The benefit of the non-static methods is that you don't have to call the [IPAddress\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/IPAddressAPIBoth.md) method to instantiate an IPAddress object.

**Parent Topic:**[Server API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/api-server.md)

## IPAddress - IPAddress\(String ipAddress\)

Instantiates an IPAddress object for the specified IP address.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|ipAddress|String|IP address for which to create the IPAddress object.|

The following code example shows how to call the IPAddress constructor when calling a non-static IPAddress method.

```
function() {
  var grDiscover = new GlideRecord('discovery_range_item');
  grDiscover.get("SYS_ID");

  var ip = grDiscover.getValue('network_ip');
  var ip2 = gs.getSession().getClientIP().toString();
  gs.info("ip address 1: " + ip);
  gs.info("ip address 2: " + ip2);
  gs.info("ip address 1 is routable?: " + new SNC.IPAddress(ip).isRoutable());
  gs.info("ip address 2 is routable?: " + new SNC.IPAddress(ip2).isRoutable());
}
```

## IPAddress - canonicalize\(String ipAddress\)

Returns the canonical \(shortened/standard\) form of the specified IP address by removing any zero padding from the address.

For example, the canonical form of the IPv6 address "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001" is "::1". The canonical form of the IPv4 address "192.168.001.002" is "192.268.1.2".

**Note:** This is a static method.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|ipAddress|String or Object|IP address to canonicalize or a scoped IPAddress object that contains the IP address.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Canonicalized \(shortened/standardized\) IP address.|

The following example shows how to use the scoped version of this method to canonicalize an IPv6 IP address.

```
function() {
  var grCMDB = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci');
  grCMDB.get("SYS_ID");
  var ip = grCMDB.getValue('ip_address');
  gs.info("ip address: " + ip);
  gs.info("canonicalized ip: " + SNC.IPAddress.canonicalize(ip));
}
```

Output:

```
ip address: 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
canonicalized ip: ::1
```

## IPAddress - getExpanded\(String ipAddress\)

Returns the expanded form of the specified IP address

For example, the expanded form of the IPv6 address "::1" is "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001". The expanded form of the IPv4 address "192.268.1.2" is "192.168.001.002".

**Note:** This is a static method.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|ipAddress|String|IP address to expand.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Expanded IP address.|

The following example shows how to use the scoped version of this method to expand an IPv6 IP address.

```
function() {
  var grCMDB = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci');
  grCMDB.get(SYS_ID);
  var ip = grCMDB.getValue('ip_address');
  gs.info("ip address: " + ip);
  gs.info("expanded ip: " + SNC.IPAddress.getExpanded(ip));
}
```

Output:

```
ip address: ::1
expanded ip: 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
```

## IPAddress - isLinkLocal\(\)

Determines whether the specified IPAddress object is a link-local IP address.

For further information on link-local IP addresses see [RFC 3927](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3927) and [RFC 4291](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291).

**Note:** This is a non-static method.

## IPAddress - isRoutable\(\)

Determines whether the specified IPAddress object is a routable IP address.

An IP Address is considered to be routable if it is not a private address, a link-local address, or the loopback address. For additional information on private addresses, see [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) and [RFC 4193](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4193).

## IPAddress - isV4\(String ipAddress\)

Determines whether the specified IP address is a valid IPv4 address.

This method has both static and non-static implementations. The way in which you call the two method types is slightly different. For the non-static implementation you don't need to first instantiate an IPAddress object and you pass the IP address in the IPAddress class reference. Both return the same response.
