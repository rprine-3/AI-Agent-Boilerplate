# TransformerRuleList - Scoped, Global

The TransformerRuleList API enables you to create a list of rules for transforming various types of JSON and XML data into name-value pair output.

This API works along with the Transformer and TransformerDefinition APIs. Together, these APIs transform XML nodes or any entity in a structured JSON document into an output of name-value pairs. Supported JSON entities including objects and elements within an array, such as strings, numbers, and other arrays.

-   The TransformerRuleList API enables you to create transformation rule lists that define what data in the source document to include in the output and how to transform the source data.

-   The TransformerDefinition API associates a transformation rule list with a JSON/XML record path to define reusable transform definition objects. You can use a transform definition object to transform one or more source documents.

-   The Transformer API performs the actual data transformation, one data entity at a time, using the specified transformation rule list to create the desired output data.


When you instantiate the TransformRuleList object, you must define whether it describes a JSON or XML source document using the .fromJSON\(\) or .fromXML\(\) methods. For example:

`var trl = sn_tfrm.TransformerRuleList().fromJSON();` or `var trl = sn_tfrm.TransformerRuleList().fromXML();`

Then use the addRule\(\) method to define a transformation rule for each element in the source document that you want to include as a name-value pair in the output.

Use "adapter methods", such as setName\(\) or thenAdd\(\), to define how to manipulate data elements when the transformation is performed. Adapter methods work along with the addRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns. You can apply one or more adapter methods to each data transformation. Adapter methods enable you to do things such as:

-   Concatenate text.
-   Perform mathematical functions, such as add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
-   Round values up or down \(round up/down, ceiling/floor\).
-   Define whether to use the minimum or maximum value when comparing a source data element to a specified value.
-   Apply a currency code.
-   Convert between different units of measure.
-   Format data elements.
-   Apply patterns.
-   Replace specified data elements with a specified value.
-   Split and rearrange strings.

You can use the TransformerRuleList class in both scoped and global server scripts. When using this class in a scoped application, use the `sn_tfrm` namespace identifier. Also, before this API is available in an instance, you must activate the Transformation Service plugin \(com.glide.transform\).

**Parent Topic:**[Server API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/api-server.md)

## TransformerRuleList - addRule\(String rule, String path\)

Creates an entry in the associated transformation rules list which defines a field to create in the output.

You can create rules for any element in a source document. For example, `.addRule('ticker', '$.quote.symbol')` creates the field "ticker" in the output and copies over the value in quote.symbol of the source.

Once you define a rule using addRule\(\), you then use adaptor methods, such as thenAdd\(\), thenReplace\(\), and thenFloor\(\) to manipulate the rule's output data. You can define as many adaptor methods as needed for a single rule. All adapter methods directly after an addRule\(\) call, until the next addRule\(\) call, apply to that rule. Adapter methods are cumulative with the result of all adapter methods being the final value saved in the output field.

For example, in the following code snippet, thenMultiply\(\) and thenRoundDown\(\) apply to addRule\('change\_percentage', '$.quote.changePercent'\); addRule\('close\_price', '$.quote.close'\) starts a new rule. If the value in **$.quote.changePercent** is .011, then the final output value is "1" \( .011 \* 100 rounded down to the ones position\).

```

  .addRule('change_percentage', '$.quote.changePercent') 
  .thenMultiply('100') 
  .thenRoundDown('0') 
  .addRule('close_price', '$.quote.close') 
```

The addRule\(\) method also supports the parameter **summary**; `.addRule('summary')`. This implementation creates the name field "summary:" in the output, but does not correlate it to any field in the source. You can then use the adaptor methods thenConcat\(\) and thenConcatSymbol\(\) to modify the contents of the summary field.

  .addRule('close_price', '$.quote.close') 
  .thenAdaptCurrency('USD', false) 
  .addRule('company_info', '$.quote.company_info') 
  .thenApplyMap({'Inc.': 'Incorporated', 'St.': 'Street'});

```

## TransformerRuleList - thenApplyPattern\(String matchPattern, String outputPattern

Adds an adapter to the current rule that matches a specified regex pattern to content in the source field and then replaces/reformats that content with a second regex pattern and stores that value in the output.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

|Name|Type|Description|

In this example, any company name that ends with "Inc." is transformed to "Incorporated", such as Company Inc. to Company Incorporated.

```
var transformerRuleList = new sn_tfrm.TransformerRuleList()
  .fromJSON()
  .setName('Stock Report 05022019 JSON')
  .addRule('ticker', '$.quote.symbol') 
  .addRule('change_percentage', '$.quote.changePercent') 
  .thenMultiply('100') 
  .thenRoundDown('0') 
  .addRule('close_price', '$.quote.close') 
  .thenAdaptCurrency('USD', false) 
  .addRule('company', '$.quote.company') 
  .thenApplyPattern('(.+)(\\w{3}\\.)', '$1Incorporated');

```

## TransformerRuleList - thenCeiling\(Number operand\)

Adds an action to the current rule to round the source field up at the decimal position specified by the passed in value.

Unlike straight rounding where the number is rounded based on the value of the digit in the specified decimal position \(0-4 round down, 5-9 round up\), ceiling always rounds up. For example, the ceiling value for 2.156 and 2.152 is always 2.16 for the passed in decimal position of 2; whereas for straight rounding the values would be 2.16 and 2.15 respectively. For negative numbers, the ceiling operation makes the number more positive, as in the ceiling value of -2.156 is -2.15; whereas the same number rounded up makes the value more negative, -2.16.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

  .thenCeiling('2') // Always round the interest rate up to the hundredths place 
  .addRule('monthly_payment', '$.quote.total_loan_amount') 
  .thenDivideBy('180'); 

```

## TransformerRuleList - thenConcat\(String value\)

Adds an adapter to the current rule that concatenates the passed in string to the output field.

Unlike other adapter methods, this method does not have to be applied to a source field. You can use this method to create completely new data strings in the output.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

  .thenConcatSymbol('close_price'); 

```

## TransformerRuleList - thenConcatSymbol\(String symbol\)

Adds an adapter to the current rule that concatenates the value of a field previously defined in the rules list to the current output field.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

## TransformerRuleList - thenDivideBy\(Number operand\)

Adds an adapter to the current rule that divides the source field by the passed in value.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

  .thenDivideInto('$.quote.total_dividends'); 

```

## TransformerRuleList - thenFloor\(Number operand\)

Adds an adapter to the current rule that rounds the source field down at the decimal position specified by the passed in value and stores it in the output.

Unlike straight rounding where the number is rounded based on the value of the digit in the specified decimal position \(0-4 round down, 5-9 round up\), floor always rounds down. For example, the floor value for 2.156 and 2.152 is always 2.15 for the passed in decimal position of 2; whereas for straight rounding the values would be 2.16 and 2.15 respectively. For negative numbers, the floor operation makes the number more negative, as in the floor value of -2.156 is -2.16; whereas the same number rounded down makes the value more positive, -2.15.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

## TransformerRuleList - thenMultiply\(Number operand\)

Adds an adapter to the current rule that multiplies the source field by the passed in value.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

In this example, any company name that ends with "Inc." is transformed to "Incorporated", such as Company Inc. to Company Incorporated.

```
var transformerRuleList = new sn_tfrm.TransformerRuleList()
  .fromJSON()
  .setName('Stock Report 05022019 JSON')
  .addRule('ticker', '$.quote.symbol') 
  .addRule('change_percentage', '$.quote.changePercent') 
  .thenMultiply('100') 
  .thenRoundDown('0') 
  .addRule('close_price', '$.quote.close') 
  .thenAdaptCurrency('USD', false) 
  .addRule('company', '$.quote.company') 
  .thenReplace('Inc.', 'Incorporated');

```

## TransformerRuleList - thenRoundDown\(Number operand\)

Adds an adapter to the current rule that rounds the source field down at the decimal position specified by the passed in value.

For negative numbers, the thenRoundDown\(\) method makes the number more positive; the round down value of -2.156 is -2.15. The thenFloor\(\) method makes the same number more negative, -2.16.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.

```

## TransformerRuleList - thenSplit\(String splitPattern, String replaceString\)

Adds an adapter to the current rule that splits, reorganizes, and replaces strings within the source field and saves them in the output field.

The **splitPattern** parameter denotes how to divide the source text string into segments. This parameter can be a typical word separator such as a space \(' '\), comma \(','\), or semicolon \(';'\), and can also be any string, such as 'name'. For example, if the source text is "Smith John Michael" and the **splitPattern** is a space, then the available segments are "Smith", "John", and "Michael". To reference a segment, use $\#, where \# is the number of the order of the segment in the source text string. For example, if the method call is `thenSplit(' ', '$2 $3 $1')`, then the output is "John Michael Smith". In addition, you can add constants within the output pattern, such as `thenSplit(' ', 'First name: $2 Middle name: $3 Last name: $1')`.

**Note:** This is an adapter method and cannot be used on its own. Adapter methods work in conjunction with theaddRule\(\) method. They define adaptations to apply to the output field defined by the addRule\(\) method such as formatting, rounding, and applying patterns.
