# Fetch Response- Scoped,Global

The Fetch Response API provides methods for creating a new Response object and for handling the response body created by a Fetch Request API method.

The Fetch Response API is part of a set of Fetch APIs, which provide various actions for fetching resources from external websites. The full Fetch API collection includes:

-   [Fetch - fetch\(String resource, Object options\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/FetchAPI.md): Starts the process of fetching a resource from the network.
-   [Fetch Headers - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.HeadersAPI.md): Retrieve and modify request and response headers.
-   [Fetch Request - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.RequestAPI.md): Create a new request object.
-   [Fetch RequestInit - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.RequestInitAPI.md): Set options to configure a fetch request.
-   [Fetch Response - Scoped,Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.ResponseAPI.md): Create a new response object.

To support fetch actions, the system property, `glide.hosts.allowlist`, allows controls over what hosts a fetch method can access. It applies to HTTP APIs like RestMessageV2 and those mentioned above. For more information about `glide.hosts.allowlist`, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

## Response properties

The Response API provides properties that return details about the HTTP response. These properties allow you to access metadata \(like `status`, `headers`, `type`\) and the response body \(`body`\) for further processing. They enable checking the success of a request \(`ok`\) and parsing the returned data in various formats \(for example, JSON or text\). These properties are important for validating and handling server responses in client-side applications. To read more in-depth explanations about each property, see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

body

</td><td>

Object

</td><td>

Optional. An object defining a body for the response.Valid types:

-   ArrayBuffer
-   Blob
-   DataView
-   FormData
-   ReadableStream
-   String
-   String literal
-   TypedArray
-   URLSearchParams

Default: null

</td></tr><tr><td>

options

</td><td>

Object

</td><td>

Optional. An options object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the response, or an empty object \(which is the default value\). The possible options are:-   headers: Any headers you want to add to your response, contained within a [Fetch Headers - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.HeadersAPI.md) object or object literal of string key/value pairs \(see [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) for a reference\). Empty by default.
-   status: The status code for the response. The default value is `200`.
-   statusText: The status message associated with the status code, such as `"OK"`. The default value is `""`.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>In this example, we create a new Response object using the constructor, passing a new Blob as a body, and an init object containing custom status and statusText options:

```
const myBlob = new Blob();
const myOptions = { status: 200, statusText: "Status message!" };
const myResponse = new Response(myBlob, myOptions);
```

## Fetch Response - arrayBuffer\(\)

Returns a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer.

The arrayBuffer\(\) method is useful when working with binary data like images, audio files, or any other binary file that needs to be processed.

</table>The following example script fetches binary data from a server and processes it while utilizing the arrayBuffer\(\) method using these steps:

1.  fetch\(\): Fetches a resource from the specified URL.
2.  **response.ok**: Checks if the response status is in the 200-299 range.
3.  arrayBuffer\(\): Reads the response body and converts it into an ArrayBuffer, which represents a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer.
4.  Uint8Array: Converts the ArrayBuffer into a Uint8Array, which is a typed array for easy manipulation of binary data.

```
javascriptCopy code// Simple API to fetch binary data and process it using arrayBuffer()asyncfunctionfetchBinaryData(url) {
  try {
    // Fetch the resource from the provided URLconst response = awaitfetch(url);

    // Check if the response is successfulif (!response.ok) {
      thrownewError(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    throw error;
  }
}

// Example usageconst binaryDataUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/binary/data';

fetchBinaryData(binaryDataUrl)
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Binary data as Uint8Array:", data);
    // Further processing can be done here, e.g., rendering an image or playing audio
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Failed to fetch binary data:", error);
  });

</table>The following example demonstrates how to use the blob\(\) method with the Fetch API using the following steps. This use case is great for fetching images or other binary content \(like videos or PDFs\) and displaying them dynamically.

1.  fetch\(url\): Fetches a resource from the specified URL.
2.  response.blob\(\): Converts the response body into a Blob object, which represents binary data.
3.  URL.createObjectURL\(blob\): Generates a temporary URL for the Blob, which can be used in the DOM \(for example, as an image source\).
4.  Appending the image to the DOM: Dynamically creates an image element, sets the blob URL as its source, and appends it to the document body.

```

async function fetchBlob(url) {
  try {
    // Fetch the resource from the provided URL
    const response = await fetch(url);

    // Check if the response is successful
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    // Convert the response body to a Blob
    const blob = await response.blob();

    // Create a URL for the Blob and log it
    const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    console.log("Blob URL:", blobUrl);

    // For example, you can set it as the source of an image
    const img = document.createElement('img');
    img.src = blobUrl;
    img.alt = "Fetched Blob Image";
    document.body.appendChild(img);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching or processing blob:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage with an image URL
const imageUrl = 'https://via.placeholder.com/150';
fetchBlob(imageUrl);
```

</table>The following example demonstrates how to use formData\(\) to process a form submission response using the following steps:

1.  Request Body: Used `JSON.stringify()` to send the form data as JSON instead of URL-encoded parameters.
2.  Content-Type: Set to `application/json` to indicate the request body format.

```
// Example of using Response.formData()
async function fetchFormData(url) {
  try {
    // Make a POST request to fetch the form data
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
      }),
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });

    // Check if the response is successful
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    // Parse the response as FormData
    const formData = await response.formData();

    // Iterate through the FormData entries
    for (const [key, value] of formData.entries()) {
      console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching or processing form data:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage
const formEndpoint = 'https://httpbin.org/post'; // Replace with your form endpoint
fetchFormData(formEndpoint);
```

Output:

```
name: John Doe
email: john.doe@example.com
```

## Fetch Response - json\(\)

Returns a promise that resolves to the result of parsing the body text as JSON.

**Note:** Despite the name of this method, the result of json\(\) is not JSON but is instead the result of taking JSON as input and parsing it to produce a JavaScript object.

|Name|Type|Description|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Object|A promise that resolves to a JavaScript object. This object could be anything that can be represented by JSON, like an object, array, string, number, and so on.|

</table>The following example demonstrates how to use json\(\) to form a response:

1.  fetch\(\) makes a GET request to the URL.
2.  The **response.ok** checks if the request was successful \(status code 200–299\).
3.  If successful, response.json\(\) is called to parse the JSON data from the response.
4.  The parsed data is logged to system logs using the Console API. If any error occurs during the request or parsing, it's caught and logged.

```
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));
```

## Fetch Response - text\(\)

Reads the response body and returns it as a plain string. The response is always decoded using UTF-8.

The text\(\) method is useful for responses that contain textual data, such as HTML, JSON \(if you want to handle it manually\), XML, or plain text files that are meant to be treated as plain strings.
