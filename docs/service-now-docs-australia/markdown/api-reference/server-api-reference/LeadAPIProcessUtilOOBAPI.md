# LeadAPIProcessUtilOOB- Scoped

The LeadAPIProcessUtilOOB script include provides methods that are called by the lead REST API to retrieve lead records and their associated lead line item records.

If you want to customize how lead records are retrieved when the [lead API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/lead-api.md) methods are called, override the methods in this script include in the LeadAPIProcessUtil script include. The names of the methods that you are overriding in the LeadAPIProcessUtil script include must be the same as those in the LeadAPIProcessUtilOOB script include file.

This API is provided within the `sn_lead_mgmt_core` namespace. To access the API, the Lead Management Data Model \(sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\) plugin must be activated on the instance, and the calling user must have the sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core.lead\_integrator role.

For additional information on Lead Management, see [Using Lead Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/lead-management-using.md).
