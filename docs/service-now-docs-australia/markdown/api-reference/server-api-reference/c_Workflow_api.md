# Workflow- Global

The Workflow script include provides methods that interface with the Workflow engine.

Use these methods to manipulate workflows.

**Parent Topic:**[Server API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/api-server.md)

## Workflow - broadcastEvent\(String contextId, String eventName\)

Sends the specified event \(message\) into the workflow context to pass along to the executing activities.

Typical use of this method is to enable activities that wait for some action to occur before proceeding. For additional information on using broadcastEvent, refer to [Workflow event-specific functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/r_WorkflowEventSpecificFunctions.md).

For a list of the available OOB events, refer to [Workflow events in the base system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/build-workflows/r_WorkflowEventsInTheBaseSystem.md).
