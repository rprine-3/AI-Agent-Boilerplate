# GlideConversation- Global

The GlideConversation API provides methods to access information in a Connect message.

**Important:**

Starting with the Paris release, Connect Support no longer receives enhancements or non-priority bug fixes. Consider moving to ServiceNow® Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat in workspace to automatically assign chat requests and other work items to agents. For details, see [Move from Connect Support to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/migrate-from-connect-support.md).

Access GlideConversation properties through a global object \(conversation\) that is available only in Connect action conditions and scripts.

Connect conversations are stored on the Live Group Profile \[live\_group\_profile\] table.
