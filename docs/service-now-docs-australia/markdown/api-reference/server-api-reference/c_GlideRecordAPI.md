# GlideRecord- Global

The GlideRecord API is used for database operations.

The GlideRecord API is the primary means of interfacing with the database on the server-side code. A GlideRecord is an object that contains records from a single table. Use the API to instantiate a GlideRecord object and add query parameters, filters, limits, and ordering.

To use this API to create dynamic attributes you must have the dynamic\_schema\_writer role. To read dynamic data using this API you must have the dynamic\_schema\_reader role.

For information on a class that performs the same functions as GlideRecord and enforces ACLs, see [Using GlideRecordSecure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/p_GlideServerAPIs.md).

See also [Dynamic Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/dynamic-schema.md).

See the [GlideRecord](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/utah/app_store_learnv2_scripting_utah_scripting_in_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_scripting_utah_server_side_scripting/app_store_learnv2_scripting_utah_gliderecord) article for details on building and running queries.

For information about GlideRecordSecure, which is a class inherited from GlideRecord that performs the same functions as GlideRecord and also enforces ACLs, see the [GlideServer APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/p_GlideServerAPIs.md).

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

## Retrieve values from records

In most cases, don’t use dot-walking to get values from a record. Dot-walking retrieves the entire object instead of the field value. Retrieving the object uses more storage and might cause undesirable results when used in arrays or in Service Portal.

Instead of retrieving the entire object, you can use one of the following methods to copy the field values:

-   [getValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)
-   [getDisplayValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)

If dot-walking through a GlideElement object is necessary, use the toString\(\) method to retrieve values. For example, you might need the current caller's manager sys\_id to set another reference field. The following example shows how to get the string value instead of the entire object:

```
var mgr = current.caller_id.manager.toString();
```

## Dynamic attributes

There are methods in this API that have the same functionality as dynamic schema methods in the [GlideDynamicAttributeStore - Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/GlideDynamicAttStoreAPI.md) API. Use the dynamic attribute methods in this API to perform actions on a specified GlideRecord. Use the methods in the GlideDynamicAttributeStore API if you want to set the same group of dynamic attributes on multiple records. Using this API, you can stage a GlideDynamicAttributeStore object with the desired attributes and then copy that object to multiple GlideRecords using the various setDynamicAttributeValues\(\) methods.

## GlideRecord - GlideRecord\(String tableName\)

Creates an instance of the GlideRecord class for the specified table.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|tableName|String|Table to use.|

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
```

## GlideRecord - addActiveQuery\(\)

Adds a filter to return active records.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideQueryCondition|Filter to return active records.|

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.addActiveQuery();
inc.query();
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the addActiveQuery\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [addActiveQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - addDomainQuery\(Object glideRecord\)

Changes the domain used for the query from the user's domain to the domain of the provided GlideRecord.

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

This function requires the Domain Support - Domain Extensions Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\) plugin.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|glideRecord|Object|GlideRecord from which to obtain the domain.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

```
//This example requires the Domain plugin be active, the Group table is the specified 
//Domain table, and the ITIL user is in the Database Atlanta domain
//From any domain (using queryNoDomain()) look up the incidents that an ITIL user can only see 
//who is in the Database Atlanta domain, should expect all incidents with the global or the
//Database Atlanta domain specified.
var domain = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
domain.addQuery('user_name', 'itil');
domain.queryNoDomain();
if (domain.next()) {
    var domainQuery = new GlideRecord('incident');
    domainQuery.addQuery('active', true);
    domainQuery.addDomainQuery(domain);
    domainQuery.query();
    gs.print('Number of Incidents for ITIL user: ' + domainQuery.getRowCount());
    while (domainQuery.next())
        gs.print(domainQuery.number);
}
```

### Scoped equivalent

This method is not available in scoped applications.

## GlideRecord - addEncodedQuery\(String query, Boolean enforceFieldACL\)

Adds an encoded query to other queries that may have been set.

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

**Note:** To enforce query access based on the user, use[addUserEncodedQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md).

 var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
 
 now_GR.addEncodedQuery(queryString);
 now_GR.query();
 while (now_GR.next()) {
 gs.addInfoMessage(now_GR.number);
 }
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the addEncodedQuery\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [addEncodedQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - addExtraField\(String dotWalkedField\)

Queries one or more dot-walked fields from a form or script in a single request.

The addExtraField\(\) method allows you to query dot-walked fields in a single database request, rather than perform multiple queries per dot-walked element in a form or script \(which requires multiple round trips to the database\).

<table id="table_ctk_qcx_hzb" class="parameters"><thead><tr><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

dotWalkedField

String

</td><td>

The dot-walked field name. Levels of field names are separated by dots \(periods\). For example, enter the value `Caller.Company` if you want to query the **Company** &gt; **Caller** condition in the Incident \[incident\] table.The format of **dotWalkedField** follows the left-to-right order of fields in a dotwalked form or script.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table><table id="table_dtk_qcx_hzb" class="returns"><thead><tr><th>

Type

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

None

</td><td>

**Note:** The addExtraField\(\) method does not impact output results; the output is always the same regardless if you use this method in your script.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The following example shows how to query the contact name field of cmn\_location \(referenced from the “location” reference field in a cmdb\_ci field\).

**Note:** The dotWalkedField value in this example, `cmdb_ci.location.contact.name`, looks like “cmdb\_ci fields” =&gt; “cmn\_location fields” =&gt; “sys\_user fields” in the ServiceNow® UI when selecting fields in a list.

```
var gliderecord = new GlideRecord("incident");
gliderecord.addQuery("number", "INC0041457");
gliderecord.addExtraField("cmdb_ci.location.contact.name");
gliderecord.query();
gliderecord.next();
gs.print(gliderecord.cmdb_ci.location.contact.name);
```

The output is the same as `gs.print(gr.cmdb_ci.location.contact.name)` without using addExtraField\(\). The addExtraField\(\) method optimizes the querying of the dot-walked fields. Example output:

```
Abel Tuter
```

## GlideRecord - addFunction\(Object function\)

Applies a pre-defined GlideDBFunctionBuilder object to a record.

Use the GlideDBFunctionBuilder scoped class to define a function. After the function is defined, use the addFunction\(Object function\) method to apply the function to a record.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|function|Object|A GlideDBFunctionBuilder or GlideDBCaseStatementBuilder object that defines a SQL operation.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

```
var functionBuilder = new GlideDBFunctionBuilder();
var myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.add();
myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.field('order');
myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.field('priority');
myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.build();

var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.addFunction(myAddingFunction);
now_GR.addQuery(myAddingFunction, '<', 5);
now_GR.query();
while(now_GR.next())
gs.log(now_GR.getValue(myAddingFunction));

```

Output:

```
*** Script: 1
*** Script: 4
*** Script: 3
*** Script: 1
*** Script: 1
*** Script: 2
*** Script: 1
*** Script: 1
```

## GlideRecord - addInactiveQuery\(\)

Adds a filter to return inactive records. Inactive records have the active flag set to false.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideQueryCondition|Records where the active flag is false.|

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.addInactiveQuery();
inc.query();
```

### Scoped equivalent

In scoped applications use the scoped method [addQuery\("active","false"\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - addJoinQuery\(String table\)

Adds a filter to return records based on a relationship in a related table.

For example, find all the users that are in the database group \(users via sys\_user\_grmember table\). Another example would be find all problems that have an assigned incident \(problems via the incident.problem\_id relationship\).

This is not a true database join; rather, addJoinQuery\(\) adds a subquery. So, while the result set is limited based on the join, the only fields that you have access to are those on the base table \(those which are in the table with which the GlideRecord was initialized\).

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|table|String|Table name|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideQueryCondition|Records where the relationships match.|

Find problems that have an incident attached. This example returns problems that have associated incidents. However, it won't pull values from the incidents that are returned as a part of the query.

```
var prob = new GlideRecord('problem');
prob.addJoinQuery('incident');
prob.query();
```

Find active=false problems with associated incidents.

```
// Look for Problem records
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('problem');
 
// That have associated Incident records
var grSQ = now_GR.addJoinQuery('incident');
 
// Where the Problem records are "active=false"
now_GR.addQuery('active', 'false');
 
// And the Incident records are "active=true"
grSQ.addCondition('active', 'true');
 
// Query
now_GR.query();
 
// Iterate and print results
while (now_GR.next()) {
    gs.print(now_GR.getValue('number'));
}
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the addJoinQuery\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [addJoinQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - addQuery\(String name, Object operator, Object value\)

Provides the ability to build a request, which when executed, returns the rows from the specified table that match the request.

If you're familiar with SQL, this method is similar to the "where" clause. You can make one or more addQuery\(\) calls in a single query. For this method the queries are AND'ed. If any of the query statements need to be OR'ed, use the class [GlideQueryCondition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideQueryConditionAPI.md).

addQuery\(\) is typically called with three parameters; table field, operator, and comparison value. It can be called with only two parameters, table field and comparison value, such as `myObj.addQuery('category','Hardware');`. The operator in this case is assumed to be "equal to".

For additional information on using queries, see [Querying tables in script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_UsingGlideRecordToQueryTables.md).

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

**Note:** To enforce query access based on the user, use[addUserQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - addUserOrderByDesc\(String name\)

Specifies a descending orderBy column. Use this method to enforce query access based on the user.

This method returns only records that the current user has query access to \(based on ACLs\).

Related methods:

-   [orderByDesc\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md) provides the same functionality without ACL enforcement.
-   [addSystemOrderByDesc\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md) bypasses query access checks.

Additional methods for enforcing query ACL checks:

-   [GlideQueryCondition - addUserOrCondition\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideQueryConditionAPI.md)

Call this method more than once to order by multiple columns. Results are arranged in descending order. To arrange records in ascending order, see [addUserOrderBy\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md).

The following example shows how to order incident records in descending order by Short Description.

```
var queryString = "priority=2";
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');

now_GR.addUserOrderByDesc('short_description'); //Descending Order
now_GR.addUserEncodedQuery(queryString);

now_GR.setLimit(6);
now_GR.query();

while (now_GR.next()) {
  gs.info(now_GR.getValue('short_description'));
}

## GlideRecord - addUserQuery\(String name, Object operator, Object value\)

Provides the ability to build a request, which when executed, returns the rows from the specified table that match the request. The calling user must have access to perform the specified query operation on the field for this request to be added. Use this method to enforce query access based on the user.

This method returns only records that the current user has query access to \(based on ACLs\).

Related methods:

-   [addQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md) provides the same functionality without ACL enforcement.
-   [addSystemQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md) bypasses query access checks.

-   [GlideQueryCondition - addUserOrCondition\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideQueryConditionAPI.md)

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

## GlideRecord - addValue\(String field, Number value\)

Provides atomic add and subtract operations on a specified number field at the database level for the current GlideRecord object.

Typically, a GlideRecord object is written as one record in a database. Individual field values are stored as defined. For code that adds a value to a GlideRecord field, it simply saves the field to the database with the new value, rather than atomically incrementing it.

For example, when the following code is executed, the value of the u\_count field in the database is 2.

```
gs.print(now_now_GR.u_count); // "1" 
now_GR.u_count += 1; 
now_GR.update(); 
now_GR.get(now_now_GR.sys_id); 
gs.print(now_now_GR.u_count); // "2"   
```

If another user concurrently runs identical code, instead of the two operations each adding 1 to u\_count, the net effect is that u\_count only contains 2, with one operation's update actually being lost.

Conversely, the addValue\(\) method performs the addition/subtraction in the database when the record is updated as an atomic operation. Two operations running concurrently each properly update the field.

```
gs.print(now_now_GR.u_count); // "1" 
now_GR.addValue("u_count", 1); 
now_GR.update(); 
now_GR.get(now_GR); // The record must be reloaded from the database to observe the result
gs.print(now_now_GR.u_count); // "3", if executed concurrently with another user 
```

**Note:** The new value is not read back from the database unless explicitly done so.

Like setValue\(\), addValue\(\) changes only take effect in the database after a subsequent call to update\(\) or insert\(\). If insert\(\) is called, the specified field is initialized with the **value** parameter passed into addValue\(\).

**Note:** If setValue\(\) is called for the specified field prior to calling addValue\(\), the addValue\(\) method is not processed and an error message is logged.

## GlideRecord - applyTemplate\(String template\)

Apply a template record from the Template table \[sys\_template\] to the current record. If the specified template is not found, no action is taken.

**Note:** This method automatically instantiates a now\_GR.insert\(\) method if a template has the **Next Related Child Template** field filled. For information, see [Create templates for related task records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/create-templates-for-related-task-records.md).

## GlideRecord - autoSysFields\(Boolean e\)

Enables or disables the update to the fields sys\_updated\_by, sys\_updated\_on, sys\_mod\_count, sys\_created\_by, and sys\_created\_on. This is often used for manually updating field values on a record while leaving historical information unchanged.

**Warning:** Use caution if you use this method. When you use this method the sys\_mod\_count field will not be incremented, and other sys\_ fields will not be updated. This can break functionality including, but not limited to, the Activity Formatter, History Sets, Notifications, and Metrics.

## GlideRecord - canRead\(\)

Indicates whether the Access Control Rules \(ACLs\) permit the current user to read the current record within the associated GlideRecord table. This method evaluates all available ACLs for the specific resource.

**Note:** You shouldn’t use this method to check for table-level access. A single call to this method might not be sufficient to get a conclusive table-level access rights check result. To perform a table-level access check, use the GlideSecurityManager.hasRightsTo\(\) method.

     hasChanged = hasChanged || element.changes();
     gs.info(element.getName() + ":" + element.changes());
   }
   gs.info(hasChanged);
```

## GlideRecord - chooseWindow\(Number firstRow, Number lastRow, Boolean forceCount\)

Sets a range of rows to be returned by subsequent queries.

-   **Using setLimit\(\) with chooseWindow\(\)**

    The setLimit\(\) method implicitly calls the chooseWindow\(\) method and might cause unexpected results when used with chooseWindow\(\) in a query.

    -   If the chooseWindow\(\) method is called first, its record window is overwritten by the setLimit\(\) method.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 100 records starting at row 1:

        ```
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        grIncident.setLimit(100);
        ```

    -   If the setLimit\(\) method is called first, the window set by chooseWindow\(\) is used and the limit is overwritten.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 10 records starting at row 21:

        ```
        grIncident.setLimit(5);
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        ```

        **Note:** Running query\(\) with the chooseWindow\(\) method triggers a `COUNT(*)` query, which can result in slow performance on tables with a large number of records. You can use setLimit\(\) before chooseWindow\(\) to skip running the `COUNT(*)` query, but the same performance benefit is achievable using setNoCount\(\).

## GlideRecord - deleteMultiple\(\)

Deletes all records that satisfy the query.

This method does not delete attachments.

Dot-walking is not supported for this method. When using the deleteMultiple\(\) function on referenced tables, all the records in the table are deleted. Also, when using deleteRecord\(\) to cascade delete, prior calls to setWorkflow\(\) on the same GlideRecord object are ignored.

Do not use deleteMultiple\(\) on tables with currency fields. Always delete each record individually. Also, do not use this method with the chooseWindow\(\) or setLimit\(\) methods when working with large tables. The setLimit\(\) method does not limit the number of records that are deleted with deleteMultiple\(\). All records returned by the query are deleted regardless of setLimit\(\).

The **glide.db.forced.chunk.threshold** system property sets the threshold above which forces chunk record deletions and updates. Chunking helps to prevent non-primary key deletions on huge tables from causing replication problems. For more information, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

**Note:** When using deleteMultiple\(\) to cascade delete, prior calls to setWorkflow\(\) on the same GlideRecord object are ignored.

## GlideRecord - disableSysIdInOptimization\(\)

Disables the default optimization that prevents an extra database query from running when a user passes in a large number of sys\_ids, such as `grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds)`.

This method only effects the GlideRecord on which it’s called. To modify the sys\_id limit optimization for all GlideRecords, adjust the value in the **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max** system property \(default 100\).

If you don't either call this method or adjust the **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max** system property and pass a list that contains more sys\_id entries than defined in **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max**, the returned value from GlideRecord.getRowCount\(\) may be incorrect.

The following code example shows how to use the disableSysIdInOptimiation\(\) method to disable the sys\_id limit optimization when passing an Incident sys\_id list that contains 200 entries.

```
var listOf200SysIds = [ ... ]; // 200 comma separated sys_ids
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds);
grIncident.disableSysIdInOptimization(); // Rowcount could be incorrect without this method call
grIncident.query();
if (grIncident.next())
    gs.info("Rowcount: " + grIncident.getRowCount());
```

Output:

```
Rowcount: 200
```

## GlideRecord - find\(String columnName, String value\)

Returns true if any record has a matching value in the specified column. If found, it also moves to the first record that matches, essentially executing next\(\) until the record is returned.

**Note:** This method creates a record instead of updating the existing record if you apply the update\(\) method after modifying the GlideRecord. To avoid creating a record, call the next\(\) method before calling find\(\). For example:

```
var existingMaterials = new GlideRecord('u_m2m_material_num_service_instance');
existingMaterials.addQuery('u_service_instance', serviceInstance.sys_id);
existingMaterials.query();
existingMaterials.next(); // This line added to prevent new record creation

existingMaterials.find('u_material_number', 'ca41b9fd37a84200fdc25ca543990ed8');

existingMaterials.u_material_quantity = 5;
existingMaterials.update("Modify request via catalog");
```

  var recordID = now_GR.getValue("sys_id");
  gs.print("Found in the following record: " + recordID);
} else {
  gs.print("An incident with the specified field value was not found");

Found in the following record: 552c48888c033300964f4932b03eb092
```

## GlideRecord - get\(Object name, Object value\)

Returns the specified record in the current GlideRecord object.

This method accepts either one or two parameters. If only a single parameter is passed in, the method assumes that it is the sys\_id of the desired record. If not found, it then tries to match the value against the display value. If two parameters are passed in, the first is the name of the column within the GlideRecord to search. The second is the value to search for. If multiple records are found, use next\(\) to access the additional records.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|name|Object|Optional. Name of the instantiated GlideRecord column to search for the specified **value** parameter. If only a single parameter is passed in, the method assumes that this parameter is sys\_id.|
|value|Object|Value to match. For calculated fields, the value is matched as is rather than running a calculation on a scripted default value for a field in the record.|

var returnValue = grIncident.get('99ebb4156fa831005be8883e6b3ee4b9');
gs.info(returnValue); // logs true or false
gs.info(grIncident.number); // logs Incident Number
```

This example gets an incident record by passing in the column in the record to search and the value to search for.

```
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
var returnValue = grIncident.get('caller_id.name','Sylivia Wayland');
gs.info(returnValue); // logs true or false
gs.info(grIncident.number); // logs Incident Number

## GlideRecord - getDisplayValue\(String name\)

Retrieves the display value for the current record or the display value of an attribute in a dynamic attribute store.

[Display values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DisplayValues.md) are manipulated based on the actual value in the database and user or system settings and preferences.

The display value that is returned is dependent on the field type.

-   Choice fields: The database value may be a number, but the display value is more descriptive.
-   Date fields: The database value is in UTC format, while the display value is based on the user's time zone.
-   Encrypted text: The database value is encrypted, while the displayed value is unencrypted based on the user's encryption context.
-   Reference fields: The database value is sys\_id, but the display value is the display field of the referenced record.

grInc.getActiveQuery();
grInc.query();
if (grInc.next())
  gs.info("Table Descriptor is - " + grInc.getED().getName());

```

Output:

```
Table Descriptor is - incident
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the getED\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [getED\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - getElement\(String fieldName\)

Retrieves the GlideElement for a specified field.

The value returned by this method is a complete GlideElement object. The results are the equivalent of dot-walking a field value. For example, `now_GR.getElement('short_description')` provides the same result as `nowGR.short_description`.

In most cases, don’t use dot-walking to get values from a record. Dot-walking retrieves the entire object instead of the field value. Retrieving the object uses more storage and might cause undesirable results when used in arrays or in Service Portal.

Instead of retrieving the entire object, you can use one of the following methods to copy the field values:

-   [getValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)
-   [getDisplayValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)

If dot-walking through a GlideElement object is necessary, use the toString\(\) method to retrieve values. For example, you might need the current caller's manager sys\_id to set another reference field. The following example shows how to get the string value instead of the entire object:

```
var mgr = current.caller_id.manager.toString();
```

for( var i = 0; i < numElements; ++i){
  gs.print(i+": "+c[i]);
}
```

## GlideRecord - getRelatedTables\(\)

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
var c = now_GR.getRelatedTables().values().toArray();
var numElements = c.length;
for( var i = 0; i < numElements; ++i){
  gs.print(i+": "+c[i]);
}
```

## GlideRecord - getRowCount\(\)

Retrieves the number of rows \(records\) in the current GlideRecord object.

**Note:** GlideRecord returns matching records, so it might not be as efficient as GlideAggregate when you only need the number of records. If you only need a record count and aren’t iterating over the matching records, use GlideAggregate.

-   **Retrieving the number of records in GlideRecord or GlideAggregate**

    The GlideRecord getRowCount\(\) and [GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideAggregateScopedAPI.md) APIs offer similar information. Use the following criteria to determine which option is best for you.

    -   The GlideRecord getRowCount\(\) method tells you how many records have been returned from a query along with the records themselves. If you need the number of records in the result set before or after you iterate over the set to perform actions on the records, use this method.
    -   The GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\) method retrieves only a count of records matching the query, excluding the actual records. The aggregate must be set on the GlideAggregate object before issuing the query.
    Retrieving the records and count with GlideRecord getRowCount\(\)

    The following example shows how to get the total number of active incidents with GlideRecord getRowCount\(\):

    ```
    var incident = new GlideRecord("incident");
    incident.addQuery("active", true);
    incident.query();
     
    gs.info("*** Total number of active incidents: {0}", incident.getRowCount());
    ```

    Retrieving only the number of records with GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\)

    The following example shows how to return only the number of records. Because this method doesn’t use the matching records, it’s much more efficient to use an aggregate query and return just the count.

    ```
    var incident = new GlideAggregate("incident");
    incident.addQuery("active", true);
    incident.addAggregate("COUNT");
    incident.query();
     
    if (incident.next())
        gs.info("*** Total number of active incidents: {0}", incident.getAggregate("COUNT"));
    ```

    Deciding which option is best for your solution

    If you only want to retrieve the number of records, the GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\) method is the best option. To use the individual records and retrieve the number of results, use GlideRecord getRowCount\(\), because a single query provides this functionality.


**Note:** If you want to use the getRowCount\(\) method when using `sys_id IN` with more than 100 sys\_id values, such as `grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds)`, you must either:

-   Call the disableSysIdInOptimization\(\) method on the GlideRecord.
-   Or, adjust the **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max** system property to a value higher than the number of sys\_ids in the list.

In addition, ensure that you call the .next\(\) method before calling the getRowCount\(\) method.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Number|Number of rows in the current GlideRecord.|

The following example shows how to get the number of incidents from the Incident \[incident\] table.

```
var numberOfIncidents = new GlideRecord('incident');
numberOfIncidents.query();
gs.info("Records in incident table: " + numberOfIncidents.getRowCount());
```

Output:

```
Records in incident table: 6920
```

The following code example shows how to use the disableSysIdInOptimiation\(\) method to disable the sys\_id limit optimization when passing an Incident sys\_id list that contains 200 entries.

```
var listOf200SysIds = [ ... ]; // 200 comma separated sys_ids
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds);
grIncident.disableSysIdInOptimization(); // Rowcount could be incorrect without this method call
grIncident.query();
if (grIncident.next())
    gs.info("Rowcount: " + grIncident.getRowCount());
```

Output:

```
Rowcount: 200
```

var item = new GlideRecord('sc_req_item'); 
item.addQuery('sys_id', current.parent.sys_id); 
item.query(); 
if(item.next()){ 
  for(var variable in item.variable_pool) {
    gs.log(variable);

## GlideRecord - isNewRecord\(\)

Determines whether the current record has been inserted into the database.

This method returns true only if the newRecord\(\) method has been called. This method is useful for scripted ACL, and in the condition of UI actions, but should not be used in background scripts.

**Note:** This method returns true for any new record during a business rule, or if the newRecord\(\) method is used to initialize a record with default values and a unique ID \(sys\_id\). In all other cases, it returns false.

</table>The following example shows how to use this method in a business rule. The operation\(\) method detects which operation triggered an event and performs a different action depending for update and insert operations.

```
if(current.operation() == "update") {
  current.updates ++; } 
if(current.operation() == "insert") {
  current.updates = 0; }
```

This example shows how to use the operation\(\) method to pass the operation value into the startFlow\(\) method.

To use the setAbortAction\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [setAbortAction\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - setCategory\(String category\)

Sets the query category, which determines how the query is routed to a secondary database.

This method requires the Secondary Database Pools \[com.glide.secondary\_db\_pools\] plugin. Call this method to route queries to a secondary \(read replica\) database based on the specified category, reducing load on the primary database. Due to replication lag, execution of a query on a read replica database may return slightly out of date results compared to executing the same query on the primary database.

Modifications to data are always serviced by the primary database, even if setCategory\(\) is used in the query. For example, a call to GlideRecord.update\(\) is always directed to the primary database even if the GlideRecord object has been provided with the name of a secondary database category via setCategory\(\).

|void| |

This example shows how to force a record in the itfm\_cost\_model table to update even without changes.

```
function() {

  var now_GR = new GlideRecord("itfm_cost_model");
  now_GR.initialize();
  now_GR.addNullQuery("source_table");

      now_GR.setWorkflow(false);
      now_GR.update();
    }
  }
}
```

## GlideRecord - setLimit\(Number limit\)

Sets the maximum number of records to return in the GlideRecord from a query.

-   **Using setLimit\(\) with chooseWindow\(\)**

    The setLimit\(\) method implicitly calls the chooseWindow\(\) method and might cause unexpected results when used with chooseWindow\(\) in a query.

    -   If the chooseWindow\(\) method is called first, its record window is overwritten by the setLimit\(\) method.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 100 records starting at row 1:

        ```
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        grIncident.setLimit(100);
        ```

    -   If the setLimit\(\) method is called first, the window set by chooseWindow\(\) is used and the limit is overwritten.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 10 records starting at row 21:

        ```
        grIncident.setLimit(5);
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        ```

        **Note:** Running query\(\) with the chooseWindow\(\) method triggers a `COUNT(*)` query, which can result in slow performance on tables with a large number of records. You can use setLimit\(\) before chooseWindow\(\) to skip running the `COUNT(*)` query, but the same performance benefit is achievable using setNoCount\(\).


See also:

-   [chooseWindow\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)

-   [setNoCount\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|limit|Number|Limit for records to fetch.|

|Type|Description|

|void| |

This example sets the number of records returned in the query to a maximum of ten.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.orderByDesc('sys_created_on');
now_GR.setLimit(10);
now_GR.query();
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the setLimit\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [setLimit\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - setLocation\(Number rowNumber\)

Sets the current row location to the specified value.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|rowNumber|Number|Row number to set as the current row.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

This example shows how to set the record position in the Incident table

```
verifySetLocation : function() {
  var now_GR = new GlideRecord("incident");
  now_GR.query();
  var recordIDs = new Array();
  while(now_GR.next()) {
  recordIDs.push(now_GR.getValue("sys_id"));
  }
  for (var ix = recordIDs.length - 1; ix >= 0; ix--) {
    now_GR.setLocation(ix);
    Assert.assertEquals(recordIDs[ix], now_GR.getValue("sys_id"),
      "The entry retrieved for the index " + ix + " is not valid");
  }
}
```

## GlideRecord - setNewGuid\(\)

Generates a new GUID and sets it as the unique ID \(sys\_id\) for the current record.

This function applies only to new records. You cannot change the GUID for an existing record.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Sys\_id of the current record.|

This example creates a new task record and stores the ID in the task\_rel\_task table.

```
var task = new GlideRecord ('task');
var tsk_id = task.setNewGuid();
 
task.description = "Request: " + current.request.number;
task.description = task.description + "\n" + "Requested by: " + current.request.u_requested_by.name;
task.description = task.description + "\n" + "Requested for: " + current.request.u_requested_for.name;
task.description = task.description + "\n" + "Item: " + current.cat_item.name;
 
var now_GR = new GlideRecord ('task_rel_task');
//link the incident to the request
now_GR.parent = current.request;
now_GR.child = tsk_id;
now_GR.insert();
```

## GlideRecord - setNewGuidValue \(String guid\)

Generates a new GUID and sets it as the unique ID for the current record, when inserting a new record.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|guid|String|Value for the new GUID.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

This example generates a new GUID and sets it as the unique ID for the newly created cmdb\_software\_instance record.

```
var gobj = new GlideRecord('sys_db_object');
gobj.addQuery('name','cmdb_software_instance');
gobj.query();
if (!gobj.next()) {
  var si = new GlideRecord('cmdb_software_instance');
  si.query();
  var count = 0;
  while (si.next()) {
  if (!si.isValidField('sys_class_name')) {
    var ci = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci');
    ci.name = si.name;
    ci.setNewGuidValue(si.sys_id);
    ci.sys_class_name = 'cmdb_software_instance';
    ci.insert();
    count++;
  }
}
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the setNewGuidValue\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [setNewGuidValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - setNoCount\(\)

Stops a GlideRecord query from running a `COUNT(*)` query.

Running query\(\) with some methods trigger a `COUNT(*)` query, such as the chooseWindow\(\) and getRowCount\(\) methods. The `COUNT(*)` query might cause slow performance on tables with a million or more records. For more information, see the [Performance Improvement - Remove Pagination Count \[KB0817996\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0817996) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

**Note:** The setLimit\(\) method also stops a `COUNT(*)`. Using setNoCount\(\) is unnecessary if the setLimit\(\) method is included in the query.

See also:

-   [chooseWindow\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)
-   [query\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordAPI.md)

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

The following code example shows how to use setNoCount\(\) to skip the `COUNT(*)` query on a windowed query set using the chooseWindow\(\) method.

```
var  grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');

grIncident.chooseWindow(6915, 6920, true);
grIncident.setNoCount();
grIncident.query();

while (grIncident.next()) { // Iterate through the returned records
    gs.info('Incident Number: ' + grIncident.number + ', Short Description: ' + grIncident.short_description);
};
```

Output:

```
Incident Number: INC0006811, Short Description: Request an account to be created for Fidelity 401(k) Plans
Incident Number: INC0006918, Short Description: Please grant me additional roles in Oracle Fin Collections
Incident Number: INC0006812, Short Description: Taxware Value-added Tax crashes when I try to launch it
Incident Number: INC0006919, Short Description: Unable to Access SuccessFactors Learning
Incident Number: INC0010004, Short Description: Incident for assessment not generating

  var now_GR = new GlideRecord("oauth_credential");
  var oauthClient = now_GR.addJoinQuery("oauth_entity", "peer", "sys_id");
  now_GR.addQuery("type", "access_token");
  now_GR.addQuery("expires", ">", nowDateTime());
  now_GR.addNullQuery("oauth_requestor_profile");

  oauthClient.addCondition("type", "client");
  now_GR.setUseEngines(false);
  now_GR.setWorkflow(false);
  now_GR.query();
  return now_GR.hasNext();
}
```

## GlideRecord - setValue\(String name, Object value\)

Sets the specified field, or an attribute in a dynamic attribute store, to a specified value.

Normally a script would do a direct assignment, for example `now_GR.category = value`. However, if in a script the element name is a variable, then you can use `now_GR.setValue(elementName, value)`. When setting a value, ensure that the data type of the field matches the data type of the value you enter. For information about the differences between using setValue\(\) and direct assignment, see [Explanation of Assignment Behavior for Reference GlideList Fields \[KB2557324\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2557324) in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

If the value parameter is null, the record isn't updated, and an error isn't thrown.

**Note:** This method can't be used on journal fields. Use [GlideElement.setJournalEntry\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementAPI.md) instead.

**Note:** If the Field Encryption Enterprise plugin is enabled and the instance has access to the key, this method can insert encrypted data into encrypted fields. If the instance does not have access to the key, this method returns an error. For more information, see [Platform Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/encryption-landing.md).

-   **Not for authentication with password2 fields**

    The setValue\(\) method passes password2 data as clear text, which results in an error about expecting encrypted data. Additionally, using the setValue\(\) method for password2 fields exposes data that should be encrypted.

    For password2 authentication, use the setDisplayValue\(\) method instead.

To specify a dynamic category field in dynamic schema, use a reference key with the namespace and category field name instead of a sys\_id. Provide the category column as the name parameter, e.g., `grExample.setValue('cat_column_name', 'namespace_name/cat_name')`.

This example shows how to set the value of the state field in the planned\_task table.

```
function() {
  var topTask = new GlideRecord('planned_task');
  topTask.setValue('state', -5);
  var childTask = new GlideRecord('planned_task');
  childTask.setValue('state', -5);
  var s = new PlannedTaskStateManagement(childTask, topTask);
  var state = s.manageStateChange(false);
  Assert.assertEquals("-5", state);
}
```

This example shows how to use this method with dynamic schema. The first usage sets the value of a dynamic category using a reference key to set the value. The second uses an attribute path to set the value of a dynamic attribute called `total_miles`.

```
var used_car = new GlideRecord('u_product');

// Using setValue() to set the dynamic category column to Car
// u_product/u_attributes is the namespace and u_car is the category
used_car.setValue('u_attributes_category', 'u_product/u_attributes/u_car');

// Using setDynamicAttributeValue() to set the dynamic attribute value
used_car.setDynamicAttributeValue("u_attributes->color","green");
used_car.setDynamicAttributeValue("u_attributes->make","Toyota");
used_car.setDynamicAttributeValue("u_attributes->model","Rav4");
used_car.setDynamicAttributeValue("u_attributes->luxury",false);
used_car.setDynamicAttributeValue("u_attributes->cost",12500);
used_car.setDynamicAttributeValue("u_attributes->avg_mpg",24.8);
used_car.setDynamicAttributeValue("u_attributes->date_purchased", new GlideDateTime());

// Using setValue() to set the dynamic attribute value
used_car.setValue("u_attributes->total_miles", 120000.12345);

used_car.insert();
```

## GlideRecord - setWorkflow\(Boolean enable\)

Enables or disables running business rules that might normally be triggered by subsequent actions.

**Note:** The setWorkflow\(\) method is ignored when subsequently using either the deleteProblem\(\) or deleteMultiple\(\) methods to cascade delete.

**Warning:** Disabling the running of business rules can have a significant impact on your ServiceNow® instance and how it operates. Ensure that you thoroughly test this change before deploying it to production.

## GlideRecord - update\(Object reason\)

Updates the GlideRecord with any changes that have been made. If the record does not exist, it is inserted.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|reason|Object|Optional. Reason for the update. The reason appears in the audit record.|

|Type|Description|

|String|The sys\_id of the new or update record. Returns null if the update fails.|

This example updates a record in the task\_ci table.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('task_ci');
now_GR.addQuery();
now_GR.query();
var count = now_GR.getRowCount();
if (count > 0) {
   var allocation = parseInt(10000 / count) / 100;
   while (now_GR.next()) {
      now_GR.u_allocation = allocation;
      now_GR.update();
   }
}
```

To use the update\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [update\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## GlideRecord - updateMultiple\(\)

Updates each GlideRecord in a stated query with a specified set of changes.

For information on adding journal entries, refer to the [setJournalEntry\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementAPI.md) method.

The **glide.db.forced.chunk.threshold** system property sets the threshold above which forces chunk record deletions and updates. Chunking helps to prevent non-primary key deletions on huge tables from causing replication problems. For more information, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

**Note:** To ensure expected results, use the setValue\(\) method instead of direct assignments. That is, use `gr_Now.setValue('<field_name>', '4'));` instead of `gr_Now.<field_name> = 4`.

**Note:** Do not use this method with the chooseWindow\(\) or setLimit\(\) methods when working with large tables.

This method sets new values and does not clear existing values. To clear an existing value, use the setValue\(\) method and set the field to 'NULL'. For more information, see [Setting a GlideRecord variable to 'NULL'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/r_SettingAGlideRecordVariableToNull.md).

## GlideRecord - updateWithReferences\(Object reason\)

Updates a record and also inserts or updates any related records with the information provided.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|reason|Object|Reason for the updates. The reason is displayed in the audit record.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|The sys\_id for the record being updated.|

If processing an incident where the Caller ID is set to reference sys\_user record 'John Doe,' then the following code would update John Doe's user record. If processing an incident where there's no caller ID specified, then the following code creates a new sys\_user record with the provided information \(first\_name, last\_name\) and sets the caller ID value to the newly created sys\_user record.

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.get(inc_sys_id);  // Looking up an existing incident record where 'inc_sys_id' represents the sys_id of a incident record
inc.caller_id.first_name = 'John';
inc.caller_id.last_name = 'Doe';
inc.updateWithReferences();
}
```
