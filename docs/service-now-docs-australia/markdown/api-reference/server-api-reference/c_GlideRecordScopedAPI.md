# GlideRecord- Scoped

The scoped GlideRecord API is used for database operations.

The GlideRecord API is the primary means of interfacing with the database on the server-side code. A GlideRecord is an object that contains records from a single table. Use the API to instantiate a GlideRecord object and add query parameters, filters, limits, and ordering.

See the [GlideRecord](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/courses/utah/app_store_learnv2_scripting_utah_scripting_in_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_scripting_utah_server_side_scripting/app_store_learnv2_scripting_utah_gliderecord) article for details on building and running queries.

For information on a class that performs the same functions as GlideRecord and enforces ACLs, see [Using GlideRecordSecure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/p_GlideServerAPIs.md).

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

## Retrieve values from records

In most cases, don’t use dot-walking to get values from a record. Dot-walking retrieves the entire object instead of the field value. Retrieving the object uses more storage and might cause undesirable results when used in arrays or in Service Portal.

Instead of retrieving the entire object, you can use one of the following methods to copy the field values:

-   [getValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md)
-   [getDisplayValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md)

If dot-walking through a GlideElement object is necessary, use the toString\(\) method to retrieve values. For example, you might need the current caller's manager sys\_id to set another reference field. The following example shows how to get the string value instead of the entire object:

```
var mgr = current.caller_id.manager.toString();
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - addActiveQuery\(\)

Adds a filter to return active records.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideQueryCondition|Filter to return active records.|

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.addActiveQuery();
inc.query();
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - addEncodedQuery\(String query, Boolean enforceFieldACL\)

Adds an encoded query to other queries that may have been set.

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

**Note:** To enforce query access based on the user, use[addUserEncodedQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

now_GR.addEncodedQuery(queryString);
now_GR.query();
while (now_GR.next()) {
  gs.addInfoMessage(now_GR.getValue('number'));
}
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - addFunction\(Object function\)

Applies a pre-defined GlideDBFunctionBuilder object to a record.

Use the GlideDBFunctionBuilder scoped class to define a function. After the function is defined, use the addFunction\(Object function\) method to apply the function to a record.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|function|Object|GlideDBFunctionBuilder object that defines a SQL operation.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

```
var functionBuilder = new GlideDBFunctionBuilder();
var myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.add();
myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.field('order');
myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.field('priority');
myAddingFunction = functionBuilder.build();

// Query incidents in which order + priority is less than 5 and display that added value
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.addFunction(myAddingFunction);
now_GR.addQuery(myAddingFunction, '<', 5);
now_GR.query();
while(now_GR.next())
  gs.info(now_GR.getValue(myAddingFunction));
```

Output:

```
1
4
3
1
1
2
1
```

## Scoped GlideRecord – addJoinQuery\(String joinTable, String primaryField, String joinTableField\)

Adds a filter to return records based on a relationship in a table related to the current GlideRecord.

You can use this method to find all the users that are in the database group via the Group Member \[sys\_user\_grmember\] table, or to find all problems that have an assigned incident via the incident.problem\_id relationship.

This is not a true database join; rather, addJoinQuery\(\) adds a subquery. So, while the result set is limited based on the join, the only fields that you have access to are those on the base table \(those which are in the table with which the GlideRecord was initialized.\)

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement.

|GlideQueryCondition|Filter that lists records where the relationships match.|

Find problems that have an incident attached. This example returns problems that have associated incidents. However, it won't pull values from the incidents that are returned as a part of the query.

```
var prob = new GlideRecord('problem');
prob.addJoinQuery('incident');
prob.query();
```

Find inactive problems with associated incidents.

```
// Look for Problem records that have associated Incident records
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('problem');
var grSQ = now_GR.addJoinQuery('incident');
 
// Where the Problem records are "active=false"
now_GR.addQuery('active', 'false');
 
// And the Incident records are "active=true"
grSQ.addCondition('active', 'true');
 
// Query
now_GR.query();
 
// Iterate and output results
while (now_GR.next()) {
gs.info(now_GR.getValue('number'));
}
```

Find problems that have incidents associated where the incident **caller\_id** field value matches that of the problem **opened\_by** field.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('problem'); 
        now_GR.addJoinQuery('incident', 'opened_by', 'caller_id'); 
        now_GR.query();
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - addNotNullQuery\(String fieldName\)

A filter that specifies records where the value of the field passed in the parameter is not null.

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

target.addNotNullQuery('short_description');
target.query();   // Issue the query to the database to get all records where short_description is not null
while (target.next()) {   
     // add code here to process the incident record
}
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - addNullQuery\(String fieldName\)

Adds a filter to return records where the value of the specified field is null.

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records.

target.query();   // Issue the query to the database to get all records where short_description is null
while (target.next()) {   
   // add code here to process the incident record
}
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - addQuery\(String name, Object value\)

Build a search query and return the rows that match the request.

If you are familiar with SQL, this method is similar to the "where" clause. One or more addQuery\(\) calls can be made in a single query; in this case the queries are AND'ed. If any of the query statements need to be OR'ed, use the GlideQueryCondition method [addOrCondition\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideQueryConditionScopedAPI.md).

**Note:** To enforce query access based on the user, use[addUserQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

When addQuery\(\) is called with only two parameters, table name and comparison value, such as `myObj.addQuery('category','Hardware');`, the operator is assumed to be "equal to".

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records.

If you are familiar with SQL, this method is similar to the "where" clause. One or more addQuery\(\) calls can be made in a single query; in this case the queries are AND'ed. If any of the query statements need to be OR'ed, use the GlideQueryCondition method [addOrCondition\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideQueryConditionScopedAPI.md).

## Scoped GlideRecord - addSystemEncodedQuery\(String query\)

Adds a query using an encoded query string. Use this method to bypass query access.

Use this method when system-level access is intended, so that query ACL enforcement is explicitly bypassed for the user. Use[addUserEncodedQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md) to enforce query access.

Additional methods for system-level access that bypass query ACL checks:

For information on using this method with GlideRecordSecure, see [Enforcing query ACLs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/p_GlideServerAPIs.md).

Always test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert\(\), update\(\), deleteRecord\(\), or deleteMultiple\(\) method on bad query results can result in data loss.

You can set the **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records. In some cases, the query may still return records in API results even when **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** is set to true. This happens in queries where an invalid query term is used with a WHERE operator. In such queries, the WHERE operator ignores the invalid term\(s\) but still interprets and returns the rest of the query statement. For more information about this system property and its functionality, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

## Scoped GlideRecord - chooseWindow\(Number firstRow, Number lastRow, Boolean forceCount\)

Sets a range of rows to be returned by subsequent queries.

-   **Using setLimit\(\) with chooseWindow\(\)**

    The setLimit\(\) method implicitly calls the chooseWindow\(\) method and might cause unexpected results when used with chooseWindow\(\) in a query.

    -   If the chooseWindow\(\) method is called first, its record window is overwritten by the setLimit\(\) method.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 100 records starting at row 1:

        ```
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        grIncident.setLimit(100);
        ```

    -   If the setLimit\(\) method is called first, the window set by chooseWindow\(\) is used and the limit is overwritten.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 10 records starting at row 21:

        ```
        grIncident.setLimit(5);
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        ```

        **Note:** Running query\(\) with the chooseWindow\(\) method triggers a `COUNT(*)` query, which can result in slow performance on tables with a large number of records. You can use setLimit\(\) before chooseWindow\(\) to skip running the `COUNT(*)` query, but the same performance benefit is achievable using setNoCount\(\).

## Scoped GlideRecord - deleteMultiple\(\)

Deletes all records that satisfy the query.

This method does not delete attachments.

Do not use deleteMultiple\(\) on tables with currency fields. Always delete each record individually. Also, do not use this method with the chooseWindow\(\) or setLimit\(\) methods when working with large tables. The setLimit\(\) method does not limit the number of records that are deleted with deleteMultiple\(\). All records returned by the query are deleted regardless of setLimit\(\).

The **glide.db.forced.chunk.threshold** system property sets the threshold above which forces chunk record deletions and updates. Chunking helps to prevent non-primary key deletions on huge tables from causing replication problems. For more information, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

grTicket.initialize();
grTicket.short_description = 'Example ticket';
grTicket.work_notes = 'An update about the ticket';
var ins_sys_id = grTicket.insert(); // Insert the record

## Scoped GlideRecord - disableSysIdInOptimization\(\)

Disables the default optimization that prevents an extra database query from running when a user passes in a large number of sys\_ids, such as `grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds)`.

This method only effects the GlideRecord on which it’s called. To modify the sys\_id limit optimization for all GlideRecords, adjust the value in the **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max** system property \(default 100\).

If you don't either call this method or adjust the **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max** system property and pass a list that contains more sys\_id entries than defined in **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max**, the returned value from GlideRecord.getRowCount\(\) may be incorrect.

var listOf200SysIds = [ ... ]; // 200 comma separated sys_ids
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds);
grIncident.disableSysIdInOptimization(); // Rowcount could be incorrect without this method call
grIncident.query();
if (grIncident.next())
    gs.info("Rowcount: " + grIncident.getRowCount());
```

Output:

```
Rowcount: 200
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - get\(Object name, Object value\)

Returns the specified record in the current GlideRecord object.

This method accepts either one or two parameters. If only a single parameter is passed in, the method assumes that it is the sys\_id of the desired record. If not found, it then tries to match the value against the display value. If two parameters are passed in, the first is the name of the column within the GlideRecord to search. The second is the value to search for. If multiple records are found, use next\(\) to access the additional records.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|name|Object|Optional. Name of the instantiated GlideRecord column to search for the specified **value** parameter. If only a single parameter is passed in, the method assumes that this parameter is the sys\_id or display value.|

var now_GR = new GlideRecord("incident");
var value = now_GR.getClassDisplayValue();
gs.info("The table label is " + value + ".");
```

Output:

```
The table label is Incident.
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - getDisplayValue\(\)

Retrieves the display value for the current record.

Display values are manipulated based on the actual value in the database and user or system settings and preferences.

The display value that is returned is dependent on the field type.

-   Choice fields: The database value may be a number, but the display value will be more descriptive.
-   Date fields: The database value is in UTC format, while the display value is based on the user's time zone.
-   Encrypted text: The database value is encrypted, while the displayed value is unencrypted based on the user's encryption context.
-   Reference fields: The database value is sys\_id, but the display value is a display field of the referenced record.

|Name|Type|Description|

var field = grInc.getElement('priority');
var ed = field.getED();

var isEdge = ed.getLabel();
gs.info("Label is - " + isEdge);
```

Output:

```
Label is - Priority
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - getElement\(String fieldName\)

Retrieves the GlideElement object for the specified field.

The value returned by this method is a complete GlideElement object. The results are the equivalent of dot-walking a field value. For example, `now_GR.getElement('short_description')` provides the same result as `nowGR.short_description`.

In most cases, don’t use dot-walking to get values from a record. Dot-walking retrieves the entire object instead of the field value. Retrieving the object uses more storage and might cause undesirable results when used in arrays or in Service Portal.

Instead of retrieving the entire object, you can use one of the following methods to copy the field values:

-   [getValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md)
-   [getDisplayValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md)

If dot-walking through a GlideElement object is necessary, use the toString\(\) method to retrieve values. For example, you might need the current caller's manager sys\_id to set another reference field. The following example shows how to get the string value instead of the entire object:

```
var mgr = current.caller_id.manager.toString();
```

See also:

-   [GlideElement – toString\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md)

|fieldName|String|Column name for which to return the GlideElement object.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideElement|The GlideElement for the specified column of the current record. Each object describes a field in the current GlideRecord.|

The following example shows how to add a new incident record with details in the **Short Description** field.

```
var elementName = 'short_description'; 
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident'); 
now_GR.newRecord(); 
now_GR.setValue(elementName, "My DB is not working");
now_GR.insert();
 
var sdesc = now_GR.getElement('short_description');
gs.info(sdesc.getValue());
```

Output:

```
My DB is not working
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - getElements\(\)

Returns an array of GlideElement objects. Each object describes a field in the current GlideRecord.

If dot-walking through a GlideElement object is necessary, use the toString\(\) method to retrieve values. For example, you might need the current caller's manager sys\_id to set another reference field. The following example shows how to get the string value instead of the entire object:

var mgr = current.caller_id.manager.toString();
```

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('question');
var elementArr = now_GR.getElements();
now_GR.orderByDesc('sys_created_on');
now_GR.setLimit(5);

  if (nicePrice != '') {
    nicePrice = parseFloat(nicePrice);
    nicePrice = nicePrice.toFixed(2);
  }
  template.print(now_GR.number + ":  " + now_GR.quantity + " X " + now_GR.cat_item.getDisplayValue() 
    + " at $" + nicePrice + " each \n");

gs.info(recordClassName);
```

Output:

```

```

## Scoped GlideRecord - getRowCount\(\)

Retrieves the number of rows \(records\) in the current GlideRecord object.

**Note:** GlideRecord returns matching records, so it might not be as efficient as GlideAggregate when you only need the number of records. If you only need a record count and aren’t iterating over the matching records, use GlideAggregate.

-   **Retrieving the number of records in GlideRecord or GlideAggregate**

    The GlideRecord getRowCount\(\) and [GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideAggregateScopedAPI.md) APIs offer similar information. Use the following criteria to determine which option is best for you.

    -   The GlideRecord getRowCount\(\) method tells you how many records have been returned from a query along with the records themselves. If you need the number of records in the result set before or after you iterate over the set to perform actions on the records, use this method.
    -   The GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\) method retrieves only a count of records matching the query, excluding the actual records. The aggregate must be set on the GlideAggregate object before issuing the query.
    Retrieving the records and count with GlideRecord getRowCount\(\)

    The following example shows how to get the total number of active incidents with GlideRecord getRowCount\(\):

    ```
    var incident = new GlideRecord("incident");
    incident.addQuery("active", true);
    incident.query();
     
    gs.info("*** Total number of active incidents: {0}", incident.getRowCount());
    ```

    Retrieving only the number of records with GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\)

    The following example shows how to return only the number of records. Because this method doesn’t use the matching records, it’s much more efficient to use an aggregate query and return just the count.

    ```
    var incident = new GlideAggregate("incident");
    incident.addQuery("active", true);
    incident.addAggregate("COUNT");
    incident.query();
     
    if (incident.next())
        gs.info("*** Total number of active incidents: {0}", incident.getAggregate("COUNT"));
    ```

    Deciding which option is best for your solution

    If you only want to retrieve the number of records, the GlideAggregate getAggregate\(\) method is the best option. To use the individual records and retrieve the number of results, use GlideRecord getRowCount\(\), because a single query provides this functionality.


**Note:** If you want to use the getRowCount\(\) method when using `sys_id IN` with more than 100 sys\_id values, such as `grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds)`, you must either:

-   Call the disableSysIdInOptimization\(\) method on the GlideRecord.
-   Or, adjust the **glide.db.first\_pass\_sys\_id\_list\_size.max** system property to a value higher than the number of sys\_ids in the list.

In addition, ensure that you call the .next\(\) method before calling the getRowCount\(\) method.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Number|Number of rows in the current GlideRecord.|

The following example shows how to get the number of incidents from the Incident \[incident\] table.

```
var numberOfIncidents = new GlideRecord('incident');
numberOfIncidents.query();
gs.info("Records in incident table: " + numberOfIncidents.getRowCount());
```

Output:

```
Records in incident table: 6920
```

The following code example shows how to use the disableSysIdInOptimiation\(\) method to disable the sys\_id limit optimization when passing an Incident sys\_id list that contains 200 entries.

```
var listOf200SysIds = [ ... ]; // 200 comma separated sys_ids
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addQuery('sys_id', 'IN', listOf200SysIds);
grIncident.disableSysIdInOptimization(); // Rowcount could be incorrect without this method call
grIncident.query();
if (grIncident.next())
    gs.info("Rowcount: " + grIncident.getRowCount());
```

Output:

```
Rowcount: 200
```

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('kb_knowledge');
now_GR.query();
now_GR.next();
var uniqueid = now_GR.getUniqueValue();
gs.info(uniqueid);
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - getValue\(String name\)

Retrieves the string value of an underlying element in a field.

**Note:** If the Field Encryption Enterprise plugin is enabled and the instance has access to the key, this method returns clear text values from encrypted fields. If the instance does not have access to the key, this method returns the encrypted value. For more information, see [Platform Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/encryption-landing.md).

|Name|Type|Description|

## Scoped GlideRecord - isEncodedQueryValid\(String query\)

Verifies whether the specified encoded query is valid.

If the specified encoded query is valid, then the query is applied, just as if you had called [addEncodedQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md). If the specified encoded query is invalid, then `sys_idNotValidnull` is added as the encoded query.

**Note:** This method has been deprecated and replaced with the [isValidEncodedQuery\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md) method which does not execute the query.

comment_GR.get(commentId);
gs.info(comment_GR.isValid());
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - isValidEncodedQuery\(String query\)

Verifies whether the syntax of the encoded query is correct.

When passing an empty string \(`""`\) as the provide query:

-   The empty string \(`""`\) represents the absence of a query and returns false.
-   Calling `GlideRecord.addEncodedQuery("")` followed by `GlideRecord.query()` returns all rows. The query method is similar to a SQL SELECT statement. In SQL, when using "SELECT \* FROM foo WHERE X", the value X represents the query. If no query value is provided, all records are returned \(e.g., SELECT \* FROM foo\).

```
if(current.operation() == "update") {
  current.updates ++; } 
if(current.operation() == "insert") {
  current.updates = 0; }
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - orderBy\(String name\)

Specifies an orderBy column.

Call this method more than once to order by multiple columns. Results are arranged in ascending order. To arrange records in descending order, see [Scoped GlideRecord - orderByDesc\(String name\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md).

## Scoped GlideRecord - query\(String field, String value\)

Runs a query against the table based on the filters specified in the query methods such as addQuery\(\) and addEncodedQuery\(\).

This method queries the GlideRecord table as well as any references of the table. For more information, see [Querying tables in script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/c_UsingGlideRecordToQueryTables.md).

**Note:** This method fails if there is a field in the table called "query". If that is the case, use the[\_query\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md) method instead.

## Scoped GlideRecord - setAbortAction\(Boolean b\)

Sets a flag to indicate if the next database action \(insert, update, delete\) is to be aborted. This is often used in business rules.

Use in an `onBefore` business rule to prevent the database action from being done. The business rule continues to run after setAbortAction\(\) is called. Calling setAbortAction\(\) does not stop subsequent business rules from executing. Calling this method only prevents the database action from occurring.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|b|Boolean|True to abort the next action. False if the action is to be allowed.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

```
// Often used in business rule to check whether the current operation should be aborted.
if (current.size > 16) {
  current.setAbortAction(true);
}
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - setCategory\(String category\)

Sets the query category, which determines how the query is routed to a secondary database.

This method requires the Secondary Database Pools \[com.glide.secondary\_db\_pools\] plugin. Call this method to route queries to a secondary \(read replica\) database based on the specified category, reducing load on the primary database. Due to replication lag, execution of a query on a read replica database may return slightly out of date results compared to executing the same query on the primary database.

Modifications to data are always serviced by the primary database, even if setCategory\(\) is used in the query. For example, a call to GlideRecord.update\(\) is always directed to the primary database even if the GlideRecord object has been provided with the name of a secondary database category via setCategory\(\).

For more information, see [KB0824441 Introduction to ServiceNow Read Replica Databases](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0824441).

gr.setCategory('embedded_list');
gr.query();
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - setLimit\(Number maxNumRecords\)

Sets the limit for number of records are fetched by the GlideRecord query.

-   **Using setLimit\(\) with chooseWindow\(\)**

    The setLimit\(\) method implicitly calls the chooseWindow\(\) method and might cause unexpected results when used with chooseWindow\(\) in a query.

    -   If the chooseWindow\(\) method is called first, its record window is overwritten by the setLimit\(\) method.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 100 records starting at row 1:

        ```
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        grIncident.setLimit(100);
        ```

    -   If the setLimit\(\) method is called first, the window set by chooseWindow\(\) is used and the limit is overwritten.

        Using the following lines in a query returns 10 records starting at row 21:

        ```
        grIncident.setLimit(5);
        grIncident.chooseWindow(20,30);
        ```

        **Note:** Running query\(\) with the chooseWindow\(\) method triggers a `COUNT(*)` query, which can result in slow performance on tables with a large number of records. You can use setLimit\(\) before chooseWindow\(\) to skip running the `COUNT(*)` query, but the same performance benefit is achievable using setNoCount\(\).

```

## Scoped GlideRecord - setNewGuidValue\(String guid\)

Sets the sys\_id value for the current record.

|Name|Type|Description|

now_GR.insert();
gs.info(now_GR.getValue('sys_id'));
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - setNoCount\(\)

Stops a GlideRecord query from running a `COUNT(*)` query.

Running query\(\) with some methods trigger a `COUNT(*)` query, such as the chooseWindow\(\) and getRowCount\(\) methods. The `COUNT(*)` query might cause slow performance on tables with a million or more records. For more information, see the [Performance Improvement - Remove Pagination Count \[KB0817996\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0817996) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

**Note:** The setLimit\(\) method also stops a `COUNT(*)`. Using setNoCount\(\) is unnecessary if the setLimit\(\) method is included in the query.

-   [chooseWindow\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideRecordScopedAPI.md)

The following code example shows how to use setNoCount\(\) to skip the `COUNT(*)` query on a windowed query set using the chooseWindow\(\) method.

```
var  grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');

grIncident.chooseWindow(6915, 6920, true);
grIncident.setNoCount();
grIncident.query();

while (grIncident.next()) { // Iterate through the returned records
    gs.info('Incident Number: ' + grIncident.number + ', Short Description: ' + grIncident.short_description);
};
```

Output:

## Scoped GlideRecord - setValue\(String name, Object value\)

Sets the value of the field with the specified name to the specified value.

Normally the script does a `now_GR.category = value`. However, if the element name is itself a variable then you can use `now_GR.setValue(elementName, value)`. When setting a value, ensure the data type of the field matches the data type of the value you enter. For information about the differences between using setValue\(\) and direct assignment, see [Explanation of Assignment Behavior for Reference GlideList Fields \[KB2557324\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2557324) in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

**Note:** If the Field Encryption Enterprise plugin is enabled and the instance has access to the key, this method can insert encrypted data into encrypted fields. If the instance does not have access to the key, this method returns an error. For more information, see [Platform Encryption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/encryption-landing.md).

-   **Not for authentication with password2 fields**

    The setValue\(\) method passes password2 data as clear text, which results in an error about expecting encrypted data. Additionally, using the setValue\(\) method for password2 fields exposes data that should be encrypted.

    For password2 authentication, use the setDisplayValue\(\) method instead.

```
var elementName = 'short_description'; 
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident'); 
now_GR.initialize(); 
now_GR.setValue(elementName, "My DB is not working");
now_GR.insert();
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - setWorkflow\(Boolean enable\)

Enables or disables running business rules, script engines, or audits.

**Note:** The setWorkflow\(\) method is ignored when subsequently using either the deleteProblem\(\) or deleteMultiple\(\) methods to cascade delete.

**Warning:** Disabling the running of business rules, script engines, and audit can have a significant impact on your ServiceNow® instance and how it operates. Ensure that you thoroughly test this change before deploying it to production.

**Note:** This method can't be set for cross-scoped applications. For additional information, see the following KB article [https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb\_article\_view&amp;sysparm\_article=KB0820691](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0820691).

## Scoped GlideRecord - update\(String reason\)

Updates the GlideRecord with any changes that have been made. If the record does not already exist, it is inserted.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|reason|String|Optional. Reason for the update. The reason appears in the audit record.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Sys\_id of the new or updated record. Returns null if the update fails.|

The following example shows how to update the Short Description field of an incident.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.get('99ebb4156fa831005be8883e6b3ee4b9');
now_GR.setValue('short_description', 'Update the short description');
now_GR.update();
gs.info(now_GR.getElement('short_description'));
```

Output:

```
Update the short description.
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - updateMultiple\(\)

Updates each GlideRecord in a stated query with a specified set of changes.

This method does not support adding multiple journal entries.

The **glide.db.forced.chunk.threshold** system property sets the threshold above which forces chunk record deletions and updates. Chunking helps to prevent non-primary key deletions on huge tables from causing replication problems. For more information, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

**Note:** To ensure expected results, use the setValue\(\) method instead of direct assignments. That is, use `gr_Now.setValue('<field_name>', '4'));` instead of `gr_Now.<field_name> = 4`.

**Note:** Do not use this method with the chooseWindow\(\) or setLimit\(\) methods when working with large tables.

This method sets new values and does not clear existing values. To clear an existing value, use the setValue\(\) method and set the field to 'NULL'. For more information, see [Setting a GlideRecord variable to 'NULL'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/scripts/r_SettingAGlideRecordVariableToNull.md).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|None| |

This example shows how to update the state of all active incidents to 4 - "Awaiting User Info".

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.addQuery('active', true);
now_GR.setValue('state',  4);
now_GR.updateMultiple();
```

This example shows how to clear existing values of the description field for priority 1 incidents.

```
var test = new GlideRecord('incident');
test.addEncodedQuery('priority=1');
test.query();
 
test.setValue('description','NULL');
test.updateMultiple();
```

## Scoped GlideRecord - updateWithReferences\(Object reason\)

Updates a record and also inserts or updates any related records with the information provided.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|reason|Object|Reason for the updates. The reason is displayed in the audit record.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|The sys\_id for the record being updated.|

If processing an incident where the Caller ID is set to reference sys\_user record 'John Doe,' then the following code would update John Doe's user record. If processing an incident where there's no caller ID specified, then the following code creates a new sys\_user record with the provided information \(first\_name, last\_name\) and sets the caller ID value to the newly created sys\_user record.

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.get(inc_sys_id);  // Looking up an existing incident record where 'inc_sys_id' represents the sys_id of a incident record
inc.caller_id.first_name = 'John';
inc.caller_id.last_name = 'Doe';
inc.updateWithReferences();
}
```
