# Cloud Runner TestUserApi – Scoped, Global

Manages test user jobs to be executed in a cloud runner for Automated Test Framework \(ATF\). This API is part of the CloudRunnerApi script include.

You can use this API for the following tasks:

-   Start the user test job.
-   Set the cloud user.
-   Check if the user specified is valid.
-   Check the progress of the user test job.
-   Cancel the test job.

In global scope, this API is executed within the sn\_atf\_tg namespace. You must have the [ATF Test Generator and Cloud Runner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/atf-tg-cr-intro.md) \(sn\_atf\_tg\) plugin activated to use this API.

## TestUserApi – cancelJob\(String snboqId\)

Sets the test user job status in the Browser Orchestration Queue \[sn\_atf\_tg\_sn\_boq\] table to complete.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|snboqId|String|Required. The sys\_id of the BOQ record in the Browser Orchestration Queue \[sn\_atf\_tg\_sn\_boq\] table.|

Type

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

null

</td><td>

Null if successful, error message otherwise.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Error

</td><td>

If unsuccessful, possible error messages:-   No sys\_id passed in – The JSON object provided doesn’t have a BOQ ID entry. Verify that the JSON object is structured as `{snboqId: "<sys_id>"}`.
-   Invalid sys\_id passed in – The ID provided must be for a BOQ record in the Browser Orchestration Queue \[sn\_atf\_tg\_sn\_boq\] table.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The following example shows how to start a test user for the admin user, get the progress, and cancel the test user. After confirming the locked out user as a valid cloud user, the code sets the cloud user as an ITIL administrator. In the global scope, use the sn\_atf\_tg namespace.

```
var snboqId = CloudRunnerAPI.TestUserAPI.startJob({username: "abel.tuter"});

gs.info(JSON.stringify(CloudRunnerAPI.TestUserAPI.progress({snboqId: snboqId})));

CloudRunnerAPI.TestUserAPI.cancelJob({snboqId: snboqId});

gs.info(CloudRunnerAPI.TestUserAPI.isValidCloudUser({username: <name of the user who has been locked out>}));

CloudRunnerAPI.TestUserAPI.selectCloudUser({username: "itil_admin"});
```

Output:

```
