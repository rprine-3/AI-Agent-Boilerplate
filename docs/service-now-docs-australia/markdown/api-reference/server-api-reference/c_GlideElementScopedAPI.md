# GlideElement- Scoped

The scoped GlideElement API provides a number of convenient script methods for dealing with fields and their values. Scoped GlideElement methods are available for the fields of the current glide record.

**Parent Topic:**[Server API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/api-server.md)

## Scoped GlideElement - canCreate\(\)

Determines if the user's role permits the creation of new entries in the associated field.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

<table id="table_iq2_gmp_fz" class="returns"><thead><tr><th>

Type

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Boolean

</td><td>

Flag that indicates whether the current user has permissions to create new entries in the associated field.Possible values:

-   true: User can create new entries.
-   false: User cannot create new entries.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The following example shows how to determine if the user has permissions to create entries for the three most recent records in the Problem \[problem\] table.

```
var gr = new GlideRecord('problem');

// Get records in new state in Problem Table
gr.addQuery('state','101');

// Sort records in order of recent to earlier Created Date
gr.orderByDesc('sys_created_on');

// Limit the query to three records
gr.setLimit(3); 
gr.query();

while(gr.next()){
  if(gr.short_description.canCreate()){ ///check to see if the current user is allowed to create the record
  gs.info("I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - " + gr.number);
  }
}
```

Output:

```
I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - PRB0000004
I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - PRB0001000
I can create new records for the field Problem statement for - PRB0001001
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the canCreate\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [canCreate\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

## Scoped GlideElement - canRead\(\)

Indicates whether the user's role permits them to read the associated GlideRecord.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the field can be read, false otherwise.|

The following example shows how to get a list of active Incident records with a readable Short Description field.

```
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addEncodedQuery("active=true"); //Query the Incident table for active incidents
grIncident.orderByDesc('number');
grIncident.setLimit(3); // limit to three results for example
grIncident.query();

while (grIncident.next()) {
    if (grIncident.short_description.canRead()) { //check to see if the current user is allowed to read the record
        gs.info('You have permission to read the short description of: ' + grIncident.number + ' ' + grIncident.short_description);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
*** Script: You have permission to read the short description of: INC0009009 Unable to access the shared folder.
*** Script: You have permission to read the short description of: INC0009005 Email server is down.
*** Script: You have permission to read the short description of: INC0009001 Unable to post content on a Wiki page
```

## Scoped GlideElement - canWrite\(\)

Determines whether the user's role permits them to write to the associated GlideRecord.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the user can write to the field, false otherwise.|

The following example shows how to get a list of active Incident records with a writeable Short Description field.

```
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addEncodedQuery("active=true"); //Query the Incident table for active incidents
grIncident.orderByDesc('number');
grIncident.setLimit(3); // limit to three results for example
grIncident.query();

while (grIncident.next()) {
    if (grIncident.short_description.canWrite()) { //check to see if the current user is allowed to write to the record
        gs.info('You have permission to write to the short description of: ' + grIncident.number + ' ' + grIncident.short_description);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
*** Script: You have permission to write to the short description of: INC0009009 Unable to access the shared folder.
*** Script: You have permission to write to the short description of: INC0009005 Email server is down.
*** Script: You have permission to write to the short description of: INC0009001 Unable to post content on a Wiki page
```

## Scoped GlideElement - changes\(\)

Determines if the current field has been modified. This functionality is available for all available data types, except Journal fields.

**Note:** The changes\(\) method is not supported within ACL scripts.

**Note:** If the GlideRecord on which you are performing this method has only been initialized and read, and has not been written, the underlying before-and-after values are the same. In this case, the method returns "false", as there has been no change to the data store.

-   **Business rule execution**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform invokes business rules \(**BEFORE** or **AFTER**\) before resetting the internal previous values for columns \(GlideElement objects\) to the current values.

    This sequence enables the following actions:

    -   Triggering an **AFTER** business rule on &lt;column&gt;.changes conditions.
    -   Accessing the previous GlideRecord object in the script section.
    Even in **AFTER** business rules, `current.<field>.changes()` returns `true` because the internal previous values haven’t been reset yet. The condition `current.<field>.value != previous.<field>.value` also returns `true`.

    Previous values are only reset after the following activities:

    -   The database update is complete.
    -   All **AFTER** business rules have been processed.
    Inside an AFTER business rule, the changes\(\) method still returns `true` if the field value was modified, even though the rule executes after the update.


|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the fields have been changed, false if the field has not.|

The following example from a business rule shows how to create an event in the EventQueue if the value of the **assigned\_to** field changes. For a comprehensive example, see [Sample scripts from the change events business rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_ChangeEventsSampleScripts.md).

```
if (!current.assigned_to.nil() && current.assigned_to.changes()) {
  gs.eventQueue('incident.assigned', current, current.assigned_to.getDisplayValue(), previous.assigned_to.getDisplayValue());
}
```

## Scoped GlideElement - changesFrom\(Object o\)

Determines if the previous value of the current field matches the specified object.

**Note:** If the GlideRecord on which you are performing this method has only been initialized and read, and has not been written, the underlying before-and-after values are the same. In this case, the method returns "false", as there has been no change to the data store.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|o|Object|An object value to check against the previous value of the current field.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the previous value matches, false if it does not.|

```
// The following example shows that in a business rule, if "active" field is changed from true, 
// insert a event in the EventQueue.
if (current.active.changesFrom(true)) {
  gs.eventQueue("incident.inactive", current, current.incident_state, previous.incident_state);
}
```

## Scoped GlideElement - changesTo\(Object o\)

Determines if the new value of a field, after a change, matches the specified object.

**Note:** The changesTo\(\) method is not supported within ACL scripts.

**Note:** If the GlideRecord on which you are performing this method has only been initialized and read, and has not been written, the underlying before-and-after values are the same. In this case, the method returns "false", as there has been no change to the data store.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|o|Object|An object value to check against the new value of the current field.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|True if the previous value matches, false if it does not.|

```
// The following example shows that in a business rule, if "active" field is changed to false, 
// insert a event in the EventQueue.
if (current.active.changesTo(false)) {
  gs.eventQueue("incident.inactive", current, current.incident_state, previous.incident_state);
}
```

## Scoped GlideElement - dateNumericValue\(\)

Returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT for a duration field. Does not require the creation of a GlideDateTime object because the duration field is already a GlideDateTime object.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Number|Number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.|

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.get('17c90efb13418700cc36b1422244b05d');
gs.info(inc.calendar_duration.dateNumericValue());
```

Output:

```
98000
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getAttribute\(String attributeName\)

Returns the value of the specified attribute from the dictionary.

For Boolean attributes, you can use the getBooleanAttribute\(\) method to return the value as a Boolean instead of a string.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|attributeName|String|Name of the attribute. The attribute name is listed in the Dictionary Entries \[sys\_dictionary\] table.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Value of the specified attribute.|

The following example shows how to get the value of the **tree\_picker** attribute in the **location** column of the User \[sys\_user\] table as a string.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
now_GR.query("user_name","admin");

if (now_GR.next()) {
   gs.info("The value of the tree_picker attribute in the location column is " + now_GR.location.getAttribute("tree_picker"));
}
```

Output:

```
The value of the tree_picker attribute in the location column is true
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getBooleanAttribute\(String attributeName\)

Returns a specified Boolean-type attribute from the dictionary as a Boolean value.

To return the attribute value as a string, use the getAttribute\(\) method.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|attributeName|String|Name of the attribute. The attribute name is listed in the Dictionary Entries \[sys\_dictionary\] table.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Boolean|Specifies the value of the attribute as Boolean true or false.|

The following example shows how to get Boolean values of the **ignore\_filter\_on\_new** attribute for two fields.

```
var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
inc.query();

if (inc.next())
 {
   // opened_by field has attribute "ignore_filter_on_new = true"
   gs.info(inc.opened_by.getBooleanAttribute("ignore_filter_on_new"));

  // short_description field does not have attribute ignore_filter_on_new
   gs.info(inc.short_description.getBooleanAttribute("ignore_filter_on_new"));
 }
```

Output:

```
true
false
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getChoices\(String dependent\)

Returns the choice list for a specified field.

The field for which to return the choice list is specified in the method call. For example: `var choices = glideRecord.urgency.getChoices();`. For information on choice list field types and their associated capabilities, see [Choice list field type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_ChoiceLists.md).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|dependent|String|Optional. Field within the associated record on which the choice list field depends.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Array|List of possible values for the choice list, which are the values in the Choice \[sys\_choice\] table. If the **dependent** parameter is passed, the return results reflect only those choices available for the specified dependent field.|

```
var glideRecord = new GlideRecord('incident'); 
glideRecord.query('priority','1'); 
glideRecord.next(); 
 
// urgency has choice list: 1 - High, 2 - Medium, 3 - Low, with value: 1, 2, 3
var choices = glideRecord.urgency.getChoices();
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getChoiceValue\(\)

Returns the choice label for the current choice.

A choice has a value \(number\) and a label \(string\). This method returns the label.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|The selected choice's label.|

```
var glideRecord = new GlideRecord('incident'); 
glideRecord.query('priority','1'); 
glideRecord.next(); 
 
// urgency has choice list: 1 - High, 2 - Medium, 3 - Low, with value: 1, 2, 3
var choiceLabel = glideRecord.urgency.getChoiceValue(); 
gs.info(choiceLabel);
```

Output:

```
1 - High
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getDecryptedValue\(\)

Returns the clear text value for Password \(2 way encrypted\) fields in scoped applications.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|The clear text password.|

```
var tablename = 'x_scoped_app_table'
var CI = new GlideRecord(tablename);  
CI.addQuery('number', '0001002'); 
CI.query(); 
CI.next(); 

var password = CI.password_field
var decrypted = password.getDecryptedValue(); 
gs.info(decrypted);
```

Output:

```
x_scoped_app: cleartextpassword
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getDisplayValue\(Number maxCharacters\)

Returns the formatted display value of a specified field from an associated GlideRecord object.

Display values are manipulated based on the actual value in the database and user or system settings and preferences.

The display value that is returned is dependent on the field type.

-   Choice fields: The database value may be a number, but the display value will be more descriptive.
-   Date fields: The database value is in UTC format, while the display value is based on the user's time zone.
-   Encrypted text: The database value is encrypted, while the displayed value is unencrypted based on the user's encryption context.
-   Reference fields: The database value is sys\_id, but the display value is a display field of the referenced record.

For more information on display values, see [Display values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/c_DisplayValues.md).

<table id="table_vy2_525_jq" class="parameters"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Display value of the specified field.|

The following example shows how to retrieve the display value of the priority field in an incident record.

```
var glideRecord = new GlideRecord('incident');
glideRecord.query('priority','1');
glideRecord.next();
gs.info(glideRecord.priority.getDisplayValue());
```

Output:

```
1 - Critical
```

The following example shows how to retrieve both the display value and internal value of specified fields in the incident database.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.get('9c573169c611228700193229fff72400'); //INC0000001
gs.info('Display Values:');
gs.info('Opened at ' + now_GR.opened_at.getDisplayValue());
gs.info('Opened by ' + now_GR.opened_by.getDisplayValue());
gs.info('Priority ' + now_GR.priority.getDisplayValue());
gs.info('Values:');
gs.info('Opened at ' + now_GR.opened_at.getValue());
gs.info('Opened by ' + now_GR.opened_by.getValue());
gs.info('Priority ' + now_GR.priority.getValue());

```

Output:

```
Display Values:
Opened at 2022-02-01 15:09:51

```

## Scoped GlideElement - getDisplayValueLang\(String language\)

Gets the display value of the field in the language passed as a parameter.

The result is only applicable to translatable field types such as **Choice**, **Translated Field**, and **Translated Text**. For other field types, the result defaults to [getDisplayValue\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

You must have the corresponding language plugin to retrieve a translated value. For information, see [Activate a language](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ActivateALanguage.md).

See also [Scoped GlideElement - getLabelLang\(String language\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideElementScopedAPI.md).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|language|String|Language tag conforming with IETF BCP-47.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Display value of the field in the language passed. If a translation isn't available, the method retrieves a value translated in the language of the current user. If a translation isn’t available, the result defaults to English.|

The following example shows how to get the original text and German-translated text from the **Accept** \(UI View\) title field.

```
var uiView = new GlideRecord("sys_ui_view");
uiView.get("fa776f6d97700100f309124eda2975bc");

gs.info("getDisplayValue: " + uiView.getElement("title").getDisplayValue());
gs.info("getDisplayValueLang: " + uiView.getElement("title").getDisplayValueLang("de"));
```

```
getDisplayValue: Accept
getDisplayValueLang: Akzeptieren
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getED\(\)

Returns the field's element descriptor.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideElementDescriptor|The field's element descriptor.|

```
var grInc = new GlideRecord('incident');
grInc.query('priority', '1');
 
var field = grInc.getElement('priority');
var ed = field.getED();
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getGlideObject\(\)

Retrieves the platform object associated with the field's value.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Object|A platform object corresponding to the field's data type, such as GlideDateTime. You can use this object for type-specific operations on the value. For example, date arithmetic, formatting, and timezone conversions that are not available when accessing the field value as a plain string.|

The following example shows how to calculate the duration between the opened date and Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) due date of an incident record.

```
// Query an incident record with both opened_at and sla_due populated
var incGr = new GlideRecord('incident');
incGr.addQuery('opened_at', '!=', '');
incGr.addQuery('sla_due', '!=', '');
incGr.setLimit(1);
incGr.query();

if (incGr.next()) {
    gs.info("Incident: " + incGr.getValue('number'));
    gs.info("Opened at: " + incGr.getValue('opened_at'));
    gs.info("SLA due: " + incGr.getValue('sla_due'));

    var duration = calcDateDelta(incGr.opened_at, incGr.sla_due);
    if (duration) {
        gs.info("Duration in seconds: " + duration.getNumericValue() / 1000);
        gs.info("Duration display value: " + duration.getDisplayValue());
    }
}

function calcDateDelta(start, end) {
    var realStart = start.getGlideObject();
    var realEnd = end.getGlideObject();

    // Use GlideDuration to calculate the difference between two GlideDateTime objects
    var startMS = realStart.getNumericValue();
    var endMS = realEnd.getNumericValue();
    var deltaMS = endMS - startMS;

    // Create a GlideDuration from the millisecond difference
    var duration = new GlideDuration(deltaMS);
    return duration;
}
```

Output:

```
Incident: INC0000031
Opened at: 2025-03-06 00:18:03
SLA due: 2025-03-06 08:18:03
Duration in seconds: 28800
Duration display value: 8 Hours
```

## Scoped GlideElement - getName\(\)

Returns the name of the field.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Field name.|

The following example shows how to get the name and other values for each field in a sys\_user record.

```
var userRec = new GlideRecord("sys_user"); // GlideRecord to sys_user table

userRec.get("5137153cc611227c000bbd1bd8cd2005"); // Sys Id of user: Fred Luddy

var fields = userRec.getFields();

for (var i = 0; i < fields.size(); i++) {

    var field = fields.get(i);
    var name = field.getName(); // Name of the field
    var label = field.getLabel(); // Label of the field
    var value = field.getDisplayValue(); // Value of the field

    gs.info((Number(i) + 1) + ".\n" + "Field Label: " + label + "\n" + "Field Name: " + name + "\n" + "Field Value: " + value);

};
```

grINC.query(); 
if (grINC.next()) { 

// Get a GlideRecord object for the referenced sys_user record 
var grUSER = grINC.caller_id.getRefRecord(); 
if (grUSER.isValidRecord()) 
  gs.info(grUSER.getValue('name')); 

} 
```

        // if it's been cancelled, it's cancelled.
        var doit = true;
        if (current.state == 'cancelled')
            doit = false;

        if (email.body.state != undefined)
            current.state = email.body.state;

        if (doit)
            current.update();
    } else {
        gs.log("Approval for task " + current.sysapproval.getDisplayValue() +
            " rejected because user sending email " + email.from +
            " does not match the approver " + current.approver.getDisplayValue());

now_GR.get('9c573169c611228700193229fff72400'); //INC0000001
gs.info('Display Values:');
gs.info('Opened at ' + now_GR.opened_at.getDisplayValue());
gs.info('Opened by ' + now_GR.opened_by.getDisplayValue());
gs.info('Priority ' + now_GR.priority.getDisplayValue());
gs.info('Values:');
gs.info('Opened at ' + now_GR.opened_at.getValue());
gs.info('Opened by ' + now_GR.opened_by.getValue());
gs.info('Priority ' + now_GR.priority.getValue());

```

## Scoped GlideElement - setDateNumericValue\(Number milliseconds\)

Sets the value of a date/time element to the specified number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.

When called, setDateNumericValue\(\) automatically creates the necessary GlideDateTime/GlideDate/GlideDuration object, and then sets the element to the specified value.

**Note:** Before calling this method, the element must already exist by querying an existing record or by using the now\_GR.initialize\(\) method to initialize a new record.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|milliseconds|Number|Number of milliseconds since 1/1/1970|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord("incident");
now_GR.initialize();
now_GR.opened_at.setDateNumericValue(10000);
```

## Scoped GlideElement - setDisplayValue\(Object value\)

now_GR.addQuery('priority', '1');
now_GR.query();

if (now_GR.next()) {
    var shortDesc = now_GR.short_description.toString();

    if (!shortDesc || shortDesc.trim() === '') {
        now_GR.short_description.setError(
            'A short description is required for all Priority 1 incidents. Please provide a brief summary of the issue.'
        );
    }
}
```

## Scoped GlideElement - setPhoneNumber\(Object phoneNumber, Boolean strict\)

function setWalkupLocPhone(locName, phoneNumber) {
  var walkupLoc = new GlideRecord('wu_location_queue');
  walkupLoc.addQuery('name', locName);
  walkupLoc.query();
  walkupLoc.next();
  
  // Set phone number of walk-up location
  var isPhoneNumberSet = walkupLoc.phone_number.setPhoneNumber(phoneNumber, true);
  walkupLoc.update();
  gs.info('Phone Number: ' + walkupLoc.phone_number);
  gs.info('Is phone number specified match the correct format: ' + isPhoneNumberSet);
}
```

Output:

```
Phone Number: +919812456789
Is phone number specified match the correct format: true
```

## Scoped GlideElement - setValue\(Object value\)

Sets the value of a field.

**Note:** Before calling this method, the element must already exist by querying an existing record or by using the now\_GR.initialize\(\) method to initialize a new record.

-   **Not for authentication with password2 fields**

    The setValue\(\) method passes password2 data as clear text, which results in an error about expecting encrypted data. Additionally, using the setValue\(\) method for password2 fields exposes data that should be encrypted.

    For password2 authentication, use the setDisplayValue\(\) method instead.
