# UserSkillAnalyzer- Global

The UserSkillAnalyzer API provides methods to analyze user skills against skills required to complete work items.

This API requires the Skills Management plugin \(com.snc.skills\_management\), which you can activate if you have the admin role.

See [Qualify and rank users based on skills and skill levels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/assign-work-based-on-skills.md).

**Parent Topic:**[Server API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/api-server.md)

## UserSkillAnalyzer - UserSkillAnalyzer\(\)

Instantiates a new UserSkillAnalyzer object.

```

var userSkillAnalyzer = new SNC.UserSkillAnalyzer();
```

## UserSkillAnalyzer - analyzeUserByID\(String requiredSkillsJson, String userID, Boolean isSkillLevelEnforced\)

Analyzes user skills against the required skills and sets the number of matching skills, skill level gap, and qualification that can be collected from an instance.

Analyzes whether an agent is qualified to work on a task by verifying if the agent has the skills and skill levels required to complete the task. If an agent is qualified to work on a task, the API analyzes the level gap between required skills and user's skill level which can be further used by the application to choose the best agent based on level gap. It also analyzes the total number of skills with and without skill levels the agent has to execute that task.
