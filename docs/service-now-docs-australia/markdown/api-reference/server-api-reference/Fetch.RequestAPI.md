# Fetch Request- Scoped, Global

The Fetch Request API contains methods for creating or retrieving a Request object to allow applications to asynchronously request resources, such as JSON, text, or binary data, from a server, and handle the response. This API supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and so on.

This API is part of a set of Fetch APIs, which provide various actions for fetching resources from external websites. The full Fetch API collection includes:

-   [Fetch - fetch\(String resource, Object options\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/FetchAPI.md): Start the process of fetching a resource from the network.
-   [Fetch Headers - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.HeadersAPI.md): Retrieve and modify request and response headers.
-   [Fetch Request - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.RequestAPI.md): Create a new request object.
-   [Fetch RequestInit - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.RequestInitAPI.md): Set options to configure a fetch request.
-   [Fetch Response - Scoped,Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.ResponseAPI.md): Create a new response object.

To support fetch actions, the system property, `glide.hosts.allowlist`, allows controls over what hosts a fetch method can access. It applies to HTTP APIs like RestMessageV2 and those mentioned above. For more information about `glide.hosts.allowlist`, see [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md).

## Request properties

The Fetch Request API supports several read-only properties that offer detailed information about an HTTP request. Some of these include `url` \(the URL of the request\), `method` \(the HTTP method\), `headers` \(the associated headers\), and `body` \(the request body as a stream\). Other properties include settings for caching, credentials, and referrers. These properties are read-only, meaning they can be accessed but not modified after the request is created. To read more about each property, see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request).

body

</td><td>

Ready-only property. Contains a readable stream of byte data with the body contents that have been added to the request.Data type/value: A ReadableStream or null.

</td><td>

```
const request = new Request("/myEndpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  body: "Hello world",
});

request.body; // ReadableStream
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

bodyUsed

</td><td>

Ready-only property. Flag that indicates whether the request body has been read yet.Accepted value:

-   true: The request body has been read.
-   false: The request body hasn't been read.

Data type: Boolean

</td><td>

```
const request = new Request("/myEndpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  body: "Hello world",
});

request.bodyUsed; // false

request.text().then((bodyAsText) => {
  console.log(request.bodyUsed); // true
});
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

cache

</td><td>

Ready-only property. Contains the cache mode of the request which controls how the request interacts with the browser's HTTP cache. Accepted values:

-   default: The browser looks for a matching request in its HTTP cache.
    -   If there is a match and it is fresh, it is returned from the cache.
    -   If there is a match but it is stale, the browser makes a conditional request to the remote server. If the server indicates that the resource has not changed, it is returned from the cache. Otherwise the resource is downloaded from the server and the cache will be updated.
    -   If there is no match, the browser makes a normal request, and updates the cache with the downloaded resource.
-   force-cache: The browser looks for a matching request in its HTTP cache.
    -   If there is a match, fresh or stale, it is returned from the cache.
    -   If there is no match, the browser makes a normal request and updates the cache with the downloaded resource.
-   no-cache: The browser looks for a matching request in its HTTP cache.
    -   If there is a match, fresh or stale, the browser makes a conditional request to the remote server. If the server indicates that the resource has not changed, it is returned from the cache. Otherwise the resource is downloaded from the server and the cache is updated.
    -   If there is no match, the browser makes a normal request, and updates the cache with the downloaded resource.
-   no-store: The browser fetches the resource from the remote server without first looking in the cache, and does not update the cache with the downloaded resource.
-   only-if-cached: The browser looks for a matching request in its HTTP cache.

    -   If there is a match, fresh or stale, it is returned from the cache.
    -   If there is no match, the browser responds with 504 Gateway timeout status.
The `only-if-cached` mode can only be used if the request's mode is `same-origin`. Cached redirects are followed if the request's `redirect` property is `follow` and the redirects do not violate the `same-origin` mode.

-   reload: The browser fetches the resource from the remote server without first looking in the cache, but then updates the cache with the downloaded resource.

mode

</td><td>

Read-only. Mode of the request. Used to determine if cross-origin requests lead to valid responses, and which properties of the response are readable.Accepted values:

-   cors: If the request is cross-origin then it will use the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\) mechanism.
-   navigate: A mode for supporting navigation. The navigate value is intended to be used only by HTML navigation. A navigate request is created only while navigating between documents.
-   no-cors: Disables CORS for cross-origin requests. The response is opaque, meaning that its headers and body are not available to JavaScript.
-   same-origin: Disallows cross-origin requests. If a request is made to another origin with this mode set, the result is an error.

Requests can be initiated in a variety of ways, and the mode for a request depends on the particular means by which it was initiated. For example, when a Request object is created using the Request\(\) constructor, the value of the mode property for that Request is set to cors. However, for requests created other than by the Request\(\) constructor, no-cors is typically used as the mode; for example, for embedded resources where the request is initiated from markup, unless the crossorigin attribute is present, the request is in most cases made using the no-cors mode — that is, for the &lt;link&gt; or &lt;script&gt; elements \(except when used with modules\), or &lt;img&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;,&lt;video&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, or &lt;iframe&gt; elements.

const myCred = myRequest.redirect;
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

referrer

</td><td>

Read-only. The referrer of the request \(for example, `client`, `no-referrer`, or a URL\). A value of `no-referrer` returns an empty string.Data type: String

</td><td>

```

const myReferrer = myRequest.referrer; // returns "about:client" by default
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

referrerPolicy

</td><td>

Read-only. The referrer policy which governs what referrer information is sent in the Referrer header with the request.Data type: String

## Fetch Request - Request\(\)

Creates a new Request object. Optionally create the Request object from a URL or object resource.

<table id="table_kxr_wvv_gdc" class="parameters"><thead><tr><th>

Name

</th><th>

Type

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

input

</td><td>

String or Object

</td><td>

Optional. The resource to retrieve.Valid values:

-   A string containing the URL of the resource to fetch. The API doesn't accept URLs containing credentials, such as `http://user.password.example.com`. An exception is thrown if the URL can't be parsed.
-   A Request object, effectively creating a copy of an existing Request object. The object structure is dictated by the Request class.

**Note:** Note the following behavioral updates to retain security while making the constructor less likely to throw exceptions:

    -   If this object exists on another origin to the constructor call, the  Request.referrer  property is stripped out.
    -   If this object has a  Request.mode  property of  `navigate`, the  mode  value is converted to  `same-origin`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

options

</td><td>

Object

</td><td>

Optional. A [Fetch RequestInit - Scoped, Global](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/Fetch.RequestInitAPI.md) object containing any custom settings to apply to the request. If you construct a new request from an existing request, options set in the new request override any corresponding options in the original request.Default: Returns default values for all properties.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The following example shows how to create a new Request object using the Request\(\) constructor.

```
var myImage = document.querySelector("img");
var myRequest = new Request("flowers.jpg");
```

The following example shows how to create the new Request object using the input parameter to retrieve a URL or object.

```

  .then((response) => response.blob())
  .then((response) => {
    var objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(response);
    myImage.src = objectURL;
  });
```

The following example shows how to create the new Request object with header options using an object literal.

```
var myImage = document.querySelector("img");
var myRequest = new Request("flowers.jpg");

var options = {
  headers: {
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=60480",
