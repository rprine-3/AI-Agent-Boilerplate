# GlideSystem- Global

The GlideSystem API, which is referred to by the variable name `gs` in any server-side JavaScript, provides a number of convenient methods to get information about the system, the current logged in user, and date/time information.

Many of the GlideSystem methods facilitate the easy inclusion of dates in query ranges, and are most often used in filters and reporting.

       process : function() {
          var user_password = request.getParameter("user_password");
          var min_len = 8;
          var rules = "Password must be at least " + min_len + 
             " characters long and contain a digit, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter.";
          if (user_password.length() < min_len) {

```

## GlideSystem - dateDiff\(String startDate, String endDate, Boolean numericValue\)

Calculates the difference between two dates.

This method expects the earlier date as the first parameter and the later date as the second parameter; otherwise, the method returns the difference as a negative value. Use getDisplayValue\(\) to convert the strings to the expected format.

This method expects parameters in the user/system date time format, which may not be the same as the internal format. Using parameters in formats other than the user/system date time format may return invalid results.

If you are working with GlideDateTime objects use the GlideDateTime subtract\(\) method instead of dateDiff\(\).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|startDate|String|The starting date to compare in the current user's date format.|
|endDate|String|The ending date to compare in the current user's date format.|
|numericValue|Boolean|If true, the return value will be formatted in number of seconds; if false the return value will be formatted ddd hh:mm:ss.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|If the numericValue parameter is true, returns the difference between the two dates as an integer number of seconds; if false, returns the difference between the two dates in the format ddd hh:mm:ss.|

```
// Given two date/times as DateTime objects
// Set the values this way to ensure a consistent input time
var date1 = new GlideDateTime();
var date2 = new GlideDateTime();
date1.setDisplayValueInternal('2014-01-01 12:00:00');
date2.setDisplayValueInternal('2014-01-01 13:00:00');
 
// Determine the difference as number of seconds (returns a string)
// Use getDisplayValue() to convert the string to the format expected by dateDiff()
var diffSeconds = gs.dateDiff(date1.getDisplayValue(), date2.getDisplayValue(), true);
 
// JavaScript will coerce diffSeconds from a string to a number
// since diffSeconds is being compared to a number
var msg = (diffSeconds <= 0) ? ' is on or after ' : ' is before ';
gs.print(date1.getDisplayValue() + msg + date2.getDisplayValue())
```

## GlideSystem - setProperty\(String key, String value, String description\)

Sets the specified key to the specified value.

**Note:** Care should be taken when setting system properties \(sys\_properties\) using this method as it causes a system-wide cache flush. Each flush can cause system degradation while the caches rebuild. If a value must be updated often, it should not be stored as a system property. In general, you should only place values in the sys\_properties table that do not frequently change.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|key|String|The key for the property to be set.|
|value|String|The value of the property to be set.|
|description|String|A description of the property.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

```
gs.setProperty("glide.foo","bar","foo");
gs.info(gs.getProperty("glide.foo"));
```

Output: bar

### Scoped equivalent

To use the setProperty\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [setProperty\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideSystemScopedAPI.md).

## GlideSystem - setRedirect\(Object URI\)

## GlideSystem - setReturn\(Object URI\)

Sets the return URI for this transaction. This determines what page the user will be directed to when they return from the next form.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|URI|Object|URI to set as the return location.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|void| |

This example ensures that the user will be returned to the current page when they are done with the next one.

```
gs.setReturn (current.getLink(true));
```

## GlideSystem - tableExists\(String tableName\)

Determines if a database table exists in the ServiceNow instance.

```
gs.info("Does the incident table exist? " + gs.tableExists("incident"));

gs.info("Does the foo table exist? " + gs.tableExists("foo"));
```

Output

```
Does the incident table exist? true
Does the foo table exist? false
```

### Scoped equivalent

To use the tableExists\(\) method in a scoped application, use the corresponding scoped method: [tableExists\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/c_GlideSystemScopedAPI.md).

## GlideSystem - userID\(\)

incidentGR.addActiveQuery();

// Filter results to incidents assigned to the current user
var currentUserSysId = gs.userID();
incidentGR.addQuery('assigned_to', currentUserSysId);
incidentGR.query();

while (incidentGR.next()) {
    incidentGR.setValue('assigned_to', 'NULL');
    incidentGR.update();
    gs.info(
        'Unassigned Incident: {0}: {1}',
        incidentGR.number.toString(),
        incidentGR.short_description.toString()
    );
}
```
