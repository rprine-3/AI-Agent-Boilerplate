# GlideQuery - Scoped, Global

The GlideQuery script include is an alternative to the GlideRecord API for performing CRUD operations on record data from server-side scripts.

The GlideQuery script include lets you:

-   Use standard JavaScript objects and types for queries and results.
-   Quickly diagnose query errors with additional checks and clear error messages.
-   Simplify your code by avoiding boiler-plate query patterns.
-   Avoid common performance issues without needing deeper knowledge of the GlideRecord.

Use the GlideQuery script include in scoped or global server-side scripts. When used within a scoped app, it must be prefixed with the global scope.

```
new global.GlideQuery('sys_user')
// ...
```

This script include requires the GlideQuery \[com.sn\_glidequery\] plugin.

## Implementation

This script include works together with the [Stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/StreamGlobalAPI.md) and [Optional](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/OptionalGlobalAPI.md) APIs in a builder pattern where the method calls chain together, each method building on the returned result of the previous method. Use methods to define the attributes of the query. The methods do not execute until you call a terminal method, a method that returns a query result, allowing you to define the requirements of the query before executing it.

If the query returns a single record, the system wraps the result in an Optional object. If the query returns a stream of records, the system wraps the result in a Stream object. These objects let you manage the result using a set of methods in each API.

For example, this script performs a query on the Task table, groups the records by priority, and returns each priority that has total reassignments greater than four.

```
var query = new global.GlideQuery('task')
    .where('active', true) //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "where" clause.
    .groupBy('priority') //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "group by" clause.
    .aggregate('sum', 'reassignment_count') //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "sum(reassignment_count)" clause.
    .having('sum', 'reassignment_count', '>', 4) //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "having reassignment_count > 4" clause.
    .select() //Returns a stream of records wrapped in a Stream object.  
    .forEach(function (priority){ //Terminal method in the Stream class that executes the query and returns the result. 
      gs.info("Priority " + priority.group.priority + ": " + priority.sum.reassignment_count + " reassignments");
    });
```

Output:

```
Priority 1: 11 reassignments
Priority 3: 6 reassignments
Priority 5: 5 reassignments
```

## Error handling

The GlideQuery script include throws an error when your query has a problem and includes a clear explanation to help guide you. This script include checks for:

-   Invalid fields
-   Invalid value types for a field
-   Invalid values for choice fields
-   Invalid query operators

For example, the following code sample would throw an error because the queried field does not exist in the table.

```
new global.GlideQuery('task')
    .where('id', '4717dfe5a9fe198100450448b2404c16') // should be 'sys_id'
    .select('description', 'severity')
    .toArray(100);
  // Error: Unable to find field 'id' in table 'task'. Known fields: active, activity_due, ...
```

This code sample would throw an error because the data type of one of the arguments is incorrect.

```
new global.GlideQuery('task')
    .where('priority', 'one') // priority is an integer (should be 1)
    .select('description', 'severity')
    .toArray(100);
  // Error: Unable to match value ['one'] with field 'priority' in table 'task'. Expecting type 'integer'
```

## Reuse

Because GlideQuery objects are immutable, you can reuse them later in other parts of your code. For example, this script creates a query and then uses the GlideQuery object later to generate a report.

```
var highPriorityTasks = new global.GlideQuery('task')
    .where('active', true)
    .where('priority', 1);

generateReport(highPriorityTasks);
notifyOwners(highPriorityTasks);
var avgReassignmentCount = highPriorityTasks
    .avg('reassignment_count')
    .orElse(0)

```

## Limitations

The GlideQuery script include does not support:

-   Reading or writing to tables that do not allow access from other scopes.
-   Reading encoded queries.
-   GlideDate or GlideDateTime objects, which are read as JavaScript strings.
-   FX currency fields.
-   Updating journal field types.
-   Queries with ambiguous conditional logic. For example, the following query is unclear because the system does not know whether to execute `(active = true AND name != null) OR last_name = Luddy` or `active = true AND (name != null OR last_name = Luddy)`.

    ```
    var user = new global.GlideQuery('sys_user')
      .where('active', true)
      .whereNotNull('name')
      .orWhere('last_name', 'Luddy')
      .selectOne()
      .get()
    ```

    See the [where\(\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/GlideQueryGlobalAPI.md) method to understand how to nest a child query instead.


**Note:** Because the GlideQuery script include converts GlideRecord objects into standard JavaScript objects, it may take longer to execute queries. To reduce performance issues, avoid creating loops that iterate over large numbers of records.

## Intermediate and terminal methods in GlideQuery

The GlideQuery script include uses two categories of methods: intermediate and terminal. Intermediate methods are those methods that return a [Stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/StreamGlobalAPI.md), an API used for interacting with a stream of items like records, allowing a fluent style of syntax where calls are chained together. Terminal methods are those methods that do not return a stream and therefore stop the chain of Stream method calls.

In the GlideQuery script include, methods such as where\(\), orderBy\(\), and disableWorkflow\(\) are intermediate methods that return a new GlideQuery object. Similarly, the GlideQuery script include's most popular terminal methods, select\(\) and selectOne\(\), are terminal methods. These methods are called when GlideQuery is done being configured and is ready to start processing records. The differences between these two method types is important to keep in mind when configuring calls to the GlideQuery script include according to your specific use cases. For more information about intermediate and terminal methods, see the article [GlideQuery - Stream Processing Part 1](https://developer.servicenow.com/blog.do?p=/post/glidequery-p6/).

The following methods are classified as intermediate:

-   aggregate\(String aggregateType, String field\)
-   disableAutoSysFields\(\)
-   disableWorkflow\(\)
-   forceUpdate\(\)
-   groupBy\(String fields\)
-   having\(String aggregateType, String field, String operator, Number value\)
-   limit\(Number limit\)
-   orderBy\(String fields\)
-   orderByDesc\(String fieldOrAggregate, String field\)
-   orWhere\(String fieldOrQuery, String operator, Any value\)
-   orWhereNotNull\(String field\)
-   orWhereNull\(String field\)
-   where\(String fieldOrQuery, String operator, Any value\)
-   whereNotNull\(String field\)
-   whereNull\(String field\)
-   withAcls\(\)

The following methods are classified as terminal:

-   avg\(String field\)
-   count\(\)
-   deleteMultiple\(\)
-   get\(String key, Array selectedFields\)
-   getBy\(Object keyValues, Array selectedFields\)
-   insert\(Object keyValues, Object selectedFields\)
-   insertOrUpdate\(Object changes, Object selectedFields\)
-   max\(String field\)
-   min\(String field\)
-   select\(String fields\)
-   selectOne\(String fields\)
-   sum\(String field\)
-   toGlideRecord\(\)
-   update\(Object changes, Object selectedFields\)
-   updateMultiple\(Object changes\)

**Note:** parse\(String table, String encoded\_query\) is neither intermediate or terminal, but static.

## GlideQuery - GlideQuery\(String table\)

Instantiates a GlideQuery object used to build and execute record queries.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|table|String|Table to query.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|None| |

This example instantiates a query of the User table.

```
var query = new global.GlideQuery('sys_user');
```

## GlideQuery - aggregate\(String aggregateType, String field\)

Aggregates a field using a specified aggregation function.

Use this method to build queries that aggregate against multiple fields or use multiple aggregate functions, or if you must use the groupBy\(\) method. If you only want to aggregate against one field with one function, and you don't need to use groupBy\(\), then use one of these methods instead:

-   avg\(\)
-   min\(\)
-   max\(\)
-   count\(\)

<table id="table_thy_rmc_nmb" class="parameters"><thead><tr><th>

</table>|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideQuery|The query object being built.|

This script performs a query on the Task table, groups the records by priority, and returns each priority that has total reassignments greater than four.

```
var query = new global.GlideQuery('task')
    .where('active', true) //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "where" clause.
    .groupBy('priority') //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "group by" clause.
    .aggregate('sum', 'reassignment_count') //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "sum(reassignment_count)" clause.
    .having('sum', 'reassignment_count', '>', 4) //Returns new GlideQuery object with a "having reassignment_count > 4" clause.
    .select() //Returns a stream of records wrapped in a Stream object.  
    .forEach(function (priority){ //Terminal method in the Stream class that executes the query and returns the result. 
      gs.info("Priority " + priority.group.priority + ": " + priority.sum.reassignment_count + " reassignments");
    });
```

Output:

```
Priority 1: 11 reassignments
Priority 3: 6 reassignments
Priority 5: 5 reassignments
```

## GlideQuery - avg\(String field\)

Returns the aggregate average of a given numeric field.

You can only use this method on fields of the following types:

-   Integer
-   Long
-   Floating point number
-   Double
-   Currency

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|field|String|Field on which to perform the operation.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Optional|Object that contains the aggregate average of the given field.|

This example shows how to return the average number of faults in the cmdb\_ci table.

```
var faults = new global.GlideQuery('cmdb_ci')
    .avg('fault_count')
    .orElse(0);

gs.info(JSON.stringify(faults));
```

Output:

```
0.0037
```

## GlideQuery - count\(\)

Returns the number of records that match the query.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Number|Number of records that match the query.|

This example returns the number of active records in the User table.

```
var userCount = new global.GlideQuery('sys_user')
    .where('active', true)
    .count();
```

Output:

```
612
```

var query = new global.GlideQuery('sys_user')
    .where('active', true)
    .where('last_name', 'Jeter')
    .deleteMultiple();
```

## GlideQuery - disableAutoSysFields\(\)

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideQuery|The query object being built.|

This example adds a record to the task table, but does not set system fields. Without calling this method, the below example would update sys\_updated\_on, sys\_mod\_count, and so on.

```
var query = new global.GlideQuery('task')
    .disableAutoSysFields()
    .insert({ description: 'example', priority: 1 });
```

## GlideQuery - disableWorkflow\(\)

Disables any business rules, flows, workflows, or audit records that would run or be created as the result of the query.

**Note:** This method only works for tables in the GLOBAL scope.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|GlideQuery|The query object being built.|

This example updates multiple records in the Task table without triggering any automatic business processes.

```
var query = new global.GlideQuery('task')
    .disableWorkflow()
    .where('active', true)
    .updateMultiple({ priority: 1 });
```

## GlideQuery - forceUpdate\(\)

Forces a database update even when no record changes are made. For example, you can use this method to force a business rule to execute.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|None| | |

  .forEach(doSomething); // Do some processing on each of the returned records
```

## GlideQuery - select\(String fields\)

Returns the results of the query as a Stream object containing the specified fields.

**Note:** Use a terminal method in the Stream class to get the result of the query. For more information, see [Stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/StreamGlobalAPI.md).

You can append a flag to a field name to return the field's metadata instead of the field's value. For example, using the field name `company$DISPLAY` returns the display value of a company field. Possible flags include:

-   `DISPLAY`: Returns the display value of a field.
-   `CURRENCY_CODE`: Returns the currency code of a currency field. For example, `USD`.
-   `CURRENCY_DISPLAY`: Returns the currency display value of a currency field. For example, `¥123.45`.

This example shows how to return records from the User table where active is true and the user's last login is after a specified date.

```
var query = new global.GlideQuery('sys_user')
   .where('active', true)
   .where('last_login', '>', '2018-01-01')
   .limit(5)
   .select()
   .forEach(function (user){
      gs.info(JSON.stringify(user, null, 2));
   });
```

Output:

```
*** Script: {
  "sys_id": "6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441"
}
*** Script: {
  "sys_id": "005d500b536073005e0addeeff7b12f4"

This example shows how to return records from the Incident table where active is true and the priority or severity is 1.

```
// active = true AND (priority = 1 OR severity = 1)
var query = new GlideQuery('incident')
    .where('active', true)
    .where(new GlideQuery()
        .where('priority', 1)
        .orWhere('severity', 1))
   .limit(5)
   .select()
   .toArray(5)

gs.info(JSON.stringify(query, null, 2));
```

Output:

```
[
   {
      "sys_id":"b0f31e5673500010c2e7660c4cf6a711"
   },
   {
