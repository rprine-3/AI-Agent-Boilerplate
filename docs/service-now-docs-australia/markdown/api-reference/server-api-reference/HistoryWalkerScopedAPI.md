# HistoryWalker - Scoped, Global

The HistoryWalker API uses the audit/history tables to generate a historical version of an existing record. This historical version contains all updates to all fields for the specified glide record.

This API provides the ability to return a GlideRecord to a previous update count \(walked GlideRecord\) with the appropriate glide elements populated. After the walked GlideRecord is retrieved, the API provides the ability to move forward and backward between the update numbers, navigating through its historical updates.

This API enables you to:

-   Instruct the HistoryWalker API to use a specific history walker implementation to retrieve audit data.
-   Navigate through the historical version of a glide record.
-   Apply the appropriate history/audit data to get an existing GlideRecord to the state it was in a specific update count.
-   Turn off row-level access control.
-   Turn off field-level access control.
-   Turn off retrieval and processing of "changes" data.
-   Enable journal fields.
-   Enable variables.

The HistoryWalker API provides four ways to retrieve audit data:

1.  HISTORY - History walker

    If not available or not up to date, creates a History Set \[sys\_history\_set\] record for the glide record that you passed when instantiating the HistoryWalker API, using the data in the Sys Audit \[sys\_audit\] table. The sys\_history\_set table contains the name of the associated History \[sys\_history\_line\] table. The sys\_history\_line table contains a record for each field value that has been updated in the table being walked. Using this retrieval method, HistoryWalker methods retrieve history data from the generated sys\_history\_line table, instead of directly querying the sys\_audit table.

    The records within the sys\_history\_line table are sorted and grouped by ascending Update \[update\] field values rather than by chronological order. The update field is loosely associated with the Updates \[sys\_mod\_count\] field on the task table.

    **Note:** Updates of the sys\_mod\_count by clients is not synchronized and therefore can be overwritten, making this count unreliable.

2.  AUDIT - Audit walker

    Queries the sys\_audit table for the glide record that you passed when instantiating the HistoryWalker API. Each record in the sys\_audit table contains the changes to field values that occurred through the life of the record.

    Records are sorted ascending by the Update count \[record\_checkpoint\] field rather than by chronological order. The record\_checkpoint field is loosely associated with the Updates \[sys\_mod\_count\] field on the task table. One-to-one correlation is not guaranteed.

    Things to consider when deciding whether to use the AUDIT retrieval method:

    -   Size of the sys\_audit table. The sys\_audit table can become quite large as the changes for all fields in all records are maintained in this table.
    -   Possible lack of update zero record depending on the setting of the system property **glide.sys.audit\_inserts**. This property defines whether an audit record is created with the initial field values when a record is first inserted in a table. In a base system, this property is set to "false" causing the HistoryWalker API to do additional processing to account for this missing information.
    As such, running the HistoryWalker API with AUDIT isn't as performant as either HISTORY or CHECKPOINT.

3.  CHECKPOINT - Checkpoint walker

    Uses a hybrid approach to obtain historical data from the sys\_history\_set or sys\_audit table depending on the setting of the system property **com.glide.history\_walker.max\_history\_count**. If the record to walk has a sys\_mod\_count that exceeds the value set in this property, default value = 1,000, the checkpoint walker uses the sys\_audit table to obtain history data. Otherwise it uses the sys\_history\_set table.

    The reason for this check is that the sys\_history\_set table provides a more performant approach for walking history data, but only up to a certain point. When the total number of field updates reaches a certain level, approximately 10K, the generation of the sys\_history\_set table can exceed the user transaction timeout. If the timeout is exceeded, the overall results are worse in performance than running against the sys\_audit table that contains all table updates. The checkpoint walker uses the **com.glide.history\_walker.max\_history\_count** to determine the optimal record set to use to achieve the best performance.

    Records are grouped and sorted ascending by the Record Internal Checkpoint \[internal\_checkpoint\] field. Since the internal\_checkpoint field is a timestamp, the records are in chronological order. In addition, the internal\_checkpoint field has no association to the task.sys\_mod\_count field.

    The most important difference between the checkpoint walker and other walkers is that the other walkers are coupled to and driven by task.sys\_mod\_count entries and related to sys\_audit.record\_checkpoint and sys\_history\_line.update. The checkpoint walker uses the sys\_audit.internal\_checkpoint and sys\_history\_line.internal\_checkpoint fields respectively.

    The record internal checkpoint addresses both of these issues making the checkpoint walker the most reliable way to retrieve audit history data.

4.  OFFLINE - Offline history walker

    Provides the offline history feature used by applications such as the Field Service mobile offline app. When a task table extension has fields with the dictionary attribute offline\_timestamp\_field set, the offline history walker runs irrespective of any property or explicit instruction to use another walker. The offline history walker uses the sys\_history\_line and sys\_history\_set tables, which contain history data purposely ordered by date and time, to support offline updates. Only the offline history walker can give accurate results for such tables.

    **Note:** For offline updates, the HistoryWalker API is initiated automatically and the only two methods that you can use are: walkTo\(0\) and walkForward\(\). You can't call other HistoryWalker methods for offline updates.


The system property **com.snc.walker.default** defines the default type of record walking to perform when instantiating the HistoryWalker API. For upgrading customers, this property is set to "HISTORY". For new customers, this property is set to "CHECKPOINT".

When you instantiate the HistoryWalker API as follows, the **com.snc.walker.default** property determines which record walker implementation the API uses.

```
var hw = new sn_hw.HistoryWalker(<table name>, <sys_id>);
```

You can also pass the type of record walker to use when instantiating the API. It’s advisable to always include the desired walker implementation when instantiating this API.

```
var hw = new sn_hw.HistoryWalker(<table name>, <sys_id>, <walker>);
```

such as:

```
var hw = new sn_hw.HistoryWalker('incident', '1c741bd70b2322007518478d83673af3', 'CHECKPOINT');
```

To use this class in scoped and global applications, use the `sn_hw` namespace identifier. The History Walker plugin \(com.glide.history\_walker\) that is enabled by default is required to access the HistoryWalker API.

   var walkedGr = hw.getWalkedRecord();
   var fields = GlideScriptRecordUtil.get(walkedGr).getChangedFieldNames();
   gs.info('Fields changed at update ' + hw.getUpdateNumber() + ' were:');
   for (var j = 0; j < fields.size(); j++) {

</table>The following code example shows how to call this method.

```
var incGr = new GlideRecord('incident');
incGr.get('number', 'INC0000015');
var hw = new sn_hw.HistoryWalker(incGr.getTableName(), incGr.getUniqueValue());

while (hw.walkForward()) {
  var oldPriority = hw.getWalkedRecord().priority;
  gs.info('Incident priority in update number ' + hw.getUpdateNumber() + ' was ' + oldPriority);
}
```

Output:

```
Incident priority in update number 0 was 4
Incident priority in update number 1 was 4
Incident priority in update number 2 was 4
Incident priority in update number 3 was 4
Incident priority in update number 4 was 4
Incident priority in update number 5 was 2
 
```

## HistoryWalker - walkTo\(int updateCount\)

Applies the appropriate history/audit data to get a GlideRecord to the state it was in a specific update count. Use getWalkedRecord\(\) or getWalkedRecordCopy\(\) after walking to an update number to retrieve the "walked" GlideRecord.

**Note:** This method is not supported by the checkpoint walker implementation. Call the [HistoryWalker - walkTo\(String checkpoint\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/HistoryWalkerScopedAPI.md) method when using the checkpoint walker.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|updateCount|Integer|Update number to walk to.|

Flag that indicates whether walking to the specified update number was possible.Valid values:

-   true: Able to walk to the specified update number.
-   false: Unable to walk to the specified update number.

Possible reasons: The requested update is greater than the update count of the GlideRecord or there is no history/audit data for the requested update number.

```

Output:

```

```

## HistoryWalker - walkTo\(String checkpoint\)

Applies the appropriate history/audit data to get a GlideRecord to the state it was in for a specific record internal checkpoint. Use the getWalkedRecord\(\) or getWalkedRecordCopy\(\) method after walking to a record's internal checkpoint to retrieve the "walked" GlideRecord.

**Note:** This method is only supported by the checkpoint walker implementation.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|checkpoint|String|Record's internal checkpoint to walk to. You can find this value in the internal\_checkpoint field of the Sys Audit \[sys\_audit\] or History \[sys\_history\_line\] table.|

```

var gr_Hw = new GlideRecord('sc_req_item');
gr_Hw.get('b0d3335d49534210f877468e89703a7c');
 
var hw = new sn_hw.HistoryWalker(gr_Hw.getTableName(), gr_Hw.getUniqueValue(), 'CHECKPOINT');
hw.walkTo('19096afcc800000001');
printChangedFields(hw);
 
function printChangedFields(hw) {
   var walkedGr = hw.getWalkedRecord();
   var fields = GlideScriptRecordUtil.get(walkedGr).getChangedFieldNames();
   gs.info('Fields changed at update ' + hw.getUpdateNumber() + ' were:');
   for (var j = 0; j < fields.size(); j++) {
      var fieldName = fields.get(j) + '';
      if (fieldName !== 'variables')
         gs.info(walkedGr.getValue('sys_updated_on') + ' ' + fieldName + '=' + walkedGr.getValue(fieldName));

         gs.info(walkedGr.getValue('sys_updated_on') + ' ' + variableName + '=' + variables[variableName].getValue());

```

Output:

```
