# g\_service\_catalog- Client

The g\_service\_catalog API provides methods to access data in a multi-row variable set \(MRVS\) when a model is open.

This API is available in all environments, such as, Service Portal, ServiceNow AI Platform, Workspace, and Now® Mobile.

**Parent Topic:**[Client API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/api-client.md)

## g\_service\_catalog - getValue\(String variableName\)

Returns the value of the specified field on the catalog item form when used in a client script on multi-row variable sets \(MRVS\).

Use this method when an MRVS modal is open for editing or creating and you want to modify data within the MRVS based on the value of a field on the parent catalog item form. For example, when you need to modify the contents of the cells within an MRVS based on a check box on the parent form. You can also use this method to access the data of other MRVS elements within the same parent form.

**Note:** This method can only be called from the parent object, such as g\_service\_catalog.parent.getValue\(\).

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|variableName|String|Name of the variable in the catalog item form to return.|

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|String|Value contained in the specified variable of the catalog item form.|

In this example, a catalog item for blocking multiple IP addresses on a firewall has a variable *address\_type* with two choices - **IPV4** and **IPV6**. The MRVS has two variables \(*ipv4\_address* and *ipv6\_address*\) for the respective address types. If the **Address type** field on the parent form is set to **IPV4**, the field **IPV6 address** is hidden on the MRVS.

```
function onLoad() {
  if (g_service_catalog.parent.getValue("address_type") == "ipv4") {
    g_form.setValue("ipv4_address", "XX.XX.XX.XX");
    g_form.setVisible("ipv6_address", "false");
  }
}
```
