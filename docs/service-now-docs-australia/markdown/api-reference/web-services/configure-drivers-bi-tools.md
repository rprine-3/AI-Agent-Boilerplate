# Integrate Live Connect Drivers with third-party BI tools

Configure ServiceNow Live Connect drivers to connect with third-party business intelligence and database tools for direct data access and analysis.

After installing and configuring the Live Connect drivers on your client machine, you can connect them to third-party business intelligence and database tools. This integration enables you to query ServiceNow data directly from your preferred analytics platforms without requiring data export or replication.

Live Connect supports integration with a wide range of ODBC and JDBC-compatible tools, including Tableau, Power BI, DB Visualizer, and other standard BI platforms. By connecting these tools to your ServiceNow instance through the Live Connect drivers, you can create dashboards, run ad-hoc queries, and perform comprehensive data analysis using live ServiceNow data.

**Note:**

Step-by-step instructions for third-party tools are illustrative. Consult tool-specific documentation for the latest updates.

## Prerequisites

-   The Live Connect plugin is installed on your ServiceNow instance.
-   Live Connect is configured on your instance, including user account creation \(personal or service account\), ACL configuration, and IP filter setup.
-   The appropriate Live Connect driver \(ODBC or JDBC\) is downloaded and installed on your client machine.
-   The driver is configured with your instance URL, user account credentials \(personal or service account\), and connection parameters.
-   Your client machine's IP address is included in the Live Connect IP filter configuration.
-   The user account has the necessary roles \(**sn\_odbc\_rest\_access** or **sn\_jdbc\_rest\_access**\) and table-level access permissions.

## General connection considerations

When connecting third-party BI tools to ServiceNow Live Connect drivers, keep the following considerations in mind:

-   All connections are read-only. Third-party tools can't modify ServiceNow data through Live Connect.
-   Query performance depends on network connectivity, query complexity, and the amount of data being retrieved. Use WHERE clauses and column selection to optimize performance.

    Use WHERE clauses to filter only the data you need. This is critical for optimizing performance when querying large tables. Use TOP, LIMIT, and WHERE clauses to minimize result sets and avoid timeout errors.

-   Security permissions are enforced at the ServiceNow level. The connected tool can only access tables and records permitted by the user account's roles and ACL configuration.
-   Strict security is enabled by default. When you query data, Live Connect validates your access at the row level and field level using the ACLs. As a result, you may notice longer query response times. This is expected behavior, consistent with how GlideRecordSecure works. You can assign the **sn\_live\_connect\_privileged\_mode** role to specific accounts \(not globally\) to disable row and field-level ACL checks for those accounts only. Table-level access control remains in effect.
-   The default query timeout is 5 minutes. If your query exceeds this limit, it is terminated.
-   Monitor your SQL query rate to stay within the 500 queries per hour limitation.
-   Consider using separate user accounts \(personal or service accounts\) for different teams or projects to maintain granular access control.

## Supported BI tools

While Power BI Desktop and DB Visualizer are specifically documented examples, the Live Connect drivers support any ODBC or JDBC-compatible application. Other commonly used tools include:

-   Pyramid Analytics
-   Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server
-   Microsoft Excel \(via ODBC connection\)
-   SQL Server Management Studio
-   DBeaver and other universal database tools
-   Custom applications using ODBC or JDBC APIs

Each tool has its own connection configuration interface, but the underlying connection parameters \(instance URL, user account credentials, driver selection\) remain consistent across all platforms.

Connect Power BI Desktop to your ServiceNow instance using the ODBC driver to access and analyze ServiceNow data. Create dashboards and reports that visualize your ServiceNow data.
-   **[Connect DB Visualizer to JDBC driver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/connect-dbvisualizer-jdbc.md)**  
Connect the DB Visualizer database tool to your ServiceNow instance using the JDBC driver to query ServiceNow data. Access authorized tables and perform read-only queries on your ServiceNow data to create visualizations, and perform ad-hoc analysis using industry-standard SQL commands.
