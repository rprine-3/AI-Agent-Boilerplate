# Specify an OAuth scope

Specify the OAuth scopes that you get from the provider. Scopes can be any level of access specified by the provider, such as read, write, or any string, including a URL.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **System OAuth** &gt; **Application Registry** and open a third-party OAuth provider record.

2.  In the OAuth Entity Scopes embedded list, click **Insert a new row** and then enter a **Name** and **OAuth scope**.

    The OAuth scope is the scope that you are granted by the provider. Typical scopes are read and write. Scopes can be any string that the provider specifies.
