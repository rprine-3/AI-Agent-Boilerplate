# Analyze REST and SOAP API usage

REST and SOAP API analytics allow you to track and analyze web service API usage.

Use analytics to help answer questions such as

-   Which APIs are used most?
-   Which API versions are being used? Can I deprecate older versions?
-   Which API methods are being used?
-   What resources are being accessed?
-   Who is using each API and resource?

The instance tracks analytics for all inbound web services, including platform web services such as the REST Table API or the SOAP API, and custom web services such as scripted REST APIs and scripted SOAP web services. Analytics are aggregated by each resource and HTTP action combination.

Outbound web services, such as REST Messages, are not tracked.
