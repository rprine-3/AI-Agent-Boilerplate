# Asynchronous SOAPMessageV2 example

You can send an outbound SOAP message asynchronously.

When you send an asynchronous message the instance does not wait for a response before proceeding. You must handle waiting for a response within your code.

```

var requestBody;
var responseBody;
var status;
var sm;
try{
	sm = new sn_ws.SOAPMessageV2("StockQuote", "GetQuote");  // Might throw exception if message doesn't exist or not visible due to scope
	sm.setBasicAuth("admin","admin");
	sm.setStringParameter("symbol", "NOW");
	sm.setStringParameterNoEscape("xml_data","<data>test</data>");
	response = sm.executeAsync(); //Might throw exception if http connection timed out or some issue with sending request itself because of encryption/decryption of password

	response.waitForResponse(60);// In Seconds, Wait at most 60 seconds to get response from ECC Queue/Mid Server //Might throw exception timing out waiting for response in ECC queue

	responseBody = response.haveError() ? response.getErrorMessage() : response.getBody();
	status = response.getStatusCode();
} catch(ex) {
	responseBody = ex.getMessage();
	status = '500';
} finally {
	requestBody = sm ? sm.getRequestBody():null;
}
gs.info("Request Body: " + requestBody);
gs.info("Response: " + responseBody);
gs.info("HTTP Status: " + status);
```
