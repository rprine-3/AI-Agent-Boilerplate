# Use a service reference in a C Sharp integration

Use a wizard to add a service reference for a C Sharp integration.

Go to the **Solutions Explorer** and select **Service References** &gt; **Add Service Reference**. A wizard will appear asking for an address. Use: https://&lt;instance name&gt;.service-now.com/incident.do?WSDL. Accept the defaults for the rest of the wizard.

Open the app.config file and change the Security mode to "Transport" and the clientCredentialType and proxyCredentialType to "Basic"
