Grant type

Select the grant type:-   **Authorization code**: The code that is granted to the client to obtain an access token, which is then used to obtain access to the resource. If you select this option, then you need an authorization URL \(the URL of the authorization server\).
-   **Resource owner password credentials**: The user name and password of the user that is trying to obtain access to the resource.
-   **Client Credentials**: The client ID and client secret, which are both used to get the access token. This method does not provide refresh tokens.
-   **JWT Bearer**: An authorization server validates a JWT token which enables identity and security information to be shared across security domains.
-   **SAML2 Bearer**: Generates the SAML2 assertion and then exchanges the assertion for the access tokens wit the provider.

**Note:** For outbound request to SuccessFactors use the **SAML2 Bearer** as the Default Grant Type.
