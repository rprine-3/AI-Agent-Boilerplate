# Collect analytics for an API

Select which APIs to collect analytics for and select if requestor information should be collected for each API.

## Before you begin

**Note:** API analytics is not available for certain APIs used for internal platform functionality, such as the UI and Mobile app APIs.

Role required: api\_analytics\_read or admin

## About this task

When a new API is added, an inclusion list record is created automatically. You can modify or create new inclusion list records to manually configure which APIs and requestor information are logged.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **Inclusion List** and create a new record.

<table id="table_zvk_rjz_qw"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

API name

</td><td>

For REST APIs, enter the API name. This name should contain only the namespace and ID of the API. Do not include any request parameters in the API name.For example, for the Table API endpoints `api/now/table/incident`and `api/now/table/problem`, the namespace and ID are **now/table**.

 SOAP APIs do not support separate logging configurations for different APIs. You can configure logging for all SOAP APIs by modifying the SOAP APIs inclusion list record.
