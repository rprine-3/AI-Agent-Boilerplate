# Create a scripted extension point

Create a scripted extension point that can be placed in a script include in the base application code. By placing the scripted extension point, you designate the specific location in the application code where data or objects can be sent to a customization and where data is returned.

## Before you begin

Role required: You must have the specific role for the developer or administrator of the application, or you must have the admin role.

**Note:** To learn about application-specific administrator roles and delegated development, see [Access control rules in application administration apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/ACL-access-checks.md) and [Delegated development and deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_DelegatedDevelopment.md).

## About this task

Define the content and structure for an extension point. This definition should describe how a customization should be structured, how it interacts with the application code, and how the data that is returned by a customization at the extension point is processed.

By creating a good definition, you provide a structure for the extensions.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Unique name for the extension point. The name can be up to 100 alphanumeric characters, including special characters.|
    |API Name|Name of the extension point API that is pre-pended with the application scope to which it applies. This is a system-assigned name and cannot be changed.|
    |Application|Application scope against which the extension point is assigned. This is system-assigned and cannot be changed. For more information about the protections that are offered by the use of scoping, see [Application scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationScope.md).|
    |Restrict to this scope|Option for restricting the extension point to the application scope only.|
    |Description|Requirements for the custom script include, such as how the UI script should be structured and how it should operate with the application code.|
    |Example|Example of how a custom script include that interacts with this extension point should be structured so it operates with the application code.|

4.  Click **Submit**.
