# Configure SOAP security

Administrators can configure web service security for inbound SOAP requests made to the ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can also set up web service security to use different certificates for different web service clients. By enabling web service security, you can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Note:** After you configure a WS-security profile or a security policy, validation is performed on all incoming SOAP requests, including from the MID Server or ODBC driver. Disable validation for these types of requests by [marking the service accounts as internal integration users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/t_MarkSvcAcctsAsInternalIntegUsers.md).

## Procedure

1.  [Upload a certificate to an instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_UploadACertificateToAnInstance.md).

2.  [Create a WS-security profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/t_CreateANewWS-SecurityProfile.md).

3.  [Create a security policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/t_CreateANewSecurityPolicy.md).

    Security policies define which WS-security profiles are used to evaluate a particular web service request. If no policy is defined, all WS-security profiles are used to evaluate all requests.

4.  Set the value of the property `glide.soap.default_security_policy` to the name of the new security policy.
