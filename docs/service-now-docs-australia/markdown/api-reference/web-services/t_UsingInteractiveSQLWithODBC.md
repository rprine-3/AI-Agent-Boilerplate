# Use Interactive SQL with ODBC

Run the Interactive SQL application for quick verification of connectivity and to test query results without using a full application.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In Windows, navigate to **Start** &gt; **Programs** &gt; **ServiceNow ODBC** &gt; **Interactive SQL \(ODBC\)**.

2.  Connect to the base instance by entering the following command and selecting the appropriate user credentials in the format without special characters: `ID*password@DSNName`.

    ```
    CONNECT odbcuser*password@ServiceNow
    ```

    \[Omitted image "ConnectingTheSQL.png"\] Alt text: Connecting the SQL.

3.  Issue a `SELECT` SQL command.

    ```
    SELECT NUMBER, short_description FROM incident;
    ```

    Make sure to include the semicolon at the end of your query statement. Otherwise, you are presented with a `'Cont>'` prompt.

-   **[Specify the maximum number of rows returned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/r_MaxRowsReturned.md)**  
By default, ServiceNow only returns 100 rows of data with each iSQL query. If you need to return more rows of data, set the maxrows parameter for the iSQL session.
-   **[SQL support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/r_SQLSupport.md)**  
The ODBC driver embeds a third party SQL/ODBC engine from DataDirect, a division of Progress Software.
