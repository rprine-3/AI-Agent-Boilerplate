# Domain separation and ODBC driver

This is an overview of domain separation and ODBC drivers.Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic\*

-   There is business logic to ensure data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   In the application, the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, aggregations, and so on, all consider domain at run time.
-   The owner of the instance needs to be able to set up the application to function normally across multiple tenants.

Use case: As a service provider when I use chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the client must be able to see my response.
