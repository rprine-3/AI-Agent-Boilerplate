# Outbound request logging exclusion domain requirements

When you exclude outbound request logging for a domain, the value you enter in the Domain field must meet certain requirements.

## Requirements

The value you enter in the **Domain** field must meet the following requirements.

-   Begins with `HTTP://` or `HTTPS://`.
-   Is a domain pattern or IP address.
-   Ends with alphanumeric characters preceded by a period, such as `.com`.
-   Includes at most a single wildcard character immediately following the scheme and hierarchical portion of the domain pattern.

## Wildcard

You can use a single wildcard character \(\*\) in the domain pattern. Use this wildcard immediately following the scheme and hierarchical portion of the domain pattern, such as `http://*.domain.com` to include all subdomains. The wildcard must immediately follow the scheme and hierarchical portion of the domain pattern. If you use an IP address instead of domain pattern, you must enter the full IP address without a wildcard.

**Note:** You cannot use multiple wildcards, or specify a wildcard without a domain pattern. Values such as \* or \*.\* are not supported.

## Domain matching

When evaluating the Origin header in a request, ServiceNow prioritizes rules that match the domain pattern exactly. If no exact match is found, the next closest match is used.

For example, if there are rules for the domain patterns `http://*.blog.mysite.com` and `http://*.mysite.com`, a request from `http://alice.blog.mysite.com` will match the `http://*.blog.mysite.com` pattern.

## Examples of valid and invalid domains

|Valid domain|Invalid domain|
|------------|--------------|
|`http://*.ms.net`|`https://*com`|
|`https://*.ms.com`|`http://*..com`|
|`https://*.com.au`|`http://192.168.1.*`|
|`http://192.168.1.1`|`http://*.168.1.126`|
|`http://*.service-now.com`|`http://blog.*.service-now.com`|
|`http://*.com`|`http://*com`|

## Outbound request logging exclusion

You can exclude domains to allow only basic-level logging on those domains.

To exclude a domain, navigate to **System Web Services** &gt; **Outbound HTTP Log Domain Exclusion List** and create a new record. You must have the web\_service\_admin role to exclude domains.
