# Use forms to limit or extend the query response

On occasion, there is a need to limit the number of field values that a SOAP query returns.

You can use a form view to limit the number of field values returned by a SOAP query. Specifying a form view has the effects of:

1.  Limiting the response elements to contain only the fields on the view.
2.  Specifying reference record field values from referenced fields such as **caller\_id.email**. This causes the value of the caller's email to be returned in the SOAP response.

To enable form views for SOAP queries, configure the **com.glide.soap.view** property to contain the name of the view that you want to use for all SOAP query responses. The default is **soap\_response**. You can also specify the view name as a URL parameter, **sysparm\_view=&lt;view name&gt;**, when making the SOAP call. For example:

```
https://<instance name>.service-now.com/incident.do?SOAP&sysparm_view=ess

```

By default, if a specified view name does not exist, the response contains all fields.
