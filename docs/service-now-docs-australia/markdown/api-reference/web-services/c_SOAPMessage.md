# SOAP message

Information needed to send SOAP requests is stored in SOAP message records.

Each record specifies an endpoint for the request, the required format of the request as a web services description language \(WSDL\) file, authentication information, and a list of functions that can run against the endpoint.

-   **[Create a SOAP message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/t_CreateASOAPMessage.md)**  
Create a SOAP message to define the remote endpoint, WSDL, and authentication settings.
-   **[SOAP message functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/c_SOAPMessageFunctions.md)**  
After you create a SOAP message record, you can click **Generate sample SOAP messages** to populate the SOAP Message Functions related list.
-   **[Variable substitution in outbound SOAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/c_VariableSubstitutionSOAP.md)**

-   **[Test the SOAP message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/c_TestTheSOAPMessage.md)**  
Test a SOAP message to validate the configuration before using the message in an integration.
-   **[Send a SOAP message through a MID server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/c_SendSOAPMsgMIDServer.md)**  
When creating SOAP message functions, you can configure the function to be sent through a MID Server.
