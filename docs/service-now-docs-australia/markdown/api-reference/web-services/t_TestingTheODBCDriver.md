# Test the ODBC driver

After configuring the ODBC driver, test that the driver can connect to the base instance as the ODBC user and can query data from a target table.

## Before you begin

You must have administrator-level access for the Windows computer on which you want to test the ODBC driver.

## About this task

To test the connection, run the ODBC Administrator program.

## Procedure

1.  In Windows, navigate to **Start** &gt; **Programs** &gt; **ServiceNow ODBC** &gt; **ODBC Administrator**.

    The ServiceNow ODBC data source is installed as a system data source.

2.  Select the **System DSN** tab, and then select the **ServiceNow** data source.

3.  Click **Configure**.

4.  Click **Test Connect** in the ODBC driver Setup dialog box.

    \[Omitted image "TestConnect.png"\] Alt text: Test data source connection

5.  Enter the login credentials.

    These are the usual ServiceNow base system login credentials for the ODBC user you created.

6.  Click **OK** to log in to the data source.

7.  Click **OK** again when the success message appears.
