# Route Live Connect calls to Read Replica

You can route Live Connect calls to Read Replica to optimize the performance of your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

You must have a secondary database configured for your ServiceNow instance.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Query routing takes the load off the primary database for SELECT queries that take numerous DB CPU cycles on the primary DB. For more information, see [Introduction to ServiceNow Read Replica Databases](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0824441).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Secondary Database** &gt; **Secondary Database Category**.

2.  Select **New** to create secondary database category for ODBC/JDBC.

3.  In the Name field, enter **odbc** or **jdbc**.

    Don't change any other field on this page. If you must change the default values, first refer to this KB: [https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb\_article\_view&amp;sysparm\_article=KB0824441](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0824441) \[Omitted image "sql-api-read-replica.png"\] Alt text: UI screen example for creating secondary database category.
