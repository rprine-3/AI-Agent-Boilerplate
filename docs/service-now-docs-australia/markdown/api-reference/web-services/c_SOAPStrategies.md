# SOAP strategies

Retrieve the information that you need and make your integration more efficient.

-   **[Use filters to limit the number of results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/r_UseFiltersLimitNumberOfResults.md)**  
One way to make your web service calls fit within the 250 record limit is to think about the design of your integrating application.
-   **[Use a local data store to pull data from](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/r_LclDtaStorePullDta.md)**  
If a large amount of data needs to be queried often, and the data does not need to be real-time, perform a sync of the ServiceNow table that you're interested in with your integrating application's data store.
-   **[Use Java/C\#/PHP code to fetch the XML data using basic authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/web-services/r_FetchTheXMLData.md)**  
If a local data store is not an option, another way to get the data is to call the CSV/XML processor directly and then parse the results.
