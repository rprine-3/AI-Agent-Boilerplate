# Debug incoming SOAP envelope

To capture incoming SOAP envelope XML in the system log, add the property **glide.processor.debug.SOAPProcessor** with a value of **true**.

When enabled, this property adds the incoming SOAP envelope in the **Message** field of the system log \(**System Logs** &gt; **All**\). Disable this debugging feature as soon as you are finished so that the log is not overwhelmed with excessive and unnecessary debugging information.
