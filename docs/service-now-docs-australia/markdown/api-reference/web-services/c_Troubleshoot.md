# Troubleshoot a null response in a C Sharp integration

Receiving a null response from ServiceNow's web service.

If you are receiving a "null" response from your web service in your client code, then you may have missed the step in this tutorial for setting the elementFormDefault setting to "False".

Remember to recompile your code against the WSDL after you have changed this setting and saved it.
