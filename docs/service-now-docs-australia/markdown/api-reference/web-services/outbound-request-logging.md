# Outbound web services: Logging

Log requests and responses for outbound web services such as REST and SOAP.

gOutbound request logging allows you to better understand what 3rd-party services your instance accesses and the volume of outbound requests. Additionally, logging can provide valuable information when debugging outbound integrations.
