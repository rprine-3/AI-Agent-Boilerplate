# Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery \(CICD\) API

The CICD API provides endpoints that enable integration with common DevOps tools for building pipelines. These tools include Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, GitLab, GitHub Actions, Atlassian Bamboo/Pipelines, and more.

It provides integrators with the ability to build CICD pipelines for ServiceNow AI Platform applications driven by pull/merge request workflows typical in source-driven development. It leverages the Source Control, Application Repository, and Automated Test Framework features.

The CI/CD API provides the following product and feature areas:

-   Source control

    Apply remote changes for an application linked to a remote Git repository through the Source Control feature in Studio, on a specific instance.

    Imports an application using the specified repository URL and branch name.

-   Application repository: Available for scoped applications, global application, application customizations for scoped applications on the ServiceNow Store, and through plugins.
    -   Publish an application from an instance to the connected application repository.
    -   Install an application onto an instance from the connected application repository.
    -   Rollback an application that was installed through rollback context.
-   Batch
    -   Define a JSON manifest file to batch install multiple applications together.
    -   Rollback the entire batch install through rollback context.
    -   Returns the results of a batch install based on a specified result identifier.
-   Plugins
    -   Activate a plugin.
    -   Rollback a plugin through rollback context.
-   Automated Test Framework \(ATF\)
    -   Start an ATF test suite.
    -   Obtain the pass/fail result of an ATF test suite.
-   Instance scan
    -   Start an instance scan \(full, point scan on table, point scan on record, scoped application, update set, combination of these items.\)
    -   Obtain the pass/fail result of an instance scan run.
-   Progress

    Obtain the percentage completion on an instance for processes initiated by other endpoint calls. You can use this feature to poll until progress completion before proceeding with the next step.


This API uses an asynchronous response model. When you call an endpoint, such as to run a test suite /sn\_cicd/testsuite/run, the endpoint kicks off the associated function, such as starting the execution of the test suite. The endpoint then returns a response message that contains the execution status of the requested function, typically `Pending`, along with a unique identifier and link. Use this information to obtain additional information about the progress, source, results, and/or findings of the request. Depending on the function request, you can use one of the following means to obtain additional information about a request:

-   Call the /sn\_cicd/progress/\{progress\_id\} endpoint using the **links.progress.id** parameter returned by the initiating endpoint.
-   Call the /sn\_cicd/testsuite/results/\{result\_id\} endpoint using the **links.result.id** parameter returned by the initiating endpoint.
-   Call the /sn\_cicd/instance\_scan/result/\{progress\_id\} endpoint using the **links.progress.id** parameter returned by the initiating endpoint.
-   Call the /sn\_cicd/sc/apply\_stash/\{stash\_id\} endpoint using the **links.stash.id** parameter returned by the/sn\_cicd/progress/\{progress\_id\} endpoint.
-   Link out to the **links.&lt;progress/result/source/findings&gt;.url** parameter returned by the initiating endpoint.

**Note:** To install an application from a repository, the application must first be published to the repository using the /sn\_cicd/app\_repo/publish endpoint. Once published, any instance connected to that repository can then install and rollback the application. If the application is not first published, the installation request fails.

The sn\_cicd.sys\_ci\_automation or admin role is required to use this API.

Beginning in Tokyo, the CICD API endpoints that need to obtain the **instance wide lock / mutex** to perform their requested operation will use a queue, rather than rejecting requests while the **instance wide lock / mutex** is occupied. Multiple CICD pipelines simultaneously make requests without detecting the rejection and retrying, and instead, can simply monitor the progress as they would for successful requests previously. This behavior is on by default.

The current queue can be inspected by a user with the admin role by navigating to the **System Diagnostic** **-&gt;Application Operation Queue**. From here the queue can be paused and resumed by the admin to allow for other manual operations that may require the **instance wide lock / mutex**.

**Note:** When paused, any in progress operation will run to completion but no new operation will be started. The API will continue to accept and queue new requests. A pending operation can also be cancelled before it begins running by updating the listed execution tracker to a cancelled state. If for whatever reason, an operation cannot proceed after the time out specified in com.glide.update\_operation.job\_cancel\_timeout\_minutes \(default: 48 hours\), it will be cancelled.

When an upgrade is scheduled, the queue will go into an upgrade paused state two hours prior to the upgrade unless overridden by the property com.glide.update\_operation.queue\_upgrade\_window. This allows for any in progress operation to complete before the upgrade commences.

**Note:** The queue automatically resumes when the upgrade is completed.

## CI/CD - POST /sn\_cicd/app/batch/install

Installs two or more packages in a single specified batch.

A batch can contain any combination of the following types:

-   Application:
    -   Scoped applications in the ServiceNow Store that are not owned by your company
    -   Scoped or global applications in the application repository that are owned by your company
    -   Your application customizations for Store applications in the application repository
-   ServiceNow plugin:

    Application customizations for scoped applications that were packaged in a plugin and were published to the application repository.


**Note:** This endpoint uses an asynchronous response model. When you call an endpoint, it kicks off the associated function, such as starting the execution of the batch install plan. The endpoint then returns a response message that contains the execution status of the requested function, typically Pending, along with a unique identifier and link. Use this information to obtain additional information about the progress or results of the request.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_cicd/{api_version}/app/batch/install`

Default URL: `/api/sn_cicd/app/batch/install`

**Note:** Available versions are specified in the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/use-REST-API-Explorer.md). For scripted REST APIs there is additional version information on the [Scripted REST Service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).

## CI/CD - POST /sn\_cicd/app/batch/rollback/\{rollback\_id\}

Rolls back all of the packages associated with a specific batch installation to their previous versions.

This endpoint works in conjunction with the /sn\_cicd/app/batch/install endpoint. The **rollback\_id** is provided in the return results of this endpoint. When this endpoint is called, it rolls back all packages specified in the associated install; you cannot rollback individual packages. If there is no previous version, the endpoint uninstalls the associated package.

**Note:** This endpoint uses an asynchronous response model. When you call an endpoint, it kicks off the associated function, such as starting the execution of the batch install plan. The endpoint then returns a response message that contains the execution status of the requested function, typically Pending, along with a unique identifier and link. Use this information to obtain additional information about the progress or results of the request.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_cicd/{api_version}/app/batch/rollback/{rollback_id}`

Default URL: `/api/sn_cicd/app/batch/rollback/{rollback_id}`

**Note:** Available versions are specified in the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/use-REST-API-Explorer.md). For scripted REST APIs there is additional version information on the [Scripted REST Service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).

## CI/CD - POST /sn\_cicd/app\_repo/install

Installs the specified application from the application repository onto the instance making the endpoint call.

Using this endpoint you are able to install both unaltered and customized ServiceNow base system and ServiceNow Store applications, customized ServiceNow plugins, and your own ServiceNow applications.

The following outlines the parameters that you need to pass to implement specific use cases. All parameters that are not specified are not passed in and use the associated defaults.

-   To only install the base application and not the corresponding application customizations.
    -   sys\_id: Sys\_id of the base application that has been customized.
    -   base\_app\_version: Version of the base application to install.
-   To install a specified version of application customizations and automatically install the recommended base application version. The recommended base application version is the version of the base application that was installed on the instance at the time that the customizations were last published. Every version of application customizations has a corresponding recommended base application version.
    -   sys\_id: Sys\_id of the application that has been customized.
    -   auto\_upgrade\_base\_app: true
    -   version: Version of the application customizations to install.
-   To install the latest version of the application customizations and its corresponding recommended base application version.
    -   sys\_id: Sys\_id of the application that has been customized.
    -   auto\_upgrade\_base\_app: true
-   To install the latest version of the application customizations, but not upgrade the base application to the application customizations recommended base application version.
    -   sys\_id: Sys\_id of the application that has been customized.
    -   auto\_upgrade\_base\_app: false
-   To install application customizations along with the scoped ServiceNow plugin of the current release.
    -   scope: Scope of the plugin that has been customized OR
    -   sys\_id: Sys\_id of the application that has been customized. This is not the ID of the plugin.
    -   version: Version of the application customizations to install.
-   To install application customizations for an already installed and activated scoped plugin.
    -   sys\_id: Sys\_id of the application that has been customized. This is not the ID of the plugin.
    -   auto\_upgrade\_base\_app: false
    -   version: Version of the application customizations to install.

Since base plugins can have only one version per family release, the **auto\_upgrade\_base\_app** and **base\_app\_version** parameters don't apply to application customization installs for plugins. To activate a plugin for the first time on an instance, use the /sn\_cicd/plugin/\{plugin\_id\}/activate endpoint instead.

**Note:** This endpoint uses an asynchronous response model. When you call an endpoint, it kicks off the associated function, such as starting the execution of the batch install plan. The endpoint then returns a response message that contains the execution status of the requested function, typically Pending, along with a unique identifier and link. Use this information to obtain additional information about the progress or results of the request.

## CI/CD - POST /sn\_cicd/sc/apply\_stash/\{stash\_id\}

Starts applying a previously generated "stash" of changes from a remote source control to a specified local application or application-customization.

This endpoint works in conjunction with the [POST/api/sn\_cicd/sc/apply\_changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/cicd-api.md) and [CI/CD - GET /sn\_cicd/progress/\{progress\_id\}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/cicd-api.md) endpoints. When the POST /api/sn\_cicd/sc/apply\_changes endpoint is called, any unsaved or uncommitted changes in App Engine Studio on the associated instance are saved into the database as a [stash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/stash-changes.md).

The way to determine whether a stash was created when the changes were initially applied is to call the GET /sn\_cicd/progress/\{progress\_id\} endpoint. If a stash was created, the sys\_id \(**stash\_id**\) and URL of the stash are returned. To apply the stashed changes to the associated application, call this apply\_stash endpoint using the **stash\_id** returned by the progress endpoint.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_cicd/{api_version}/sc/apply_stash/{stash_id}`

Default URL: `/api/sn_cicd/sc/apply_stash/{stash_id}`

**Note:** Available versions are specified in the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/use-REST-API-Explorer.md). For scripted REST APIs there is additional version information on the [Scripted REST Service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).
