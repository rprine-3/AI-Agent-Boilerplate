# Workplace Connector Webhook API

The Workplace Connector Webhook API is a generic interface that enables data from different kinds of workplace hardware or sensors \(such as badging systems or occupancy sensors\) to be stored in Workplace Service Delivery tables.

This API runs in the `sn_wsd_wc` namespace. To access this API the Workplace Connectors \(com.sn\_wsd\_wc\) plugin must be activated.

Before calling this API, you must configure records in the Connector Configuration \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_connector\_config\] and Provider Configuration \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_provider\_config\] tables. For information on how to configure these records, see [Configure Workplace Connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/configure-workplace-connectors.md).

In addition, you must set up an extension point that defines the data conversion/mapping from the hardware/sensor-based event payload to the target ServiceNow table, such as the Employee Attendance Data \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_employee\_attendance\_data\] table.

For additional information on workplace connector webhooks, see [Workplace Connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-connectors-landing-page.md).

**Parent Topic:**[REST API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/api-rest.md)

## Workplace Connector Webhook - POST /workplace\_connector\_webhook/event

Creates a record in the Connector Events \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_connector\_events\] table and then stores the hardware/sensor-based event data passed in the endpoint's payload into the Payload field of that record.

After the endpoint stores the payload, it sets the State field within the Connector Events record to `new`, indicating the payload hasn’t been processed.

A scheduled job locates the new badging records in the Connector Events table and transforms and writes them to the Employee Attendance Data \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_employee\_attendance\_data\] table. The State field is then set to `processed`.

The mapping of the data between the payload data in the Connector Events record and the Employee Attendance Data record is defined in an extension point. This extension point is identified in the Extension Point Definition field in the associated Connector Configuration \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_connector\_config\] table. For this endpoint, this is the BadgingDataHandler extension point.

**Note:** Records in the Connector Events table in the `processed` state are purged after two days from the creation date. Records in the `error` state are purged after seven days from the date of creation. Records in the `new`state are never purged.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_wsd_wc/{api_version}/workplace_connector_webhook/event`

Default URL: `/api/sn_wsd_wc/workplace_connector_webhook/event`

**Note:** Available versions are specified in the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/use-REST-API-Explorer.md). For scripted REST APIs there is additional version information on the [Scripted REST Service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).

&lt;payload&gt;

</td><td>

Name-value pairs of the hardware/sensor-based event data. The names must correspond to the names identified in the BadgingDataHandler extension point.

For example:

```
{
  "Time zone": "(UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)",
  "Event": "Access granted",
  "Door": "L_SJC005_B1.101_ELEVATOR 2 INT",
  "Side": "Reader - In",
  "Cardholder": "ninat.salem",
  "First name": "Nina T",
  "Last name": "Salem",
  "Credential": " ninat.salem's credential",
  "Employee ID (Cardholder)": "10097",
  "Event timestamp": "11/07/2022 00:56:57"
}
```

You can pass multiple event's data within a single endpoint call. Pass each event's data in a separate object. Each event's data is stored in a separate Employee Attendance Data record.

**Note:** Ensure that any provided timestamp adheres to ISO 8601 formatting to avoid any issues with date parsing.

Data type: JSON object
