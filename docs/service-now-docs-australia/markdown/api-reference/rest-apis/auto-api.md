# Automation Center API

The Automation Center API provides endpoints to create and update data related to robots, processes, and execution jobs. By leveraging this API, you can integrate and reflect details from your automation workflows into the Automation Center dashboard.

Key concepts of the API:

-   Robots: Software agents that execute bot processes. RPA robots can operate in attended or unattended modes.
-   Processes: Instances of RPA workflows executed on a specific robot. To uniquely identify a process, both the process ID and the robot ID must be specified.
-   Executions: Individual tasks performed within a process, such as transferring information from one resource to another \(such as, copying data from emails into a spreadsheet\).

How to use the API:

You can use the API to send data from third-party RPA tools, including robots, processes, and executions, to Automation Center.

Recommended Workflow:

1.  Send the robot data.
2.  Send the process data linked to the sent robot.
3.  Send execution data that references the corresponding robot and process.

    **Note:** Execution data without its associated robot and process already captured in Automation Center will not appear on the dashboard.


Additional information:

-   Event retention: Events created using this API are automatically removed from your instance after 14 days \(default setting\).
-   Record limits: Each API call can handle a maximum of 2,000 records. This limit cannot be changed.
-   Event deletion: This API does not support event deletion.

This API requires the Automation Center plugin to be active and requires the user to have either the sn\_as.automation\_technical\_user or sn\_ac.automation\_admin role.

**Parent Topic:**[REST API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/api-rest.md)

## Automation Center - POST /sn\_ac/automation/rpa

Creates robot, process, and execution events.

These events provide process automation. They appear in the Overview and Execution Automation Center dashboards to measure and monitor the output from multiple RPA vendors.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_ac/{api_version}/automation/rpa`

Default URL: `/api/sn_ac/v1/automation/rpa`

**Note:** Available versions are specified in the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/use-REST-API-Explorer.md). For scripted REST APIs there is additional version information on the [Scripted REST Service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).
