# WSD Multi Reservation API

The Workplace Service Delivery \(WSD\) Multi Reservation API provides endpoints for managing reservations with multiple workplace locations.

To access this API, the caller must have the sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user role and the Workplace Safety Management \(sn\_wsd\_core\) and Workplace Reservation Management \(sn\_wsd\_rsv\) plugins must be activated.

This API runs in the `sn_wsd_rsv` namespace.

For additional information on Workplace Reservation Management, see [Workplace Reservation Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/workplace-rsv-mgmt-feat.md).
