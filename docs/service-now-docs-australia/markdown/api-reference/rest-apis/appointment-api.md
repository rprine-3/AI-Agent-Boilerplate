# Appointment API

The Appointment API provides endpoints for interacting with the appointment booking application. Use this API to book and reschedule appointments, check available appointment slots, and fetch appointment booking configuration details.

Before using this API, the Appointment Booking Configuration and Service Configuration must be setup. In addition, a task for which the appointment is being booked must already exist. For additional information, see [Configuring Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/appointment-booking-administer.md).

The Appointment API requires the Appointment Booking plugin \(com.snc.appointment\_booking\) and is provided within the `sn_apptmnt_booking` namespace. To access this API you must have the snc\_internal role.

## Appointment - GET /sn\_apptmnt\_booking/appointment/execute\_rule\_conditions

Returns the sys\_id of the appointment booking service configuration rule that matches a specified task sys\_id or a set of specified catalog item data.

The passed task ID or catalog item data is evaluated against the rules defined for a service configuration. The sys\_id for the first rule for which these conditions match is returned. You must then pass this rule sys\_id to subsequent availability requests to fetch the correct slots, which are defined in the rule.

You must have either the snc\_internal or snc\_external role to access this endpoint.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_apptmnt_booking/{api_version}/appointment/execute_rule_conditions`

-   Task ID validation: Verifies that the passed **taskId** parameter is a valid sys\_id and the task is in the pending dispatch state.
-   Duplicate slot validation: For reschedules, if you pass the same slot as the original appointment, the slot is invalid as the slot is technically already booked.
-   Slot validation: Verifies that the passed slot information matches what is configured and that the slot has the same time frame. For example, if in the configuration a two-hour slot is configured, but you pass a three-hour slot, the slot is not valid. Similarly, if the 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. slot is available, but the passed slot is for 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., then the passed slot is invalid.

## Appointment - POST /sn\_apptmnt\_booking/appointment/availability

Returns the slots that have been configured in the appointment booking service configuration along with their availability.

If advanced configurations are enabled for the service configuration, the endpoint honors these configurations, and returns the data according to the rules and advanced configuration. You can also use this endpoint to find the first available slot by passing the **get\_next\_available\_slot** parameter or **get\_next\_available\_day\_data** parameter in the request body as `true`.

You must have either the snc\_internal or snc\_external role to access this endpoint.
