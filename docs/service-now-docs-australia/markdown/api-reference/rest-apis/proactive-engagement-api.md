# Proactive Engagement API

The Proactive Engagement API provides an endpoint for creating digital experience issues.

This API is available as a custom scripted REST API. It requires the Proactive Engagement \(proactive-engagement\) plugin and sn\_pren.experience\_issue\_create role. This API belongs to the `sn_pren` namespace.

Use the Proactive Engagement API to create an experience issue when an issue is detected on a user’s instance. The created experience issue drives engagement with the user and helps them self-resolve the issue.

To use this API, ensure the following tables are populated with records:

-   Issue Registry Template \[sn\_pren\_issue\_registry\_template\]
-   Issue Registry \[sn\_pren\_issue\_registry\]
-   Resolution \[sn\_pren\_resolution\]
-   Notification Content \[sn\_pren\_notification\_content\]
-   Provider \[sn\_pren\_provider\]

For more information, see [Proactive Engagement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/proactive-engagement-landing-page.md)

</table>### cURL request

The following example creates an experience issue for user Abel Tuter. The issue code in the body allows Proactive Engagement to identify the resolution from the Issue Registry Template and engage with the end-user via Virtual Agent to help them self-solve the issue.

```
curl  "http://instance.servicenow.com//api/sn_srf/self_remediation/experience_issue/create" \
--request POST \
--header "Accept:application/json" \
--user 'username':'password'
--data “{
  "endpoint": {
    "CI": "d049b28e936aa1106f98f6db5cba10d5",
    "user_id": "62826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5df1",
    "user_name": "abel.tuter",
    "email": ""
  },

  "experience_id": "09ed4830f393739df33",
  "input_parameters": {
    "process_id": "10644"
  },
  "investigative_details": {
    "cpu usage": "78%",
    "processes running": "35",
    "available memory": "23%"
  }

```

The response body returns the experience ID, indicating that the issue creation was successful.

```

  "result": { 
    "experience_id": “09ed4830f393739df33”
  }
