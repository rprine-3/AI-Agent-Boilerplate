# WSD User API

The WSD User API is a Scripted REST API which returns the authenticated user's workplace context, including their assigned workspace location, in-office presence schedule, collaborators, and past and future reservations.

This WSD User is featured with the Workplace Service Delivery \(WSD\) Reservation product and provides a single-call entry point for initializing the reservation booking experience with all relevant user data. This API sits within the Workplace Service Delivery Reservation \(com.sn\_wsd\_rsv\) plugin and serves as the entry point for surfacing a user's complete workplace identity and history.

An authenticated user is someone who is logged in or whose credentials are included in the API request.

Common use cases:

-   Reservation portal initialization: Load a user's home location, schedule, and booking history in a single call when opening a workplace app or portal.
-   Custom mobile or web apps: Fetch all the user context without stitching together multiple table API calls,for example when building front-end reservation experiences.
-   In-office presence tracking: Identify which employees are scheduled to be in-office on a given day.

## Requirements

The WSD User API requires:

-   At least one user record must exist with the sn\_wsd\_core.workplace\_user role.
-   The Workplace Service Delivery Concierge \(com.sn\_wsd\_concierge\), Workplace Service Delivery Core \(com.sn\_wsd\_core\), and Workplace Service Delivery Reservation \(com.sn\_wsd\_rsv\) plugins to be active.

## Related APIs

The WSD User API belongs to a family of APIs all under the `sn_wsd_rsv` namespace that together support the full reservation lifecycle:

-   WSD Search API: Find available reservable spaces based on location, time, and capacity criteria.
-   WSD Reservation API: Create reservations and manage check-in/check-out.
-   WSD Reservable Module API: Retrieve the booking rule configurations that govern what users can reserve and how.

## WSD User - GET /api/sn\_wsd\_rsv/v1/user/context

Retrieves the authenticated user's workplace context, including their assigned workplace location, presence schedule, collaborators, and past and future reservations.

Use this endpoint to initialize a reservation experience by loading all relevant user context in a single call. Collaborator data is optionally included when the com.sn\_wsd\_concierge plugin is active.
