# Spendint API

The Spendint API provides endpoints that push the catalog, price, availability, order, shipment, and invoice information from a third party to the ServiceNow instance. This API is part of the Source-to-Pay Integration Framework application.

This API requires the Procurement Integration Framework \(com.glide.sn\_spend\_intg\) store application and is provided within the `sn_spend_intg` namespace. For information, see [Procurement File Transfer Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/procurement-file-transfer-framework.md).

To access this API, you must have the sn\_spend\_intg.procurement\_integrator role.

**Parent Topic:**[REST API reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/api-rest.md)

## Spendint API - POST /sn\_spend\_intg/spendint/catalog

Allows suppliers to post multiple catalogs for creating supplier products, model products, contracts, and pricing records.

In the catalog API integration, when you receive data from a third-party catalog, you can:

1.  Create any new third-party categories and map these categories to model categories.
    -   If available, use the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code \(UNSPSC\) and then the category name.
    -   If UNSPSC is not available, use just the category name.
2.  After you map a third-party category to a model category, use the Manufacturer Part Number \(MPN\) to find an existing product model, if one is available.
    1.  If a product model is found for the MPN, update the product model with any changes, and then create or update any supplier products that are related to the product model.
    2.  If a product model does not exist for the MPN, do the following:
        1.  A product model class is usually available on the model category that is referenced by the third-party category for the product. Use this product model class to get the product model table in which the product model should be created, for example, hardware, software, consumable, and so on. If no product model class is available, create the product model in the base product model table.
        2.  After the correct product model class is identified, create a new product model in the correct class as follows:
            -   Manufacturer, publisher, or provider should map to the manufacturer on the product model.
            -   Product name from the API should map to the name on the product model.
            -   MPN from the API should update the model number.
            -   Product description from the API should update the description on the product model.
            -   Model category should be updated with the product category referenced on the third-party category record.
            -   Product category should be updated with the product category referenced on the third-party category record.
            -   If there are values in the substitute products in the API, create the substitute product records between the current product model and the other product models.
            -   If there are values in the compatible products in the API, create the compatible product records between the current product model and the other product models.
            -   Product attributes from the API should be created or updated in the product attribute related list for the product model.
3.  If a product model is available, use the supplier part number to create or update the supplier products that are related to the product model.

### Third-party mapping

Use the following tables to perform the third-party category, model, and unit mappings:

-   Third-Party Categories: Stores all the third-party category records for the ShoppingHub administrator to map with internal existing model categories.
-   Third-Party Model Mappings: Stores all the mapping information between product models and third-party model categories.
-   Third-Party Units: Stores all the third-party unit records for the ShoppingHub administrator to map with supplier product units.
-   Third-Party Unit Mappings: Stores all the mapping information between product models and third-party units.

**Note:** A third-party integration product is auto-published when both the third-party category and third-party unit are mapped appropriately.

### Supplier product sales dates

A supplier product is discontinued and no longer published in the catalog when it has reached its sales end date. The **Sales start date** and **Sales end date** fields on the Supplier product form are populated through third-party integration from theCatalog API.

### Status tables

To know the status of the bulk product import request, make a REST call into the ServiceNow database using the Table REST API. The response from the API lists the records where the bulk import request failed. For bulk product import response, query the Catalog Error table with the following parameter:

`sysparm_query=outbound_error.supplier_id=<supplier_id>^outbound_error.state=20`

Details on the customer id, supplier id, error type, unique import set id, and state can be found in the Outbound Status table, which is the parent error table.

## Spendint API - POST /sn\_spend\_intg/spendint/price

Updates any pricing for supplier product records.

When pricing is available for supplier product records, the API uses the product SKU to find an existing supplier product. If a matching supplier product exists, the corresponding contract price is updated. If no matching supplier product is found, an error message is generated, stating that the product for which you are trying to update pricing for does not exist.

### Status tables

To know the status of the price import request, make a REST call into the ServiceNow database using the Table REST API. The response from the API lists the records where the price import request failed. For a price import response, query the Price Error table with the following parameter:

`sysparm_query=outbound_error.supplier_id=<supplier_id>^outbound_error.state=20`

You can find the details on the customer ID, supplier ID, error type, unique import set ID, and state can in the Outbound Status table, which is the parent error table.

## Spendint API - POST /sn\_spend\_intg/spendint/availability

Updates the availability for supplier product records.

When supplier product records are available, the API uses the product SKU to find an existing supplier product. If a matching supplier product exists, the corresponding **available\_units** field is updated. If no matching supplier product is found, an error message generates stating that the product for which you are trying to update availability for does not exist.

### Status tables

To know the status of the update availability request, make a REST call into the ServiceNow database using the Table REST API. The response from the API lists the records where the update availability request failed. For update availability response, query the Availability Error table with the following parameter:

`sysparm_query=outbound_error.supplier_id=<supplier_id>^outbound_error.state=20`

The details on the customer ID, supplier ID, error type, unique import set ID, and state can be found in the Outbound Status table, which is the parent error table.

## Spendint API - POST /sn\_spend\_intg/spendint/orderack

Updates order information for when a user shops for a product from a third-party catalog. When the user checks out, a purchase line is created so that approvals or other tasks for the purchase can be completed.

When a purchase order is generated in the ServiceNow database, the order is pushed into the following tables:

-   Outbound Order: Contains the order header.
-   Outbound Order Line: Contains the order lines.

Suppliers need to query these tables and fetch the orders that are pending against them. Suppliers should create a scoped app for Workflow Studio actions for integrating with the ServiceNow database.

Query the tables with the following parameters:

-   `sysparm_query=supplier_id=<supplier_id>^purchase_order.status=20 for header`
-   `sysparm_query=purchase_order.supplier_id=<supplier_id>^purchase_order.status=20 for header`

When a purchase line is converted to a purchase order line, the following processes are run:

1.  The purchase order and purchase order line are submitted to the Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\), if applicable.
2.  The purchase order and purchase order line are transferred through integration to the third party with the customer ID, supplier ID, purchase order number, order date, purchase order amount, purchase order amount currency, and purchase order lines.
3.  The purchase order and purchase order line remain in the Pending Submission state until confirmation messages are received by both the third-party catalog integration and the ERP. After confirmation is received, the state is updated to Ordered. If there is no ERP integration involved, a confirmation message is required only from the third-party integration.

### Status tables

To know the status of the order acknowledgment request, make a REST call into the ServiceNow database using the Table REST API. The response from the API lists the records where the order acknowledgment request failed. For an order acknowledgment response, query the Order Acknowledgment Error table with the following parameter:

`sysparm_query=outbound_error.supplier_id=<supplier_id>^outbound_error.state=20`

The details on the customer ID, supplier ID, error type, unique import set ID, and state can be found in the Outbound Status table, which is the parent error table.

## Spendint API - POST /sn\_spend\_intg/spendint/shipment

Use this endpoint to accept updates on purchases from third parties.

When you receive data, you must match the shipment data to a purchase order line by using the sales order line number. You can use the tracking number to find an existing shipment detail record that is related to the purchase order line. If no such record is found, create a new shipment detail record. If no purchase order or purchase order line exists for the shipment data, you see an error message that states that the purchase order for this shipment does not exist.

**Note:** If the purchase order and purchase order lines are in the Pending Submission status, and the sales order and sales order lines are not populated, then the shipment and invoice posting from the third-party reseller is not allowed. It is only allowed when the status of the purchase order and purchase order lines are Ordered. Also, there is no sequential restriction on shipment and invoice posting.

### Status tables

To know the status of the shipping request, make a REST call into the ServiceNow database using the Table REST API. The response from the API lists the records where the shipping update failed. To get a shipping response, query the Shipment Error table with the following parameter:

`sysparm_query=outbound_error.supplier_id=<supplier_id>^outbound_error.state=20`

The details on the customer ID, supplier ID, error type, unique import set ID, and state can be found in the Outbound Status table, which is the parent error table.

## Spendint API - POST /sn\_spend\_intg/spendint/invoice

Accepts invoices from third-party providers.

If the purchase order and purchase order lines are in the Pending Submission status, and the sales order and sales order lines are not populated, then the shipment and invoice posting from the third-party reseller is not allowed. It is only allowed when the status of the purchase order and purchase order lines are Ordered. Also, there is no sequential restriction on shipment and invoice posting.

After an invoice is submitted, the invoice and invoice lines are mapped to a purchase order. On a successful mapping, the state of the invoice is set as follows:

-   Awaiting Delivery: When no receipts exist, the order is partially delivered, or the invoice requires approval.
-   Invoice Confirmed: When the purchase order is delivered and the amount invoiced matches the purchase order total amount.
-   Requires Review: When the purchase order is delivered and the amount invoiced does not match the purchase order total amount.

When a valid invoice is posted for a line item, the same invoice cannot be updated.

If the provided invoice does not have a purchase order number, the invoice is rejected and you see an error message that states that one or more of the provided invoices does not have a purchase order number. If the provided invoice has a purchase order number, but it doesn't match the purchase order or no purchase order exists, you see an error message. The message states that one or more invoices do not have a corresponding purchase order that matches the purchase order number of the invoice. Also, if the amount invoiced sent from the third-party reseller does not match with the invoiced amount, the invoice is rejected.

### Status tables

To know the status of the invoice request, make a REST call into the ServiceNow database using the Table REST API. The response from the API lists the records where the invoice creation failed. For invoice response, query the Invoice Error table with the following parameter:

`sysparm_query=outbound_error.supplier_id=<supplier_id>^outbound_error.state=20`
