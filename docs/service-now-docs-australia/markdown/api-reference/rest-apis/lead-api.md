# lead API

The lead API provides endpoints that enable you to create, update, and query/retrieve marketing leads and their associated lead line items from an instance.

Use this API to integrate your instance with external websites and systems such as automated lead capture systems, or to provide lead information to external reporting systems.

This API is provided within the `sn_lead_mgmt_core` namespace. To access the API, the Lead Management Data Model \(sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\) plugin must be activated on the instance, and the calling user must have the sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core.lead\_integrator role.

For additional information on Lead Management, see [Using Lead Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/lead-management-using.md).

## Extending the Lead API

You can extend the lead API by overriding the methods in its associated script includes. The default API functionality is located in script includes ending in "OOB", such as LeadAPIProcessUtilOOB. To override this functionality, create methods with identical names and parameters in the script include that has the same file name, but doesn't end in "OOB", such as LeadAPIProcessUtil.

The following is a list of the script includes that you can override to change the behavior of the lead API:

-   [LeadAPIProcessUtilOOB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/LeadAPIProcessUtilOOBAPI.md): Contains methods that handle the retrieval and creation of lead and lead line item records.
-   [LeadApiValidationUtilOOB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/LeadAPIValidationUtilOOBAPI.md): Contains methods that validate the JSON request object for the POST and PATCH endpoints.
-   [LeadAPIHelperOOB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/server-api-reference/LeadAPIHelperOOBAPI.md): Contains API helper methods that:
    -   Return an array of leads and related lead line items.
    -   Return a JSON object from the associated GlideRecord.
    -   Remove all ignored fields from a JSON object and perform other transformations.
-   LeadAPIConstantsOOB: Contains constants, status codes, and messages for all API operations. It also includes the list of fields that are ignored by the POST and PATCH endpoints.

## lead - GET /sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core/lead

Retrieves all leads and associated lead line items based on the filter criteria passed in the query parameters.

This endpoint returns a paginated response as per the specified limit and offset. It retrieves information from the following tables:

-   Lead \[sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\_lead\]
-   Lead Line Item \[sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\_lead\_line\_item\]

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_lead_mgmt_core/{api_version}/lead`

Default URL: `/api/sn_lead_mgmt_core/{api_version}/lead`

**Note:** Available versions are specified in the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/use-REST-API-Explorer.md). For scripted REST APIs there is additional version information on the [Scripted REST Service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).

### Supported request parameters

<table class="rest_api_path_parameters"><thead><tr><th>

Name

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

api\_version

</td><td id="version-entry-RESTAPI">

Optional. Version of the endpoint to access. For example, `v1` or `v2`. Only specify this value to use an endpoint version other than the latest. Data type: String

</td></tr></tbody>
</table><table class="rest_api_query_parameters"><thead><tr><th>

Name

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sysparm\_fields

</td><td id="sysparm_fields_entry-RESTAPI">

Comma-separated list of fields to return in the response. Invalid fields are ignored.Data type: String

Default: Return all fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sysparm\_limit

</td><td>

Maximum number of records to return. For requests that exceed this number of records, use the **sysparm\_offset** parameter to paginate record retrieval. This limit is applied before ACL evaluation. If no records return, including records you have access to, rearrange the record order so records you have access to return first.

**Note:** Unusually large **sysparm\_limit** values can impact system performance.

Data type: Number

Default: 10000

</td></tr><tr id="row_sysparm_offset"><td>

sysparm\_offset

</td><td>

Starting record index for which to begin retrieving records. Use this value to paginate record retrieval. This functionality enables the retrieval of all records, regardless of the number of records, in small manageable chunks. For example, the first time you call this endpoint, **sysparm\_offset** is set to "0". To simply page through all available records, use `sysparm_offset=sysparm_offset+sysparm_limit`, until you reach the end of all records.

Don't pass a negative number in the **sysparm\_offset** parameter.Data type: Number

Default: 0

</td></tr><tr><td>

sysparm\_query

</td><td>

Encoded query used to filter the result set.For example:

`(sysparm_query=caller_id=javascript:gs.getUserID()^active=true)`

The encoded query supports order by. To sort responses based on certain fields, use the ORDERBY and ORDERBYDESC clauses in **sysparm\_query**. For example, `sysparm_query=active=true^ORDERBYnumber^ORDERBYDESCcategory` filters all active records and orders the results in ascending order by number first, and then in descending order by category.

If part of the query is invalid, such as by specifying an invalid field name, the instance ignores the invalid part. It then returns rows using only the valid portion of the query. You can control this behavior using the property **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows**. Set this property to true to return no rows on an invalid query.

**Note:** The **glide.invalid\_query.returns\_no\_rows** property controls the behavior of all queries across the instance, such as in lists, scripts \(GlideRecord.query\(\)\), and web service APIs.

## lead - PATCH /sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core/lead/\{sys\_id\}

Updates the specified lead record and its associated lead line items. You can also use this endpoint to associate new lead line items to the specified lead.

This endpoint updates information in the following tables:

-   Lead \[sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\_lead\]
-   Lead Line Item \[sn\_lead\_mgmt\_core\_lead\_line\_item\]

Rules for passed-in parameters:

-   Invalid parameter names are ignored.
-   Invalid values for non-mandatory choice and reference fields are ignored.
-   If field WRITE access is denied for one or more fields, the restricted fields are ignored.
-   You can't insert system field values using this API. Any provided values are ignored. System fields are a part of the ignored fields list, which is configurable.
-   The values of the parameters **account**, **contact**, and **consumer** are ignored if both the **account** and **consumer** parameters are non-empty.
-   Unless otherwise specified, the default value for all non-passed parameters is 'null'.

**Note:** This endpoint only modifies the specified parameters. If a parameter that exists in the current lead or lead line item record is not specified in the call, its contents remain unchanged.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_lead_mgmt_core/{api_version}/lead/{sys_id}`

Default URL: `/api/sn_lead_mgmt_core/{api_version}/lead/{sys_id}`
