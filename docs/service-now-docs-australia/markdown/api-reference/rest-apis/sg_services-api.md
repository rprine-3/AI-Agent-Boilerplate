# SG Services API

The SG Services API provides endpoints to create and manage application services and the upstream relationships between them.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

This API can only be used when the CMDB Application API and CLI \(sn\_service\_graph\) plugin is activated. This API is used within the `sn_service_graph` namespace.

Using this API does not require details regarding source tables or relationship types.

To script critical operations which support automation across the enterprise, you can leverage APIs or run command line operations that the CMDB Application CLI and API store app provide instead of using the user interface. The CMDB Application CLI and API store app provides a robust framework which consolidates all the APIs that are related to application services and the command lines that let you access the interface to those APIs.

CMDB Application CLI and API commands enable the following tasks:

-   Registering and creating an application service and establishing upstream relationships
-   Getting details of a given application service and its upstream relationships
-   Connecting higher level constructs such as business applications and business service offerings
-   Populating an application service with a given population type
-   Changing the state of an application service

For the command line solution, see [CMDB Application CLI and API available commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/cmdb-cli-commands.md).

## SG Services – POST /sg\_services/app\_service/convert

Converts a manual or empty type application service to a calculated application service. During conversion, the application service record moves into the \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_calculated\] table with the newly assigned class.

The following properties for identifying a CI take precedence as follows:

1.  sys\_id – If sys\_id, the system only uses the sys\_id and ignores any additional values.
2.  number – If provided without the sys\_id, the system only uses the number and ignores any additional values.
3.  &lt;IRE field name&gt; – The system only uses these values if the sys\_id or number are not provided.

### URL format

Versioned URL: `/api/sn_service_graph/{api_version}/sg_services/app_service/convert`

Default URL: `/api/sn_service_graph/sg_services/app_service/convert`

**Note:** Available versions are specified in the [REST API Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/use-REST-API-Explorer.md). For scripted REST APIs there is additional version information on the [Scripted REST Service form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/api-reference/rest-api-explorer/c_CustomWebServices.md).

## SG Services – POST /sg\_services/app\_service/populate

The following properties for identifying a CI take precedence as follows:

1.  sys\_id – If sys\_id, the system only uses the sys\_id and ignores any additional values.
2.  number – If provided without the sys\_id, the system only uses the number and ignores any additional values.
3.  &lt;IRE field name&gt; – The system only uses these values if the sys\_id or number are not provided.
