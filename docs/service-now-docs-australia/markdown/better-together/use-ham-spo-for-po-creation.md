</table>## Workflow for IT Asset Management and Sourcing and Procurement Operations better together feature

Using the IT Asset Management and Sourcing and Procurement Operations applications together provides the following benefits:

-   Create and manage external purchase by accessing the items from the Shopping Hub within the IT Asset Management application.
-   Manage all related receipts and shipments automatically and consistently across IT Asset Management and Sourcing and Procurement Operations applications.

\[Omitted image "itam-spo-bt-workflow.png"\] Alt text: ITSM-SPO better together flow

In this workflow:

1.  The procurement journey begins with one of the following events:
    -   An employee requests IT assets through the Service Catalog.
    -   An automated inventory stock order is generated based on stock rule configurations.
2.  The Procurement Manager checks whether the request can be fulfilled with items from local stock, by transferring items, or by placing an order.

3.  The Procurement Manager with the following roles can create a Purchase Order by accessing the items with or without a price from the Shopping Hub catalog to fulfill the service request.
    -   procurement\_admin or procurement\_user
    -   asset manager role \(sn\_spend\_asset.spo\_shopper\)
4.  After the Purchase Order is completed, the requested assets are received and delivered to the stockroom.
5.  In the IT Asset Management application, assets are created when you confirm receipt of the requested items. Depending on the type of the asset, one of the following asset records is created:
    -   For hardware or enterprise assets, a record is added to the Asset \[alm\_asset\] table.
    -   For software assets, an entitlement is created in the Software License \[alm\_license\] table.
    -   For consumable assets, an entitlement is created in the Consumable \[alm\_consumable\] table.
