## Workflow of advanced project risk assessment

Use Project Portfolio Management \(PPM\) and Advanced Risk Assessment \(ARA\) together for these benefits:

-   Monitor your risk exposure at the organization level
-   Integrate your risk management system for both project and enterprise risk teams.

The following figure shows an example workflow of how a project manager, risk specialist, and enterprise risk manager use the applications together to assess and mitigate risks both at the project and enterprise level.

In this workflow:

1.  The project manager creates risks from the standard library for the project and then initiates the risk assessment.
2.  The risk specialist assesses the risk and gives it an assessment score.
3.  If the risk score is high, the project manager elevates the risk as an enterprise risk.
4.  The enterprise risk manager assesses the risk from the enterprise perspective and gives it an assessment score.
5.  Based on the risk score, the project manager can convert the risk into an issue.
6.  The project manager and enterprise risk manager use risk heatmaps and risk overview dashboards to monitor risks and understand the overall risk posture of the organization.

## Requirements for Project Portfolio Management and Advanced Risk integration
