# Renew a contract

After you have created a contract or the contract has expired, you can renew the contract.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, contract\_manager\(core UI or Hardware Asset Workspace only\), sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin \(Enterprise Asset Workspace only\), or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager \(Enterprise Asset Workspace only\)

## About this task

-   When a contract is renewed, a new contract isn't created. Instead, the same contract is updated with renewal information.
-   The changes to the start date and end date of a contract is captured in the Contract History tab.
-   Contract information and history is retained when a contract is renewed. If the end date of the contract changes, the end date of any associated assets changes to match. You can renew a contract that meets the following conditions.
    -   **State** is **Active** or **Expired**
    -   **Substate** is **None** or **Rejected**
-   If the system property **sn\_contract\_enable\_renewal\_flow** is enabled, the contract renewal workflow is available for maintenance &amp; warranty contracts. For more information, see [Contract renewal workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/contract-management/cont-renew-wf.md).

## Procedure

1.  Open the list of contracts that are used across your deployment.

    -   If you are using the core UI, navigate to **Contract** &gt; **Contracts** &gt; **All**.
    -   If you are using the Hardware Asset Workspace, open the Contract management view and then select the **All contracts** tab.

        Alternatively, select the **Overview** tab of the Contract management view. In the Contract overview section, locate the Expiring contract widget to view the list of contracts that are expiring.

    -   If you are using the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Contract and lease management view and then select the **All contracts** tab.

        Alternatively, select the **Overview** tab of the Contract and lease management view. In the Contract overview section, locate the Expiring contract widget to view the list of contracts that are expiring.

2.  Select a contract in the **Active** or **Expired** state.

3.  Click **Renew**.

4.  On the Renew the Contract form \(core UI\) or dialog box \(Hardware Asset Workspaceand Enterprise Asset Workspace\), fill in the fields.
