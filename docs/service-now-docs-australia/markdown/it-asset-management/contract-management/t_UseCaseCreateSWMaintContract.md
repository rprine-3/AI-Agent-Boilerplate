# Create a software maintenance contract example

One common use case for the Contract Management application is creating a contract to track maintenance payments for enterprise software. You can use this example to learn how to create a software maintenance contract.

## Before you begin

Role required: contract\_manager or admin

The goal of this example is to create a contract that shows the total amount of maintenance that must be paid for the software application, independent of different license purchases made over time. The Software Asset Management plugin must be activated to use this example.

## Procedure

2.  Create a [software model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/product-catalog/c_Models.md), adding a **Name** and **Model Number**, and selecting the application model created in step 1.

3.  Create a new software entitlement by selecting the software model created in step 2.
