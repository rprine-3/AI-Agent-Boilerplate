## About this task

The active and valid assets from the contract that are being renewed are carried over to the new contract, and are listed in the Assets Covered tab. Valid hardware and enterpriseassets are the assets that are not removed from the contract before the end date, and are in the following states or substates:

-   State
    -   In stock
    -   In transit
    -   In maintenance
    -   In use
-   Substate
    -   Available
    -   Reserved
    -   Pending transfer
    -   None
    -   Pending repair
    -   Pending install

Invalid assets are not carried over to the draft contract and you must add them manually.
