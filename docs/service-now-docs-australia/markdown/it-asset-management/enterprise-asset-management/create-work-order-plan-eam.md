        1.  In the **Assignment group** field, select the assignment group.

            **Note:** To assign multiple work order tasks to the same assignment group, select the tasks and then select the assignment group.

        2.  \(Optional\) In the **Assigned to** field, select the technician to whom you want to assign the work order task.

            **Note:** All work order tasks must have an assignment group specified before you can complete this activity. The **Assigned to** field is optional; however, the schedule is populated for work order tasks in the Review schedule activity only when a technician is specified in the Assigned to field.

        3.  Select **Mark complete** to proceed to the next activity.
    2.  In the **Review schedule** activity, schedule the work order tasks.

        1.  -   To schedule a task manually, inline edit the **Scheduled start** field directly. The **Estimated end** field is automatically populated based on the Estimated work duration.
-   To schedule a task using the calendar view, the task must have a technician assigned in the Review assignments activity.

    -   Select **Calendar view** to schedule tasks visually by dragging the edges of a work order task to adjust the scheduled start and estimated end times.
    -   Reposition the task on the calendar view as needed.
    -   Double-click a work order task to open the corresponding record for detailed review.
    **Note:** Tasks appear in the calendar view only when assigned to a technician. If only an assignment group is specified, the task isn't displayed. The calendar view also displays active tasks from other work orders, maintenance plans, incidents, and ad hoc work orders.

        2.  Select **Ready for work** so that technicians can begin working on the work order tasks.

            **Note:** After you select **Ready for work**, the scheduled start and end times can't be modified.

        3.  Select **Mark complete** to proceed to the **Track status** activity.
6.  In the **Track status** activity, monitor the progress of the work order tasks.

    The following fields are updated automatically based on the technician's actions:

    -   **State**: Current state of the work order task.
    -   **Actual work start**: Date and time at which the technician started the task.
    -   **Actual work end**: Date and time at which the technician closed and completed the task.
    **Note:** Select **Calendar view** to get a visual overview of the scheduled work order tasks. The calendar view displays only tasks that are in the Work in progress state. Completed tasks aren't displayed.

    You can track the status of the work order tasks at any time through the associated work order plan.
