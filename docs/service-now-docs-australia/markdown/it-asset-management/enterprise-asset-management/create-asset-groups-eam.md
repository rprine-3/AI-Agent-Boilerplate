# Create an asset group in Enterprise Asset Management

Create asset groups to create a logical group of entities that includes assets, locations, and users.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin
-   sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager
-   sn\_eamfam.facility\_asset\_manager
-   sn\_eamhc.medical\_asset\_manager
-   sn\_otam.ot\_asset\_manager

## About this task

Asset groups can be used and created in the Enterprise Asset Workspace, Facility Asset Workspace, Medical Asset Workspace, and the Operational Technology \(OT\) Asset Workspace. This task specifically describes how to create an asset group in the Enterprise Asset Workspace.

After you create an asset group, you can create subgroups and add assets to the subgroups.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Workspace** &gt; **Enterprise asset estate** &gt; **Asset groups**.

    The Asset groups tab contains two subtabs:

    -   Asset groups: all the asset groups in your organization.
    -   Sites: equipment model entities that are picked up from the Equipment model \[cmdb\_ci\_ot\_isa\_entity\] table. The Equipment model table is a descendant of the Application Service CI \[cmdb\_ci\_service\_auto\] table.
    The Asset groups subtab is further classified into the following sites:

    -   Unassigned sites: sites not assigned to any asset group.
    -   Assigned sites: sites assigned to an asset group.
2.  Select **New** to open the Create New Asset group page.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    If you have the sn\_cmdb\_user role, you can further drill down by selecting the dependency map icon. For example, in the screenshot, select the dependency map icon on the Surgery Room 1 node to further drill down.
