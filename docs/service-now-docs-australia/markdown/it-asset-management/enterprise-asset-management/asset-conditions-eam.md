# Asset conditions in Enterprise Asset Management

Assessing the condition of assets in your organization aids in effective maintenance planning, resource allocation, and managing the asset life cycle.

## Overview of asset conditions

You need to evaluate assets based on specific conditions to ensure reliability. Asset health helps your organization in various ways:

-   Maximizes asset life.
-   Reduces unplanned downtime.
-   Improves operational effectiveness and safety.
-   Helps to comply with regulations and industry standards.

## Roles for asset conditions

The following are the two new roles added for the asset conditions feature:

-   Asset technician \(sn\_smart\_asmt.actor\) role added to the Enterprise technician \(sn\_eam.asset\_technician\) role
-   Asset manager \(sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_manager\) role added to the Enterprise asset manager \(sn\_eam.asset\_manager\) role

## Asset condition workflow

The asset condition workflow comprises of the following stages:

-   **Create condition templates**

    Create condition templates and associate condition attributes that you have defined to a condition template. Create questions and enable scoring in the templates to indicate whether the condition attributes for a model or asset passed or failed. For more details, see [Create condition templates for condition attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-condition-template-eam.md).

-   **Define condition attributes**

    Enterprise asset managers define condition attributes for evaluating models and assets. For more details, see [Define condition attributes on enterprise models and assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-condition-attribute-eam.md).

-   **Schedule condition evaluations**

    The Enterprise asset manager schedules evaluations via maintenance plans or work orders. For more details, see [Schedule condition evaluations for enterprise models or assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/schedule-condtion-evaluations.md).

-   **Perform condition evaluations**

    The technician performs the evaluation via the web interface or through the mobile application. Once the evaluation is complete, a score and a result are calculated. The Enterprise asset manager either accepts or rejects the evaluation. For more details, see [Perform condition evaluation from the Enterprise Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/perform-condition-assessment-webui.md) and [Perform condition evaluation from the Mobile Agent application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/perform-condition-assessment-mobileapp.md).

-   **View the evaluation reports**

    The Enterprise asset manager views the report for the evaluation. For more details, see [Review the asset condition results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/review-service-event-conditions.md).
