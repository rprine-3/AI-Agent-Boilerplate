</td></tr><tr><td>

Specific product model of the asset.**Note:** If you are creating a consumable asset, you can select any product model that meets the following criteria:

-   The Model type is set to Consumable.
-   The product model falls under the Enterprise good model \[sn\_ent\_model\] class or any of its child classes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Model category

</td><td>

Model grouping of the asset. Based on the model category selected, the asset can be linked to a configuration item.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Parent

</td><td>

Parent asset of the asset. When a parent link is defined, the fields related to assignment and state of the child assets is set to read-only and are populated based on the parent assignment and state fields.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Asset type

</td><td>

Type of multi-component asset. The following are the types of multi-component assets:-   Pre-assembled
-   User-assembled
-   Simple
-   Simple with add-on
-   Pre-assembled with add-on
-   User-assembled with add-on

</td></tr><tr><td>

Asset tag

</td><td>

Alphanumeric information assigned by your organization to help track the asset.

</td></tr><tr><td>

CI automatically created when this asset is created. The name that appears in this field is based on **Serial number** and **Model**. Point to the reference icon to see the configuration item details inherited from the asset record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Serial number

</td><td>

Serial number of this asset.

</td></tr><tr><td>

State

</td><td>

The current state of the asset. By default, the newly created asset is in **Build** state. Once you configure the asset and its components, you can change the status of the model. The other state options are:

-   **On order**
-   **In stock**
-   **In transit**
-   **In use**
-   **In maintenance**
-   **Retired**
-   **Missing**

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Quantity

</td><td>

Number of items this asset represents. An asset always has a quantity of one unless one or more of these points are true.-   It is a consumable. Quantity is unrestricted because consumables are tracked in groups.
-   It is pre-allocated. Quantity is unrestricted when **Model category** and **Model** are defined and **Substate** is set to **Pre-allocated**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Eligible for refresh

</td><td>

Indicates whether or not the asset is eligible for a refresh. If the date in the **Installed** field is in the past, this check box is shown. This check box is selected automatically two months before the number specified in the model's **Useful life \(months\)** field.

 When the `EAM- Calculate Asset Refresh Eligibility` weekly scheduled job runs, it calculates all of the assets that are eligible for refresh.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Location

</td><td>

Current physical location of the asset.

 **Note:** If you set the location to a specific building, floor, or place, the Enterprise Asset Management application automatically populates a corresponding location hierarchy of up to three levels, including the campus, building or structure, and floor that the asset is currently located in. The location hierarchy depicts the hierarchical relationship between the specified location and the corresponding parent locations. You can view the location hierarchy in the Location Hierarchy section of the asset record, which is generated after you fill in all fields and save the form.

If you remove the parent asset, the **RFID tag** field is cleared for this asset.
