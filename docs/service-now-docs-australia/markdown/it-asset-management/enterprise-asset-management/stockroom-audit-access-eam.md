# Stockroom audit access by role

Audit roles determine which stockrooms a user can view and audit. Depending on your application and assigned role, you may have access to all stockrooms or only personal stockrooms.

## Stockroom audit roles

|Role|Stockroom scope|Read|Write|Create|Delete|
|----|---------------|----|-----|------|------|
|sn\_itam\_common.personal\_stockroom\_audit\_user|Assigned personal stockrooms only|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|
|sn\_itam\_common.personal\_stockroom\_audit\_admin|Personal stockrooms only|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_user|All stockrooms|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|
|sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_admin|All stockrooms|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|

**Important:** Access to the Asset Audits \[sn\_itam\_common\_asset\_audit\] table is no longer granted through the inventory\_user role. Assign one of the new audit roles to users who require audit access.

## Role hierarchy

The audit roles are organized in the following hierarchy:

-   The sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_user role is contained within the sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_admin role.
-   The sn\_itam\_common.personal\_stockroom\_audit\_user role is contained within the sn\_itam\_common.personal\_stockroom\_audit\_admin role.

## Role assignments by application
