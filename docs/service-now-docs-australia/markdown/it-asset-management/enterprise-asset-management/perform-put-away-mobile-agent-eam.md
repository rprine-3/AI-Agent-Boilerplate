# Put away enterprise assets using the ServiceNow Agent application

Scan available assets in the inventory and perform asset put away in the designated scanned drop-off location.

## Before you begin

Role required: inventory\_user

## About this task

The inventory user can scan the available assets in the inventory and put them away in the scanned aisle-space in the stockroom. The Enterprise Asset Management application checks the existence of an active put away task for the asset and makes the required update in the Enterprise Asset Workspace.

-   If an active Asset put away task exists, the task is closed when the asset is placed in the designated stockroom location.
-   If an active Asset put away task doesn't exist for the asset, then a task is created and closed when the asset is placed in the designated stockroom location.

## Procedure

1.  From your mobile device, launch the Now Mobile Agent application.

2.  On the navigation bar, tap the **Asset put away** menu.
