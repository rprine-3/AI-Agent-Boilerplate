# Scheduled jobs and tables installed with normalization of firmware models

Scheduled jobs that run during the normalization of firmware models embedded into Operational Technology \(OT\) assets and tables that store firmware normalization details are installed with the OT Asset Management application.

<table id="table_knc_ytj_tdc"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Firmware Content Upload

</td><td>

-   Uploads data from the firmware tables to the CDS Client Staging \[cds\_client\_staging\] table.
-   Skips the upload if Content Data Service \(CDS\) hasn’t pulled all data.
-   Uses the Firmware configuration \[sn\_itam\_firmware\_configuration\] table to identify the firmware tables from which the content should be pushed.
-   Skips the upload if normalization hasn't run after the latest pull.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Firmware Content File Manager

</td><td>

Triggers during on-premise content import and export actions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Firmware – Daily Job

</td><td>

-   Sets the time when the data is pulled by the Content Data Service \(CDS\).
-   Sets current life-cycle phase of model life cycles.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Firmware – Apply latest content changes

</td><td>

Processes changes in the content tables after content pull.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Firmware - Generate Lifecycles

</td><td>

Updates firmware model records with the recently updated content life-cycle details. This is a weekly job.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Firmware Normalization

</td><td>

Normalizes firmware models using the newly downloaded content.
