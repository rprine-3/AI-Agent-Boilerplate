# View your subscription consumption for the Enterprise Asset Management for Data Center and Network Asset Management \(DCNAM\) application

Use the ITAM Licensing Resource Counts \[itam\_licensing\_resource\_counts\] table to gain insight into your subscription consumption for the Enterprise Asset Management for Data Center and Network Asset Management \(DCNAM\) application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin

## About this task

The EAM Populate Licensing Data scheduled job runs daily to generate subscription consumption information for the application. Any changes to your subscription consumption are reflected only after the next scheduled job runs.

## Procedure

2.  In the menu navigation filter, enter `itam_licensing_resource_counts_list.do`.

    The ITAM Licensing Resource Counts \[itam\_licensing\_resource\_counts\] table opens.

3.  In the table, locate all entries for the Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM application.

            Alternatively, right-click the Application column name.

        2.  Select an option to sort the applications in either ascending or descending alphabetical order.
            -   To sort the applications in ascending alphabetical order, select **Sort \(a to z\)**.
            -   To sort the applications in descending alphabetical order, select **Sort \(z to a\)**.
        You can then locate all entries for the Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM application.

    -   If you want to group the table by application, use the following steps:

        1.  Select the Column options icon \[Omitted image "configure-options-icon.png"\] Alt text:next to the Application column name.

            Alternatively, right-click the Application column name.

        2.  Select **Group By Application**.
        You can then expand the **Application: Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM** group to view all entries for the application.

    -   If you want the table to display only the Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM application, use the following steps:

        1.  On the table header, set the search filter to **Application**.
        2.  In the corresponding search box, enter `Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM`.
        3.  Press the Enter key.
        Alternatively, you can right-click the Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM application name in the table and then select **Show Matching**.
