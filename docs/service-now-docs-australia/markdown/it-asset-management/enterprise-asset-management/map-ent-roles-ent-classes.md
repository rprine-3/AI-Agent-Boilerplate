2.  Select **Roles-to-class access**

3.  Select the role record that you want o configure.

    The respective class access rules page opens. For example, if you select the Facility asset technician enterprise class access rules record, the Facility asset technician enterprise class access rules page opens.

4.  Select a model category from the **Additional model categories** list.

    The classes related to the model category appear in the **Class names**.

5.  Select **Save**.

    The role is now assigned to the classes that you selected. You need to now expose the model and asset tabs related to these classes by navigating to the Model and asset tabs in the Admin center.

6.  Select Model and asset tabs in the Admin center.

7.  Select the model category name, that you assigned to the role, to open the class tab configuration page.

8.  Select **Include in tab** and **Include in dialog box**.
