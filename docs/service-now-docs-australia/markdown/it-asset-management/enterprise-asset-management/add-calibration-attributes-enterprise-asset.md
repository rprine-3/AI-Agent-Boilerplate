# Add calibration attributes to an enterprise asset

Add calibration attributes to an enterprise asset to specify and manage the calibrations that are required for the asset throughout its life cycle.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## About this task

You can add calibration attributes at the individual enterprise asset level or at the enterprise model level. Alternatively, you can create common calibration attributes that are not associated with any enterprise assets or enterprise models. For details on how to add calibration attributes to an enterprise model, see [Add calibration attributes to an enterprise model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/add-calibration-attributes-enterprise-model.md). For details on how to create common calibration attributes, see [Create a calibration attribute library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eam-calibration-attribute-library.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Workspace**.

2.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Enterprise asset estate view.

3.  Select either the **All enterprise** tab or the tab for a specific enterprise asset category, such as **Facility assets**.

4.  From the list of available enterprise assets, select the enterprise asset that you want to add calibration attributes to.

5.  On the **Calibration attributes** tab of the enterprise asset record, select **New**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td><td>

Brief description of the calibration attribute.

</td><td>

Criticality level that indicates how important the calibration attribute is.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Service frequency

Frequency at which you must perform the calibration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Type of calibration.**Note:** The Enterprise Asset Management application includes default calibration categories such as Electrical, Flow, Humidity, and Pressure. You can create additional calibration categories for any calibrations that do not fall under the default categories. For detailed instructions, see [Create a calibration category for your enterprise asset calibrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eam-calibration-categories.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option that indicates if the calibration attribute is active.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order in which the calibration attribute applies to the enterprise asset. If your enterprise asset contains more than one calibration attribute, the attribute with the lowest numerical value applies to the asset first.**Important:** You must use a unique numerical value for each calibration attribute.

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

Calibration properties

</td></tr><tr><td>

Value type

</td><td>

Method by which you want to measure tolerance conformance. Select one of the following options:-   **Accuracy % full scale**: Fixed percentage of accuracy that your calibration measurements must fall within at any point within the enterprise asset's full measurement range. The corresponding tolerance limits remain the same at every point within the measurement range. For example, if a measurement range is 100 units and the accuracy percentage is set to ±1%, the tolerance limits are ±1 unit at every point within the measurement range.
-   **Accuracy % point**: Fixed percentage of accuracy that your calibration measurements must fall within at a specific point within the enterprise asset's full measurement range. The corresponding tolerance limits increase or decrease proportionally based on the value of the point that you are comparing your calibration measurement against. For example, if your accuracy percentage is set to ±1% and you want to compare your calibration measurement against a point that has a value of 50 units, the tolerance limits for this specific point are ±0.5 units. If you want to compare your calibration measurement against a point that has a value of 60 units, the tolerance limits increase to ±0.6 units.
-   **Range**: Measurement range that your calibration measurements must fall within. The corresponding tolerance limits are based on the lowest and highest acceptable point values within the range.
-   **Less than**: Value within the enterprise asset's full measurement range that your calibration measurements must fall below. The corresponding tolerance limit is based on the highest acceptable point value within the range.
-   **Greater than**: Value within the enterprise asset's full measurement range that your calibration measurements must lie above. The corresponding tolerance limit is based on the lowest acceptable point value within the range.
-   **True/false**: Option to assess any qualitative elements of the calibration.

</table>7.  Select **Save**.

    The form closes and you are automatically redirected to the new calibration attribute record.

8.  Specify the points at which you can measure tolerance conformance.

    **Important:** You must specify one or more points within the enterprise asset's measurement range. If you do not specify at least one point, the calibration attribute cannot be set to Active.

    1.  On the calibration attribute record, select **Add calibration points**.

        The Calibration points dialog box opens.

    2.  In the dialog box, fill in the fields.

</table>    3.  To add an additional point to the calibration attribute, select the Add Content icon \[Omitted image "add\_content\_icon.png"\] Alt text: and then fill in the fields.

        Repeat this step for each point that you want to add.

    4.  Select **OK**.

    The dialog box closes and the points appear on the **Calibration points** tab of the calibration attribute record.

9.  If your enterprise asset also contains calibration attributes at the enterprise model level, enable this enterprise asset level attribute to override an existing enterprise model level attribute.

    1.  On the calibration attribute record, select the **Details** tab.

    2.  In the Identification section of the **Details** tab, select the Search for Record icon \[Omitted image "search-icon.png"\] Alt text: next to the **Override** field.

        The Override dialog box opens.

    3.  In the dialog box, select the enterprise model level attribute that you want to override.

        The dialog box closes and you automatically return to the calibration attribute record.

    4.  Select **Save**.

    The enterprise model level attribute is removed from the **Calibration attributes** tab of the enterprise asset record.


## What to do next

Create work orders to track the calibrations that are made to your enterprise asset. These work orders must use a work order template with tasks that have a Work type of Calibration. For more information on work orders, see [Managing work orders for your enterprise assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-manage-wo-enterprise-assets.md).
