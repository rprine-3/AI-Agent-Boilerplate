# Replace aged enterprise assets

Replace aged enterprise assets by sourcing new enterprise assets.

## Before you begin

Role required: inventory\_user

## About this task

When refreshing enterprise assets, you don't have to manually update the asset records. When closing the enterprise asset refresh lines, the asset records and the assets are automatically updated. Close each task to go to the next task, complete the refresh, and reclaim the aged assets.

After sourcing the new assets, asset refresh is completed through the following stages:

-   Prepare asset task: Prepare the new asset before you hand it over to the user. For example, install any software that's required.
-   Schedule refresh task: Schedule a date to hand over the asset to the requester.
-   Deploy new asset: Hand over the asset to the requester or install the asset at the requester's location if necessary.
-   Reclaim aged asset: Collect the aged asset.

## Procedure

1.  Select the hardware asset refresh request.
