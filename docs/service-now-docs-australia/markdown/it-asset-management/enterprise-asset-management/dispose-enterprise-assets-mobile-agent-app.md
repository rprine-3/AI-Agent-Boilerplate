# Verify and depart your enterprise assets for disposal using the Mobile Agent application

Use the ServiceNow® Mobile Agent application to complete the verification and departure of any enterprise assets that you want to dispose of.

## Before you begin

Before you can complete the verification or departure of an enterprise asset, create a disposal order for that asset. See [Create a disposal order in the Enterprise Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eamdisposal-order.md) for detailed instructions.

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager
