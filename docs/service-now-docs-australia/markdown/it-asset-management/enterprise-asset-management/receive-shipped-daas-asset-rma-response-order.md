-   If you successfully received a defective DaaS asset from a customer for an off-site repair or replacement, a corresponding Evaluate RMA asset task is automatically generated.
-   If a customer successfully received a DaaS asset that you repaired, the RMA response order line moves to the Completed stage.

## What to do next

-   If you successfully received a defective DaaS asset from a customer for an on-site replacement, complete the corresponding inbound asset order to provide the customer with a new asset.
