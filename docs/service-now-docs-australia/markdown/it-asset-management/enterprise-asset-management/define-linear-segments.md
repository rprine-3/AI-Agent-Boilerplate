# Create segments for linear assets

Create segments for linear assets to assign work orders to the segments. You can also create maintenance plans for the segments.

## Before you begin

Linear segments are parts of a linear asset. When creating a linear segment, you must enter values for any two of the following fields and the value for the third field is populated automatically. For example, when you enter the start and end markers, the **Length** field is automatically filled in. Similarly, entering the start marker and length populates the **End marker** field.

-   Start marker
-   End marker
-   Length

If you enter start marker or end marker on the map, markers must be within 10 feet from the linear asset line. This value can be customized by changing the value of the asset\_property **com.eam.linear\_segment\_marker\_boundary**.

For details on creating work orders and maintenance plans, see [Create a work order for an enterprise asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eam-work-order.md) and [Create a maintenance plan for your enterprise assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eam-maintenance-plan.md).
