# Create life-cycle definitions for your firmware models

Manage the complete life cycle of firmware models by adding life-cycle information in the OT Asset Workspace.

## Before you begin

**Important:** The OT Asset Management application must be activated to access the OT Asset Workspace. For details, see [Install OT Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/install-otam.md).

Role required: sn\_otam.ot\_asset\_manager
