# Associate a third-party shipping carrier with an integration profile in the Enterprise Asset Workspace

Associate a third-party shipping carrier with an integration profile so that you can successfully connect to that shipping carrier.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin

## About this task

Each shipping carrier can be associated with only one active integration profile at a time. If any of your integration profiles are not already associated with a shipping carrier, you can view and take action on those integration profiles by using the Unmapped carrier profiles important action in the Inventory view of the Enterprise Asset Workspace.

## Procedure

1.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Asset operations view.

2.  From the left navigation menu of the Asset operations view, navigate to **Shipment** &gt; **Carrier integration profiles**.

3.  Select the integration profile that you want to associate a shipping carrier with.

4.  On the integration profile record, select the **Shipping Carriers** tab.

5.  Associate a shipping carrier with the integration profile.

    -   To associate an existing shipping carrier with the integration profile, use the following steps:
        1.  Select **Add**.

            The Add carriers dialog box opens.

        2.  In the dialog box, search for and select the shipping carrier that you want to associate with the integration profile.

            **Note:** The dialog box displays only the shipping carriers that aren’t already associated with an integration profile.

        3.  Select **Add**.
    -   To associate a new shipping carrier with the integration profile, use the following steps:
        1.  Select **New**.
        2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

            |Field|Description|
