Add a distribution channel to a stockroom so that you can link that stockroom with other geographically-related stockrooms. By linking your stockrooms, you can efficiently source and transfer assets between those stockrooms. You can also assign a rank to each linked stockroom to specify the order of stockrooms that you can source and transfer assets between.
