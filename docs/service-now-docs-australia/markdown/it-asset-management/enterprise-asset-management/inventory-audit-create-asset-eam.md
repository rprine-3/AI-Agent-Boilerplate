# Create an enterprise asset from the inventory audit screen

Create an enterprise asset record for the scanned asset that doesn't exist in your ServiceNow instance and that is detected when auditing inventory.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset, and sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_admin, or sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_user

## About this task

When scanning an asset in the inventory, if a new asset is detected that doesn’t exist in your ServiceNow® instance, you can create a record for it. You can add the asset directly from the audit screen in the ServiceNow Agent app.

**Note:** This procedure applies when you scan assets for a single scan audit record.

## Procedure

1.  From your mobile device, launch the ServiceNow Agent application.

2.  On the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, tap the **Enterprise Asset** tab.

3.  Select the stockroom or location audit record.

4.  Tap **Start audit**.

    **Note:** This button appears only for the location audit.

5.  Select **Scan**.

    The Asset scan page is displayed.

6.  In the **Asset tag/Serial number/Model barcode** field, enter or scan the asset tag, serial number, or model barcode of the asset.

7.  Tap **Next**.

8.  Select an **Aisle and space**.

9.  Select **Submit**.

    The List of assets and models screen is displayed.

10. Tap the three dots icon \[Omitted image "list-of-assets-and-models-three-dot-icon.png"\] Alt text:.

11. Tap **Create new asset**.

    \[Omitted image "list-of-assets-and-models-screen.png"\] Alt text: Create new asset

    The Create asset from audit screen is displayed.

12. On the form, fill in the following fields.

    | | |
    |---|---|
    |Model|The product model of the asset.|
    |Stockroom|The stockroom where the asset is available.|
    |State|The **State** field value is automatically set to **In stock**. Change this value as needed.|
    |Substate|The **Substate** field value is automatically set to **Available**. Change this value as needed.|
    |Asset Tag|Alphanumeric information assigned by your organization to help track the asset.|
    |Serial Number|Serial number of this asset.|
    |MAC address|MAC address of the mobile device|

    **Note:** Depending on the IRE rule configured for the selected **Model** field value, either **Asset Tag**, **Serial Number**, or **MAC address** field value is required to save the audit record.

    For more details on these field descriptions, see [Asset fields for enterprise assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/asset-fields-eam.md).

13. Tap **Submit**.

    A confirmation message is displayed on the screen, and the asset record is created.


## Result

In the audit results, the **New** field value is incremented for each new asset scanned in the inventory.
