# Buy out a leased enterprise asset

Buy out a leased enterprise asset before the corresponding lease contract expires.

## Before you begin

Before you can proceed with buying out a leased enterprise asset, you must complete the Planning task for the associated lease contract. See [Complete the Planning task for an expiring enterprise asset lease contract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/complete-leased-asset-planning.md) for detailed instructions.

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## Procedure

1.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Contract and lease management view.

2.  On the **Lease-end assets** tab, select the lease contract for the enterprise asset that you want to buy out.

    The lease contract record opens.

3.  Complete and close the Buyout task for the lease contract.

    To successfully complete and close this task, you must confirm a buyout date and amount with the asset vendor.

    1.  On the **Contract Asset Tasks** tab of the lease contract record, select the task number for the **Buyout** task.

        Alternatively, select the task number that is displayed in the **Current task** field of the lease contract record header.

        The Buyout task opens.

    2.  On the **Details** tab of the Buyout task, fill in the fields.

</table>    3.  Select **Close Task**.

        The Buyout task automatically closes with an updated state of Closed Complete.

4.  Complete and close the Buyout confirmation task for the lease contract.

    To successfully complete and close this task, you must pay the asset vendor the confirmed buyout amount on or before the confirmed buyout date.

    1.  On the **Contract Asset Tasks** tab of the lease contract record, select the task number for the **Buyout confirmation** task.

        Alternatively, select the task number that is displayed in the **Current task** field of the lease contract record header.

        The Buyout confirmation task opens.

        **Note:** Aside from the **State** field and the additional **Buyout confirmation** field, all editable fields in the Buyout confirmation task are pre-populated based on the corresponding fields that you filled out in the Buyout task. The **Purchase order** and **Purchase order line** fields are pre-populated with the purchase order and purchase order line that the Enterprise Asset Management application automatically created for the enterprise asset buyout in the [Planning task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/complete-leased-asset-planning.md).

    2.  In the Buyout details section of the **Details** tab, set the **Buyout confirmation** field to **Yes**.

        This field indicates if you bought out the enterprise asset successfully.

    3.  In the same section, select the Open Record icon \[Omitted image "open-record-icon.png"\] Alt text: in the **Purchase order** field.

        The purchase order record opens.

    4.  Select **Order**.

    5.  After the page reloads, select **Receive**.

        The form closes and you automatically return to the purchase order record, which now has a status of Received.

    6.  Close the purchase order record to return to the Buyout confirmation task.

    7.  On the Buyout confirmation task, select **Close Task**.

        The Buyout confirmation task automatically closes with an updated state of Closed Complete.


## Result

After you successfully buy out the enterprise asset, the **Date removed** field on the lease contract record automatically updates with the date on which you completed all buyout tasks. Following this date, you can no longer track the enterprise asset through this lease contract record.
