# Track assets using indoor maps in the Enterprise Asset Workspace

Use indoor maps to locate and track the enterprise assets, consumable assets, and pallets that are deployed across your organization. Each indoor map consists of an interactive interface that enables you to visualize where your assets are located within your campuses, buildings, floors, and places.

## Before you begin

To use indoor maps in the Enterprise Asset Workspace, you must fulfill all the requirements specified in [Indoor maps in Enterprise Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/indoor-maps-eam.md).

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## Procedure

1.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Enterprise asset estate view.

2.  Select the **Asset indoor map** tab.

    This tab contains an interactive map that enables you to view the real-time location of each enterprise asset, consumable asset, and pallet within a specific floor or place.

3.  Set the map to a specific floor by using the Campuses, Buildings, and Floors filters.

    By default, the map provides a high-level view of all campuses that are available across your organization. This default map view doesn’t display the locations of your assets. To view the locations of your assets, you must set the map to the floor that those assets are located in. To set the map to a specific floor, select the appropriate values in the Campuses, Buildings, and Floors filters.

4.  Specify the assets that you want the map to display the locations of.

    By default, the map displays the locations of all enterprise assets, consumable assets, and pallets that are deployed across your organization. If you want the map to display the locations of only certain assets, use the following steps:

    1.  Select the Filters Tab icon \[Omitted image "filters-tab-icon.png"\] Alt text: on the sidebar of the map.

    2.  In the Filter by window, use any of the following filters to narrow down the assets that you want to display the location of:

        -   **Department**: Department that the asset belongs to.
        -   **User**: User who the asset belongs to.
        -   **Model category**: Model category of the asset.
        -   **Classification**: Classification code that is assigned to the asset model.
5.  Change the format through which you view your asset locations by selecting a display option at the bottom-right corner of the **Asset indoor map** tab.

    The **Asset indoor map** tab supports the following display options:

    -   **Show map only** \(default display option\): Displays an interactive map that shows the locations of the assets within the specified floor.
    -   **Show list only**: Displays the list of assets that are located within the specified floor.
    -   **Show map and list**: Displays both the interactive map and the list of assets.
6.  Use the interactive map or the list of assets to view the real-time locations of assets within the specified floor or place in that floor.

    Select an asset from the map or list to view additional details about that asset.
