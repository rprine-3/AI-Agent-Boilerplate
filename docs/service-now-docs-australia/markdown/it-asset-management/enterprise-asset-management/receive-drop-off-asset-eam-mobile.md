# Verify the enterprise assets received through a Drop off task using the Mobile Agent application

As an asset manager, confirm that you received the enterprise assets that were delivered to your stockroom and complete the Receive task using the Mobile Agent application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## Procedure

1.  From your mobile device, launch the Mobile Agent application.

2.  On the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, tap the **My Tasks** tab.

    The home screen of the My Tasks application opens, showing you a list of your assigned tasks.

3.  Tap the Receive drop off task that you want to verify and complete.

    The Details tab shows the following fields:

    -   **Expected**: The number of assets that are expected to be received.
    -   **Received**: The number of assets that have been scanned and received.
    -   **Not received**: The number of assets that couldn't be received.

        **Note:** Before you start working on the task, the **Expected** and **Not received** fields will show the same number of assets.

4.  Tap **Start work**.

    On the **Details** tab, the **Start work** link changes to **Start timer**, **Scan**, and **Close Task** automatically.

5.  Scan the enterprise assets that you physically received at your stockroom.

    1.  Tap **Scan**.

    2.  Provide the asset tag information.

        Follow any of these steps for each enterprise asset that you received at your stockroom:

        -   Scan the asset tag of the enterprise asset that you received using the camera on your mobile device.
        -   Enter a value in the **Asset tag** field and tap the Enter key on the keyboard of your mobile device.
        The enterprise assets are automatically added to the **Review** tab.

6.  Acknowledge the receipt of the enterprise assets that you scanned.

    1.  Tap **Receive**.

        The Receive screen opens and the **Asset tag** field displays the count of assets that you scanned.

    2.  Tap **Submit**.

    The **Received** field in the Details tab shows the count of assets that you received.

    When you receive all the enterprise assets, the value in the **Expected** field matches the value in the **Received** field.

7.  After receiving all the enterprise assets, tap **Close Task**.


## Result

The state of the Receive drop off task and the associated Drop off task changes to **Closed Complete**.
