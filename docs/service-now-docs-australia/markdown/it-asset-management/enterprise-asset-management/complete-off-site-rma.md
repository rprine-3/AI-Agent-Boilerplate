</table>    3.  Select **Close Task**.

    The Receive task automatically closes with an updated state of Closed Complete.


## Result

The RMA order line moves to the **Completed** stage.

If the asset vendor successfully replaced the defective enterprise asset with a new one, the **Details** tab of the RMA order line automatically updates with information about the new enterprise asset, including the name, model, and stockroom of the asset. In addition, the Enterprise Asset Management application automatically retires the defective enterprise asset, triggering the **State** and **Substate** fields to change to **Retired** and **Vendor credit** in the corresponding asset record.

If the asset vendor successfully repaired the defective enterprise asset, the **State** and **Substate** fields change to **In stock** and **Available** in the corresponding asset record.

If the asset vendor rejected the RMA, the defective enterprise asset remains in the In stock state and Pending repair substate. You must submit a new RMA order to take additional action on the asset.

## What to do next

Complete the RMA process for any remaining RMA order lines within the RMA order. After all RMA order lines reach the Completed stage, the RMA order is closed.
