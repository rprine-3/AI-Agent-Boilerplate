# Create enterprise models

Create a model based on a top tier Enterprise Asset Management model category. Use models to manage and keep track of your assets.

## Before you begin

You can create a model based on any of the following Enterprise Asset Management model categories:

-   Construction
-   Medical
-   Transportation
-   Industrial
-   Facility
-   Retail
-   Tactical equipment
-   Wearable
-   Multimedia production equipment
-   Pallet

**Note:** Only consumables created from models in the Enterprise Asset Management application can be used if the **Asset strategy tracking** for the model is set to **create consumable asset**.

**Note:** The Enterprise Asset Management application supports only facilities models that fall under the Facility model \[sn\_ent\_facility\_model\] child class of the Enterprise good model \[sn\_ent\_model\] class. The application does not support facilities models that are listed in the Facility Models \[cmdb\_facility\_product\_model\] table.

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterptrise\_asset\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Enterprise Asset Workspace** &gt; **Enterprise model management**

2.  Select the tab for the model type that you want to create.

    -   Select the **All enterprise** tab for all available enterprise model types.
    -   Select the tab for a specific enterprise model type, such as **Facility**, **Industrial**, **Medical**, **Retail**, or **Transportation**.
    -   Select the **All models** tab for pallet models.
3.  Select **New**.

    If you are creating a pallet model, select **New pallet model**.

    If you select **New** on any tab other than the **All models** tab, a dialog box opens, prompting you to specify the type and category of the new model that you are creating. Proceed to [step 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-model-eam.md) to fill in the fields in the dialog box.

    If you select **New pallet model** on the **All models** tab, you are automatically redirected to the Create New Product Model page. Proceed to [step 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-model-eam.md) to fill in the fields on the page.

4.  In the dialog box, fill in the fields.

    For a detailed description of the fields, see [Model fields for Enterprise Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/eam-model-fields.md).

7.  Select **Save**.

    The model is created along with the related tabs such as **Model Components**, **Assets**, **Enterprise Model Lifecycles**, **Compatibles**,**Substitutes**, and **Vendor Catalog Items**. You can perform additional configuration on the model by entering details in the related tabs.

8.  Change the status of the model to **In Production** once you are done configuring the model.

9.  Select **Publish to Enterprise Asset Catalog** to publish your model to the Service Catalog.**Publish to Enterprise Asset Catalog** appears only when you change the status of the model to **In Production**.

    Enterprise models can be deleted only by the sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin role.

10. You may select **Update risk** if you updated the model's risk scores and want to propagate the updated scores to the associated assets too.

    After the **EAM - Update model risk values to asset** scheduled job is completed, the risk values for all the assets associated with this model is updated.
