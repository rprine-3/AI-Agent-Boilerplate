# Close an enterprise asset reclamation request

Close an asset reclamation request to efficiently reclaim enterprise assets when an employee leaves an organization or moves to a different role.

For each reclaimed asset, an Enterprise Asset Reclamation Line is created. You must close all the tasks of a Enterprise Asset Reclamation Line to close the Enterprise Asset Reclamation Line. Once all Enterprise Asset Reclamation Lines are closed, the Asset Reclamation Request is closed.
