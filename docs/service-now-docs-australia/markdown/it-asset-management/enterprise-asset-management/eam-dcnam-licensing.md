# Enterprise Asset Management for Data Center and Network Asset Management \(DCNAM\) licensing

The Enterprise Asset Management for Data Center and Network Asset Management \(DCNAM\) application supports a unit-based subscription licensing model in which you must pay a recurring fee for assets to use the application. You can determine the licensing requirements and costs for these assets based on their resource categories and corresponding subscription unit ratios.

Resource categories group specific types of assets together and enable them to use the features and workflows of an application. Each resource category is associated with a corresponding subscription unit ratio, which you can use to group the given assets against a standardized cost. You can use this information to determine the total licensing requirements and costs for assets within each resource category. For example, a ratio of 25:1 indicates that one subscription is required for every 25 assets within a given resource category. If one subscription costs $100 and you have 50 assets within that resource category, you must purchase two subscriptions for a total of $200.

The Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM application supports the following resource categories.

**Note:** These resource categories are automatically enabled when you activate the Enterprise Asset Management for DCNAM application on your ServiceNow instance.
