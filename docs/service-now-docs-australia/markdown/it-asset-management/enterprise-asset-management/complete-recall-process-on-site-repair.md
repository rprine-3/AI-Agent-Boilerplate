# Complete the recall process for an enterprise asset through an on-site repair

Perform all tasks that are required for an on-site repair so that you can complete the recall process for an enterprise asset that has been recalled by the asset vendor.

## Before you begin

Before you can proceed with repairing a recalled enterprise asset on-site, you must complete the Prepare task for that asset. See [Complete the Prepare task for a recalled enterprise asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/complete-prepare-task-recall-order.md) for detailed instructions.

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager or enterprise\_asset\_technician

## Procedure

1.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Inventory view.

2.  Select the **Recall orders** tab.

3.  From the list of available recall orders, select the recall order that you want to complete.

    The recall order record opens.

4.  On the **Recalled Assets** tab of the recall order record, select the enterprise asset that you want to repair.

    The recalled asset record opens.

5.  Complete and close the On-site Repair task for the recalled enterprise asset.

    To successfully complete and close this task, you must repair the recalled enterprise asset on-site.

    1.  On the **Recall Tasks** tab of the recalled asset record, select the task number for the **On-site Repair** task.

        Alternatively, select the task number that is displayed in the **Current task** field of the recalled asset record header.\[Omitted image "current-task-recall-orders.png"\] Alt text: Current task field.

        The On-site Repair task opens.

    2.  On the **Details** tab of the On-site Repair task, fill in the fields.

    3.  Close the On-site Repair task.

        You can either close the On-site Repair task for only the specified enterprise asset or bulk update and close the On-site Repair task for multiple enterprise assets.

        If you want to close the On-site Repair task for only the specified enterprise asset, select **Close Task**.

        If you want to bulk update and close the On-site Repair task for multiple enterprise assets, select **Include more assets**. When the Select assets for bulk update dialog box opens, select the check box for each enterprise asset that you want to bulk update and close the On-site Repair task for. Select **Close Task** to close the dialog box and return to the On-site Repair task.

        **Important:** You can bulk update the On-site Repair task only for enterprise assets that have the same task name, state, assignment group, and assigned to user.

        The On-site Repair task automatically reloads with an updated state of Closed Complete.


## Result

The recalled asset record moves to the Completed stage. In addition, the state and substate fields change to In stock and Available in the corresponding asset record.

## What to do next

Complete the recall process for all remaining enterprise assets that are included in the recall order. After all corresponding recalled asset records reach the Completed stage, the state of the recall order changes to Completed.
