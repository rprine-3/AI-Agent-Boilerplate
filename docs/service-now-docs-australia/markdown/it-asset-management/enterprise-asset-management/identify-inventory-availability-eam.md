# Identify suitable replacement options for assets in the Enterprise Asset Workspace

Use the Inventory availability report to determine suitable replacement options for your assets and their child components that are in use, in maintenance, pending repair, or defective. The report also helps you to determine the quantity of available substitute models that can be used locally, moved through the distribution channels, and estimate the lead time for new purchases.

## Before you begin

The Inventory availability report is available only for enterprise, consumable, and bundle assets that are in use, in maintenance, pending repair, or defective.

Service locations and distribution channels should be configured for the stockroom. If the asset's location is a service location of a stockroom, it automatically becomes the local stockroom. A location can have multiple local stockrooms if it is serviced by more than one stockroom. For more details, see [Add a distribution channel to a stockroom in the Enterprise Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/add-distribution-channel-eam-stockroom.md) and [Add service locations to a stockroom in the Enterprise Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/add-service-location-eam-stockroom.md).

## About this task

The Inventory availability report helps you to identify the best sourcing option when sourcing parts for assets or its components that are in use and nearing the end of their life, defective, or pending repair. Additionally, you can check how much stock is currently available at a stockroom.

2.  Select the asset for which you want to view the replacement assets available in the local and remote stockrooms.

3.  Select the **Inventory availability** tab.
