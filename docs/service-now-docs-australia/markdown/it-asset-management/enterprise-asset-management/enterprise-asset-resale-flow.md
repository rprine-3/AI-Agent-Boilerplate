# Create an asset resale flow

Create an asset resale flow for an asset to be resold in order to reduce waste and save cost.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## About this task

The asset vendor must confirm which assets can be resold and how much they are worth.

Only assets that are in a non-terminal state, which is any state in which the asset can transition into a different state, can be resold through a enterprise resale order. Each asset must also be associated with either an enterprise model or pallet model. You can add simple assets; multi-component assets, which include pre-assembled and user-assembled assets; and pallet assets with children to an enterprise resale order.

**Note:** If you are adding a pallet asset with children to a resale order, any changes that you make to the pallet asset are automatically applied to all child assets.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the **Service Catalog** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Lifecycle**.

2.  Select Enterprise Resale Order.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
