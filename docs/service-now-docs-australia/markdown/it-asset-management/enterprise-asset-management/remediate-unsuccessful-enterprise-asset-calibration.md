# Remediate an unsuccessful enterprise asset calibration

Remediate a failed enterprise asset calibration event by initiating a new work order and corresponding work order tasks for that event.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Workspace**.

2.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Work management view.

3.  Select the **Calibrations and conditions** tab.

4.  In the Calibration overview section, select either the **All calibration events** widget or the **Calibration pending verification** widget.

5.  From the list of available calibration events, select the event that you want to remediate.

    The corresponding service event record opens.

6.  Initiate the creation of a new work order by selecting **Remediate**.

7.  In the Select template to begin remediation dialog box, search for and select the template that you want to apply to the new work order.

    **Note:** The dialog box lists only the work order templates that have at least one work order task with a Work type of Calibration.

8.  Select **OK**.

    The dialog box closes and you are automatically redirected to the Create New Work Order form. The form is auto-populated with the following information:

    -   The asset that you want to calibrate
    -   The location of the asset
    -   The original work order
    -   All other mandatory fields
9.  Fill out any additional fields in the Create New Work Order form and then select **Save**.

    See [Create a work order for an enterprise asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eam-work-order.md) for a detailed description of each field.

10. Add additional work order tasks to the new work order.

11. Create a checklist of all items that must be completed for the new work order or the associated work order tasks.

12. Specify any upstream or downstream dependencies for the associated work order tasks.
