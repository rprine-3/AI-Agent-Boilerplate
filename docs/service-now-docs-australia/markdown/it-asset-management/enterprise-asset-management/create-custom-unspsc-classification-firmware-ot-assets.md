# Create a custom United Nations Standard Products and Services Code \(UNSPSC\) classification for firmware in your operational technology \(OT\) assets

If the UNSPSC classification for any firmware that is embedded into your OT assets isn't already represented in the Enterprise Asset Management Content Service, create a custom UNSPSC classification.

## Before you begin

**Important:** You can create custom UNSPSC classifications only using the OT Asset Workspace. To use the OT Asset Workspace, install the OT Asset Management application on your ServiceNow instance. See [Install OT Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/install-otam.md) for detailed instructions.

You can use the UNSPSC to classify the firmware that is embedded into your industrial- and hardware-based OT assets.
