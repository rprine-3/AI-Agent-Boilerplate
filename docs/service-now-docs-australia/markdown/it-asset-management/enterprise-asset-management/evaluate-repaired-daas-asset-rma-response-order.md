## Result

-   The Evaluate asset task closes with an updated state of Closed Complete.
-   If you set the **Evaluation result** field to **Redeployable** and you performed an on-site repair, the RMA response order line moves to the Completed stage. The customer can redeploy the asset at any time.
-   If you set the **Evaluation result** field to **Redeployable** and you performed an off-site repair, a corresponding Ship task is automatically generated.

## What to do next

-   If you set the **Evaluation result** field to **Redeployable** and you performed an off-site repair, complete the corresponding Ship task by shipping the repaired asset back to the customer so that it can be redeployed. For detailed instructions, see [Complete the Ship task for a defective Device as a Service DaaS asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/ship-daas-asset-rma-response-order.md).
-   If you set the **Repair result** field to **Unrepairable**, the customer must dispose of the asset. For detailed instructions, see [Create a disposal order in the Enterprise Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eamdisposal-order.md).
