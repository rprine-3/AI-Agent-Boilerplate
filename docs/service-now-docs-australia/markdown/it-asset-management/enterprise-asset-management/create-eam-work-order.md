# Create a work order for an enterprise asset

Create a work order to track and manage work for an enterprise asset, linear asset, linear segment, or asset group.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## About this task

**Note:** Starting with Enterprise Asset Management version 10.0, work orders can be created for asset groups, enabling technicians to execute a single work order for an entire group of related assets.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Workspace** &gt; **Work management**.

2.  On the **Work orders** tab, select **New**.

    **Note:**

    If you created a maintenance plan to manage and schedule maintenance for your enterprise assets, the Enterprise Asset Management application automatically creates a corresponding work order for each asset to which the maintenance plan is applied.

    For more information on maintenance plans, see [Create a maintenance plan for your enterprise assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-eam-maintenance-plan.md).

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

 To apply a template to a work order in the draft state and view the work order tasks and part requirements generated from the template, the sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager role must ensure that the **Apply Work Order template in draft status** field in the Field Service Management application is enabled. To accomplish this, navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Configuration** and enable the **Apply Work Order template in draft status** field in the **Business Process** tab.
