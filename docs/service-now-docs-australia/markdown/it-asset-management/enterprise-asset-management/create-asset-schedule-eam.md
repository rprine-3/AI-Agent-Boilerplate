# Map enterprise assets to an operational schedule

Create an asset schedule to map the enterprise assets to an operation schedule.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin

## About this task

An asset schedule record is stored in the Asset schedule policy \[sn\_asset\_cmn\_schdule\_policy\] table.

**Note:** If an asset isn't associated with an operational schedule, the Default asset schedule \(24 hours, 7 days a week or 24/7\) will be applied.

The **Asset performance - Map schedule policies** job runs weekly to sync the mapping between assets and the operational schedule.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Workspace** &gt; **Admin center** &gt; **KPI configuration**.

2.  From the KPI configuration list, select **Asset schedules**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
