To view this heat map, ensure that the band score records in the Risk Score module are frozen.**Note:** If risk likelihood, risk impact, and risk score are not frozen, the heat map is rendered in a draft mode with no risk values in the model record. If only one of these vectors is frozen, the heat map is not rendered. If all three vectors are frozen, the heat map is rendered in a production mode and the risk values are populated in the model record.
