# Create an enterprise asset in the Mobile Agent application

Use the ServiceNow® Mobile Agent application to create a serialized or multi-component enterprise asset.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## About this task

**Important:** The enterprise assets that you create through the Mobile Agent application can be associated only with enterprise models that are classified through the Enterprise good model \[sn\_ent\_model\] class within the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) class hierarchy. See [Expanded Model and Asset Classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/enterprise-model-asset-classes-app.md) for more information on enterprise model classes.

## Procedure

1.  From your mobile device, launch the Mobile Agent application.

2.  On the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, tap the **Enterprise Asset** tab.

    The navigation bar displays tabs for the ServiceNow applications and applets that you have access to through the Mobile Agent application. The navigation bar also displays tabs for your Mobile Agent application settings and notifications.

    The home screen for the Enterprise Asset Management application opens.

3.  Tap **Create Asset**.

    The Serial Number screen opens.

4.  If your enterprise asset contains a serial number, scan or enter the serial number to verify if the asset already exists.

    If you want to skip this verification, tap the back arrow at the top left corner of the screen to proceed directly to the Create Asset form. You can then proceed either to [step 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-enterprise-asset-mobile-agent-app.md) to verify the asset existence based on asset tags or to [step 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-enterprise-asset-mobile-agent-app.md) to skip both verifications and continue with the asset creation process.

    1.  Use the camera on your mobile device to scan the serial number.

        You can also enter the serial number manually in the **Serial Number** field.

    2.  Depending on whether the enterprise asset exists or not, proceed with one of the following options:

        -   If the enterprise asset already exists, verify the asset details in the corresponding asset record:
            1.  Return to the home screen for the Enterprise Asset Management application.
            2.  Tap **Asset lookup**.

                The Asset lookup screen opens.

            3.  Use the camera on your mobile device to scan the asset tag of the enterprise asset.
            4.  Tap **Submit**.

            5.  From the list of corresponding asset records, tap the asset record through which you want to verify the asset details.

                The asset record opens.

            6.  Verify all asset details for the given enterprise asset.
            7.  Update any asset details if needed.

5.  If your enterprise asset contains an asset tag, scan the asset tag or enter the asset tag value to verify if the asset already exists.

    If you want to skip this verification, proceed directly to [step 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/create-enterprise-asset-mobile-agent-app.md) to continue with the asset creation process.

            2.  Tap **Asset lookup**.

                The Asset lookup screen opens.

            3.  Use the camera on your mobile device to scan the asset tag of the enterprise asset.
            4.  Tap **Submit**.

                The list of corresponding asset records opens.

            5.  Tap the asset record through which you want to verify the asset details.

    1.  On the Create Asset form, tap the **Serial Number** field.

        The Serial Number screen opens.
