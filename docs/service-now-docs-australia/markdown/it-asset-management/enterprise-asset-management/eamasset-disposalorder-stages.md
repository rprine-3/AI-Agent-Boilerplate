# Enterprise asset disposal order stages

An enterprise asset disposal order goes through various stages in the disposal process before it’s completed. With each stage, the task that's associated with that stage changes too.

Closing a task in the asset disposal process completes that task and automatically creates the next task in the process. For example, after you close the Schedule Pickup task, the state for that task changes to Closed Complete and the next task, Asset Departure, is created. This process continues until you close all the tasks required for disposing of the selected assets. After you close all the tasks, the disposal order is completed.
