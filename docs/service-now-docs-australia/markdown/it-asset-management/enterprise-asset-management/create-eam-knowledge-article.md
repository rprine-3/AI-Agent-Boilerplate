</td></tr><tr><td id="d236030e124">

**Valid to**

</td><td>

The date this knowledge article expires. Articles don’t appear in search results after the Valid to date or if the Valid to date is empty.

 The default value of the this field is derived from the **Article Validity** field configured for the knowledge base. The Valid to date starts from the date that the article was created until the number of days specified in the **Article Validity** field. If the **Article Validity** field is empty, the default date in the **Valid to** field for the knowledge article is set to January 1, 2100.

 An article author or editor can select whether to keep or change the default Valid to date.

 On the first day of each month, the application sends an email notification to a list of authorized recipients to remind them about articles that are expire in the next month. The recipient can then extend the Valid to date to continue using the article.

**Note:** If the system date format or user preferences is set to use `yy` year format, you might face issues when the Valid to date is set to the default date. Contact your administrator or modify the user preferences to use a date format with the `yyyy` year format.
