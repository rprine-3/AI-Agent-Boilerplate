# Request an enterprise asset refresh

Use the Enterprise Asset Refresh flow to track the assets that are nearing the end of their life cycle and replace them with new assets.

## Before you begin

Role required: inventory\_user

## About this task

When assets get old, their maintenance costs and risks of failure increase, while their performance decreases. You can choose to replace old assets with the same or different models of newer assets. After your Enterprise Asset Refresh request is approved, the Enterprise Asset Refresh flow takes you through sourcing and triggers the Enterprise Asset Refresh Line flow. The Enterprise Asset Refresh Line flow uses Refresh Line tasks to take you through the steps of preparing the new asset, scheduling it for delivery, deploying it, and reclaiming the aged asset.

The Workflow Studio application is used to create the Enterprise Asset Refresh flow and the Enterprise Asset Refresh Line flow.
