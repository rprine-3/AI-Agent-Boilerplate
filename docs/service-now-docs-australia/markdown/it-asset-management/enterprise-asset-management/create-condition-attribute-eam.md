# Define condition attributes on enterprise models and assets

Define the conditions to be inspected on enterprise models and assets throughout their life cycle.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## About this task

Once condition attributes are defined on an enterprise model, all the assets for that models inherit the condition attributes.

Before defining condition attributes, create a condition template from the Admin center view. You can also create condition templates while defining condition attributes from the enterprise asset or enterprise model page.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Workspace**.

2.  Navigate to either of the two views.

    -   Enterprise asset estate: For adding condition attributes to an asset.
    -   Enterprise model management: For adding condition attributes to a model.
3.  Select either the **All enterprise** tab or the tab for a specific model or asset category, such as Construction.

4.  From the list of available enterprise models or assets, open the enterprise model or asset that you want to define the condition attributes on.

5.  Select **New** on the Condition attributes related list.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.
