# Complete the shipment for a moving enterprise asset

Perform all tasks that are required to ship an enterprise asset. You must perform these tasks if you set the **Move type** field to **Ship** in an enterprise move line.

## Before you begin

Before you can proceed with the shipment, you must complete the Prepare task for the enterprise asset. See [Complete the Prepare task for a moving enterprise asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/complete-prepare-task-moving-enterprise-asset.md) for detailed instructions.

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager, sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin, or enterprise\_asset\_technician

## Procedure

1.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, navigate to **Asset operations** &gt; **Moves** &gt; **Move orders**.

2.  From the list of available move orders, select the move order that you want to complete.

    The move order record opens.

3.  On the move order record, select the **Enterprise move lines** tab.

4.  From the list of available enterprise move lines, select the enterprise move line for the enterprise asset that you want to move.

    The enterprise move line record opens.

    To successfully complete and close this task, the enterprise asset must be shipped to the target location.

    1.  On the **Enterprise move tasks** tab, select the task number for the **Ship** task.

        Alternatively, select the task number that is displayed in the **Current task** field of the enterprise move line record header.

        The Ship task opens.

    2.  On the **Details** tab of the Ship task, fill in the fields.
