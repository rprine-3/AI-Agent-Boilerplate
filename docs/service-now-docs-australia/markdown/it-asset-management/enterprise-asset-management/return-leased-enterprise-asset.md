# Return a leased enterprise asset

Return a leased enterprise asset to the asset vendor before the corresponding lease contract expires.

## Before you begin

Before you can proceed with returning a leased enterprise asset, you must complete the Planning task for the associated lease contract. See [Complete the Planning task for an expiring enterprise asset lease contract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/complete-leased-asset-planning.md) for detailed instructions.

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

**Note:** The sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_technician role can also perform the Collection, Preparation, and Shipment tasks. However, this role can perform these tasks only through the **Lease-end tasks** Quick links card that is available on the Enterprise asset overview.

## Procedure

1.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Contract and lease management view.

2.  On the **Lease-end assets** tab, select the lease contract for the enterprise asset that you want to return.

    The lease contract record opens.

3.  Complete and close the Collection task for the lease contract.

    To successfully complete and close this task, you must collect the enterprise asset that you want to return.

    1.  On the **Contract Asset Tasks** tab of the lease contract record, select the task number for the **Collection** task.

        Alternatively, select the task number that is displayed in the **Current task** field of the lease contract record header.
