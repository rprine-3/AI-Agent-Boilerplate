# Complete a single scan enterprise asset inventory audit using the ServiceNow Agent app

Scan your inventory assets by using the ServiceNow Agent app for single scan audit records.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin, sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager, sn\_eam.asset\_technician, sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_user, or sn\_itam\_common.asset\_audit\_admin

## Procedure

1.  From your mobile device, launch the ServiceNow Agent application.

2.  On the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, tap the **Enterprise Asset** tab.

3.  Select the stockroom or location audit record.

4.  Tap **Start audit**.

    **Note:** This button appears only for the location audit.

5.  Select **Scan**.

    The Asset scan page is displayed.

6.  In the **Asset tag/Serial number/Model barcode** field, enter or scan the asset tag, serial number, or model barcode of the asset.

7.  Tap **Next**.

8.  Select an **Aisle and space**.

9.  Select **Submit**.

    The List of assets and models screen is displayed, showing the scanned asset record.

    **Note:** When the scanned asset record doesn't exist in your ServiceNow instance, the List of assets and models screen is empty. You can create an asset record for the new asset in the inventory. For more information, see [Create an enterprise asset from the inventory audit screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/inventory-audit-create-asset-eam.md).

10. On the List of assets and models screen, slide the scanned asset record to the left side.

    The Audit option is displayed on the screen.

11. Tap **Audit**.

12. After you’re finished scanning assets, mark the audit as complete.

    1.  Tap the three dots icon in the navigation bar.

    2.  Tap **Complete**.

        A confirmation message appears on the audits page.

        **Note:** You can start a new scan as many times as you need while the audit is in progress. After you mark the audit as **Complete**, you can't scan any more assets.
