# OT Asset Management licensing

The ServiceNow® platform uses a licensing method where your organization is charged for using the OT Asset Management application. In this licensing model, all assets of the Industrial and Hardwaremodel categories are charged based on the Subscription unit ratio.

The ServiceNow® OT Asset Management licensing is based on resource categories. A resource category is a group of related model categories. The OT Asset Management application supports some default resource categories. These resource categories enable assets of the Industrial and Hardwaremodel categories to use the features and workflows of the OT Asset Management application. Any asset of the Industrial and Hardwaremodel category is counted toward a Subscription Unit based on the predefined ratio of number of assets to subscription units.

When you create a custom model category with a licensable Industrial or Hardwaremodel category as its parent, the custom model category is automatically associated with the resource category of the parent model category. Based on the resource category, the assets of these custom model categories are licensed and counted toward a Subscription Unit.

**Note:** When the OT Asset Management application is activated on your ServiceNow instance, all the OT Asset Management license resource categories are opted in by default.

</table>The Subscription unit ratio is the ratio of the number of assets to the number of subscription units. For example, the subscription unit ratio of Industrial Consumable is 25:1, where 25 assets require a single unit of license. If 1 license costs $100, then 25 industrial consumable assets cost $100 and 50 industrial consumable assets cost $200.

You can view the subscription details of your OT Asset Management application using the ITAM License Report. For more details, see [View the license report for the OT Asset Management application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/view-license-report-otam.md).

## OT hardware assets in OT Asset Management licensing

The OT Asset Management licensing model includes a few default hardware resource categories to license OT hardware assets.

In the OT Asset Management licensing model, only hardware assets with the **OT entity** flag set to **true** are licensed and counted toward a Subscription unit under the hardware resource categories of OT Asset Management licensing. The OT Asset Management workflows support OT hardware assets.

**Note:** Non-OT Hardware assets with the **OT entity** flag set to **false** can't use the features and workflows of the OT Asset Management application even if you have installed the application. The non-OT hardware assets aren't licensed under OT Asset Management.

The Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) licensing model includes default resource categories equivalent to the hardware resource categories of OT Asset Management.

|OTAM hardware resource category|Equivalent HAM resource category|
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|OT Servers|Servers|
|OT Network Gear|Network Gear|
|OT Storage|Storage|
|OT End User Computers|End User Computers|
|OT Mobile Devices|Mobile Devices|
|OT Monitors|Monitors|
|OT Printers|Printers|
|OT Unclassified hardware|Unclassified Hardware|

When both OT Asset Management and Hardware Asset Management applications or licensed HAM solutions are activated, and HAM resource categories are opted in, consider the following points:

-   OT hardware assets are licensed only under the hardware resource categories of OT Asset Management licensing.
-   Non-OT hardware assets are licensed only under the resource categories of HAM licensing.
-   OT Asset Management workflows support only OT hardware assets.
-   HAM workflows support both OT hardware assets and non-OT hardware assets.

For more details on licensing hardware assets, see [Licensing framework for Hardware Asset Management solutions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/licensing-ham-solutions.md).
