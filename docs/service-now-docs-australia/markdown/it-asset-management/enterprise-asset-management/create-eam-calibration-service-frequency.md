# Create a service frequency for your enterprise asset calibrations

Create a service frequency to specify how often you must perform an enterprise asset calibration.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin or sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager

## About this task

You can specify the calibrations that are required for your enterprise assets by using calibration attributes. When you create a calibration attribute, you must specify the frequency at which you need to perform the associated calibrations.

For more details on calibration attributes, see [Add calibration attributes to an enterprise asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/add-calibration-attributes-enterprise-asset.md) or [Add calibration attributes to an enterprise model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/add-calibration-attributes-enterprise-model.md).

## Procedure

1.  From the Enterprise Asset Workspace, open the Admin center view.

2.  From the left navigation menu of the Admin center view, navigate to **Calibration configuration** &gt; **Service frequency**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the service frequency.|
    |Service frequency|Frequency at which you must perform the calibrations.|
    |Service frequency type|Type of frequency.|

5.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The service frequency is available to use in your calibration attributes.
