Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Linear asset

</td><td>

An asset that has a physical length or dimension, such as roads, railways, pipelines, and power transmission lines.

 Linear assets have a series of geopoints; at least a start and end point and have segments with different attributes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Geo point

</td><td>

Geo points, or graphical coordinates, are a way of expressing a location on the earth's surface using a set of numerical values.

 Geo points consists of latitudes, longitudes, and altitudes and can be visualized on a map. In the Enterprise Asset Management application, geo point latitude and longitude refer to the coordinate format defined by WGS 84 and uses signed  decimal degrees.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Route

</td><td>

Geo points of a linear asset form a route. Routes can be plotted and visualized on a map.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Boundary width

</td><td>

Maximum width of the linear asset. It’s used to validate whether a cmn\_location is on-route or not.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Marker

</td><td>

A point location that can be identified on or near a linear asset. A marker should contain a geo point so it can be visualized on a map. If the geo point is on the route of the linear asset, then it’s an on-route marker.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Segment

</td><td>

A section of a linear asset with certain attributes. A segment consists of a start point and an end point, or a start point and length.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Discrete asset

</td><td>

Discrete assets are enterprise assets and consumables. Discrete assets can be associated to a linear asset and be managed as part of the linear asset.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Overlap asset

</td><td>

A linear asset relationship where two or more linear assets are in close proximity and within the boundary width. For example, a northbound and a southbound highway. A linear asset can be defined for a northbound highway and another linear asset for a southbound highway.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Intersect asset

</td><td>

A linear asset relationship where linear assets have an intersect point. For example, intersecting roads, where two or more roads meet or cross each other.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Continue asset

</td><td>

A linear asset relationship for linear assets that have a start and an end marker. For example, a highway that after a particular point changes into another highway.
