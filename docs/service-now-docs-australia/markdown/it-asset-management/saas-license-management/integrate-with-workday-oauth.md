# Integrate with Workday using OAuth 2.0

Integrate your Software Asset Management application with the Workday application using OAuth 2.0 authentication method to track your software subscriptions.

## Configure permissions in Workday

To set up the Workday integration successfully, configure permissions in Workday for the OAuth 2.0 authentication method.

### Before you begin

Role required: Users having roles such as Security Admin, Integration Admin, Integration Auditor, who can create Integration System Users and assign required security policies.

### Procedure

1.  Register an Integration System User.

    **Note:** While filling out account information details, the **Do Not Allow UI Sessions** check box should be kept cleared to allow login and authentication.

2.  Create a security group and assign it to the Integration System User.

    1.  In **Action**, navigate to **Security Group** &gt; **Maintain Domain Permissions for Security Group** and provide the following permission:

        |Operation|Domain Security Policy|Functional Areas|
        |---------|----------------------|----------------|
        |Get Only|Worker Data: Current Staffing Information|Staffing|
        |View Only|Person Data: Work Address|Contact Information|
        |View Only|Worker Data: Active and Terminated Workers|Staffing|
        |View Only|Workday Accounts|System|
        |View and Modify|WQL for Workday Extend|System|
        |View and Modify|Workday Query Language|System|

        **Note:** Confirm that the domain security policies are activated for the security group using the active pending security policy changes.


### Result

The new credentials for this Integration System User would be used to configure the connection in the ServiceNow instance.

## Create Workday OAuth 2.0 credentials

Create Workday OAuth 2.0 credentials to get access to Workday APIs.

### Before you begin

Role required: Users having roles such as Security Admin, Integration Admin, Integration Auditor, who can create Integration System Users and assign required security policies.

### Procedure

1.  Log in to your Workday account.

2.  In the search bar, enter `register API client` and select **Register API Client**.

3.  On the Register API Client page, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Client Name|A unique name for the client application. For example, `Workday HR spoke`.|
    |Client Grant Type|Select **Authorization Code Grant**.|
    |Access Token Type|The type of access token. Select **Bearer**.|
    |Redirection URI|URL of your ServiceNow instance.|
    |Non-Expiring Refresh tokens|The option to enable refresh tokens which do not expire.|
    |Scope \(Functional Areas\)|Scopes required for the client application.|

4.  Select **OK**.

    The client ID and client secret are generated on the Register API Client page.

5.  Copy the values in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields and secure them for later use for Workday integration.


## Create a Workday integration profile

### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).
