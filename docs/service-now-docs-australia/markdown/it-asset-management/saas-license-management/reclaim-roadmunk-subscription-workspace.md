# Reclaim Roadmunk user subscriptions in the Software Asset Workspace

Reclaim unused Roadmunk subscriptions to reduce your total software costs.

## Before you begin

To reclaim user subscriptions in the Software Asset Workspace, you must request and activate the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application. See [Request Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmt.md) for more details on requesting and activating the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application.

Roadmunk Role required: Account Admin

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_user

## About this task

The SaaS License Management Roadmunk integration doesn’t support reclamation through the ServiceNow AI Platform. When Software Asset Management creates a removal candidate for your Roadmunk integration, you can reclaim the user subscription by deactivating the associated user on your Roadmunk account. After you deactivate the user, you must update the state of the removal candidate to **Closed Skipped** so that the user subscription is removed from the Software Subscriptions \[samp\_sw\_subscription\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Identify removal candidates for your Roadmunk integration.

    1.  From your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **Software Asset** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace**.

        The Software Asset Workspace launches in a new tab.

    2.  From the side navigation menu of the Software Asset Workspace, select **License usage**.

        The License usage view opens.

    3.  On the **Publishers** tab of the License usage view, select **Roadmunk** from the list of available publishers.

        The Roadmunk publisher overview opens.

    4.  Select the **Removal Candidates** related list to view the list of available removal candidates.

    5.  Take note of the removal candidates that you want to reclaim the user subscription for.

        Save this information for later use.

2.  Deactivate the associated users on your Roadmunk account.

    Based on the list of removal candidates that you identified in [step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/reclaim-roadmunk-subscription-workspace.md), you can reclaim user subscriptions by deactivating the associated users on your Roadmunk account.

    1.  From a web browser, open [Roadmunk](https://roadmunk.com/).

    2.  Log in using your Account Admin credentials.

        The Roadmunk dashboard opens.

    3.  On the side navigation menu of the Roadmunk dashboard, select your profile icon and then select **Account Settings**.

        Your account settings appear.

    4.  On the page header of your account settings, select the **Users** tab.

        This tab displays the complete lists of users on your Roadmunk account, including collaborators, reviewers, and inactive users.

    5.  Select the **Active** toggle button for every user that you want to deactivate.

    6.  Select **Save**.

    The users are deactivated and added to the list of inactive users.

    **Note:** By default, the Roadmunk Download Subscriptions subflow within the ServiceNow SaaS License Management Roadmunk integration downloads all users in your Roadmunk account, including both active and inactive users. To download only the active users in your account, you must download your Roadmunk User Report and then attach it to the Roadmunk integration profile on your ServiceNow instance. See step 7 of [Create a Roadmunk integration profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-roadmunk.md) for detailed instructions.

3.  Delete deactivated users from your Roadmunk account.

    If a deactivated user is no longer part of your organization or team, you can delete the user from your Roadmunk account.

    **Warning:** Users are deleted permanently. Proceed with caution, as users can’t be restored once deleted.

    1.  On the same **Users** tab of your Roadmunk account settings, select **INACTIVE USERS**.

        The list of inactive users opens.

    2.  Select the Remove icon \[Omitted image "remove-icon.png"\] for the user that you want to delete.

        The removal confirmation dialog box appears.

    3.  In the dialog box, select **Delete**.

        The user is deleted from your account and all roadmaps are unassigned from the user.

        **Note:** The user isn’t notified about being deleted from your account. Any comments that either mention or are made by the user are updated to indicate that the user has been deleted. All roadmaps that are owned by the user are retained in your account and can be managed by any Account Admin. You can view these roadmaps at any time in the All Roadmaps list on the Roadmaps home page. If the user is invited back to Roadmunk under the same email address, you must manually reassign these roadmaps to the user.

    4.  Repeat steps b and c for each user that you want to delete.

4.  Return to your ServiceNow instance to update the state of each removal candidate to **Closed Skipped**.

    1.  From your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **Software Asset** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace**.

        The Software Asset Workspace launches in a new tab.

    2.  From the side navigation menu of the Software Asset Workspace, select **License usage**.

        The License usage view opens.

    3.  On the **Publishers** tab of the License usage view, select **Roadmunk** from the list of available publishers.

        The Roadmunk publisher overview opens.

    4.  Select the **Removal Candidates** related list.

    5.  From the list of available removal candidates, select the removal candidate number \(RCCxxxxxxx\) for a user that you deactivated in [step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/reclaim-roadmunk-subscription-workspace.md).

    6.  On the Removal Candidate form, update the state of the removal candidate by selecting **Closed Skipped**.

        Software Asset Management removes the user subscription from the Software Subscriptions \[samp\_sw\_subscription\] table.

    7.  Close the tab for the Removal Candidate form.

    8.  Repeat steps e through g for each Roadmunk user that you deactivated.
