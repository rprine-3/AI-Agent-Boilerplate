# Integrating with CrowdStrike

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the CrowdStrike enables you to view CrowdStrike active host sensors information and check license compliance.

**Note:** CrowdStrike currently doesn't support the APIs for integration in regulated environments, including US-GOV-1 \(GovCloud\) or US-GOV-2 CrowdStrike clouds.

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

|Process|Required user role in the CrowdStrike application|Authentication scopes|
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|Download consumption|Falcon administrator|Sensor usage scope with read permissions|

This process is applicable for Zurich Patch 7, Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) 17.0.5, and Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 4.1.0 version onwards.

## Register a CrowdStrike OAuth application

Register the CrowdStrike OAuth application to access the CrowdStrike API and to receive a Client ID and Client secret.

### Before you begin

The CrowdStrike Integration Hub spoke must be active. For more information, see [CrowdStrike spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/crowdstrike-spoke.md).

CrowdStrike Role required: Falcon administrator

**Important:**

-   To use the Sensor Usage APIs, your API client must be assigned the Sensor usage scope with Read permissions.
-   Contact your account team to enable the following feature flags:
    -   Hourly usage data feature flag: This flag must be enabled for your Customer Identification \(CID\) to view hourly usage data.
    -   Aggregated usage data feature flag: This flag must be enabled to get aggregated usage data in multi-CID \(non-Flight Control\) accounts.

### Procedure

1.  Log in to [Falcon](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/) using your admin credentials.

2.  Navigate to **Support and resources** &gt; **API Clients and Keys**.

3.  Select **Create API Client**.

4.  Provide the client name and description.

5.  Select the **Read** check box for the **Sensor usage** scope.

6.  Select **Create**.

    The API client created screen is displayed.

7.  Copy the Client ID and Secret for later use.

8.  Select **Done**.


## Create a CrowdStrike integration profile

Create a CrowdStrike integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for your CrowdStrike applications.

### Before you begin

The Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) must be installed from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_admin or sam\_integrator

**Important:** You must select the **CrowdStrike Spoke** check box for this integration while installing optional features on the [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager.md) page. For more information about choosing the required SaaS applications, see [Request SaaS License Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/request-saas-license-management.md).

### About this task

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the CrowdStrike integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

**Note:** When upgrading to Yokohama patch 1 with Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) 15.0.8 and Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 2.1.0 store applications installed, you must delete the entitlements for the existing CrowdStrike integration profiles. Then, create entitlements for various CrowdStrike products, such as Falcon Endpoint Protection and Falcon Discover, based on their license metrics. These metrics include Reserved Hourly Average Sensor and Sensor Subscription, which are found under the CrowdStrike license metric group.

-   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the **Draft** state, create integration profiles and delete the existing ones.
-   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the **Published** state, their state changes to Draft.

If you are on any version for Yokohama below patch 1, refer [KB1801232](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=ef634dac83935610cdbbc430feaad3d9).

    The OAuth token is generated successfully.

9.  On the Integration Profile form, proceed with the Workload product mapping by selecting the **CrowdStrike Product Workload Mappings** tab.

    **Note:** The software entitlements and software models must be created before proceeding to the next step.

    -   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
    -   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
    -   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).
    1.  On the CrowdStrike Product Workload Mappings page, select **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        For further details on the CrowdStrike Product Workload Mapping, see [Create a product workload mapping for CrowdStrike products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-product-workload-mapping-crowdstrike.md).

    3.  Select **Save**.

10. On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    You can also validate connections before creating CrowdStrike product workload mappings.

    **Important:** You must create the product workload mapping before publishing the profile.

11. After the connection is verified and the workload product mapping is provided, select **Publish**.

12. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.


### Result

This integration pulls or creates usage records in the CrowdStrike Product Usage \[samp\_crowdstrike\_product\_usage\] table and CAL records in the Client Access \[samp\_sw\_client\_access\] table.

### What to do next

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

You can view details on the usage records and workload mappings created with the CrowdStrike integration. For more information, see [License operations view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/operations-workspace.md) in the Software Asset Workspace.

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.
