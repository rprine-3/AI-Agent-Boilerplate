# Integrate with Docusign at Organization level

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the Docusign service at the organization level enables you to track your software subscriptions and envelope consumption data.

**Note:** Integration with Docusign at the organization level is done using the Data Feed API, so the user's last activities aren’t tracked as part of this integration.

For more information about the Docusign service, see [the DocuSign Developer site](https://developers.docusign.com/ios_sdk/developer.html).

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

|Process|Required user role in the Docusign application|Authentication scopes|
|-------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|Download subscriptions|admin|No scopes|
|Download consumption|admin|No scopes|

This process is applicable for Zurich patch 4, Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) 16.0.8, and Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 2.1.0 version onwards.

## Register a Docusign application

Register a Docusign application through the Docusign admin portal.

### Before you begin

Docusign Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Log in to your Docusign demo \(non-production\) account.

    You can use any subaccount for logging in that is later promoted to the corresponding production account.

2.  Go to the Admin tab.

    -   If you already have an API integration key from a previous integration ready for use in production, skip to [step 15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-docusign-org.md).
    -   If you don't have your API integration key saved, you must generate a new one.
3.  On the side navigation pane, select **Account Profile** and copy the **Organization ID** to secure it for later use.

4.  Navigate to **INTEGRATIONS** &gt; **Apps and Keys**.

5.  In the **Apps and Integration Keys** section, select **Add App and Integration Key**.

6.  On the Add Integration Key form, enter a unique name for your application in the **App Name** field and select **CREATE APP**.

7.  On the profile page of your application, select **Third-party integration key** in the **Integration Type** field.

8.  Copy the value of the **Integration Key** and secure it for later use.

    **Important:** You must request the Docusign support team for enabling the Data feed API on the integration key that you’re generating. If you’re using an Enterprise Pro plan, the Data feed API is free for you with organization management. If you’re using a low-tier plan, you can opt for organization management as an add-on. For further information, contact the Docusign support team.

9.  Select **Save**.

10. In the **Apps and Integration Keys** section, locate the application that you just created in the App Name list.

11. Select **Actions** &gt; **Select Go-Live account**.

    A Docusign login window pops up prompting you to enter the credentials for your Docusign account.

12. Enter your Docusign credentials.

13. Select a production account on the window that pops up prompting you to choose a production account to which you want to promote your integration key.

    The **Go Live Status** field changes to **Pending approval**. For a successful Go-Live review, your app must meet the requirements for Go-Live for each API that it uses. For more information on the Go-Live review stages, see [Docusign documentation](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/go-live/).

14. After the integration is approved, the **Go Live Status** changes to **View in production**.

15. Log in to your Docusign production account and verify that the same integration key has been promoted to the production account.


## Generate RSA keypair for Docusign integration

Generate RSA keys to integrate the Docusign application with your ServiceNow instance.

### Before you begin

Docusign requirements:

-   Docusign account
-   Docusign app configured to integrate with ServiceNow
-   Role required: Docusign administrator

### About this task

The integration of Docusign at the organization level enables access to all subaccounts using a single integration key generated in any one subaccount.

### Procedure

1.  Log in to your Docusign production content account.

2.  Go to the Admin tab.

3.  Navigate to **INTEGRATIONS** &gt; **Apps and Keys**.

4.  Next to your application, select **Actions** &gt; **Edit**.

5.  Select **Generate RSA** and save the Key Pair ID, Public Key, and Private Key for later use.


## Generate a Java Key Store certificate

Generate a Java Key Store \(JKS\) certificate for the JSON Web Token \(JWT\) authentication of your Docusign integration profile.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

The JKS file that you generate is required for uploading to retrieve the OAuth token when you create a Docusign integration profile. For this upload to be successful, one of the following conditions must be true for the glide.attachment.extensions system property:

-   If the property value is empty, the upload is successful.
-   If the property value isn't empty, then the jks value must be present for the upload to be successful. For example, if the property already has values such as xlsx, json, and so on, then jks must be present too.

### Procedure

1.  Open a text editor for code, such as Sublime Text, and create a file.

2.  Paste the Private key that you had generated from your Docusign integrator app.

    For more information, see [Generate RSA keypair for Docusign integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-docusign-org.md).

    **Note:** Make sure to include both the beginning and ending of the private key.

3.  Save the file with the .key extension.

    For example, `privatekey.key`.

4.  Open the command line interface \(CLI\) and navigate to the directory where you saved the file with the .key extension.

5.  Create a CA signed certificate using your private key by executing the command:

    ```
    openssl req -new -x509 -key <file-name>.key -out <certificate-name>.pem -days 1095
    ```

    You're prompted to provide details such as country name and province name.

6.  Enter the required details.

7.  Create a PKCS 12 file using your private key and CA signed certificate by executing the command:

    ```
    openssl pkcs12 -export -in <certificate-name>.pem -inkey <file-name>.key -certfile <certificate-name>.pem -out <PKCS-12-file-name>.p12
    ```

    You're prompted to provide a password for the file.

8.  Enter the export password or the source keystore password.

9.  Create the JKS file by executing this command:

    ```
    keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <PKCS-12-file-name>.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore <JKS-certificate-filename>.jks -deststoretype JKS
    ```

    You're prompted to provide a password for the JKS file.

10. Provide the same password for the destination and source keystore passwords.


## Create a Docusign integration profile at Organization level

Create an integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for the Docusign service.

### Before you begin

To create a Docusign integration profile, request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

Role required: sam\_integrator

### About this task

An organization level integration profile uses the Docusign Data Feed API that retrieves detailed subscription and consumption data across an entire organization. The Data Feed API aggregates data from all subaccounts under an organization, offering a centralized view of envelope activity and usage.

How Data feeds work:

-   Data feeds are updated nightly based on the site the accounts are in.
-   Data for each account is processed every seven days.
-   If an organization has multiple accounts, each account is processed on a different weekday. The system randomly selects a few accounts to process each day, so that data is processed daily but for different accounts. For example, Accounts 1 and 2 on Monday, Accounts 3, 4, and 5 on Tuesday, and so on.

Even if the integration job runs on the same day the envelopes are sent, the data feeds for those envelopes may not be available. After the data feeds are generated, they are included in the API response. The scheduled job then processes those envelopes during its next run.

If you're using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the Docusign integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the integration profile.

### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
