# Create a custom integration profile

Create a custom integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize stale licenses for any SaaS application.

## Before you begin

Before you create a custom integration profile in your ServiceNow instance, set up a method of authentication in the SaaS application admin or developer account. For example, create an OAuth application or an API token.

-   If you create an OAuth application, confirm that you enable the appropriate scopes. The app needs scopes to read users, read user activity, and to modify or delete users. These scopes enable the integration to get a list of users, get user activity, and reclaim unused subscriptions. Record the Client ID and Client secret for the OAuth application. You input these values in your ServiceNow instance.
-   If you create an API token, record the value for the API token. You input this value in your ServiceNow instance.

Role required: sam\_integrator

    -   If you're using a different method of authentication, the available fields are determined by the configuration template that you created.
6.  Select **Create** and grant access for the integration.

    **Tip:** Log in to your SaaS application admin account in a new browser tab to verify that the integration connects to the correct account.

    -   If the connection is successful, a connection record is created in the Connections related list on the Connection &amp; Credential Alias record.
    -   If the connection fails, you must delete the connection record, credential record, and application registry record that were created during the attempted connection.
        1.  To delete the connection record, navigate to **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connections** and delete the record for the SaaS application.
        2.  To delete the credential record, navigate to **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Credentials** and delete the record for the SaaS application.
        3.  To delete the application registry record, navigate to **System OAuth** &gt; **Application Registry** and delete the record for the SaaS application.
        4.  Return to the Connection &amp; Credential Alias record for the SaaS application and select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link to reattempt the connection.

## What to do next

[Create a data stream action to get users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-data-stream-action-slc.md) and view SaaS related analytics on [SaaS overview dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/saas-dashboard-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.
