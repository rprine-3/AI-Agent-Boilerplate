# Integrating with Zoom

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the Zoom service enables you to track your software subscriptions and to reclaim unused licenses.

With this integration, you can retrieve and analyze licensing information for the following Zoom applications:

-   Zoom Regular account \(not a Master / Master-sub account\) for Meetings
-   Zoom Regular account \(not a Master / Master-sub account\) for Webinar

For additional information about Zoom, see [Zoom Developer Documentation](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs).

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

## Create a Zoom integration profile

Create an integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for the Zoom service.

### Before you begin

To create a Zoom integration profile, request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_integrator

### About this task

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the Zoom integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the integration profile.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Display name|Name of the integration profile. For example, `Zoom Integration`|
    |Client Id|Client ID for the OAuth 2.0 application created in the SaaS admin account in [step 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-zoom.md).|
    |Redirect url|This value is automatically populated.|
    |Client secret|Password related with the client ID created in the SaaS admin account in [step 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-zoom.md).|
    |Profile type|Type of integration profile. This value is automatically set to `Zoom Subscription`.|
    |Analyze user activity from|You can choose to start analyzing data from the current date or from up to 30 days in the past. Choosing a date in the past enables you to detect stale subscriptions without waiting in real time because you can see subscriptions that haven't been used recently. Because choosing a date in the past increases the amount of data that is analyzed, it could take several hours for you to be able to view the results.|

3.  In the Process configuration section, Review the required user roles or API permissions specified in the **Vendor configuration** field for each process to minimize security risks and optimize SaaS licenses.

    **Note:** For more information about the required roles and scopes, see [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-zoom.md) table.

    -   The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

    -   The **Download Activity** check box is selected by default. If you clear it, the activity scheduled job **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Events** isn't created.

        In the **Analyze user activity** field, you can also select the date and time starting from when you want to analyze the user activity. By default, you can analyze user activity up to 60 days prior to the current date and view events performed by individual users from the time you create this profile.

        **Note:** Software Asset Management pulls the events from the time that you start analyzing user activity irrespective of the profile creation date.

        You can modify this value in the Last activity threshold field of your software reclamation rules. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

    -   The **Reclaim subscriptions** check box is selected by default. If you don't want to reclaim subscriptions, you can clear this check box. If you clear it, the removal candidates are created but the reclaim subscription subflow isn't triggered or the reclamation process isn't initiated.

4.  Select **Submit**.

    Your ServiceNow instance creates a draft integration profile.

5.  On the integration profile, select the **Get OAuth Token** related link and follow the steps to get an OAuth token.

    **Note:** For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-zoom.md) table.

6.  On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions and Calculate Activity APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

    **Note:** If you clear the **Download Activity** check box after the integration profile is validated and scheduled jobs are created, you must revalidate the connections because the following events occur:

    -   The **Status** field on the integration profile form changes to **Draft**.
    -   The **Validate connection** button shows up on the form.
    -   The current **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Events** job gets deleted.

### Result

You can view events performed by individual users up to one year prior to the current date. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md). Software Asset Management pulls the events from the time that you start downloading user subscriptions irrespective of the profile creation date.

### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.
