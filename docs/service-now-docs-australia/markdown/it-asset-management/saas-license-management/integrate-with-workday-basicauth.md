# Integrate with Workday using Basic Authentication

Integrate your Software Asset Management application with the Workday application using Basic authentication method to track your software subscriptions.

## Configure permissions in Workday

To set up the Workday integration successfully, perform this procedure in Workday.

### Before you begin

Role required: Users having roles such as Security Admin, Integration Admin, Integration Auditor, who can create Integration System Users and assign required security policies.

### Procedure

1.  Register an Integration System User.

    **Note:** While filling out account information details, you must select the **Do Not Allow UI Sessions** check box.

2.  Create a security group and assign it to the Integration System User.

    1.  In **Action**, navigate to **Security Group** &gt; **Maintain Domain Permissions for Security Group** and provide the following permission:

        |Operation|Domain Security Policy|Functional Areas|
        |---------|----------------------|----------------|
        |Get Only|Worker Data: Public Worker Reports|Staffing|
        |Get Only|Worker Data: Current Staffing Information|Staffing|
        |Get Only|Worker Data: Workers|Staffing|

        **Note:** Confirm that the domain security policies are activated for the security group using the active pending security policy changes.


### Result

The new credentials for this Integration System User would be used to configure the connection in the ServiceNow instance.

## Create a Workday integration profile

Create a Workday integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for your Workday applications.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin, sam\_admin, sam\_integrator

Install the latest Workday HR spoke. For more information about the latest version, see the **Spoke version** section in [Workday HR Spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/workday-hr-spoke.md).

### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).
