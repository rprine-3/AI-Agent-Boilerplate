# SaaS License Management

SaaS License Management tracks and controls cloud-based application subscriptions within Software Asset Management \(SAM\). This capability helps organizations manage subscriptions, monitor usage, and control costs across hybrid and direct SaaS models.

## SaaS subscription models

SaaS applications and services are typically subscribed to on a per-user basis. They generally fall into two categories:

-   **Hybrid SaaS**

    Hybrid SaaS combines on-premise installations with cloud-based subscriptions. It’s commonly used by organizations that require offline access to certain applications while also using cloud features for collaboration. This model is also suitable for businesses with compliance requirements that mandate local installations. For example, a Microsoft 365 subscription enables you to access cloud services and install applications like Microsoft Excel on their devices. SAM supports the following Hybrid SaaS integrations:

    -   [Adobe Cloud integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/adobe-cloud-integration.md)
    -   [Microsoft 365 integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/microsoft-o365.md)
-   **Direct SaaS**

    Direct SaaS refers to applications where all data and functionality are hosted in the cloud and accessed through the internet. You typically log in via a web browser or a dedicated app without installing software locally. For example, a Miro subscriber accesses the application entirely online. This model is common for organizations that prioritize ease of deployment and minimal maintenance, and for teams that work remotely or across multiple locations.

    **Important:** This topic focuses on the Direct SaaS category. It explains how to get started, identifies areas where Direct SaaS can be applied, and outlines ways to use available solutions and workflows effectively.


## Managing Direct SaaS with the SaaS License Management application

Managing Direct SaaS applications can vary based on organizational needs. The best approach depends on factors such as the level of integration required, available APIs, and whether SSO \(Single Sign-On\) is in place.

-   Use [Direct Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-integration-profile.md) when you need deep usage insights and automated license management for supported vendors.
-   Use [SaaS License Connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/saas-license-connections.md) when you want flexibility to connect any SaaS app with a public API and prefer a low-code setup.
-   Use [SSO Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/saas-sso-integration.md) when you need visibility into apps connected through an SSO provider and want to address SaaS sprawl.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

[Direct Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-integration-profile.md)

</td><td>

-   Base system or default direct integrations
-   Full visibility into individual user-to-application assignments
-   Identifies inactive or unused subscriptions based on usage and last activity signals
-   Orchestrates the reclamation workflow end to end

</td><td>

-   Provides detailed usage insights
-   Automates license management
-   Reduces manual effort

</td><td>

-   When the underlying application or publisher API supports write-back \(programmatic removal or de-provisioning of users\).
-   When an integration provides usage visibility but does not offer a reclamation or write-back API, SAM identifies reclamation candidates. You must remove users manually or through a custom workflow.

</td></tr><tr><td>

[SaaS License Connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/saas-license-connections.md)

</td><td>

-   Connect to any SaaS application with a public API
-   Low-code framework using ServiceNow® via [Integration Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integrationhub.md) and Workflow Studio

</td><td>

-   Flexible for any SaaS application
-   Customizable workflows

</td><td>

Depends on the public API and custom workflow configuration. Build removal logic through Workflow Studio for supported applications.

</td></tr><tr><td>

[SSO Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/saas-sso-integration.md)

</td><td>

-   Connect via SSO providers such as Okta and Microsoft Entra ID.
-   Analyzes user login activity
-   Generates reclamation candidates for stale or inactive users
-   Download the list of applications or users
-   Identify overlapping software and rationalize applications

</td><td>

-   Helps tackle SaaS sprawl
-   Improves cost control
-   Simplifies user access management

</td><td>

-   For users who are directly assigned to applications \(supported for both Azure and Okta\).
-   For users accessing applications through Okta or Microsoft Entra ID groups. Group-based removal is not automated. A single group can grant access to multiple applications. Removing a user from a group could have unintended downstream effects across other apps.
