# Integrating with Aha!

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the Aha! service enables you to track your software subscriptions and to reclaim unused licenses.

For more information about the Aha! service, see [Aha! Product management guide](https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide).

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

|Process|Required user role in the Aha! application|Authentication scopes|
|-------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|Download subscriptions|admin|None|
|Pull user activity|admin|None|
|Reclaim subscription|admin|None|

## Create an Aha! OAuth2 application

Create an Aha! OAuth2 application to get access to the Aha! API.

### Before you begin

Aha! Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Go to [OAuth2 Authentication](https://www.aha.io/api/oauth2).

2.  Log in to the Aha! site using your admin credentials.

3.  On the Personal settings page, select **Developer**.

4.  Select the **OAuth applications** tab.

5.  Select **Register OAuth application**.

6.  On the Register new OAuth application form, enter `https://*instance*/oauth_redirect.do` as the Redirect URI, where *instance* is the name of your ServiceNow instance.

7.  Select **Create**.

    The **OAuth applications** tab shows Client ID and Client Secret keys.

8.  Note down the values in the Client ID and Client Secret fields.


## Create an Aha! integration profile

Create an integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for the Aha! service.

### Before you begin

To create an Aha! integration profile, request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home).

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_integrator

**Important:** You must select the **Aha! Spoke** check box for this integration while installing optional features on the [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager.md) page. For more information about choosing the required SaaS applications, see [Request SaaS License Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/request-saas-license-management.md).

### About this task

Type of integration profile. This field is automatically set to **Aha! Subscription**.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  Review the required user roles or API permissions specified in the **Vendor configuration** field for each process to minimize security risks and optimize SaaS licenses.

    **Note:** For more information, see [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-aha.md) table.

    1.  In the Download Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Aha! Download Subscriptions**.

        **Note:** The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

    2.  In the Reclaim Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Aha! Reclaim Subscription**.

        **Note:** The **Reclaim subscriptions** check box is selected by default. If you don't want to reclaim subscriptions, you can clear this check box. If you clear it, the removal candidates are created but the reclaim subscription subflow isn't triggered or the reclamation process isn't initiated.

4.  Select **Save**.

    Your ServiceNow instance creates a draft integration profile.

    The **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears and is automatically set to **sn\_aha\_spoke.Aha\_**.

5.  Open the connection &amp; credential aliases record by selecting the preview icon \[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field and then selecting **Open Record** in the record preview.

6.  On the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases form, select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

7.  In the Create Connection and Credential dialog box, fill in the fields.

    |Fields|Descriptions|
    |------|------------|
    |Connection Name|Name of the integration profile.|
    |Connection URL|Connection URL for Aha!.|
    |OAuth Client ID|OAuth2 key that you received while creating an OAuth2 authentication from the Aha! site.|
    |OAuth Client Secret|OAuth Client Secret key that you received while creating an OAuth2 authentication from the Aha! site.|
    |OAuth Redirect URL|ServiceNow redirect URL.|

8.  Select **Create and Get OAuth Token** and then select **Authorize**.

    **Note:** For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-aha.md) table.

9.  On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

10. After the connection is verified, select **Publish**.

11. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.


### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).
