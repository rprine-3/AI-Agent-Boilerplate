# SaaS Overview dashboard

Optimize how much your organization spends on SaaS and SSO licensing by analyzing the subscription usage, cost, and compliance of your SaaS applications and SSO providers using the SaaS Overview dashboard.

**Important:** The SaaS Overview dashboard is available in both the Software Asset Management classic application and the Software Asset Workspace. This topic provides information on the SaaS Overview dashboard in the Software Asset Management classic application. For information on the SaaS Overview dashboard in the Software Asset Workspace, see [SaaS overview dashboard in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/saas-dashboard-workspace.md).

The Engineering License Overview dashboard is no longer available for new Australia users who have activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin or upgraded to Australia without activating the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia.

-   If you activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia but didn't activate the Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\), you have access to this dashboard.
-   If you activated the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application after upgrading to Zurich, you won’t be able to access this dashboard from the **Software Asset** navigation menu in your instance. You can however access this dashboard from the **Dashboards** navigation menu.

The SaaS Overview dashboard displays information about the usage, costs, and potential savings that are associated with your SaaS and SSO applications. Access this dashboard by navigating to **SaaS License** &gt; **Overview**. You can filter the dashboard by software model or publisher. Click any report to see more information.

**Note:** To view your organization's software usage and compliance for Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Cloud, navigate to **SaaS License** &gt; **Office 365 &amp; Adobe Cloud**.
