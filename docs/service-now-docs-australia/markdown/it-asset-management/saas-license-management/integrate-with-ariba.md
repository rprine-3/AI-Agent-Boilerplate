# Integrating with SAP Ariba

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the SAP Ariba application enables you to track your software subscriptions and reclaim unused licenses.

**Important:**

This integration retrieves user subscription details, tracks last login date, and identifies low-usage for the following SAP Ariba applications:

-   Ariba Sourcing
-   Ariba Supplier Performance Management
-   Ariba Contract Management

## Download reports for SAP Ariba users consuming licenses

Before setting up an SAP Ariba integration profile, generate and download reports for all users who are currently using SAP Ariba licenses.

### Before you begin

Role required: SAP Ariba admin

### About this task

For setting up an SAP Ariba integration profile, the following SAP Ariba reports are required.

-   Sourcing - User Names and Permissions
-   Contract Usage Reports
-   Number of Users Creating Projects
-   Supplier Performance Managements \(SPM\) Project Report

## Create an SAP Ariba integration profile

Create an SAP Ariba integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for your SAP Ariba applications.

### Before you begin

The Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) must be installed from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

For publishing the integration profile, change the application scope to **Global**.

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_integrator

### About this task

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the SAP Ariba integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the integration profile.

Status of the integration profile. -   If you have not published the integration profile, this field is automatically set to **Draft**.
-   If you have already published the integration profile, this field is automatically set to **Published**.


</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Type of integration profile. This field is automatically set to `Ariba Subscription`.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>3.  View the required user roles or API permissions to minimize security risks and optimize SaaS licenses.

    In the Download Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to**SAP Ariba Download Subscriptions**. The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

4.  Select **Save**.

5.  After the integration profile is saved, upload the attachments by selecting the **Attach** icon \[Omitted image "attachments-icon.png"\].

6.  On the Attachments pane, drag or select the files in the `.csv` format that you want to upload one by one or together.

    **Important:** Upload the SAP Ariba reports regularly to view the most recent data.

    After the files are uploaded successfully, the Subscription Stagings \[samp\_subscription\_staging\] table gets populated with the uploaded data.

7.  Select **Publish**.

    After the integration profile is published, the files attached to the profile are deleted automatically.


### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).
