</table>You can integrate a ServiceNow instance with multiple Jira instances. For this integration, create a connection and credential alias record and a connection record for each Jira instance.

## Create a Jira account API token

Create an API token in Jira to authenticate requests.

### Before you begin

Jira Role required: Refer the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-jira-basicauth.md) table.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens).

2.  Select **Create API token**.

3.  Enter a name for your API token, then select **Create**.

4.  Copy the API token and save it.

    You’ll use the token later.


## Create the child alias record for Jira

Configure the default connection and credential alias record to authenticate the requests from ServiceNow.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

2.  Open the alias record for Jira that is shipped with the spoke.

    Verify that the ID of the alias record is **sn\_jira\_spoke\_jira**.

3.  Create the child alias by navigating to the Related Links section and selecting the Child Aliases tab.

    The **Application scope** must be Jira Spoke.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  Enter a unique and descriptive name for the child alias.

6.  Select **Submit**.


### Result

The child alias appears in the list on the Child Aliases tab. You can select the child alias and verify the values in the **ID** and **Application** fields.

## Create a Jira Software Cloud integration profile

Create an integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for Atlassian Jira Software Cloud.

### Before you begin

To create a Jira integration profile, request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

To enable the integration profile to retrieve and update user activity through the Jira Update User Activity subflow, set the **com.glide.transform.json.max-partial-length** system property **Value** to `32768`.

Atlassian Role required: site admin

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_integrator

**Important:** You must select the **Jira Spoke** check box for this integration while installing optional features on the [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager.md) page. For more information about choosing the required SaaS applications, see [Request SaaS License Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/request-saas-license-management.md).

</table>3.  Review the required user roles or API permissions specified in the **Vendor configuration** field for each process to minimize security risks and optimize SaaS licenses.

    **Note:** For more information, see the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-jira-basicauth.md) table.

    1.  In the Download Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Jira Download Subscriptions**.

        **Note:** The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

    2.  In the Calculate Activity Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Jira Update User Activity**.

        **Note:** The **Download Activity** check box is selected by default. If you clear it, the activity scheduled job **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Activity** isn't created.

        In the **Analyze user activity** field, you can also select the date and time starting from when you want to analyze the user activity. By default, you can analyze user activity up to 60 days prior to the current date and view events performed by individual users from the time you create this profile.

        **Note:** Software Asset Management pulls the events from the time that you start analyzing user activity irrespective of the profile creation date.

        You can modify this value in the Last activity threshold field of your software reclamation rules. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

    3.  In the Reclaim Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Jira Reclaim Subscription**.

        **Note:** The **Reclaim subscriptions** check box is selected by default. If you don't want to reclaim subscriptions, you can clear this check box. If you clear it, the removal candidates are created but the reclaim subscription subflow isn't triggered or the reclamation process isn't initiated.

4.  Select **Save**.

    A draft integration profile is created.

    The **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears and is automatically set to **sn\_jira\_spoke.jira\_subscription\_activity\_reclaim**.

5.  Open the connection &amp; credential aliases record by selecting the preview icon \[Omitted image "search-icon.png"\] next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field and then selecting the child alias that you had created in [Create the child alias record for Jira](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-jira-basicauth.md).

6.  Select **Save**.

7.  Open the connection &amp; credential aliases record by selecting the preview icon \[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field and then selecting **Open Record** in the record preview.

8.  On the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases form, select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

9.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Connection URL|URL of your Jira instance in `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<Cloud-Id>` format.|
    |User Name|Email address of the user.|
    |API Key|The API token that you generated for Jira.|

10. Select **Create**.

11. On your ServiceNow instance, specify the groups that have access to Jira products.

    By specifying these groups on your ServiceNow instance, you can retrieve data and manage licenses for only the users within these groups.

    1.  In a new tab, open the [Atlassian Administration portal](https://admin.atlassian.com/).

    2.  Log in to your site admin account.

    3.  Select the **Select** button against the required organization.

    4.  Select the **Products** tab.

    5.  On the Products page, select **Manage product** on the Jira product row.

    6.  View the list of groups that have access to Jira Software.

        Take note of this information for later use.

    7.  Return to your ServiceNow instance and navigate to **Jira** &gt; **Jira Groups**.

    8.  On the Jira Groups form, select the **Add Groups** related link.

        The Add Jira Groups dialog box opens.

    9.  In the Available list, select the groups that have access to Jira products.

        **Tip:** The Available list includes all groups that are associated with your Atlassian account. Select only the groups that have access to Jira products.

    10. Select the right arrow button to move the groups from the Available list to the Selected list.

    11. Select **OK**.

12. On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions and Calculate Activity APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

13. After the connection is verified, select **Publish**.

14. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.

    **Note:** If you clear the **Download Activity** check box after the integration profile is published, you must revalidate the connections and then republish the integration profile because the following events occur:

    -   The **Status** field on the integration profile form changes to **Draft**.
    -   The **Validate connection** button shows up on the form.
    -   The current **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Activity** job gets deleted.

### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple Jira integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-jira.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.
