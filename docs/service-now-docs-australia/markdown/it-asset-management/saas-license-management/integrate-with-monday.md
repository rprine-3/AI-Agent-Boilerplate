# Integrating with monday.com

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with monday.com enables you to track your software subscriptions and to reclaim unused licenses.

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

|Process|Required user role in the monday.com application|Authentication scopes|
|-------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|Download subscriptions|Member|users:read|
|Pull user activity|Member|users:read|

## Create a monday OAuth2 application

Create a monday OAuth2 application to authorize access to the monday.com API.

### Before you begin

monday.com Role required: Refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-monday.md) table.

### About this task

A monday application enables you to build workflows, user experiences, and products on top of the existing monday.com work operating system \(Work OS\). When you configure a monday application to use OAuth2, access is granted to the monday.com API so that it can read and modify user data.

### Procedure

1.  From a web browser, go to [monday.com](https://monday.com/).

2.  Log in using your admin credentials.

3.  Select your profile icon and then select **Developers**.

    The My Apps page opens.

4.  Select **Create App**.

    The Basic Information page for the new application opens.

5.  In the Display Information section, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name of the monday application.|
    |Short Description|Description of the application.|

6.  In the same section, add your own application icon by selecting the auto-generated icon and then selecting an icon image.

    You can also change the icon color by selecting **App Color** and then selecting either a preset or custom color. If you don’t add your own application icon or select an icon color, the application uses the auto-generated icon and default icon color.

7.  In the App Credentials section, copy the values in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields.

    Save them in a secure location for later use.

8.  Select **Save App**.

9.  From the left navigation menu of the new application, navigate to **General** &gt; **OAuth**.

    The **Scopes** tab of the OAuth &amp; Permissions page opens.

10. In the Scopes section, specify how the application can access or use different types of user data by selecting the check box for the **users:read** OAuth scope.

11. Select **Save Feature**.

12. Select the **Redirect URLs** tab of the OAuth &amp; Permissions page.

13. In the Redirect URLs section, enter the URL of the OAuth provider that users are redirected to after authentication.

    Enter `https://*instance*.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`, where &lt;*instance*&gt; is the name of your ServiceNow instance.

14. Select **Save Feature**.


## Create a monday.com integration profile

Create a monday.com integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for your monday applications.

### Before you begin

To create a monday.com integration profile, request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_integrator

**Important:** You must select the **monday.com Spoke** check box for this integration while installing optional features on the [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager.md) page. For more information about choosing the required SaaS applications, see [Request SaaS License Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/request-saas-license-management.md).

### About this task

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the monday.com integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

    The dialog box closes and then you automatically return to the integration profile form.

12. On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

13. After the connection is verified, select **Publish**.

14. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.


### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).
