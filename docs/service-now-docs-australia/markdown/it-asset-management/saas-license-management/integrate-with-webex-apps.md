</table>3.  Review the required user roles or API permissions specified in the **Vendor configuration** field for each process to minimize security risks and optimize SaaS licenses.

    **Note:** For more information, see [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-webex-apps.md) table.

    1.  In the Download Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Cisco Webex Download Subscriptions**.

        **Note:** The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

    2.  In the Calculate Activity Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Cisco Webex Update User Activity**.

        **Note:** The **Download Activity** check box is selected by default. If you clear it, the activity scheduled job **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Activity** isn't created.

        In the **Analyze user activity** field, you can also select the date and time starting from when you want to analyze the user activity. By default, you can analyze user activity up to 60 days prior to the current date and view events performed by individual users from the time you create this profile.

        **Note:** Software Asset Management pulls the events from the time that you start analyzing user activity irrespective of the profile creation date.

        You can modify this value in the Last activity threshold field of your software reclamation rules. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

    3.  In the Reclaim Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Cisco Webex Reclaim Subscription**.

        **Note:** The **Reclaim subscriptions** check box is selected by default. If you don't want to reclaim subscriptions, you can clear this check box. If you clear it, the removal candidates are created but the reclaim subscription subflow isn't triggered or the reclamation process isn't initiated.

4.  Select **Save**.

    A draft integration profile is created.

    In the **Download Subscription Subflow** tab, the **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears and is automatically set to **sn\_cisco\_teams\_spk.CiscoWebexTeams**. In the **Calculate Activity Subflow** tab, the **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears and is automatically set to **sn\_webex\_mtg\_spoke.Webex**.

    **Note:** The automatically populated value in the **Connection &amp; credential** field changes based on the selection in the **Download activity** and **Reclaim subscriptions** check boxes.

    |Selection|Connection &amp; credential value|
    |---------|---------------------------------|
    |Both **Download activity** and **Reclaim subscriptions** are selected.|sn\_cisco\_teams\_spk.webex\_subscription\_activity\_reclaim|
    |Only **Download activity** is selected.|sn\_cisco\_teams\_spk.webex\_subscription\_activity|
    |Only **Reclaim subscriptions** is selected.|sn\_cisco\_teams\_spk.webex\_subscription\_reclaim|
    |Both **Download activity** and **Reclaim subscriptions** aren’t selected.|sn\_cisco\_teams\_spk.webex\_subscription|

5.  In the **Download Subscription Subflow** tab, select the preview icon \[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field and then select **Open Record** in the record preview.

6.  Select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

7.  On the form, fill in the **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret** that you had saved while creating the Webex Teams OAuth application.

    Leave all other fields as is.

8.  Select **Create and Get OAuth Token**.

    **Note:** Make sure you're logged in to your ServiceNow instance using your local admin credentials. Logging in with SSO user credentials might cause the tokens to be generated automatically.

    For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-webex-apps.md) table.

9.  When prompted, log in using your Webex Email address and Password.

10. After the connection is successfully created, navigate to the Webex integration profile.

11. In the **Calculate Activity Subflow** tab, select the preview icon \(\[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] Alt text: Preview icon\) next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field and then select **Open Record** in the record preview.

12. Select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

13. On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_acz_lht_3qb"><thead><tr><th>

Replace &lt;subdomain&gt; with the Webex Meeting site domain configured for the organization.

 Log in to the Webex admin portal and navigate to **SERVICES** &gt; **Meeting** &gt; **Sites**. In the Site name column, &lt;subdomain&gt; is the part of `<subdomain>.webex.com` in the site name.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Webex Admin User Name

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>14. Fill in the **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret** values that you saved while creating the Webex Meetings OAuth application.

15. Select **Create and Get OAuth Token** and follow the steps to get an OAuth token.

    **Note:** For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-webex-apps.md) table.

16. On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions and Calculate Activity APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

17. After the connection is verified, select **Publish**.

18. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.

    **Note:** If you clear the **Download Activity** check box after the integration profile is published, you must revalidate the connections and then republish the integration profile because the following events occur:

    -   The **Status** field on the integration profile form changes to **Draft**.
    -   The **Validate connection** button shows up on the form.
    -   The current **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Activity** job gets deleted.

### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple Cisco Webex integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-webex.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).
