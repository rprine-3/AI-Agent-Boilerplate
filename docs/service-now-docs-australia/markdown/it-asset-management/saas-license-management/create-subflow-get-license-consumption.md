# Create a subflow to get license consumption

Create a subflow to add license consumption data to the Subscription Consumption Summaries \[sam\_saas\_consumption\_summary\] table.

## Before you begin

This subflow is applicable to any integration that uses the SaaS license connection framework, including custom integrations.

</table>4.  Click **Submit**.

    The Flow Designer creates the draft subflow and then redirects you to the subflow configuration page.

5.  From the subflow configuration page, add an integration profile input.

    1.  Under INPUTS &amp; OUTPUTS, click the plus icon \(+\) to add an input for your subflow.

    2.  In the Inputs section, click the plus icon \(+\).

    3.  When prompted, enter the following information for your integration profile input.

        |Label|Name|Type|Mandatory|
        |-----|----|----|---------|
        |Integration profile|integration\_profile|Reference.Integration Profile|Yes|

    4.  Click **Done**.

6.  Add a data stream action for getting license consumption data.

    1.  Under ACTIONS, click the plus icon \(+\) and then select **Action** to add a new action.

    2.  When prompted, select the **Global** spoke from the list of INSTALLED SPOKES.

    3.  From the list of Default actions, select **Get &lt;saas-application&gt; Consumption**.

    4.  Click **Done**.

7.  Add an Upsert Consumption action as a child of the Get &lt;saas-application&gt; Consumption action.

    The Upsert Consumption action uploads license consumption data to the Consumption Summary table on your ServiceNow instance.

    1.  Under the Get &lt;saas-application&gt; Consumption action, click the plus icon \(+\) and then select **Action**.

    2.  When prompted, select **Software Asset Management** from the list of INSTALLED SPOKES.

    3.  From the list of Default actions, select **Upsert Consumption**.

        The Upsert Consumption action inputs appear.

    4.  From the Product \[Software Product\] list, search for and select the software product that you are connecting to with your integration.

        This value must be a reference to the Software Product \(samp\_sw\_product\) table. If the product does not exist in the table, [add a custom software product](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_AddACustomProduct.md).

    5.  Use values from the Data panel to fill in the remaining action inputs.

        Your request to the SaaS API may not return data for all inputs. Fill in the inputs that are applicable to your integration.

        |Field|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |Version|Version of the SaaS application.|
        |Edition|Edition of the SaaS application, such as `Standard` or `Enterprise`.|
        |Unit of consumption|Unit of measure for the software units that can be consumed.|
        |Total units|Total number of software units that you have purchased across all active entitlements for the software product.|
        |Units consumed|Total number of software units that your users have consumed.|
        |Contract start|Start date of your contract.|
        |Contract end|End date of your contract.|

    6.  Click **Done**.

8.  Verify that your subflow is working properly by clicking **Test**.

    View the test results and system logs for details about any errors in your subflow. You can view system logs by navigating to **System Logs** &gt; **System Log** &gt; **All** in your ServiceNow instance.

9.  After verifying that the subflow is working as expected, click **Publish**.

    **Tip:** You can still edit the subflow after it's published.
