# Create a subflow to get user activity

Create a subflow to update the Software Subscription table with each user's most recent activity in the SaaS application.

## Before you begin

This subflow requires a data stream action to get user activity. For more information, see [Create a data stream action to get user activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-data-stream-get-activity.md).

Role required: flow\_designer

</table>4.  Click **Submit**.

5.  Add an integration profile input and a look back time input.

    |Label|Name|Type|Mandatory|
    |-----|----|----|---------|
    |Integration profile|integration\_profile|Reference.Integration Profile|Yes|
    |Look back time|look\_back\_time|Date/Time|Yes|

6.  In the Actions section, click the plus icon and then click **Action** to add a new action.

7.  Select the spoke for the SaaS application that you want to integrate with from the list of installed spokes.

    **Note:** To add additional spokes to your list of installed spokes, request them on the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com). For a complete list of available spokes, see [IntegrationHub available spokes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/spokes-list.md). If there’s no existing spoke for the SaaS application that you want to integrate with, you can [create a new spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-saas-spoke.md).

8.  Select a data stream action to get user activity.

9.  Add the **Look back time** subflow input as the value to pass to the **Look back time** input for the data stream action.

10. Define the values to pass for any user authentication inputs for the data stream action.

11. Add the **Update User Activity If Later Using User** action from the Software Asset Management spoke as a child of the get user activity data stream action.

12. Use values from the Data panel to complete the action.

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Last activity|Date of most recent activity from the targetObject.|
    |Integration profile|Integration profile input that you created for the subflow.|
    |External user id|User id or account id from the user targetObject. This id is generally a numeric and non human-readable value. This value must be unique.|
    |User principal name|Email address from the user targetObject. If an email address isn’t available, use another value such as user name plus user id. This value should be human readable.|

13. If you want to use more than one data stream action to get multiple types of user activity, repeat steps 6 through 12 to add each data stream action to the subflow.

14. Click **Test** to test your subflow.

    1.  View the test results and system logs for details about any errors.

        To view system logs, navigate to **System Logs** &gt; **System Log** &gt; **All**.

15. After verifying that the subflow is working as expected, click **Publish**.

    **Tip:** You can still edit the subflow after it's published.
