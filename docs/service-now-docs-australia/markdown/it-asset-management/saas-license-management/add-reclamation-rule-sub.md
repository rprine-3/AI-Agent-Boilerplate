# Review a software reclamation rule

Use reclamation rules to cancel user subscriptions that have limited to no activity.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin

## About this task

When you create a direct integration profile or connect an SSO application, a reclamation rule is automatically created for the software. It's important that you review the reclamation rule to verify that it meets your specifications. For more information about the reclamation rules for each application, see [Reclamation rules for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/reclamation-rules.md) and [Reclamation rules for Microsoft 365 integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/m365-reclamation-rules.md).

For SSO subscriptions, the reclamation rule checks for user logins.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Reclamation Rules** and select the reclamation rule that corresponds to your integration profile.

2.  On the form, review the fields.
