    16. On the **Configuration** tab, specify whether you want your data columns to display data in either the date only or the date and time format.

        For each applicable data column, select either **Date** \(date only\) or **Timestamp** \(date and time\). After you select the format for each data column, select **OK**.

    17. On the **Filters** tab, select filters to refine the data that is displayed on the report.

    18. Select **Refine Criteria** &gt; **Employee Login Detail** &gt; **Last Login**.

        A pop-up displays with the Define last login filter.

    19. Select the **By Rule** &gt; **Add rule** tab.

    20. From the drop-down list, select the **Greater than** option.

    21. Enter the date from when you want to generate the report.

        You must select a date not older than a couple of weeks to keep the file size within allowed limits.

    22. Select **Done** after you select the filters.

    23. Select **Generate**.

    24. In the Download section of the generated report, select **Excel** to export the report as an Excel file.

        **Note:** The Excel file must not be greater than 5 MB.

    25. Return to your SAP SuccessFactors integration profile form.

    26. On the Integration Profile form header, select the Manage Attachments icon \(\[Omitted image "manage-attachments-icon.png"\] Alt text: Manage attachments icon.\).

    27. In the Attachments dialog box, select **Choose file** to locate and select your user login report.

    28. After the report uploads successfully, close the dialog box to return to the integration profile form.

6.  After the form reloads, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions and Calculate Activity APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

7.  After the connection is verified, select **Publish**.

8.  In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.

    **Note:** If you clear the **Download Activity** check box after the integration profile is published, you must revalidate the connections and then republish the integration profile because the following events occur:

    -   The **Status** field on the integration profile form changes to **Draft**.
    -   The **Validate connection** button shows up on the form.
    -   The current **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Activity** job gets deleted.
    By default, the activity job runs every one hour and deletes the file attached to the integration profile as part of the clean-up. If the file isn't found, the activity job fails to indicate no new attachment. The job failure has no impact on the already updated last activity.

    If you plan to attach the file once everyday or once a week, you can update the run time of the **SAM - Refresh Success Factors Activity** scheduled job accordingly. You can also run this job on demand whenever you attach a file.

    You must attach a file every time for the job to run because SAP SuccessFactors doesn’t have an API for activity data pull.


### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

**Important:** Child aliases and alias overrides aren't supported for the **SuccessFactors Update User Activity** subflow because this subflow doesn't use REST steps directly where aliases are required.

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.
