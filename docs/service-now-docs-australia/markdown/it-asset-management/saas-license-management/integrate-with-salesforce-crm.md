# Integrating with Salesforce CRM

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the Salesforce customer relationship management \(CRM\) services enable you to track your software subscriptions and to reclaim unused licenses.

**Note:**

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, use SaaS Playbook for integrating your ServiceNow instance with the Salesforce CRM. For more information about creating a Salesforce CRM integration profile through Playbook, see [Create a Salesforce CRM integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/playbook-salesforce-crm.md).

The supported Salesforce CRM services include

-   Salesforce Sales Cloud
-   Salesforce Service Cloud
-   Salesforce Platform
-   Salesforce Customer Community
-   Salesforce Partner Community
-   Salesforce Company Community
-   Salesforce Chatter

**Note:** For Experience Cloud login-based licenses such as Customer Community and Partner Community, the integration imports Daily Unique Logins \(once per user per day\) as consumption. This metric aligns with the Salesforce contractual licensing model used for compliance calculations and overage determinations. The total login event count shown in Salesforce isn't imported, as it isn't used for licensing compliance calculations.

Both Salesforce Classic and Salesforce Lightning organizations are supported.

**Note:** You can use custom license metrics to track entitlements for services that aren’t based on user subscriptions. For more details on how to create a custom license metric, see [Add a custom license metric](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/add-custom-license-metric.md).

The Salesforce account that you use to connect the integration requires a Salesforce user license and the following user access permissions.

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

## Create a Salesforce CRM integration profile

Create an integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for the Salesforce CRM services.

**Note:** You must create Salesforce CRM integration only in the Global scope.

### Create your first Salesforce CRM integration profile

Create an integration profile for the first Salesforce organization for which you want to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing.

#### Before you begin

To create a Salesforce CRM integration profile, request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_integrator

**Important:** You must select the **Software Asset Management integration with Salesforce CRM** check box for this integration while installing optional features on the [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager.md) page. For more information about choosing the required SaaS applications, see [Request SaaS License Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/request-saas-license-management.md).

#### About this task

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the Salesforce CRM integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, use SaaS Playbook for integrating your ServiceNow instance with Salesforce CRM. For more information about creating a Salesforce CRM integration profile through Playbook, see [Create a Salesforce CRM integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/playbook-salesforce-crm.md).

#### Procedure

1.  Navigate to the integration profile.

    1.  In the Download Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Salesforce CRM Download Subscriptions**.

        **Note:** The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

    2.  In the Reclaim Subscription Subflow section, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Salesforce CRM Reclaim Subscription**.

        **Note:** The **Reclaim subscriptions** check box is selected by default. If you don't want to reclaim subscriptions, you can clear this check box. If you clear it, the removal candidates are created but the reclaim subscription subflow isn't triggered or the reclamation process isn't initiated.

    3.  On the **Download Consumption Subflow** tab, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Salesforce CRM Download Consumption**.

4.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** The Calculate Activity Subflow isn’t required for Salesforce CRM integrations because these integrations use information about last user login from the user records.

    Your instance creates a draft integration profile. You can view consumption counts for the specific consumption based Salesforce CRM application.

    The **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears and is automatically set to **sn\_sforce\_v2\_spoke.Salesforce**.

5.  Open the connection &amp; credential aliases record by selecting the preview icon \[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field to configure the child alias.

6.  Select **Open Record** in the record preview.

7.  On the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases form, select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

This is generally the URL of the ServiceNow instance that you specified in [Register a Salesforce application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-salesforce-crm.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>9.  Select **Create and Get OAuth Token**.

    **Note:** For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-salesforce-crm.md) table.

10. In the OAuth2 dialog box, log in to the same Salesforce admin account that you used to create your Salesforce application.

    **Tip:** If the dialog box doesn’t open automatically, check to make sure that pop-ups are allowed on your browser.

    If you have selected **Client Credentials** as the grant type, the OAuth2 dialog box doesn't appear.

    Your ServiceNow instance creates an OAuth token for Salesforce.

11. Return to your integration profile by navigating to **SaaS License** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Direct Integration Profiles** and then selecting the profile from the Integration Profiles list.

12. On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

13. After the connection is verified, select **Publish**.

14. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.


#### Result

After you publish the integration profile, your ServiceNow instance begins retrieving data from your Salesforce CRM services. For organizations with fewer than 100 users, this process typically takes only a few minutes to complete. For organizations with 100–5000 users, this process can take around 15 minutes to complete. For organizations with over 5000 users, this process can take over one hour to complete.

#### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).

        **Note:** The **Reclaim subscriptions** check box is selected by default. If you don't want to reclaim subscriptions, you can clear this check box. If you clear it, the removal candidates are created but the reclaim subscription subflow isn't triggered or the reclamation process isn't initiated.

    3.  On the **Download Consumption Subflow** tab, verify that the **Subflow** field is set to **Salesforce CRM Download Consumption**.

4.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** The Calculate Activity subflow isn’t required for Salesforce CRM integrations because these integrations use information about last user logins from the user records.

    Your instance creates a draft integration profile. You can view consumption counts for the specific consumption based Salesforce CRM application.

    The **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears and is automatically set to **sn\_sforce\_v2\_spoke.Salesforce**.

5.  Select the preview icon \[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field to open the connection &amp; credential aliases record.

6.  Select **Open Record** in the record preview.

7.  On the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases form, create a child alias that can uniquely identify the connection and credentials for this integration profile.

    The first Salesforce CRM integration profile that you create uses the default \(parent\) connection and credential alias for Salesforce. Each additional Salesforce CRM integration profile that you create requires a unique child alias that helps differentiate the connection and credentials between each integration profile.

    1.  Select the link under **Child Aliases** &gt; **Parentalias=\*\*\*** to add child aliases.

    2.  Select **New**.

        The Connection &amp; Credential Aliases form for the child alias opens.

    3.  Enter a name for the child alias in the **Name** field.

    4.  Select and hold \(or right-click\) the form header and then select **Save**.

    5.  After the form reloads, select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

    6.  In the Create Connection and Credential dialog box, fill in the fields.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    7.  Select **Create and Get OAuth Token**.

        **Note:** For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-salesforce-crm.md) table.

    8.  In the OAuth2 dialog box, log in to the same Salesforce admin account that you used to register your Salesforce application.

        **Tip:** If the dialog box doesn’t open automatically, check to make sure that pop-ups are allowed on your browser.

        If you have selected **Client Credentials** as the grant type, the OAuth2 dialog box doesn't appear.

        Your ServiceNow instance creates an OAuth token for Salesforce.

8.  Return to your integration profile by navigating to **SaaS License** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Direct Integration Profiles** and then selecting the profile from the Integration Profiles list.

9.  In the **Connection &amp; Credential** field of the Integration Profile form, select the lookup icon to locate and select the child alias that you created in [step 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrate-with-salesforce-crm.md).

    Selecting the child alias associates the alias with the integration profile. Your ServiceNow instance uses this alias to identify the connection and credentials for this integration profile.

10. On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

11. After the connection is verified, select **Publish**.

12. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.


#### Result

After you publish the integration profile, your ServiceNow instance begins retrieving data from your Salesforce CRM services. For organizations with fewer than 100 users, this process typically takes only a few minutes to complete. For organizations with 100-5000 users, this process can take around 15 minutes to complete. For organizations with over 5000 users, this process can take over one hour to complete.

#### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.
