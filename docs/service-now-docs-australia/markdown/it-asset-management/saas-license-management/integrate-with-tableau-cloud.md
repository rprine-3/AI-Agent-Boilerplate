# Integrating with Tableau Cloud

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the Tableau Cloud application enables you to track your software subscriptions and to reclaim stale licenses.

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

|Process|Required user role in the Tableau Cloud application|Authentication scopes|

|Download subscriptions|site administrator|None|
|Pull user activity|site administrator|None|
|Reclaim subscription|site administrator|None|

## Register a Tableau Cloud application

Register a Tableau Cloud application through the Tableau Cloud admin portal.

### Before you begin

-   Activate the Tableau spoke. For more information, see [Tableau spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/tableau-spoke.md).
-   Tableau Cloud Role required: site administrator

### Procedure

1.  Use one of the following authentication types to validate ServiceNow instance requests with Tableau Cloud.

    -   Personal Access Token \(PAT\)
    -   JSON Web Token \(JWT\)
    1.  Validate ServiceNow instance requests with Tableau Cloud using the PAT authentication type.

        1.  Log in to the Tableau Cloud account using admin credentials.
        2.  Select your profile icon.
        3.  Select **My Account Settings**.
        4.  Scroll down to the **Personal Access Tokens** section on your profile page.
        5.  In the text field, provide a token name.

            For example, `Test 1`.

        6.  Select **Create Token**.

            The Personal Access Token is generated with a Token name and Secret.

        7.  To copy the Personal Access Token Secret, select **Copy Secret**.

            **Important:**

            Keep the Personal Access Token Secret at a secure place. You would need it when you create a connection record for Tableau.

    2.  Validate ServiceNow instance requests with Tableau Cloud using the JWT authentication type.

        1.  Log in to the Tableau Cloud account using admin credentials.
        2.  Select your profile icon.
        3.  From the left-pane, select **Settings**.
        4.  Select the **Connected Apps** tab.
        5.  On the Connected Apps page, select the **Direct Trust** option from the **New Connected Apps** drop-down list.
        6.  In the **Create Connected App** dialog box, fill in the Connected app name, Access level, and Domain allow list details.
        7.  Select **Create**.

            The Connected App that you created gets displayed on the Connected Apps page. By default, the Connected App is inactive.

        8.  To enable the Connected App, select the ellipsis icon \[Omitted image "ellipsis-horizontal-outline-24.svg"\] next to the Connected App name and then select **Enable**.

            The status of the Connected App shows as enabled.

        9.  Select the Connected App name.

            Keep the Secret ID and Secret value at a secure place. You would need it when you create a connection record for Tableau.

        10. To copy the Client ID, select **Copy Client ID**.

            Keep the Client ID at a secure place. You would need it when you create a connection record for Tableau.

11. Select **Publish**.

12. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.


### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-recon-workspace.md).
