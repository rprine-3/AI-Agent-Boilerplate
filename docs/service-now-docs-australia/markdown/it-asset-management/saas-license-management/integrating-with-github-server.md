# Integrate with GitHub Enterprise Server

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the GitHub Enterprise Server application help you track your software subscriptions and reclaim unused licenses.

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

|Process|Required user role in the GitHub Enterprise Server application|Authentication scopes|
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|Download subscriptions|site admininistrator|site\_admin|
|Reclaim subscription|site admininistrator|site\_admin|

## Generate an API access token for GitHub Enterprise Server

Generate a token that you can use to access the GitHub Enterprise Server API.

### Before you begin

GitHub Role required: site administrator

### About this task

The GitHub repository hosting service uses personal access tokens to grant users access to the GitHub API. Personal access tokens function similarly to OAuth access tokens by authorizing API requests. By generating a personal access token to authorize your GitHub Enterprise Server API requests, you can gain access to the GitHub Enterprise Server API.

### Procedure

1.  From a web browser, open your GitHub Enterprise Server instance.

2.  Sign in to your GitHub account.

3.  On the GitHub page header, select your profile photo and then select **Settings**.

    Your profile settings open.

4.  From the left navigation pane, select **Developer Settings**.

    Your developer settings open.

5.  From the left navigation pane, select **Personal access tokens**.

6.  On the Personal access tokens page, select **Generate new token**.

7.  If you’re prompted to confirm your password before proceeding, enter your GitHub password and then select **Confirm password**.

8.  On the New personal access token form, describe the purpose of the token in the **Note** field.

9.  In the Select scopes form section, enable the site\_admin OAuth scope by selecting the **site\_admin** check box.

    OAuth scopes limit the level of access that the application has to your protected resources. The site\_admin OAuth scope enables you to manage your enterprise users, organizations, and repositories.

10. Select **Generate token**.

    Your personal access token generates.

11. Copy the access token and save it in a secure location for later use.


## Create a GitHub Enterprise Server integration profile

Create a GitHub Enterprise Server integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for your GitHub Enterprise Server applications.

### Before you begin

To create a GitHub Enterprise Server integration profile, request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

ServiceNow Role required: sam\_integrator

**Important:** You must select the **GitHub Spoke** check box for this integration while installing optional features on the [Application Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/application-manager.md) page. For more information about choosing the required SaaS applications, see [Request SaaS License Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/request-saas-license-management.md).

### About this task

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the GitHub Server integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

</table>3.  In the Process configuration section, review the required user roles or API permissions specified in the **Vendor configuration** field for each process to minimize security risks and optimize SaaS licenses.

    **Note:** For more information about the required roles and scopes, see [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrating-with-github-server.md) table.

    -   The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

    -   **Note:** The **Download Activity** check box is selected by default. If you clear it, the activity scheduled job **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Activity** isn't created.

        In the **Analyze user activity** field, you can also select the date and time starting from when you want to analyze the user activity. By default, you can analyze user activity up to 60 days prior to the current date and view events performed by individual users from the time you create this profile.

        **Note:** Software Asset Management pulls the events from the time that you start analyzing user activity irrespective of the profile creation date.

        You can modify this value in the Last activity threshold field of your software reclamation rules. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

    -   The **Reclaim subscriptions** check box is selected by default. If you don't want to reclaim subscriptions, you can clear this check box. If you clear it, the removal candidates are created but the reclaim subscription subflow isn't triggered or the reclamation process isn't initiated.

4.  Select **Save**.

    Your ServiceNow instance creates a draft integration profile.

    The **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears and is automatically set to **sn\_github\_spoke.GitHub\_Server**.

5.  Open the connection &amp; credential aliases record by selecting the preview icon \[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] next to the **Connection &amp; Credential** field and then selecting **Open Record** in the record preview.

6.  On the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases form, select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

7.  In the Create Connection and Credential dialog box, fill in the fields.

The &lt;*api-key*&gt; is the personal access token that you generated in [Generate an API access token for GitHub Enterprise Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/integrating-with-github-server.md).

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>8.  Select **Create**.

9.  On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    Validating the connection verifies the Download Subscriptions and Calculate Activity APIs, but not the Reclaim Subscriptions APIs.

10. After the connection is validated, select **Publish**.

11. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.

    **Note:** If you clear the **Download Activity** check box after the integration profile is published, you must revalidate the connections and then republish the integration profile because the following events occur:

    -   The **Status** field on the integration profile form changes to **Draft**.
    -   The **Validate connection** button shows up on the form.
    -   The current **SAM - Refresh &lt;displayname&gt; Activity** job gets deleted.

### What to do next

After the integration connects, your ServiceNow instance automatically creates software models, reclamation rules, and software subscriptions that are refreshed daily.

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists. If all of the following related lists aren't visible for an integration profile in the default view, you can select the custom integration view from the Details tab:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Review all automatically generated reclamation rules to reclaim user subscriptions. For more information, see [Review a software reclamation rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/add-reclamation-rule-sub.md).

Create software entitlements for the automatically generated software models to track used software against owned software.

-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management Core UI, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/track-software-rights.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
-   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.
