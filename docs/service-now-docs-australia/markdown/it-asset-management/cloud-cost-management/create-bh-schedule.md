# Create Business hours schedule

Create and apply a Business hours schedule to the cloud resources for enforcing the on/off schedule.

## Before you begin

Role required: insights\_admin or insights\_owner

## About this task

**Important:** Starting with Cloud Cost Management v11.0.0, the `sn_change_write` role is no longer inherited by the insights\_admin and insights\_owner roles. Both roles now inherit the `sn_change_read` role instead. As a result, users with these roles can view change requests that are created when a recommendation is scheduled, but they can't create change requests directly. To schedule recommendations, configure a change creator user before using the Recommendations module. For more information, see.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Business hours schedules**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
