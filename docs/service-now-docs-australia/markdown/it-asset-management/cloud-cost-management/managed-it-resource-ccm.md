# Managed IT Resource types

There are three IT Resource categories in ServiceNow Cloud Cost Management - Server, PaaS Resources, and IaaS Storage.

-   Server is any physical or virtual server that is represented as a configuration item \(CI\) in the CMDB tables listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Cloud Cost Management application. Server includes virtual machines in AWS, Azure, or GCP.
-   PaaS Resources are cloud-based platform services that are represented as a CI in the CMDB tables listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Cloud Cost Management application. PaaS resources include databases.
-   IaaS Storage is any cloud-based infrastructure service represented as a CI in a CMDB table listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Cloud Cost Management application. IaaS resources include storage volumes.

</table>An example for calculating license resource consumption:

Suppose your organization manages 2 servers, 3 databases or PaaS resources, and 3 storage volumes or IaaS resources.

The total number of license resource units consumed is: \(2 + 1 + 1\) = 4 resource units.

To calculate cost, multiply each resource count by the applicable per-unit rate from your entitlement. For example, at a rate of n per resource unit: \(2\*n\) + \(1\*n\) + \(1\*n\) = 4n.
