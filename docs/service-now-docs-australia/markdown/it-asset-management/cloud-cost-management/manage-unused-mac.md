# Manage unused resources

Reduce cost by identifying the unused resources and scheduling jobs to power-off or terminate the unused resources.

You can [configure Unused resources operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/um-settings-config-cloudin.md) by selecting **Settings**.

New

</td><td>

Resources that are candidates for Unused resources. Each successful execution of a Billing Download job triggers the Budget Forecast, Business Hours, Commitments, Rightsizing, and Unused resources jobs to analyze the spend and usage data of resources and to update the actionable recommendations in reports.**Note:** Microsoft Azure only: The Azure Advisor service generates the recommendations that appear in Rightsizing and Unused resources reports. Cloud Cost Management doesn’t generate the recommendations.

-   Microsoft Azure: Recommendation from the Azure Advisor service.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Confidence

</td><td>

The confidence level in a recommendation.-   High confidence requires the following conditions:
    -   The system has at least 10 days of usage data for the resource.
    -   The current and recommended family or generation is identical.
-   Medium confidence requires the following conditions:
    -   The system has less than 10 days of usage data for the resource.
    -   The current and recommended family or generation is identical.
-   Low confidence: The current and recommended family/generation are different.

</table>-   **[Configure Unused resources operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/um-settings-config-cloudin.md)**  
The Unused resources feature recommends termination or power-off for resources that are wasting money because they aren’t being used. Configure Unused resources processes and specify the potential savings that trigger notifications.
-   **[Schedule unused resources to be powered off or terminated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/um-schedule-job-cloudin.md)**  
To terminate or power off an unused resource, add it to an Unused resources job, specify whether to terminate or power off, and specify when the job should run. You can also move resources from one scheduled job to a different job.
-   **[Move a resource to a different Unused resources job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/um-change-job-cloudin.md)**  
You can add resources to a currently scheduled job, move resources from one job to another, or remove resources from a job.
-   **[Exclude a resource from Unused resources analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/um-exclude-resource-cloudin.md)**  
To ensure that a particular resource is not considered or recommended for Unused resources, add the resource to the Excluded Resources list. The system continues to collect cost and usage data but does not consider the resource for the processes of Unused resources.
-   **[View or edit scheduled and completed Unused resources jobs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/view-um-scheduled-jobs.md)**  
View and manage the upcoming and completed Unused resources jobs.
