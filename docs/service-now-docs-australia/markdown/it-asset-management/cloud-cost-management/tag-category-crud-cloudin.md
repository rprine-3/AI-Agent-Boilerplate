Create a tag category to enable multiple tag names for representing costs against a single business entity. For example, multiple users might independently have created the tag names "App", "AppService", and "appl" to indicate applications. With a tag category of "Application", any costs for items tagged App, AppService, or appl are correctly assigned as costs against an application.

## Before you begin

Role required: insights\_admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\]

## About this task

This procedure describes the process as performed from the user interface. Alternatively, to speed the process, you can edit the affected tables directly.

-   Tag Category \[sn\_cld\_intg\_core\_tag\_category\]
-   Tag Name-Category \[sn\_cld\_intg\_core\_tag\_name\_category\]

**Note:** Each successful execution of a Billing Download job updates tagged costs. Recent updates that you make to tag category definitions might not reflect ton the cost reports. To apply the latest tag category definitions to cost data without running a Billing Download job, select **Reapply categories** by navigating to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Cost usage tags** &gt; **Tag categories**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Cost usage tags** &gt; **Tag categories**.

2.  On the Tag Categories list, select **New**.

    For the list of default tag categories, see [List of default tag categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/default-tag-categories.md).

    **Note:** In this step, you add a single tag name to the category to create the initial category record. You can add any number of tag names to the category later.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
