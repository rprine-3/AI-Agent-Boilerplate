# Schedule and manage the Cloud Cost Management jobs that download Google Cloud price sheets

A Price Sheet Download job downloads and stores price sheet data.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have the proper credentials and service account setup.

Role required: insights\_admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\].

## About this task

-   You create a scheduled Price Sheet Download job for each provider.
-   A single API fetches the Price Sheet details for all regions at once.
-   When the scheduled time arrives, job execution happens in multiple stages \(for example, connect to the provider, download the data, perform the post-import sort, and so on\). The system logs status and results on the Price Sheet Executions page for each stage.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Price sheet download jobs**.

2.  Select **New**.
