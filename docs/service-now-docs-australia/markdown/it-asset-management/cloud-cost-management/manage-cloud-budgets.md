# Manage cloud budgets

Define and monitor custom budget plans for managing your cloud spend by using the Budget view in the Cloud Cost Management Workspace.

**Parent Topic:**[Using Cloud Cost Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/using-cloud-insights.md)

## Create or update a budget policy

Create budget policy to specify a budgeted amount, cost type, reset period, and other aspects of the budget. In addition, specify who can view budget data and who is notified of variances from the budgeted amount.

### Before you begin

-   A cloud account \(parent account\) that has at least one service account and associated datacenters is required.
-   A Billing Download job must be defined.

    **Note:** For Microsoft Azure, you must first execute a Billing Download job before defining a budget plan.


Role required: insights\_admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\] or insights\_owner \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_owner\] for owned service accounts.

### About this task

You must select one of the Cloud Cost Management application scopes to create or update a budget policy.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Budget**.

2.  Select **Create budget**.

3.  On the Budget policy creation form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [List of Budget policy creation fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/budget-policy-fields.md).

4.  Select **Submit**.


### Result

After you create or modify a budget policy, the policies get displayed on the **All Budgets** page in the Budgets view. Find the details of the budget such as overrun, surplus, or invalid budgets. You can view only the overrun budgets by toggling the **Show overrun budget only** toggle button. Search a budget by its name, owner, or provider.
