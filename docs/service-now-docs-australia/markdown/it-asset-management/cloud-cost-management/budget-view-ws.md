# Budget view

Understand budget compliance by groups and service accounts can significantly improve oversight and reduce cloud spend.

**Important:** If you have the insights\_owner role, only the accounts that are assigned to you appear in the filters and data.

Use the Budget view to:

-   View your total budget and spend on your cloud assets.
-   Analyze your future spend and understand if you're within or over the budget.
-   Manage your cloud spend, you can define and monitor custom Budget plans.
-   Create and manage a budget policy. For more information, see [Create or update a budget policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/manage-cloud-budgets.md).
