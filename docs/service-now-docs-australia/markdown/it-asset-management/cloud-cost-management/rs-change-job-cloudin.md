# Move a resource to a different Rightsizing job

You can add resources to a currently scheduled job, move resources from one job to another, or remove resources from a job.

## Before you begin

Run Discovery on each service account.

Ensure that the Billing Download job has completed for each provider.

Ensure that the Price Sheet Download job has completed for each provider.

Role required: insights\_admin or insights\_owner

## About this task

When you change the resources that are included in a job, the app checks for the following conditions:

-   A resource in the job is owned by another user \(as when a insights\_admin updates a job that was created by an insights\_owner or an insights\_owner updates a job that was created by a different insights\_owner\).
-   The job was created by another user.

If either condition is met, the app sends an email notification to the owner of the resource or the creator of the job.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Recommendations** &gt; **Rightsizing**.

2.  In the list on the appropriate tab, select the check boxes for the resources to rightsize.

    -   On the **New Recommendations** tab, select **Schedule**.
    -   On the **Declined Recommendations** tab or the **Failed Recommendations** tab, select **Reschedule**.
3.  In the dialog box, fill in the fields.
