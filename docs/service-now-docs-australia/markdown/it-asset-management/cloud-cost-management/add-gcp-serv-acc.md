# Add a Google Cloud service account

Add a Google Cloud service account to store the credential and access information.

## Before you begin

Role required: discovery\_admin or sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

Set up download jobs for billing and price sheet data for the service account.

## About this task

A service account is a secure record on your instance that stores the credential and access information for your provider account. Discovery uses the information to access your provider account to get data on each resource in each specified datacenter. A cloud account can include multiple service accounts — even service accounts from different providers. For each service account, you specify which datacenters to include in the cloud account.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Service accounts**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
