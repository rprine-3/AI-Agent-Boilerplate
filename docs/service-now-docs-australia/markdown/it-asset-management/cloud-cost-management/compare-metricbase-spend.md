# Compare MetricBase data with spend data

Compare MetricBase \(Clotho\) data with your Spend data for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) to diagnose and troubleshoot Cloud Cost Management billing issues.

## Before you begin

Role required: Cloud Insights Admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\]

Request the MetricBase \[com.snc.clotho\] plugin. For more information, see [Requesting the MetricBase product](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/request-metricbase.md).

Verify that the Billing Download job has been completed successfully for the cloud provider.

## About this task

**Important:** This feature is available with the Cloud Cost Management 8.0.0 version or later.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Tools**.

2.  Select **Compare MetricBase with spend data**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

A request with a unique number gets created and a CSV file is attached to the request item, which lists the comparison data. The process to generate the CSV file runs in the background and the file is attached to the request item when the processing is complete.

If there are any errors, the **Work notes** field of this request item is updated and Cloud Cost Management doesn't generate the CSV file.

## What to do next

Select the **Requested Items** tab and then select the Requested Items number to navigate to the CSV file. In the Attachments section, you can find the CSV file. Download this file to analyze any mismatch in the cost values from both of the sources. You can also filter the data according to your requirements.
