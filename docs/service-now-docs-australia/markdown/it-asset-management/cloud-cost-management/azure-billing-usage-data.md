# Set up access to Microsoft Azure billing and usage data

Set up access to Microsoft Azure billing and usage data depending on your agreement type.

You can access the billing and usage data, by assigning an appropriate role to the Microsoft Azure service principal, depending on your agreement type: Enterprise Agreement \(EA\), Microsoft Customer Agreement \(MCA\), or Microsoft Partner Agreement \(MPA\). Accordingly, some of the following steps might be optional for you.
