Total spend that is budgeted for the time period that is specified by the Granularity value.**Calculated**

Behaves in the same way as the default currency field type. Whenever conversions are performed, the system uses the latest currency conversion rates. The amount appears in the session currency for the user.

**Fixed**The amount displays in the currency code that you used when you entered the Amount value. Conversions use the latest currency conversion rates.

**Multiple**Enables you to enter multiple amounts using a different currency for each amount. The field value is the value entered in the user’s session currency. Otherwise, the first value entered converts to the user’s session currency. Conversions use the latest currency rates.

**Note:** The first amount entered is used during display. The other values aren’t used to perform calculations.

The session currency for the instance determines the numbers that a user sees on budget reports. If the currency you specify in the Budget plan differs from the session currency, then the amount displays in the reports in two fields:

-   **Budgeted amount**: The money amount expressed in the currency used in the plan.
-   **Converted budget amount**: The same money amount, expressed in the session currency.
