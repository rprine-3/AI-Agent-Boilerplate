# Spend analytics

The Spend analytics page gives you visibility of your cloud spending data across multiple report types, including cloud spend, Kubernetes spend, and shared cost. Use saved views to store and reload your preferred filter configurations, including cost type, time range, and group-by selections.

**Important:** If you have the Insights owner \(insights\_owner\) role, only the accounts that are assigned to you appear in the filters and data.

Selecting any bar on the spend report navigates you to the list view of the corresponding report. The following roles can perform actions on spend views:

-   Spend admin \(spend\_admin\) and Spend owner \(spend\_owner\): can create, update, share, favorite, and delete views. These roles can also modify the system property sn\_cld\_spend\_core.favourite\_views\_limit.
-   Spend user \(spend\_user\): can create, update, favorite, and delete their own views. This role can read but not modify the system property sn\_cld\_spend\_core.favourite\_views\_limit.

Access the Spend analytics page by navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Spend** &gt; **Spend analytics**.
