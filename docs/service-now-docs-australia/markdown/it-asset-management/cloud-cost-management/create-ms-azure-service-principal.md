# Create a Microsoft Azure service principal

Give Cloud Cost Management access to Microsoft Azure billing and usage data by creating a Microsoft Azure service principal.

## Before you begin

Microsoft Azure Role required: Azure Cloud admin

## About this task

Cloud Cost Management supports Microsoft Azure billing and cost usage data for multiple types of billing agreements: Enterprise Agreement \(EA\), Microsoft Customer Agreement \(MCA\), and Microsoft Partner Agreement \(MPA\). There are specific roles that you must assign to the service principal depending on your billing agreement type. For more information on agreement types, see [Billing information for Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/manage-billing-access).

## Procedure

1.  From a web browser, open the [App Registrations page](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps=true#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) of the Microsoft Entra ID portal.

2.  Log in using your global administrator credentials.

3.  In the **Name** field of the Register an application form, enter a name for the application.

4.  In the **Supported account types** field, select **Accounts in any organizational directory \(Any Microsoft Entra ID – Single tenant\)**.

5.  Select **Register**.

    The application is registered and you’re redirected to the Overview page of the new application.

6.  On the Overview page, copy the values in the **Application \(client\) ID** and **Directory \(tenant\) ID** fields.

    Save them in a secure location for later use.

7.  Generate a Client secret for your application.

    1.  From the side navigation menu, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Certificates &amp; secrets**.

    2.  In the Client secrets section, generate a client secret for the application by selecting **New client secret**.

    3.  In the dialog box, fill in the fields.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    4.  Select **Add**.

    5.  Copy the client secret that is generated and save at a secure location for later use.

8.  Get **Subscription ID** to enable the service principal to work with various Azure subscriptions.

    1.  Navigate to **Subscriptions**.

    2.  Select the **Subscription ID** to which the service principal needs access.

    3.  Copy the **Subscription ID** from the Subscription Overview page and secure it for later use.

        You require the **Subscription ID** while adding an Azure service account.

9.  Assign access roles and permissions to the service principal depending on your billing agreement type.

    Refer to the table for required roles and permissions for the service principal.
