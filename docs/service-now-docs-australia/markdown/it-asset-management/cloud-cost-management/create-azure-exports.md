# Create exports on the Azure portal

Create exports for your Azure service account to download Azure billing data.

## Before you begin

Roles required:

-   For Enterprise Agreement \(EA\): Enterprise administrator, Storage Account Contributor
-   For Microsoft Customer Agreement \(MCA\): Billing account owner or contributor, Storage Account Contributor
-   For Subscriptions \(EA/MCA/MPA\): contributor, Storage Account Contributor

## About this task

When you're using the Azure Export method to download billing data, you must create an export for your service account on the Azure portal to export billing data to your ServiceNow storage account.

Cloud Cost Management 10.0 and later versions support the FOCUS billing format in addition to the Cloud Native billing format. You must create exports for your Azure service account with the appropriate cost template.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for **Cost Management**.

2.  Select a billing account scope.

3.  Select **Exports**.

4.  Select **+ Create**.

5.  On the Basics tab, select one of the following templates.

    -   For the Cloud Native billing format, create exports with the **Cost and usage \(actual\)** and **Cost and usage \(amortized\)** templates to ensure accuracy of billing data.
    -   For the FOCUS billing format, create exports with the **Cost and usage \(FOCUS\)** to ensure efficient billing data management.
