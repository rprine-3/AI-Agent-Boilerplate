# Resize resources with Rightsizing

Gain better visibility of resource usage by identifying your over-provisioned or underused resources, configuring rightsizing operations, implementing rightsizing recommendations, and performing various rightsizing operations.

You can [configure Rightsizing operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/rs-settings-config-cloudin.md) by selecting **Settings**.

Resources that are candidates for Rightsizing. Each successful execution of a Billing Download job triggers the Rightsizing jobs to analyze spend and usage data and to update the actionable recommendations in reports.

Failed

</td><td>

Resources for which the Rightsizing operation wasn’t successful. For failed attempts, the Rightsizing operation performs a rollback as described in [AWS only – Rollback on failed Rightsizing attempts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/rs-rollback-cloudin.md).

Monthly savings

</td><td>

Potential savings if the resource is resized to the Recommended size.

Provider

</td><td>

The provider that hosts the resource.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Current size

</td><td>

Size of the resource that was analyzed for Rightsizing, the size that you’re currently paying for.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Recommended size

</td><td>

-   AWS: The size that is operationally and cost-wise most appropriate for the resource, based on the analysis of provisioning and usage levels over the last 14 days.
-   Microsoft Azure: Recommendation from the Azure Advisor service.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Override size

</td><td>

Size to use instead of the recommended size. By default, the system uses the Recommended size when Rightsizing. Specify a different size by specifying an Override size.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Rationale

</td><td>

The reason that the system recommends resizing.-   AWS: Based on Cloud Cost Management analysis of provisioning and usage levels over the last 14 days.
-   Microsoft Azure: Recommendation from the Azure Advisor service.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Confidence

</td><td>

The confidence level in a recommendation.-   High confidence requires the following conditions:
    -   The system has at least 10 days of usage data for the resource.
    -   The current and recommended family or generation is identical.
-   Medium confidence requires the following conditions:
    -   The system has less than 10 days of usage data for the resource.
    -   The current and recommended family or generation is identical.
-   Low confidence: The current and recommended family/generation are different.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Account

</td><td>

Configure Rightsizing processes and specify the amount of potential rightsizing savings that triggers notifications.
-   **[Schedule resources to be rightsized](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/rs-schedule-job-cloudin.md)**  
To rightsize a resource, add it to a Rightsizing job and specify when the job should run. You can also move resources out of one scheduled job into a different job or remove a resource from a job.
-   **[Move a resource to a different Rightsizing job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/rs-change-job-cloudin.md)**  
You can add resources to a currently scheduled job, move resources from one job to another, or remove resources from a job.
-   **[Exclude a resource from Rightsizing analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/rs-exclude-resource-cloudin.md)**  
To ensure that a particular resource is not considered or recommended for Rightsizing, add the resource to the Excluded Resources list. The system continues to collect cost and usage data but does not consider the resource for Rightsizing.
-   **[View or edit scheduled and completed Rightsizing jobs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/view-rs-scheduled-jobs.md)**
