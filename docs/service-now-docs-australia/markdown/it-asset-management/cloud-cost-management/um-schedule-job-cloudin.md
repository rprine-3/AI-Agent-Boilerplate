# Schedule unused resources to be powered off or terminated

To terminate or power off an unused resource, add it to an Unused resources job, specify whether to terminate or power off, and specify when the job should run. You can also move resources from one scheduled job to a different job.

## Before you begin

Run Discovery on each service account.

Ensure that the Billing Download job has completed for each provider.

Ensure that the Price Sheet Download job has completed for each provider.

Role required: insights\_admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\] or insights\_owner \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_owner\]

## About this task

**Important:** After an Unused resources job powers off or terminates a machine, the machine is added to the Excluded Resources list for Business Hours. This process ensures that the resource isn't started again in the future because it matches a Business Hours policy. The exclusion reason on the Business Hours **Excluded Resources** tab indicates that the resource is an unused resource.

When you change the resources that are included in a job, the app checks for the following conditions:

-   A resource in the job is owned by another user \(as when a insights\_admin updates a job that was created by an insights\_owner or an insights\_owner updates a job that was created by a different insights\_owner\).
-   The job was created by another user.

If either condition is met, the app sends an email notification to the owner of the resource or the creator of the job.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Recommendations** &gt; **Unused resources**.

2.  In the list on the appropriate tab, select the check boxes for the resources to terminate.

    -   To create an Unused resources job for resources that are new candidates for termination: On the **New Recommendations** tab, select the resources and then select **Schedule Job**.
    -   To create a job for resources that had previously been scheduled but the action wasn't completed successfully: On the **Declined Recommendations** tab or the **Failed Recommendations** tab, select the resources and then select **Reschedule**.
    **Note:** Microsoft Azure only: The Azure Advisor service generates the recommendations that appear in Rightsizing and Unused resources reports. Cloud Cost Management doesn't generate the recommendations.

3.  In the dialog box, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_e5m_kw3_ggb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Value

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Job Type

</td><td>

Type of job action.Select **Schedule job**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Job name

</td><td>

Unique and descriptive name for the Unused resources job.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Action

</td><td>

The action to take on the selected resources:-   **Power off machine**: Power off triggers a Microsoft Azure process called deallocation to set the resource as Stopped \(Deallocated\).
-   **Terminate machine**: Terminated machines can't be recovered.
-   **Terminate machine and delete storage**: If the root volume isn’t automatically deleted when the VM is terminated, the job deletes the root volume. No other volumes are deleted.

**Note:** Terminated resources or deleted volumes can't be recovered.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Schedule

</td><td>

Date and time to run the Unused resources job.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approval type

</td><td>

Type of change request to use. Unused Machines operations are directly integrated with the ServiceNow® Change Management feature.

 -   **Auto approval \(Standard Change\)**: Generates and auto-approves a change request to terminate or stop the resource. The system also sends the approved change request to the change group. The resource is added to the list of resources that the job terminates or stops.

-   **Manual approval \(Normal Change\)**: Generates a change request \(Normal Change type\) for a member of the change group to terminate or stop the resource and continues to list the resource in the appropriate Unused resources reports.

    -   Until a member of the change group approves/rejects the change, the resource state is set to Pending, the resource remains listed on reports, and no other action is taken.
    -   If a member of the change group approves the request, the state is set to **Approved** and the resource is added to the list of resources that the job terminates or stops.
    -   If a member of the change group rejects the request, the resource state is set to **Declined**, the resource remains listed on reports, and no action is taken.
**Note:**

The **Short description**, **Description**, **Assignment group**, and **Affected CIs** fields are auto-populated. For more information, see [Create a change request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/t_CreateAChange.md).

</table>4.  Select **Submit**.
