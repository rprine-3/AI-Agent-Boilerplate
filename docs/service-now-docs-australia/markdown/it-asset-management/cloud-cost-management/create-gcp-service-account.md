# Create a Google Cloud billing account

Create a billing account, project, and BigQuery dataset in the Google Cloud Console.

## Before you begin

You must be familiar with Google Cloud policies.

## Procedure

1.  Under the Google Cloud billing account, create a project that can store the billing data in a BigQuery dataset.

    **Note:** Charges associated with BigQuery usage are based on billing plans.

    1.  Create a service account under the project and create a key.

        See the Create service accounts and Manage service accounts sections in [Google Cloud docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs) for more information.

    2.  Configure the service account to have access to all projects.

        You must have the Viewer role to all the projects.
