# Assign service accounts to an insights\_owner

Assign ownership of one or more service accounts and, optionally, the related CIs to users that have the insights\_owner role. An insights\_owner can define jobs and policies and can view data for owned service accounts.

## Before you begin

Before you assign service accounts, you might want to view the list of current insights\_owner and their owned accounts. For more information, see [View the service accounts owned by an insights\_owner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/insights-owners-view-list-cloudin.md).

Role required: insights\_admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\]

## About this task

The insights\_owner role spreads responsibility for Cloud Cost Management activities to persons who have good knowledge of operations in the service accounts. For more information about the insights\_owner role, see [Cloud Cost Management roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/cloud-insights-roles.md).

A service account is a secure record on your instance that holds the credential and access information for your provider account. Discovery uses the information to access your provider account to get data on each resource in each specified datacenter.

**Tip:** When you assign service accounts to a user, the user is auto-granted the insights\_owner role.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Account to owner mappings**.

2.  Select **Assign accounts that currently have no owner**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.
