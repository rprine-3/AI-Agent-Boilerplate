# System properties for Cloud Cost Management

These system properties are available for the Cloud Cost Management application.

Access system properties by navigating to **All** &gt; **System properties** &gt; **All properties.**. You can set some property values on the System Properties form, but other lesser-used properties are available only on the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_clin\_core.bh\_recom\_max\_chunk\_size

Description

mid.azure\_action.batch\_size

</td><td>

Use `batch_size` to set the batch size to fewer than 20 for action calls like Stop, Start, Modify \(resize\), Terminate, and Describe.

 Cloud Cost Management uses the Azure Batch API to make a bulk request for the actions. By default, Azure Batch supports a maximum of 20 for the synchronous call.

 -   Type: integer
-   Default value: 20

System property

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_cld\_intg\_azure.az\_rs\_recommendation\_queue\_orchestrator\_polling\_time

</td><td>

Polling time for the Microsoft Azure recommendation orchestrator to check the status of the `generate`, `get generate status`, `list recommendation`, or `process recommendation` call and move it to the next stage for processing.**Note:** A short polling time is better if there are fewer subscriptions.

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 5000 \(ms\)

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_cld\_intg\_azure.chunk\_size\_generate\_recommendation\_subscriptions

</td><td>

Number of subscriptions to be processed by each workload. Each workload creates a maximum of 5 threads to process 10 subscriptions in parallel based on the available MID Server worker threads.

Changing the setting to lower number increases the number of workloads created. `Generate Recommendation` is an asynchronous API call that quickly returns the generate recommendation operation ID.**Note:** For fewer than 50 subscriptions, you can decrease the value to enable parallel processing. For example, for 40 subscriptions, changing the chunk size to 10 allows 4 workloads to process subscriptions. By default, a maximum of 3 parallel workload executions are allowed. The maximum is configured in the flow launcher job that is defined in the `sn_cld_intg_core_flow_launcher_job_config` table.

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 5

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_cld\_intg\_azure.advisor\_get\_status\_min\_chunk\_size

</td><td>

Minimum number of subscriptions to process in a workload for `Get generate status` API call.

 The call creates a workload when the specified minimum chunk size is met and, after all subscriptions are processed, doesn’t create another workload.

 **Note:** By default, a maximum of 4 parallel workload executions are allowed. The maximum is configured in the flow launcher job that is defined in the `sn_cld_intg_core_flow_launcher_job_config` table.

 -   Type: integer
-   Default value: 5

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_cld\_intg\_azure.advisor\_list\_recommendation\_min\_chunk\_size

</td><td>

Minimum number of subscriptions to process in a workload for the `list recommendation` API call.The call creates a workload when the specified minimum chunk size is met and, after all subscriptions are processed, doesn’t create another workload.

**Note:** Increasing the chunk size might increase the overall processing time because subscriptions are processed sequentially. By default, a maximum of 4 parallel workload executions are allowed. The maximum is configured in the flow launcher job that is defined in the `sn_cld_intg_core_flow_launcher_job_config` table.

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 1

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_clin\_azure.advisor\_process\_recommendation\_min\_chunk\_size

</td><td>

The number of recommendation responses that should be processed in a workload for the API call and persisted in the Rightsizing or Unused Machines recommendation table.

 The call creates a workload when the specified minimum chunk size is met and, after all subscriptions are processed, doesn’t create another workload.

 **Note:** Increasing the chunk size might increase the overall processing time because subscriptions are processed sequentially. By default, a maximum of 4 parallel workload executions are allowed. The maximum is configured in the flow launcher job that is defined in the `sn_cld_intg_core_flow_launcher_job_config` table.

 -   Type: integer
-   Default value: 20

Enables the option to limit the columns used for pivot key generation so that multiple cost line items map to a single pivot key, which decreases the number of entries in the cost usage table. -   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_cld\_intg\_core.sink\_only\_required\_ci\_types

</td><td>

Enables the option that only the line items that have the CI types - cmdb\_ci\_vm\_instance, cmdb\_ci\_database, cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_database, cmdb\_ci\_storage\_volume, cmdb\_ci\_storage\_vol\_snapshot, are sent to Glide for storage in the cost usage table, reducing the data that is transmitted.-   Type: true \| false
