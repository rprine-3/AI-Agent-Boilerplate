The exclusion reason on the Business hours **Excluded** tab indicates that the resource is an unused resource.

</table>-   **[Configure Business hours operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/bh-settings-config-cloudin.md)**  
Enable or disable the Business hours feature and set a non-business-hour spend threshold to trigger notifications to users or groups. This action helps control unnecessary resource usage and reduce costs.
-   **[Create Business hours schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/create-bh-schedule.md)**  
Create and apply a Business hours schedule to the cloud resources for enforcing the on/off schedule.
-   **[Define or update a Business hours policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cloud-cost-management/bh-policy-create-cloudin.md)**  
A Business hours job applies policies to identify resources that are running when they should be powered off, reports them, and can start and stop them on a schedule that you specify. Running only during specified business hours can significantly reduce your cloud spend.
