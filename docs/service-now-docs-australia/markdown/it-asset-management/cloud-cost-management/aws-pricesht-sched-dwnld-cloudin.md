# Schedule and manage the Cloud Cost Management jobs that download AWS price sheets

A Price Sheet Download job downloads and stores price sheet data. The Rightsizing and Unused resources processes use price sheet data when generating recommendations.

## Before you begin

For each provider, run Discovery on each service account.

Role required: insights\_admin \[sn\_clin\_core.insights\_admin\].

## About this task

-   You create a scheduled Price Sheet Download job for AWS.
-   Each execution of a Price Sheet Download job runs multiple execution items. Each execution item imports and stores the price sheet for one region.
-   To ensure accurate reporting and recommendations for some providers, make sure that the Discovery application runs before the scheduled execution.
-   When the scheduled time arrives, job execution happens in multiple stages \(for example, connect to the provider, download the data, perform the post-import sort, and so on\). The system logs status and results on the Price Sheet Executions page for each stage.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Cloud Cost Management Workspace** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Price sheet download jobs**.

2.  Select **New**.
