# Fulfill evidence requests through the Asset Response Guided Experience

Use the Asset Response Guided Experience to fulfill and respond to evidence requests for financial regulatory audit engagements.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_audit\_response.asset\_governance

## About this task

The Asset Response Guided Experience takes you through the entire process of fulfilling an evidence request, from accepting the request to submitting a final response to the request. Each set of tasks in this process is represented by a step in the guided experience. You must complete all tasks within a step before you can move on to the next step. You can also save your progress at any point in the process and return to the guided experience at a later time.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Asset Governance Workspace**.

2.  From the Asset evidence tasks related list in the Asset governance overview, select the task that is associated with the evidence request that you want to fulfill.

    The Asset Response Guided Experience opens.

3.  In the Audit scope step of the guided experience, verify the details of the evidence request and then select **Accept**.

    **Note:** At any point in the Audit scope step, you can post comments and view your activity stream in the contextual side panel.

    **Note:**

    At any point after you select **Accept**, you can automatically generate a comprehensive summary of the evidence request by selecting **Summarize evidence**. This summarization skill uses generative AI to provide the following information about the request:

    -   Evidence Request Overview: General information about the request, including the purpose of the request, the date and time at which the request was created, the user who the request is assigned to, and details about the corresponding audit engagement.
    -   Evidence Records: Information about the evidence records that were created for the request, including the total number of records, the type of supporting information that is included in each record, and the state of each record.
    -   Remediation Rules: Information about the remediation rules that were created for the request, including the total number of rules and the focus of each rule.
    -   Remediation Tasks: Information about the remediation tasks that were automatically generated based on the remediation rules, including the total number of tasks and the status of each task.
    -   Activity &amp; Audit Notes: Additional notes and activity logs for the request.
    This skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md). If you choose to deactivate the skill, you must reactivate it manually. For detailed instructions, see [Activate an AI skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-a-now-assist-skill.md).
