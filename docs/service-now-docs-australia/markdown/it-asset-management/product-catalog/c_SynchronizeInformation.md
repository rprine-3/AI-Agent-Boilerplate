# Synchronize information

Certain information is synchronized between models, product catalog items, and vendor catalog items.

When working with models, product catalog items, and vendor catalog items, keep the following in mind:

-   Changes to model record update vendor catalog items automatically only if the vendor catalog items are published, not linked.
-   If a model is linked to a vendor catalog item, any changes to the model do not update the vendor catalog item.
-   After publishing a vendor catalog item or model to the hardware or software catalog, some fields become read-only on the vendor catalog item or product catalog item record. Information can only be updated on the model record.

List of synchronized fields:

-   Description
-   Short description
-   Name
-   Product ID
-   Price
-   Vendor
-   Specs
-   Features
-   Model
-   UPC
-   Model number
-   Cost
-   Manufacturer
