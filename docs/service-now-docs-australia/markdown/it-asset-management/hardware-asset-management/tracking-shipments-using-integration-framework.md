# Track shipments using the integration framework

Track your shipments in real time by integrating your ServiceNow instance with your third-party carrier's application through the integration framework provided by the IT Asset Management application.

-   **[Creating an integration script include for third-party carrier applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/creating-integration-script-include-ham.md)**  
In order to integrate with a ServiceNow instance, a third-party carrier application must have a script include that extends the base class `ITAMShipmentIntegration` script on its ServiceNow instance to receive the shipment tracking number from the customer's ServiceNow instance and respond with the carrier-related details.
-   **[Connect your ServiceNow instance with a shipping carrier application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/associate-shipping-carrier-int-profile.md)**  
Associate a shipping carrier with an integration profile to connect your ServiceNow instance to the carrier application.
-   **[Remove a shipping carrier from an integration profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/remove-shipping-carrier.md)**  
Remove a shipping carrier that you no longer want to associate with an integration profile.
-   **[Create a carrier integration profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-carrier-integration-profile.md)**  
Create a carrier integration profile for your carrier by specifying the API and connection details that are used to connect your ServiceNow instance to the third-party shipping carrier application.
-   **[View the carrier integration profile details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/view-integration-profiles.md)**  
View the details of the carrier API used to connect your ServiceNow instance to the third-party shipping carrier application.
-   **[Test the integration with the carrier API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/test-carrier-api-integration.md)**  
Check the connection with the carrier API to handle any connection issues such as invalid credentials, incorrect tracking details, and issues with the integration script include.
-   **[Create a shipping carrier record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-shipping-carrier.md)**  
Create a shipping carrier record used to associate the carrier with an integration profile.

-   **[Stale shipments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/stale-shipments.md)**  
Shipments that are delayed due to various reasons such as an incorrect tracking number, the loss of a shipment package during transit, and invalid connection details are considered stale shipments.
-   **[Track a hardware asset shipment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/track-hardware-asset-shipments.md)**  
Track the progress of your hardware asset shipment that isn't delivered and that has a carrier associated with an active integration profile.
