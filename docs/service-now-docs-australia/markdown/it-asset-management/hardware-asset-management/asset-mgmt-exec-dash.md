# Asset Management Executive Dashboard

Use the Asset Management Executive Dashboard to gain visibility into critical KPIs for Hardware Asset Management, Software Asset Management, and Cloud Cost Management applications via a single dashboard.

To access the Asset Management Executive dashboard, you must either have Software Asset Management or Hardware Asset Management in your ServiceNow instance.

To view the Asset Management Executive dashboard, navigate to **Asset Executive Workspace** &gt; **Asset Management Executive Dashboard**. A user with the role of sn\_itam\_common.asset\_exec can access the dashboard.

You can filter the results in the dashboard by product, domain, or by both product and domain. If you filter by domain, the filter gets applied to all the widgets. If you filter by product, since some widgets are applicable for certain products, the filter isn’t applied to all the widgets.

After you select a filter, a blue box gets displayed on the right side of each widget displaying one of the numbers:

-   0: Indicates that no filter is applied to a widget.
-   1: Indicates that only one filter is applied to a widget.
-   2: Indicates that both the filters are applied to a widget.

**Note:** To use the domain filter, you must activate the plugins: com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer and com.snc.pa.domain\_support.

The schedule job, **Asset Management - Populate KPI aggregate table**, runs daily to update the data on the dashboard. To view the latest data for a widget, select the widget to display the list view page.

The dashboard widgets vary depending on the application plugins that you've activated in your instance. The widgets available with each application are listed in the following table:
