# Normalize hardware and consumable models

After you have created your hardware and consumable models, normalize the information of the model.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, asset, or model\_manager

## About this task

**Note:**

-   If you have opted in to the Hardware Asset Management Content Service, you can override any life cycle values that were added from the schedule job, or you can manually add your own life cycles.
-   For a model to be fully normalized, you must add manufacturer details and a model number, and optionally a model name.
-   If you update the **Device Type** field, the normalization status is updated.

## Procedure

1.  Create a hardware or consumable model.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    If the information is available, the model is compared against the data in the Hardware Normalization Content Service, and the model is normalized.

    **Note:** If the hardware or consumable model is normalized against the Hardware Asset Management Content Service, a life cycle is added if applicable life cycles exist in the content service.

2.  Normalize your model manually if the normalization status of your model is Partially Normalized or Publisher Normalized.

## Normalize a hardware model

You have created a hardware model for the Lenovo ThinkPad T43 and you want your asset information to be consistent across the organization.

Review the normalization status of the model by reviewing the **Normalization** section.

The normalization status is set to Partially Normalized because the name of the model is missing.

In the **Model** field, enter `2687DTU`.

Select **Save**.

The **Normalization Status** field displays **Manually Normalized**.
