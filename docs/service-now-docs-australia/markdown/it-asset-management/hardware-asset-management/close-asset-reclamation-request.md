# Close an asset reclamation request

Efficiently reclaim hardware assets when an employee leaves an organization or moves to a different role.

## Before you begin

Role required: inventory\_user or inventory\_admin

## About this task

For each reclaimed asset, a Hardware Asset Reclamation Line is created. For each Hardware Asset Reclamation Line, at most three Hardware Asset Reclamation Tasks are created.

You must close all the tasks of a Hardware Asset Reclamation Line to close the Hardware Asset Reclamation Line. After all Hardware Asset Reclamation Lines are closed, the Asset Reclamation Request is closed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Asset Reclamation** &gt; **Asset Reclamation Request**.

2.  Open the Asset Reclamation Request that you want to close and then open a Hardware Asset Reclamation Line.

    **Note:** To search for a specific asset reclamation request, use the search bar or filter options on the Asset Reclamation Request list. You can filter by fields such as Requested for, State, or Request number.

    Based the Reclaim method selected while submitting the Asset Reclamation request, a Schedule drop off, Schedule pickup, or Schedule shipment task is created in the Hardware Asset Reclamation Line.

    The **Stage** field of the Hardware Asset Reclamation Line form shows **Ready**.

3.  Open the Schedule drop off, Schedule pickup, or Schedule shipment task that is present in the Hardware Asset Reclamation Line.
