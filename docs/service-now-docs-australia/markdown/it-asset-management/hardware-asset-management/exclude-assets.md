# Exclude assets

Exclude an asset for which you don't want to use Hardware Asset Management licensed features.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Asset estate** &gt; **Hardware assets**.

2.  Select a hardware asset that you want to exclude.

3.  On the asset form, select the **Exclude from HAM features** check box.

    **Note:**

    The **Exclude from HAM features** check box is automatically selected under these conditions:

    -   If the hardware asset belongs to a resource category that's opted out of Hardware Asset Management licensed features.
    -   If the hardware asset belongs to a custom model category whose parent model category is associated with an opted-out resource category.
4.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** To exclude assets using other criteria — for example, a specific model — select the **Exclude from HAM features** check box on each asset record manually. You can't exclude assets automatically using custom criteria.


## Result

The asset is excluded from using the licensed Hardware Asset Management features.
