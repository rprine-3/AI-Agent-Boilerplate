# Create an asset attestation or a schedule using the playbook

Create a one-time asset attestation or a schedule for recurring attestations to verify if your serialized hardware assets are in use, using the playbook.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset or inventory\_admin

## About this task

A single asset attestation can have attestations involving more than one employee. Also, an employee can have more than one asset assigned. Therefore, an asset attestation can have multiple users and assets involved.

Only serialized hardware assets that belong to the opted-in resource categories can be requested for attestation. Consumables, bundles, and pallets can't be attested.

The **ITAM Common- Asset attestation** daily job runs daily to check through all the attestation schedules that are created. Based on the frequency specified in the attestation schedule, the job creates an asset attestation.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Inventory**.

2.  Select the **Asset attestations** tab.

3.  Select **New**.

    The Create asset attestation playbook displays the following activities that you must complete in the sequence:

    -   **Provide attestation details**
    -   **Select users**
    -   **Select model categories**
    -   **Attestation completed**
4.  Select whether you want to create an asset attestation or an attestation schedule, and then fill in the necessary details in the **Provide attestation details** activity.

    The **Schedule number** field is automatically populated with a unique identifier for the attestation schedule.

    -   To create an asset attestation, select **One-time** in the Mode field and follow these steps:
        1.  In the **Schedule name** field, enter the name of the attestation.
        2.  Select **Mark Complete**.
    -   To create a schedule for recurring asset attestations, select **Recurring** in the Mode field and follow these steps:
        1.  On the form, fill in the fields.

5.  In the **Select users** activity, select employees required to confirm assets.

        For example, to select employees in the Development department, set the **Department** field to **Development**.

        The **User list** section displays the number of records that match your condition. You can also view these results.
