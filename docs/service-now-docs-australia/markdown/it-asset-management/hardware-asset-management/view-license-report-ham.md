For more details, see [Licensing framework for Hardware Asset Management solutions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/licensing-ham-solutions.md).
    -   **Resource Subcategory**: Subcategories of a Resource category.

    -   **Resource Total Count**: Asset count of the managed IT resources that is grouped by Resource categories and Model categories.
    -   **Subscription Unit Ratio**: Predefined ratios that determine how many assets of a Resource category require a subscription. For example, the defined ratio of 4:1 for End User Computers means that every four assets of that resource category require one Subscription Unit.
    -   **Total Subscription Units Consumed**: The number of subscriptions per Resource category that your organization consumed. The licensing module calculates this number by applying the Subscription Unit Ratio to the Resource Total Count for each Resource Category.
