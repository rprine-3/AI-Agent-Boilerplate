# Manage hardware asset requests using the Zero Touch request flow

## Setup required for providers

The provider must complete the following tasks to fulfill the requests received through the Zero Touch request flow:

1.  [Complete the Service Exchange setup for providers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/service-bridge-for-ztreq.md).
2.  [Configure Scratchpad to send updates to your consumer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/using-scratchpad-for-provider-updates.md).

**Note:** After completing the prerequisites of the Zero Touch request flow, the provider can fulfill provider tasks. For details, see [Fulfill a provider task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/fulfill-provider-task-ztr.md).
