# View deprecated audit records

View the deprecated asset audit records that are created before switching to the common Asset Audits \[sn\_itam\_common\_asset\_audit\] table and stored in the Asset Audits \[sn\_hamp\_asset\_audit\] table.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset

Set the **migrate\_hamaudit** system property to **true**.

## About this task

You can view deprecated asset audit records in the Audits \[Deprecated\] list. These records are read only and you can’t perform any actions on them or create audit records from this view. Before enabling audit enhancements and migrating to the common audit table, you must complete and close all in-progress and new audit records. Once the **migrate\_hamaudit** system property is set to **true**, you can't act on in-progress and new audit records, because they’re considered deprecated audits.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Asset operations**.

2.  Select **Audits \[Deprecated\]**.

3.  Select an audit number link.


## What to do next

View the details of scanned assets within the asset audit form by selecting the relevant tabs.
