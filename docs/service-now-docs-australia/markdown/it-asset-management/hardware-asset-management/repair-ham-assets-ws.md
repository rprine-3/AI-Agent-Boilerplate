# Complete the repair asset task in the Hardware Asset Workspace

Complete the repair of the defective asset and confirm if the asset is repaired, unrepairable, or redeployable.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Inventory**.

2.  Select the **Repair orders** tab.

3.  Select the repair order for which you want to complete the Repair asset task.

4.  Select the **Repair order lines** tab.

5.  Select the repair order line that's in the Repair stage.

6.  Select the **Repair asset tasks** tab.

7.  Select the **Repair asset** task that's in the Open state.

8.  Indicate that you have started working on the Repair asset task by selecting **Start Work**.

    The **Start Work** option changes to **Start Timer** and **Record Time** automatically.

9.  Record the time worked on the task.

    You can either use the timer or record the time manually. For more details, see [Record time worked on asset repair tasks in the Hardware Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/record-repair-time-ham-ws.md).

    An entry for the time you worked is created in the **Time Worked** tab of the Repair asset task.

10. Select the **Details** tab.

11. Select the repair result in the **Repair result** field.

    -   If the asset is repaired, select **Repaired**.
    -   If the asset couldn't be repaired, select **Unrepairable**.
    -   If the asset can be redeployed, select **Redeployable**.
12. Enter the issue identified with the asset during the repair process in the **Issue identified** field.

    This field is automatically populated with the value carried forward from the troubleshoot asset task if the issue is identified and a value is provided in the **Issue identified** field. Once the task is closed, this field can’t be modified.

    The value in the **Issue identified** field is carried forward to evaluate repaired asset task after the repair task is closed.

13. Enter notes related to the task in the **Work notes** field.

14. Select **Close task**.

-   If you had set the Repair result to **Unrepairable**, the following changes happen on closure of the task:
    1.  The repair order and the repair order line are in the Completed stage.
    2.  The state of the asset changes to In stock and the substate changes to Pending disposal.
-   If you had set the Repair result to **Redeployable**, the following changes happen on closure of the task:
    1.  The repair order and the repair order line are in the Completed stage.
    2.  The state of the asset changes to In stock and the substate changes to Available.
