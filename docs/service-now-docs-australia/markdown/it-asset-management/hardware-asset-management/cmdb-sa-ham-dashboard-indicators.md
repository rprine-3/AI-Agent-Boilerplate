# Indicators used in the CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard

Indicators enable viewing of high-level metrics that highlight data quality, completeness, and synchronization issues across hardware assets and configuration items \(CIs\).

## CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard indicators

-   **Assets created for virtual CIs**

    Total number of virtual CI assets in the Hardware \[alm\_hardware\] table created daily, where the life cycle stage of CI is operational, the asset field is not empty, and the CI is marked as virtual.

-   **Assets missing CI**

    Total number of hardware assets in the Hardware \[alm\_hardware\] table missing a linked CI from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class, measured daily, where the CI is operational, the asset is actively in use, and no CI is linked to the asset.

-   **CIs by normalization status**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class, measured daily and grouped by model category and HAM normalization status, based on the Normalized status field on the associated hardware product model.

-   **CI install status vs. asset state matched**

    All CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class where the installation status correctly aligns with the expected asset state, promoting accurate and reliable asset management.

-   **CI install status vs. asset state mismatched**

    All CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class with an installation status that doesn’t align with the expected asset state, resulting in erroneous asset management.

-   **CI lifecycle stage vs. asset lifecycle stage matched**

    All CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class with a life cycle stage matched between the CI and its linked asset. This indicator is supported only on instances where the CSDM Activation plugin \(com.snc.cmdb.csdm.activation\) is installed and migrated to life cycle stage.

-   **CI lifecycle stage vs. asset lifecycle stage mismatched**

    All CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class with a life cycle stage mismatch between the CI and its linked asset. This indicator is supported only on instances where the CSDM Activation plugin \(com.snc.cmdb.csdm.activation\) is installed and migrated to life cycle stage.

-   **CIs missing asset**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a linked asset, measured daily, where the life cycle stage of CI is operational and no asset is associated with the CI.

-   **CIs missing assigned to**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing an assigned owner, measured daily, where the CI lacks an assigned owner.

-   **CIs missing location**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a location, measured daily, where the CI doesn’t have a location assigned.

-   **CIs missing managed by group**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a managed by group, measured daily, where the CI doesn’t have a managed by group assigned.

-   **CIs missing manufacturer**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a manufacturer, measured daily, where the CI doesn’t have a manufacturer specified.

-   **CIs missing model ID**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a model ID, measured daily, where the CI doesn’t have a model ID or model display name specified.

-   **CIs missing model name**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a model name, measured daily, where the CI doesn’t have a model name specified, with or without a model ID.

-   **CIs missing model number**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a model number, measured daily, where the CI is not associated with a model ID, or is associated with a model ID that is missing a model number.

-   **CIs missing serial number**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class missing a serial number, measured daily, where the CI doesn’t have a serial number assigned.

-   **CIs not updated in last 7 days**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class not updated in the last seven days, measured daily, where the update timestamp is older than seven days.

-   **CIs not updated in last 14 days**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class not updated in the last 14 days, measured daily, where the update timestamp is older than 14 days.

-   **CIs not updated in last 30 days**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class not updated in the last 30 days, measured daily, where the update timestamp is older than 30 days.

-   **CIs not updated in last 60 days**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class not updated in the last 60 days, measured daily, where the update timestamp is older than 60 days.

-   **CIs not updated in last 90 days**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class not updated in the last 90 days, measured daily, where the update timestamp is older than 90 days.

-   **Duplicate CIs**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class identified as duplicates, measured daily, based on the results of the HAM duplicate CI audit process.

-   **Hardware CIs group by**

    Total number of CI records from the Hardware \[cmdb\_ci\_hardware\] class, measured daily and grouped by model category and discovery source.
