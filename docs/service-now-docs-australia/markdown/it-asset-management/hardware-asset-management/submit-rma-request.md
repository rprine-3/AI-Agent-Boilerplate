# Submit an RMA request

Submit a Return Merchandise Authorization \(RMA\) request to initiate an RMA process with your vendor. You can repair or replace a faulty asset.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset and inventory user

The asset, inventory\_user, or itil role can only access the reports of the RMA request lines.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Asset Lifecycle** &gt; **Asset RMA Order**.

2.  To initiate an RMA request for a defective asset or consumable, click **Add**.

3.  In the **Asset** field on the Add Row form, select the defective asset or consumable for which you want to initiate the RMA request.

    You can select multiple rows of assets and consumables. You can't select an excluded asset. For more information about asset exclusion, see [Hardware Asset Management license exclusion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/ham-license-exclusion.md).

    If you select a consumable, a **Quantity** field appears beside the **Asset** field. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of defective consumables for which you want to initiate the RMA.

4.  To add the selected assets or consumables, click **Add**.

5.  To submit the RMA request, click **Submit**.
