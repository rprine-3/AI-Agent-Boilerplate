# Request a loaner asset

Request a temporary or loaner asset or consumable and use it for a short period.

## Before you begin

Role required: None

While requesting a loaner asset, confirm that the start date is within three months from the date of submission, and the end date is within six months from the start date.

## About this task

Request a loaner asset for a specific period. You can request it for yourself, for another employee of your organization, or for a third-party vendor. Before the asset is installed, you can cancel the loaner asset request at any time.

You can submit a loaner order even if the product isn’t available at the moment in the location you want to select. In this case, your order is placed in the queue.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Asset Lifecycle**.

    The **Asset Lifecycle** category isn't on the Service Catalog page by default. To add this category, log in with admin credentials, select the add content icon \[Omitted image "add\_content\_icon.png"\] Alt text: Add content icon. next to the search catalog bar and then select **Asset Lifecycle**.

2.  Select **Loaner Asset Request**.
