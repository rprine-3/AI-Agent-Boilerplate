# Close an Asset put away task

Add the asset drop-off location for an open Asset put away task and close it in the Hardware Asset Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: inventory\_user

## About this task

You can bulk close selected Asset put away tasks that are open and assigned to you by specifying a drop-off location, which moves all associated assets to that location. You can also close individual tasks by specifying a drop-off location.

**Note:** When you make the following changes to a hardware asset, the associated Asset put away task is closed:

-   When the asset’s **Aisle and Space** value is filled, the associated Asset put away task for the asset is closed, and the **State** field is updated to **Closed Complete**.
-   When the asset’s State field is updated from In stock to some other value without adding the **Aisle and Space** field value, the associated Asset put away task is closed and its state is updated to Closed Incomplete.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Inventory**.

2.  Open the put away task either from the Inventory overview section or the **All Stockrooms** tab.
