# Prepare, deploy, and reclaim loaner assets

Select and prepare the loaner asset or consumable for deployment and reclamation by using loaner asset tasks. Deploy the loaner asset or consumable for a specific period, and reclaim it on the return date.

## Before you begin

To use an asset as a loaner asset or consumable, go to the asset record and set the **Asset function** field to **Loaner**. These assets are reserved for use as loaner assets. You can’t use an asset that has the **Asset function** field set to anything other than **Loaner**. Only hardware, bundle, and consumables can be used as Loaner assets.

The Loaner Asset Orders related list in the Asset form shows all the loaner orders that the asset has served in the past and at present. When the consumable isn’t in a stockroom, it shows only the current loaner asset order that it's serving at present.

Role required: inventory\_user

## About this task

Use the Loaner Asset Orders module to view and complete the loaner asset orders that were requested by the users.

The Hardware Asset dashboard gives a consolidated view of all the loaner asset orders that are in the New, Deployed, or Return Overdue states. For details, see [Hardware Asset dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/hardware-asset-content-pack.md).

**Note:**

There are readily available decision tables that you can use to customize the Loaner Asset Request Flow. For more details, see [Hardware Asset Management flow customization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/readily-available-dec-tables-ham.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Loaner** &gt; **Loaner Asset Orders**.

2.  Open a loaner asset order record.

3.  Under the Loaner Asset Tasks related list, open the Prepare task.

    For a consumable, the state changes to Consumed.

    Two days before the return date, the users who requested the asset will receive an email notification about the reclaim. One day before the return date, a Reclaim task is created under the Loaner Asset Tasks related list.

11. Open the Reclaim task.

12. On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
