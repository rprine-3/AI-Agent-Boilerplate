# Model management view

Use the Model management view in the Hardware Asset Workspace to create or edit models, view the asset model-related functions such as hardware and consumable models nearing the end of life, and take appropriate actions.

All reports except **Days until next hardware content refresh** under the Model Management view get filtered based on the model category you choose.
