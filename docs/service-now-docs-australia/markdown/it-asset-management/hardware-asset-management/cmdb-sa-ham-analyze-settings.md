# Analyzing CMDB settings for HAM

Monitor and optimize Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) settings that support configuration item \(CI\) to hardware asset synchronization, life cycle alignment, and Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) data quality.

Use the **Settings** tab in the CMDB success advisor for HAM to review configuration indicators and identify opportunities to improve CMDB alignment with HAM guidelines.

The CMDB success advisor for HAM evaluates your current configuration across key areas such as:

-   Automatic asset and CI creation
-   Field and model category mappings
-   CI state and substate usage
-   CMDB Data Manager policy coverage

Settings are categorized as `Ideal` or `Requires attention`, enabling you to prioritize actions and maintain a healthy CMDB for HAM.

## Access settings

Navigate to the CMDB success advisor landing page and for the HAM card, select **View insights**. Select the **Settings** tab to access settings-related details. For more information, see [Access CMDB success advisor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-sa-access.md).

**Note:** The CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard is available only after the setup process is complete. For more information, see [CMDB success advisor for HAM setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-config-settings.md).

## Required roles

You need the sn\_cmdb\_admin role to access the CMDB success advisor for HAM.

To manage business rules, change the application scope from CMDB success advisor to Global in the [application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-development/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

## CMDB and HAM settings assessed in the CMDB success advisor

The Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) and Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) settings review provides a configuration-level assessment of the CMDB configuration item \(CI\) classes and HAM assets for maintaining data accuracy.

### Settings overview

Each setting is checked for alignment with suggested business rules and mapping guidelines.

<table id="table_obb_mh2_dgc"><thead><tr><th>

Setting

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Create asset on CI insertion

</td><td>

Enables the automatic creation of an asset record when a CI is inserted into the CMDB. Requires the Create Asset on Insert business rule to be active for asset creation to occur during CI insertion.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Update asset fields on CI change

</td><td>

Enables automatic updates to asset records when a related CI is modified. Requires the Update Asset Fields on Change business rule to be active to synchronize CI changes with asset data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create CI on asset insertion

</td><td>

Enables the automatic creation of a configuration item when an asset record is added. Requires the Create CI on Insert business rule to be active to reflect asset data in the CMDB.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Update CI on asset update

</td><td>

Enables automatic updates to configuration item records when associated asset data is changed. Requires the Update CI Fields on Change business rule to be active to maintain data consistency.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review custom model categories

</td><td>

Validates that custom model categories are properly mapped to predefined model categories. Verifies accurate classification, consistent reporting, and standardized data alignment.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review asset CI field mappings

</td><td>

Evaluates whether asset fields are correctly mapped to configuration item fields using standard mappings. Helps prevent data discrepancies caused by custom or incorrect mappings.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review asset CI install status mappings

</td><td>

Checks that CI install status values are accurately mapped to the state and substate fields of the corresponding asset record. Verifies precise life cycle tracking and status reporting.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review asset CI hardware status mappings

</td><td>

Verifies that CI hardware status values align with the state and substate fields of the corresponding asset record. Supports consistent representation of physical asset conditions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Review Data Manager policies

</td><td>

Assesses the configuration of CMDB Data Manager policies, including archive, attestation, certification, delete, and retire, for the selected hardware CI classes. Each policy type manages a specific life cycle action:-   **Archive**
