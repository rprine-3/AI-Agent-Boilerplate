# Import and export content data

Import content data from or export content data to the Hardware Asset Management content library service to support hardware normalization of asset models. On-premise users can import or export data via a zip file using the Manage Hardware Library module.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   ham\_admin
-   domain\_admin \(if domain separation is enabled\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Modules** and search for **Manage Hardware Library**.

2.  Open the Manage Hardware library form layout and select the **Active** check box to activate the module.

3.  Select **Save** and refresh the form layout.

4.  Navigate to the Manage Hardware Library module.

5.  Import the content data to get the new data into your system.

    1.  Select **Import Hardware Library Content**.

    2.  Select **Attach Content File** and then select the zip file that contains the content.

    3.  Select **Run Import**.

        After the data is imported, the content update schedule job, **HAM - Apply latest content changes**, is triggered to process the content updates.

6.  Export content to send the custom data or any hardware models that are not fully normalized to the ServiceNow content service team.

    1.  Select **Content Service Opt-in: Export Hardware Normalization Content**.

    2.  If you already haven't opted in to share the data with ServiceNow content service, select **opt-in** and refresh the Manage Hardware Library page.

    3.  Select **Run Export**.

    4.  After the status changes to Ready for Download, refresh the page.

        A zip file is created and appears at the top of the Manage Hardware Library page. If there is no content to export, an error message appears informing you that no content exists.

    5.  Download and send this zip file to the ServiceNow content service team.
