## About this task

**Important:** Configuring the stockroom is necessary for AI agents to source the hardware asset requests from it. However, to automate your hardware asset requests using the Manage hardware asset requests agentic workflow, you must install the ServiceNow Otto for Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) application. For more details, see [ServiceNow Otto for Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/now-assist-for-hardware-asset-management/now-assist-ham.md).

2.  Select the **All stockrooms** tab.

3.  Select the stockroom that you want to set up for automatic sourcing.

4.  Select the automatic sourcing options in the **Sourcing by AI agents** section.

    -   To enable the AI agent to consume the local stock automatically, select the **Auto-consume** check box.
    -   To enable the AI agent to create a transfer order for the stockroom automatically, select the **Auto-transfer** check box.
    -   To enable the AI agent to create a purchase order for the stockroom automatically, select the **Auto-purchase** check box.
5.  Select **Save**.
