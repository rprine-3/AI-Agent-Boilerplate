# Hardware Asset Management system properties

System properties control asset lifecycle, procurement, inventory, reporting, and system configuration for the Hardware Asset Management application. You can view and update these properties from the Properties setup item in the Configuration Console.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

**glide.asset.create\_ci\_with\_ire**

</td><td>

Controls whether a configuration item \(CI\) is created along with an asset using IRE API.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**glide.create\_alm\_asset.async**

</td><td>

Controls when an asset is created relative to its configuration item. When set to true, asset creation is deferred and processed by the scheduled job **Asset - Create asset delayed sync**. When set to **false**, the asset is created immediately when the configuration item is created.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_enable\_cache\_for\_asset\_ci\_mapping**

</td><td>

Turns on caching for the following mappings to improve performance:-   Asset and CI fields
-   Asset state and CI install status
-   Asset state and CI hardware status

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_enable\_pid\_recalculation\_for\_child\_asset**

</td><td>

Controls whether the Product Instance Identifier \(PID\) is recalculated for child assets when the parent asset is updated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_exclude\_ibi\_asset\_reporting**

</td><td>

Excludes Install Base Item \(IBI\) assets from the Asset Workspace reports and Important actions on the Overview page.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_hamp.update\_assets\_norm\_model\_name**

</td><td>

Controls whether asset records are updated with the normalized model name when normalization runs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_hamp.enable\_asset\_tag\_serial\_number\_edits**

</td><td>

Enables user to update asset tag and serial number of the asset to be received on the Employee Center Portal.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_hamp.approximate\_dates\_in\_hw\_lifecycle**

</td><td>

Boolean flag for hardware lifecycle date calculations. When true, the report uses all content table rows and inherits approximate dates. When false, only researched dates are used.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_enable\_caching\_for\_depreciation**

</td><td>

Turns on caching for depreciation formula in **Calculate Depreciation** scheduled job.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_hamp.enable\_asset\_action\_validation\_incident**

</td><td>

Controls whether an asset action is required to close an incident. When set to **true**, users must specify an asset action before closing an incident. When set to **false**, asset action validation is skipped on incident closure.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_hamp.enable\_asset\_action\_validation\_change\_request**

</td><td>

Controls whether an asset action is required to close a change request. When set to **true**, users must specify an asset action before closing a change request. When set to **false**, asset action validation is skipped on change request closure.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**glide.asset.procurement.sourcing.local\_stock\_transfer**

</td><td>

Controls whether local stock transfers are used as a sourcing option during procurement.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_common.enable\_asset\_attestation\_playbook**

</td><td>

Allows asset manager to enable playbook for asset attestation request

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_common.close\_attestation\_async**

</td><td>

Controls whether the closure check for attestation records runs asynchronously. When set to **true**, an asynchronous check runs to determine if the attestation record needs to be closed when a user confirms an asset in the attestation request.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_hamp.migrate\_hamaudit**

</td><td>

Controls whether HAM audit data is migrated to the common audit table. When set to **true**, audit data moves to the common table. Note that migrating audit data removes access for users with the inventory\_user and inventory\_admin roles. Configure the appropriate ACLs before enabling this property to maintain user access to audits.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_common.sn\_enable\_indoormap\_for\_assets**

</td><td>

Turns on indoor map functionality for assets forms and dashboards.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_common.receive\_assets\_batch\_size**

</td><td>

Determines the batch size of the asset records when logging import and receiving jobs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_trigger\_depreciation\_job\_after\_days**

</td><td>

Sets the number of days that must pass since the last depreciation job run before the depreciation job is allowed to run again. Default is 7 days.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_hamp.model\_lifecycle\_phase\_order**

</td><td>

Sets the priority order of hardware model lifecycle phases when multiple phases share the same start date. Enter the lifecycle phase names as a comma-separated list in increasing order of priority.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_depreciation\_job\_last\_run**

</td><td>

Records the date and time the depreciation job last ran. This is a read-only, system-managed value.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_common.put\_away\_task.drop\_off\_location.delimiter**

</td><td>

Sets the delimiter used to separate drop-off location values in put-away tasks. The drop-off location format is `Location||Stockroom||Aisle||Space`. The default delimiter is `||`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

**sn\_itam\_common.set\_default\_include\_consumables**

</td><td>

Sets the default value of the **Include consumables** field on the Asset Audits form.
