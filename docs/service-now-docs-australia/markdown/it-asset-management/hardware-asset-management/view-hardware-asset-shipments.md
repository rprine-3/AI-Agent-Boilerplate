# View hardware asset shipment details

View all hardware asset shipment details in a single place in the Hardware Asset Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: inventory\_user \(read\) or inventory\_admin

## About this task

The Shipment list shows all the shipment records initiated by the shipment tasks of various flows. For details, see [Task closures that create shipment records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/shipment-record-sources.md).

A shipment record is created automatically whenever a shipment task of a flow or process is closed.

**Note:**

The Shipment \[sn\_itam\_common\_shipment\] table also has the Currency, Delivery services cost, and Parcel weight fields. However, these fields aren’t shown on the Shipment form.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Asset operations**.

2.  From the **Shipment** list, select **Shipments**.

3.  Select a shipment record to view the shipment details.
