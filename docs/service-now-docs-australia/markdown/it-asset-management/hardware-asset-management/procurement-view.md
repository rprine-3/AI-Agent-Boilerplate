# Procurement view

Use the Procurement view in the Hardware Asset Workspace to view and manage procurement-related details such as procurement requests, purchase orders, sourcing tasks, and receiving slips.

The Procurement view provides access to actions for managing your open requests, pending purchase orders and transfer orders, and requests that need manager approval.
