# Manage HAM advisor scope in CMDB success advisor

Manage the scope of your advisor for Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) by editing model categories in CMDB success advisor to support your targeted HAM outcomes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

Control which resource and model categories are included in the HAM advisor dashboard in CMDB success advisor. Add or remove entire resource categories, or include or exclude specific model categories within a resource category. Resource categories can be opted in or out based on hardware asset manager preferences.

## Procedure

1.  On the HAM advisor dashboard, select **Edit dashboard scope**.

2.  In the Edit dashboard scope dialog box, add or remove categories to update the model category selection.

## Result

The HAM dashboard in CMDB success advisor is updated to reflect the data based on the model category selection. Dashboard metrics refresh once daily when the **CMDB Advisor - HAM Daily Data Collection** scheduled job runs. The scheduled job invokes the **CMDB success advisor data collection for HAM** Performance Analytics job to recalculate the pre-aggregated indicators used throughout the dashboard. For more information about Performance Analytics jobs, see [Collecting indicator scores](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_ClctData.md). Changes to your model category selection appear in the dashboard metrics after this job's next run, not immediately.
