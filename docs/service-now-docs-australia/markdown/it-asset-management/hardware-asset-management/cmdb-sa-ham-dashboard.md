# Monitoring CMDB data quality using dashboard metrics in CMDB success advisor for HAM

The CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard enables CMDB administrators to identify and address data quality issues specific to HAM in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

**Important:** Charts display up to the top 10 values. Any remaining values are grouped into an **Others** category. When you select a segment or count on a chart from a CMDB success advisor dashboard, the KPI Details page opens. On the page, you can analyze how a specific metric trends over time. Additionally, the Remediation actions panel appears when remediation actions are available for that card. Use the panel to improve the quality of CMDB. To learn more, see [KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/kpi-details.md) and [Improving CMDB data quality for HAM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-remediation.md).

\[Omitted image "cmdb-sa-ham-dashboard.png"\] Alt text: CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard overview.

**Note:** If the Performance Analytics data collector exceeds its row limit during data processing, a notification banner appears on the dashboard indicating that some metrics could not be loaded. For more information, see [Data collector Performance Analytics properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/pa-dc-props.md).

## Access the dashboard

To open the dashboard, select **View insights** for HAM on the CMDB success advisor landing page. See [Access CMDB success advisor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-sa-access.md). The dashboard displays a **Last updated** timestamp reflecting the completion time of the most recent HAM data collector job run.

**Note:** The CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard is available only after the setup process is complete. For more information, see [CMDB success advisor for HAM setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-config-settings.md).

</table>## Dashboard features

The dashboard provides clear, consolidated insights into hardware asset data quality and asset status. Use the dashboard to identify and resolve data quality issues within the CMDB through dedicated sections, filters, indicators, and visual reports. Gain valuable insights into CMDB performance related to HAM.

Targeted CMDB metrics focus remediation efforts. Regularly monitor these metrics and follow suggested remediation actions to systematically improve CMDB data quality over time.

**Important:** The dashboard data is filtered based on the Selected model categories and Date range filters. See [Filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-dashboard.md).

CMDB data quality insights generated by AI

</td><td>

Displays an AI-generated summary of CMDB data quality for HAM outcomes and lists the top 5 issues with guided remediation actions.Issues are ranked primarily by the percentage of CIs or CI classes that each issue affects, not by severity, within five categories, in this order: **Data integrity**, **CI attributes**, **CI-asset relationships**, **Business rules**, and **Data Manager policies**. Foundational data integrity issues, such as duplicate CIs and stale CIs, are evaluated first because they can inflate the counts behind other issues.

A percentage gap of more than 15 points between issues in the same category can change their default order. A percentage gap of more than 40 points between issues in different categories can also change their default order. For the reasoning behind the ranking and recommendations, see [Summarize CMDB readiness with the ServiceNow Otto skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/na-cmdb-skill-summ-rdy.md).

Select **View reasoning** to open the Reasoning popover, which explains the ranking and includes a **Learn more** link to the same topic.

**Note:** Available only when the summarize CMDB readiness skill is configured. See [Configure the summarize CMDB readiness skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/na-cmdb-config-summ-rdy.md).
