# Stockroom types

Stockroom types are categories of stockrooms.

The stockroom type has two significant characteristics.

-   **Priority**: Order of stockrooms the parts should be sourced from. For example, if a personal stockroom \(priority 2\) contains the required part, the personal stockroom receives priority over the Central Stockroom \(priority 7\) because the part in the personal stockroom doesn’t require delivery.
-   **Shipment Required**: Informs the system if a transfer order must be created when the part is sourced from a stockroom of the given type. For example, a part in a personal stockroom doesn’t require shipment, so no transfer order is needed.
