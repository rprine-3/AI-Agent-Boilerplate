Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Display name

</td><td>

Name of the asset as it appears in the record lists. This field is automatically set when you create an asset, based on the **Asset Tag** and **Model** fields.

</td><td>

Model grouping of the asset. Based on the model category you select, the asset is linked to a configuration item.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Model

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Configuration Item

</td><td>

CI is automatically created when you create an asset. Point to the reference icon to view the configuration item details inherited from the asset record. The CI value is populated as follows:-   By default, the CI value is based on the **Model** field.
-   If the model category of the asset is associated with a CI and the Serial number field isn't empty, then the CI value is based on the **Serial number** and **Model** field values.
-   If an asset is created in the On Order state, then the CI value is based on the **Model** field.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Quantity

</td><td>

The number of items this asset represents. An asset has a quantity of one unless one or more of these points are true.-   If the asset is a consumable, the quantity is unrestricted because consumables are tracked in groups.
-   If the asset is pre-allocated, the quantity is unrestricted when the **Model category** and **Model** values are defined and **Substate** is set to **Pre-allocated**.

**Note:** When the **Quantity** field value is greater than one, the asset is managed as a group and do not require individual asset tags and serial numbers. This applies to pre-allocated assets and consumables where individual tracking is not required.
