## Verify and depart your assets for disposal

Use the ServiceNow Agent app to scan, verify, and depart your assets for disposal.

### Before you begin

To verify an asset using the ServiceNow Agent app, make sure that a Disposal order exists in your Hardware Asset Management instance.

Role required: asset

### About this task

After a Disposal order is initiated for your asset, use the ServiceNow Agent app to scan, verify, and depart the asset. You do not have to manually verify and depart your assets.

On the app, you can use the same functionalities when you are offline. For more information, see [Offline mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/mobile/mobile-offline-mode.md).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Asset** &gt; **Asset disposal**.

    The **Verification** tab shows the list of verification tasks, while the **Departure** tab shows the list of departure tasks. These tasks are for the assets that are present in a particular asset location for disposal.

2.  Scan and verify your assets in one of the following ways.

    -   Swipe a verification task to the left.
    -   Tap a verification task to open it and then tap **Scan**.
    You can scan multiple assets together. After you open a verification task, the verification task shows the number of assets that are verified, not verified, or expected to be verified. Click **Expected**, **Verified**, or **Not verified** to view the respective types of assets.

3.  Tap **Review** &gt; **Submit**.

    A pop-up message appears and shows the successful verification of the scanned assets. The lists of verified and not verified assets are updated.

4.  Once you scan all the assets, tap **Complete** to close the verification task.

    If there are still some assets left for scanning and you click **Complete**, then a pop-up window appears to confirm if you still want to close the task. If you tap **Complete**, the task is closed.

5.  Enter the vendor details and the scheduled date by using your Hardware Asset Management instance.

    See [Create a disposal order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-disposal-order.md).

    After you enter the vendor details and close the Schedule Pickup task from your Hardware Asset Management instance, the **Departure** tab shows the list of departure tasks to process.

6.  Scan and depart your assets in one of the following ways.

    -   Swipe a departure task to the left.
    -   Tap a departure task to open it and then tap **Scan**.
    You can scan multiple assets together. After you open a departure task, the departure task shows the number of assets that are departed, not departed, or expected to be departed. Click **Expected**, **Departed**, or **Not departed** to view the respective types of assets.

7.  Tap **Review** &gt; **Submit**.

    A pop-up window appears and shows the successful departure of the scanned assets. The lists of departed and not departed assets are updated.

8.  Once you scan all the assets, tap **Complete** to close the departure task.

    If there are still some assets left for scanning and you click **Complete**, then a pop-up window appears to confirm if you want to close the task. If you tap **Complete**, the task is closed.
