# Analytics and Reporting Solutions for Hardware Asset Management

This Platform Analytics Solution contains preconfigured dashboards. These dashboards contain actionable data visualizations that help you improve your business processes and practices.

## Enabling the Performance Analytics Solution

Use the Performance Analytics widgets on the dashboard to visualize data over time, analyze your business processes, and identify areas of improvement. With solutions, you can get value from Performance Analytics for your application with minimal setup.

**Note:** Solutions include some dashboards that are inactive by default. You can activate these dashboards to make them visible to end users according to your business needs.

For unlimited access to all features of this Platform Analytics Solution, purchase a Performance Analytics subscription. For more information, see [Activating your Performance Analytics subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_PremiumPerformanceAnalytics.md).

To use this Analytics and Reporting Solution, you must be entitled to use Performance Analytics with Hardware Asset Management. For more information about entitlements to Performance Analytics, see [Activating your Performance Analytics subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_PremiumPerformanceAnalytics.md)

This Out-of-the-box Performance Analytics Solution is available from the ServiceNow Store. To enable this solution, an admin navigates to **System Applications** &gt; **Search ServiceNow Store**. When the landing page for the ServiceNow Store opens, search for Hardware Asset Management. When you have found the Solution, follow the instructions in the Store. The ServiceNow Store has its own documentation.

## Domain separation and 'Run As' user

In some solutions, System Administrator is the **Run As** user for data collection jobs in the Platform Analytics Solutions. In other solutions, the **Run As** user for data collection jobs is left blank. Verify that the **Run As** user exists on the instance, and that this user has the appropriate level of access. An inappropriate **Run As** user can cause errors or limit the data that is collected. This setting only has an effect if domain separation is enabled.

## Performance Analytics dashboards for Hardware Asset Management

**Important:** You can access the Core UI Performance Analytics dashboards only if you have upgraded from prior releases to Xanadu. Beginning with the Xanadu release, the Core UI Performance Analytics dashboards aren't available to new users of Hardware Asset Management.

The Performance Analytics dashboards available for Hardware Asset Management are the following:

-   Hardware Asset Dashboard
-   Hardware Normalization Dashboard
-   My Assets
-   Procurement Overview
-   Asset Contract Overview
-   Asset Overview

Beginning with the Xanadu release, note the following points about the Core UI Performance Analytics dashboards:

-   The Procurement Overview and Asset Contract overview module links are redirected to [Hardware Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/using-ham-workspace.md).
-   The following Next Experience Platform Analytics dashboard versions of the Asset Overview and My Assets Core UI Performance Analytics dashboards are available:
    -   Analytics Overview: You can access this dashboard by navigating to **Asset** &gt; **Analytics Overview**.
    -   My Assets Analytics: You can access this dashboard by navigating to **Self-Service** &gt; **My Assets Analytics**.

**Note:** After upgrading to Xanadu, you can view both the Core UI Performance Analytics dashboards and the Next Experience Platform Analytics dashboards for Hardware Asset Management. While migrating the Core UI Performance Analytics dashboards to the Next Experience Platform Analytics dashboards, auto-migration is disabled by default to avoid duplicate dashboards.

## Hardware Asset dashboard

View the key metrics on your hardware and consumable models and assets for the entire asset life cycle in the Hardware Asset dashboard.

**Important:** You can access the Hardware Asset dashboard only if you have upgraded from prior releases to Xanadu. Beginning with the Xanadu release, the Hardware Asset Dashboard isn't available to new users of Hardware Asset Management.

Access the Hardware Asset dashboard by navigating to **Asset** &gt; **Hardware Asset Dashboard**.

The results in all the tabs in the Hardware Asset dashboard are updated in real time. Only the reports that display data in the **Lifecycle Overview** sections is updated daily based on scheduled jobs. You can save charts in PNG or JPEG formats for sharing or viewing them locally.

### End user and roles

|End user and goal|Required role|Benefits|
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
|Asset Manager must see patterns in the data all through the asset life cycle.|asset|View reports that provide critical insights on assets such as procurement needs, inventory, and end of life status. You can also view the normalization status and life-cycle overview for hardware and consumable models.|

### Asset Health tab

This tab gives you an overview of hardware and consumable models that are missing purchase information, undiscovered over a period one month of missing, scheduled for retirement, or reported with most incidents. Use Location and Model Category filters to view asset health reports of particular location and model respectively.

|Report|Source table|Description|
|------|------------|-----------|
|Incomplete Assets|Asset \[alm\_asset\]|Asset models without purchase order number, purchase order line, or receiving line.|
|Eligible for Refresh Assets|Hardware \[alm\_hardware\]|Asset nearing end of life and which are eligible for refresh.|
|Asset incident Frequency|Incident \[incident\]|Assets that have been reported with frequent incidents.|
|Active Assets - Not Discovered|Asset \[alm\_asset\]|Assets that aren’t discovered at all or not discovered within one month.|

### Model Management tab

This tab gives you an overview of hardware and consumable models that are reaching their end of life. You can also view the normalization status, life-cycle overview, and information on the content service library. You can effectively manage your models by viewing their end of life status on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis.
