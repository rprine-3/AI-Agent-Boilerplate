# Create a labor rate card in Hardware Asset Workspace

Create a labor rate card to record the time worked on a task and associate a rate to the task.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset\_admin

Activate the ServiceNow® Cost Management \(com.snc.cost\_management\) plugin. For more information, see [Activate Cost Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/t_ActivatingCostManagement.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Asset operations** &gt; **TCO configuration** &gt; **Labor rate card**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_pln_ql2_hzb"><thead><tr><th>

For more information, see [Create a task rate card in Hardware Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-ham-task-rate-card.md).This field uses the Condition Count widget to preview what records would be returned by the conditions.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Select **Save**.


## Result

If you’re working on multiple HAM workflows including a labor rate card, the same value is used for all the time recorded tasks. But a labor rate card isn't included, the Default labor rate mentioned in the task rate card is used.
