# Audit your hardware assets by using Asset Attestation

Improve the asset utilization by auditing the hardware assets assigned to your employees and validating if the employees are using the assigned assets.

As an Asset manager or an Inventory administrator, you can create an asset attestation in any of the following ways:

-   [Create an asset attestation or a schedule using the playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-attestation-using-playbook.md)
-   [Create an asset attestation in the Inventory view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-attestation-req-ham.md).
-   [Create an asset attestation schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-attest-schedule-ham.md).
-   [Create an attestation for a hardware asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/attest-single-asset-ham.md)

**Important:** Starting with Hardware Asset Management version 13.0.0, the playbook is the default option for the creation of asset attestations and schedules. However, if you set the value of the **sn\_itam\_common.enable\_asset\_attestation\_playbook** system property to **false** with the asset or inventory\_admin role, you will be shown forms to complete the attestation process instead of the playbook.

As an employee, you can confirm the assets assigned to you in any of the following ways:

-   [Confirm the assigned assets using the Now Mobile app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/confirm-ham-assets-now-mobile.md).
-   [Confirm the assigned assets on the Employee Center portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/confirm-assets-on-emp-center.md).

For more details, see [Asset Attestation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/asset-attestation-ham.md).

The Create asset attestation playbook provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for creating an asset attestation. This playbook guides you through each stage of the attestation process, starting from filling in the asset attestation details to the completion of attestation.

Create an asset attestation to validate whether the serialized hardware asset that's assigned to an employee is still in use.
-   **[Create an asset attestation schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-attest-schedule-ham.md)**

-   **[Confirming the assigned serialized hardware assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/confirming-assets-emp-portal-mobile.md)**  
As an employee, acknowledge whether you have the serialized hardware that's assigned to you either through the Now Mobile app or on the Employee Center portal.
-   **[Raise issue related to your asset on the Employee Center portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/report-asset-issue-attestation.md)**

-   **[View open asset attestations in the Hardware Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/view-open-asset-attest-ham.md)**
