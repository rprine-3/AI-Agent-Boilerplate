# Content lookup portal for Hardware Asset Management

The Content lookup portal gives you visibility into the data stored in the Content Library as part of the IT Asset Management Content Service via an intuitive user interface.

The Content Library is a repository of hardware product names and all additional information such as hardware product lifecycle dates and model numbers. This information is stored in different tables in the Content Library.

The Content library portal application is available in the ServiceNow Store. After you install the application, verify that the AI Search \(com.glide.ais\) plugin is activated. For more information about installing Content library portal application, see [Install Content lookup to view Hardware Asset Management data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/content-lookup-ham.md).

The Content lookup portal enables you to do the following:

-   Search for hardware products, manufacturers, lifecycles, or model numbers.
-   View the entire list of hardware products, manufacturers, lifecycles, and model numbers in the Content Service.
-   View additional details related to hardware products such as model numbers, and life cycle phases of hardware models.
-   View the cumulative days remaining for the next content update.

Access the Content lookup portal by navigating to **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Content lookup**.

**Note:** After installing the Content library portal application, when you access Content lookup portal for the first time, the charts aren’t populated on the page due to the absence of historical data. To load the charts, execute the Historical Data Collection jobs. For details, see the [Historical Data Collection job](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2229665) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

On the Content lookup portal, you can view the information based on the applications that are installed.

-   If only the Hardware Asset Management application is installed and you have the asset role, you can view the following tabs showing the data stored in the Hardware Asset Management Content Service:
    -   Hardware Overview
    -   Hardware Manufacturers
    -   Hardware Products
    -   Hardware Models
    -   Hardware Lifecycles
-   If both Software Asset Management Professional and Hardware Asset Management applications are installed and you have both asset and sam\_user roles, you can view both hardware and software content tabs. For more information about the Software Asset Management Content library portal, see the [Content lookup portal for Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/content-search-portal.md).

The Content lookup portal uses the AI search functionality and helps you to search for a specific hardware manufacturer, product, and model number. After you enter your search criteria in the search bar, the search results are listed with the most relevant matches at the top. Using the Filters section, you can further narrow down the result.

Based on your search criteria, the information in the Content Service is pulled from the following tables.

-   Hardware Product \[sn\_hamp\_hw\_product\]
-   Hardware Model Libraries \[sn\_hamp\_hw\_product\_model\]
-   Hardware Manufacturer \[sn\_hamp\_hw\_manufacturer\]
-   Hardware Lifecycle Definition \[sn\_hamp\_lifecycle\_definition\]

Select the search result that matches your criteria to display the details of the content record and related lists. The content record page opens in read-only mode.

## Hardware Overview tab

The **Hardware Overview** tab is by default displayed when you navigate to the Content library portal. View the following hardware widgets on this page:
