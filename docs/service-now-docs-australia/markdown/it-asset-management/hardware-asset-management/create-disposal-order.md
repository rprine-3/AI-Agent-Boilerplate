# Create a disposal order

Create a disposal order for hardware or consumable assets. You can create a disposal order for an asset reaching its end of life cycle or an asset that is no longer functional.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset

**Note:** Install the Hardware Asset Management application from the ServiceNow Store.

## About this task

To add the consumables to a disposal order, select **Mark for disposal**. This will set the Planned for disposal field to **true**. For more details, see [Dispose of consumable assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/asset-management/dispose-consumables.md).

Use the Workflow Studio application to create the Hardware Asset Disposal flow to take you through the entire hardware disposal order process.

The hardware disposal order goes through various stages before it’s completed. Each stage is associated with a hardware disposal task. To move through the various stages, close each task until you reach the last stage. After you complete the last task, the hardware disposal order is complete. For more information about the hardware disposal order stages, see [Hardware disposal order stages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/hardware-disposal-stages.md).

You can cancel a disposal order until it reaches the transit stage in the workflow. After your disposal order is in the confirmation stage, you can't cancel that order. You can cancel a task that is in a draft, scheduling, or transit stage by selecting **Closed Incomplete** from the **State** list and closing the task.

Starting with Hardware Asset Management 15.0.0 version, the asset resale option is integrated at the final stage of the disposal workflow that is the Documentation stage. When the Disposal order task is in the Documentation stage, you can choose either to dispose of or to resell the assets. For more information about asset resale, see [Resale hardware assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-resale-order.md).
