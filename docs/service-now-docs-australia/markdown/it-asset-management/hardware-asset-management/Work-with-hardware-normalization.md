# Work with hardware normalization

Asset Management Hardware Model Normalization enables users to normalize the details, such as manufacturer, product, model, and device type, of your hardware and consumable models. Data from the models is compared against the data in the Hardware Model Normalization Content Service.

The Normalization Data Services Client \(com.glide.data\_services\_canonicalization.client\) plugin is also activated when you activate the Hardware Model Normalization plugin.

**Note:** This documentation is for Hardware Model Normalization. For additional information on Asset Management, see the [Asset Management documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/c_AssetManagement.md).

## Scheduled jobs

To standardize your hardware and consumable models, the asset data must be normalized. You can manually update the model records with the normalization content, or you can compare your data against the Hardware Asset Management Content Service.

The **HAM- Hardware Normalization** scheduled job runs daily. This job does not add, remove, or merge models, nor does it modify original fields like Model Name, Manufacturer, or Model Number. It only updates the normalization-related fields for existing models, such as Normalized Product, Normalized Manufacturer, Normalized Model, and so on.

Content from the Hardware Model Normalization Content Service is pulled into the ServiceNow AI Platform. Use the Asset Job Log \(asset\_job\_log\) table to review the status of the scheduled job.

The normalization status of models can be reverted by clicking **Revert Normalization** on the model. Any normalization that occurred on the model gets reverted and the rule gets deactivated. When the scheduled job runs, the models are processed with the active rules and the status is updated.

The scheduled job generates hardware and consumable model reports. These reports identify the overall status of your models and provide a breakdown of the normalization status.

The following reports are included.

-   Hardware Product Overall Normalization Status
-   Consumable Product Overall Normalization Status
-   Hardware Model Normalization Status
-   Consumable Model Normalization Status

-   **[Opt-in to the Hardware Asset Management Content Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/opt-in-hardware-normalization.md)**  
Opt in to the Hardware Asset Management Content Service to improve the normalization process by sharing hardware and consumable model data from your organization with ServiceNow.
-   **[Import and export content data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/import-export-ham.md)**  
Import content data from or export content data to the Hardware Asset Management content library service to support hardware normalization of asset models. On-premise users can import or export data via a zip file using the Manage Hardware Library module.
-   **[Create a hardware or consumable model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/create-hardware-consumable-model.md)**  
To begin tracking your hardware and consumable assets, create a hardware or consumable model. Then, add lifecycle information to keep track of the lifecycle phase of your model.
-   **[Copy a hardware model from the Content lookup portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/copy-hardware-model.md)**  
Copy a hardware model record from the Content lookup portal to add a new model entry to the Product Model \[cmdb\_model\] table.
-   **[Normalize hardware and consumable models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/normalize-hardware-consumable-models.md)**  
After you have created your hardware and consumable models, normalize the information of the model.
-   **[Revert normalization of hardware and consumable models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/revert-norm-ham.md)**  
Revert the normalization of hardware and consumable models in the Hardware Asset Workspace.
-   **[Add a custom product](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/add-custom-hardware-model.md)**  
If you have a product that is not represented in the Asset Management Content Service yet, you can create a custom product.
-   **[Add a custom hardware model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/add-custom-model.md)**  
If you have a hardware model that isn't represented in the Asset Management Content Service yet, you can create a custom model.
