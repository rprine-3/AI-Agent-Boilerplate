## Help manage hardware asset requests agentic workflow overview

The AI agents in the Help manage hardware asset requests agentic workflow help to speed up request resolution, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user satisfaction. This agentic workflow processes and fulfills requests for hardware, consumables, bundles, and pallets.

**Note:** The itil, the procurement\_user, and the now\_assist\_panel\_user roles have access to the ServiceNow Otto panel. The fulfiller needs the itil and procurement\_user roles if you have the ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) store application installed. If you have the ServiceNow Otto for Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) store application but not the ServiceNow Otto for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) store application, then the fulfiller requires the itil, procurement\_user, and now\_assist\_panel\_user roles to fulfill the request via the panel trigger.

-   **Auto-sourcing scenarios**

    To enable AI agents to perform sourcing autonomously, the following options are available at the stockroom level:

    -   **Auto-consume**: Automatically use the available local stock.

        Automatic consumption of local stock happens when a minimum of one stockroom serving the location of the requester has the **Auto-consume** option enabled. If several stockrooms at the location of the requester have the **Auto-consume** option enabled, assets are first consumed from the stockroom with the highest available quantity. If there are still assets needed, they’re consumed from the stockroom with the next highest quantity.

    -   **Auto-transfer**: Automatically transfer stock from another stockroom.

        Automatic transfer of assets happens under the following conditions:

        -   There’s only one destination stockroom serving the location of the requester that has the **Auto-transfer** option enabled.
        -   The destination stockroom must be linked to distribution channels that serve as source stockrooms. Sourcing from these channels is based on their rank, beginning with the distribution channel having the lowest rank and moving on to the next ranks.
        -   The **Auto-transfer** option is enabled on both the source and destination stockrooms.
        .

    -   **Auto-purchase**: Automatically create purchase orders to procure assets from a vendor.

        Automatic purchase of assets happens under the following conditions:

        -   There’s only one stockroom serving the location of the requester that has the **Auto-purchase** option enabled.
        -   There’s only one vendor from whom the model of the requested item can be purchased.
-   **Requested item \(RITM\) validations**

    Before sourcing any hardware asset requests, the Help manage hardware asset requests agentic workflow validates the requested item \(RITM\). The agentic workflow doesn't proceed with sourcing under the following conditions:

    -   The RITM number is missing or invalid.
    -   More than one requested items have the same RITM number.
    -   The requested item is already sourced.
    -   The request isn't sourceable.
    -   The request isn’t approved.
    -   The model that’s requested is invalid or missing.
    -   The model isn’t associated with any model category.
    -   The resource category of the requested model isn’t opted in.
    -   The model associated with the catalog item isn’t licensed.
-   **Prerequisites for using the Hardware Asset Management sourcing AI agent**
    -   The catalog item must be configured to trigger the Standard Hardware Asset Request flow. The sourcing agent depends on actions within this flow, such as request approval.
    -   The requesting user's profile or the requested item must have a location populated. The sourcing agent first checks the requested item for a location; if none is found, it falls back to the requesting user's profile location.
    -   The stockroom must have the Auto-consume, Auto-transfer, or Auto-purchase options enabled for autonomous sourcing. If these flags aren't set, the agent presents a sourcing plan for user confirmation rather than processing the request automatically.
    -   The stockroom must service the requesting user's location. The agent uses location hierarchy and stockroom-to-location mappings to find a match. The stockroom does not need to share the exact same location as the user, but must service that location or one of its parent locations.
-   **Troubleshoot sourcing agent errors**

    If the sourcing agent can't fulfill a request, use the following table to identify the root cause and resolution.

</table>-   **Stages in the agentic workflow**

    The fulfillment of hardware asset requests through the agentic workflow includes the following stages:

    1.  Hardware asset request initiation
        1.  An employee creates a hardware asset request in the Service Catalog application.
        2.  The request is either automatically approved or, when necessary, approved by the asset manager.
        3.  The requested item is assigned to a procurement user, which triggers the Help manage hardware asset requests agentic workflow.
    2.  Asset availability checks by the AI agent
        1.  The AI agent verifies whether the requested item is available in the inventory.
        2.  The AI agent also checks the stockrooms that are set up for automatic consumption of local stock, transfer, and purchase.
    3.  Asset sourcing and allocation
        1.  When stockrooms are configured to consume, transfer, and purchase assets automatically through the AI agents, the following events occur:
            1.  The AI agent first uses the available stock in the stockroom.
            2.  For any remaining assets that can be transferred from another stockroom, the AI agent creates a transfer order.
            3.  If there are still assets to be sourced, the AI agent creates a purchase order to buy them from a vendor.
        2.  When assets are available in stockrooms that aren't set up for automatic sourcing, the AI agent creates a sourcing plan and asks for confirmation from the assignee of the requested item \(RITM\) or the person who started the conversation through the ServiceNow Otto panel before proceeding.

            **Note:** To access the panel after it has been activated, you should have the now\_assist\_panel\_user role. To access the Help manage hardware asset requests agentic workflow in the Hardware Asset Workspace, select the Otto icon \[Omitted image "icon-otto-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:.

            \[Omitted image "now-assist-ham-ai-workflow.png"\] Alt text: Conversation in the ServiceNow Otto panel

            1.  If the AI agent receives the confirmation to proceed and there have been no changes to the plan, it sources the assets according to the sourcing plan.

                **Note:** If there's a change in the plan, the agentic workflow stops, and the conversation should be reinitiated through the panel.

            2.  If the AI agent receives a confirmation not to proceed with the sourcing plan, or if there's still some quantity of assets remaining to be sourced, the agentic workflow continues as follows:
                1.  The AI agent first verifies whether the assets can be sourced through a transfer order or purchase order.

                    If the transfer is possible, the following events happen:

                    1.  The AI agent asks to confirm whether it can proceed with the transfer.
                    2.  If the AI agent receives confirmation to proceed, it asks to confirm both the source and destination stockrooms.
                    3.  After receiving confirmation, the AI agent creates a transfer order.
                    **Note:** If there’s only one stockroom available as the source or destination, it’s automatically selected. The AI agent displays only the source stockrooms that have the quantity of assets to be sourced. Only the stockrooms that serve the location of the requester are shown as destination stockrooms.

                2.  If the AI agent receives a confirmation not to proceed with the transfer order:

                    1.  The AI agent further requests confirmation to proceed with the purchase order.
                    2.  If the AI agent receives confirmation to proceed, it asks to confirm the vendor and the destination stockroom.
                    3.  After receiving confirmation, the AI agent creates a purchase order.
                    **Note:** If there's only one stockroom or vendor available, these values are automatically selected. The AI agent displays the list of vendors for the requested item. Only the stockrooms that serve the location of the requester are shown as destination stockrooms.

                3.  If the user doesn't agree to either the transfer order or the purchase order, the request must be sourced manually.
