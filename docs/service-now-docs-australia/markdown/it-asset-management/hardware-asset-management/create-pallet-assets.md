# Create pallet assets

Create a pallet asset from the Asset estate view in the Hardware Asset Workspace to track and manage assets in the inventory.

## Before you begin

You must create a model for a pallet asset. For more information, see [Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/c_Models.md).

Role required: asset

## About this task

While creating a pallet asset, only the Details, Disposal, Activities, and Audit sections of the asset form appear. Although audit-related fields are shown on the asset form, you can't conduct the audit of pallet assets. You can specify the aisle and space details to give the exact location of the pallet in a stockroom.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Asset estate**.

2.  Select **New Asset**.

3.  In the dialog box, select **Pallet** as the asset type and then select **Create**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
