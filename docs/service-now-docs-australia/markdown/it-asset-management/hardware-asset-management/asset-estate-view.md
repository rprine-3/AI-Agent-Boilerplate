## Load reports on Asset estate view

You can load charts or widgets that fetch a huge set of asset records on demand instead of loading them along with the page. This approach enables you to reduce the loading time for the Asset estate view.

The system property **sn\_itam\_workspace.asset\_estate\_enable\_lazy\_loading** provides you with an option to either selectively load reports you want to view or load reports concurrently with the page. By default, this system property is set to **False**. When this system property is enabled on your ServiceNow instance, you can view charts or widgets by using the **Load report** option.
