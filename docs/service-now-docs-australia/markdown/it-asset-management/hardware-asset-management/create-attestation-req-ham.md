# Create an asset attestation in the Inventory view

Create an asset attestation to validate whether the serialized hardware asset that's assigned to an employee is still in use.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset or inventory\_admin

## About this task

A single asset attestation can have attestations involving more than one employee. Also, an employee can have more than one asset assigned. Therefore, an asset attestation can have multiple users and assets involved.

Only serialized hardware assets that belong to the opted-in resource categories can be requested for attestation. Consumables, bundles, and pallets can't be attested.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Inventory**.

2.  Select the **Asset attestations** tab.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  In the dialog box, under the **Attestation mode**, select **One time**.

5.  Select **Create**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.
