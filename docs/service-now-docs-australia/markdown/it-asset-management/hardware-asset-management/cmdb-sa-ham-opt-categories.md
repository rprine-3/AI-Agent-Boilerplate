# Managing opt-in and opt-out resource categories for HAM in CMDB success advisor

You can opt in to Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) license resource categories to make the corresponding model categories available for selection in CMDB success advisor for HAM.

Before you can set up or update the HAM advisor scope in CMDB success advisor, at least one HAM license resource category must be opted in. Resource categories define the hardware types, such as Servers, Storage, or Mobile Device, covered by your HAM subscription. Only model categories belonging to opted-in resource categories appear in the CMDB success advisor for HAM.

The opted-in resource categories are set to `true` in the HAM Resource Category \[sn\_hamp\_resource\_category\] table. For more information, see [Opt-in or opt-out of HAM license resource categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/optin-optout-ham-license-resource-categories.md).

## Model category availability based on opt-in status

The opt-in status of resource categories determines which model categories are available in the HAM advisor.

The following table describes the HAM advisor behavior based on opt-in status.

|Status|Advisor behavior|
|------|----------------|
|No resource categories opted in|The Select model categories dialog box displays a message indicating that no categories are currently available. You must opt in to at least one resource category before you can configure or update the HAM advisor scope.|
|Resource categories opted in|The corresponding model categories appear in the **Available resource and model categories** column of the Select model categories and Edit dashboard scope dialog boxes and can be selected for the HAM advisor scope.|
|Resource category opted out after selection|Model categories from that resource category are no longer available in the advisor. If those categories were previously selected for the HAM advisor scope, they may become unavailable and the dashboard scope may be reduced.|

## Remove opted-out HAM resource categories

When a resource category is opted out in HAM, its model categories remain in CMDB success advisor until you manually remove them.
