# Analyzing data integrations for improving HAM data coverage

Improve HAM data coverage by analyzing existing and suggested data integrations, including Discovery patterns and Service Graph Connectors.

Use the **Data integrations** tab in the CMDB success advisor for HAM to assess the effectiveness of your current data integration sources in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) and identify opportunities to improve HAM data coverage. The **Data integrations** tab provides a breakdown of active Discovery patterns and installed Service Graph Connectors, including how many key configuration item \(CI\) attributes each integration source is populating.

## Access data integrations

Navigate to the CMDB success advisor, and on the HAM card, select **View insights**. Select the **Data integrations** tab. To access the dashboard, see [Access CMDB success advisor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-sa-access.md).

**Note:** The CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard is available only after the setup process is complete. For more information, see [CMDB success advisor for HAM setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-config-settings.md).

-   Identify an inactive Discovery pattern that can populate attribute data for hardware assets.
-   Identify a Service Graph Connector relevant to hardware assets that is installed but without any active connections.
-   Prioritize which hardware-related integrations to improve to maximize CMDB data quality for improving the completeness, accuracy, and reconciliation of hardware asset records.

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Integration overview|Displays the count of all Discovery patterns and Service Graph Connectors contributing hardware asset data to the CMDB.|
|Status indicators|Check whether Discovery patterns are active and Service Graph Connectors are installed with active connections. For more information, see [Reviewing data integrations for HAM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-integration-details.md).|
|Attribute coverage insights|Select the **Attribute coverage** link next to the integration to review which hardware asset attributes are populated by a Discovery pattern or Service Graph Connector. For more information, see [Evaluate HAM data integration coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-evaluate-data-integration.md).|
|Access integration details|Configure integrations to improve attribute coverage.
