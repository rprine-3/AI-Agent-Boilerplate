# Identify the supply and demand for models within a stockroom in the Hardware Asset Workspace

Use the Supply vs Demand report to evaluate the available and incoming quantity of models in your stockroom and the requests for these models from different service locations. This report helps you determine if you have enough assets to meet the demand.

## Before you begin

Supply refers to the assets that are currently in stock and those that are incoming at your stockroom. Demand refers to the requests for assets from different service locations that your stockroom services.

Note the following points about the Supply vs Demand report:

-   Supply of an asset model to your stockroom includes:
    -   In stock assets that are in the Available, Reserved, Pending transfer, and Pending install stage
    -   Incoming transfer orders that are partially shipped, fully shipped, in transit, received, and delivered
    -   Incoming purchase orders that are ordered
-   Demand for an asset model includes:
    -   Outgoing transfer orders that are in the Draft, Requested, and Shipment preparation stage
    -   Asset requests
    -   Refresh requests
    -   Work order parts requests

The supply and demand details are stored in the Model and stockrooms \[sn\_asset\_model\_and\_stockroom\] table. The **Populate model and stockroom data** scheduled job runs daily to populate this table.

Role required: asset

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Hardware Asset Workspace** &gt; **Inventory**.

2.  Select the **All stockrooms** tab.

3.  From the list of stockrooms, select the one for which you want to view the supply and demand details.

4.  Select the **Inventory insights** tab.

    The Supply vs Demand report shows the count on the y-axis and the model on the x-axis, with separate bars for supply and demand for each model. This visual representation helps you to compare the available quantity of each model in the stockroom with the number of requests from different service locations. By looking at the graph, you can determine which models have enough supply to meet demand and which ones need more stock.

    **Note:** By default, the graph shows details for only 10 models.

5.  View the details of the model that isn't shown on the report.

    1.  Select the **Model** filter.

    2.  Enter the model in the search field or select the model from the **Available** list.

    3.  Move the selected model to the **Applied** list.

    4.  Select **Apply**.

6.  To further drill down into the supply or demand for a model and view its component-level details, select the corresponding bar.

    -   The supply graph shows the count of the following:
        -   **In stock assets**
        -   **Incoming transfer order**
        -   **Incoming purchase order**
    -   The demand graph shows the count of the following:
        -   **Outgoing transfer order**
        -   **Asset requests**
        -   **Refresh requests**
        -   **Work order parts requests**
    By selecting the relevant bars, you can view the list of assets that make up the count.

7.  To initiate the calculation of supply and demand for asset models manually, select **Recalculate quantity**.

    The Supply vs Demand graph updates to show the recently calculated values.
