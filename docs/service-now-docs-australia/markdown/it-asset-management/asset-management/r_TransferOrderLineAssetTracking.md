# Transfer order line asset tracking

Understand how asset states and stock information update automatically as a transfer order line progresses through each stage. Consumables and non-consumables are tracked differently.

When an asset is included in a transfer order line, the following takes place:

-   A substate field on the asset form changes to reflect the transfer order line states
-   The Active TO option on the asset form is automatically selected to show that the asset is part of a transfer order and cannot be added to multiple transfer orders
-   The asset is removed from the pool of available assets and changed to a state of In Stock Pending Transfer

When transfer order line stages change for non-consumables, it affects asset substates.

When a consumable is added to a transfer order line, the stock for the consumable is split into two records and the transfer order links to the newly created stock line.
