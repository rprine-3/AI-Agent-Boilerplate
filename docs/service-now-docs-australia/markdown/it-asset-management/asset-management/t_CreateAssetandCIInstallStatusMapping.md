# Map asset state and CI install status

Map the asset **State** and **Substate** fields to the **CI Install Status** field. The **Substatus** field of the **CI Install Status** field should not be used for hardware CIs.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or asset

**Note:** If you upgraded from a prior release and customized the AssetAndCISynchronizer script include before the upgrade, you must overwrite the customization and then recreate the custom mappings.

## About this task

Asset synchronization does not update this field when hardware assets are updated. When you create the mapping, you can set the synchronisation direction from Asset to CI, but not from CI to Asset. For non-Hardware CI classes, you can set the synchronisation in both the directions.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Asset** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Asset-CI Install Status Mapping**.

    By default, only custom mappings display. The list of mappings uses the filter condition of **\[Out of the box\] \[is\] \[False\]**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  From the **Asset State** list, select the state you want to map.

4.  If available, select a substate from the **Asset Substate** list.

    Some of the asset states do not have a substate.

5.  From the **Configuration Item Status** list, select the logically associated CI status you want to map.

6.  From the **Sync direction** list, select the direction you want to drive the synchronization.

7.  Select the **Active** check box to activate the mapping.

8.  Click **Submit**.
