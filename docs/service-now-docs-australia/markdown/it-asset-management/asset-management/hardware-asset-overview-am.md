# Hardware asset overview

Enhance your Asset Management experience by using the modernized and user-friendly Hardware asset overview view. The Hardware asset overview is a simplified and intuitive environment that helps you use the application more effectively by reducing complexity.

Use the Hardware asset overview view to:

-   Act on discrepancies such as when an asset is missing PO number, model number, asset function, or manufacturer.
-   Navigate to specific dashboards on asset functions such as Asset requests, Transfer orders, and Stock orders.
-   View the 360 asset view section displaying asset counts by model category and asset value by model category.
-   View the overall performance section displaying the Discovered and undiscovered asset count and Assets eligible for refresh by model category.

Select any widget or chart to view detailed information and take appropriate actions. You can also use **Location**, **Stockroom**, and **Model category** lists to filter your results.

## Load reports on Hardware asset overview

You can load charts or widgets that fetch a huge set of asset records on demand instead of loading them along with the page. This approach enables you to reduce the loading time for the Hardware asset overview page.

The system property **sn\_itam\_workspace.asset\_overview\_enable\_lazy\_loading** provides you with an option to either selectively load reports you want to view or load reports concurrently with the page. By default, this system property is set to **False**. When this system property is enabled on your ServiceNow instance, you can view reports by using the **Load report** option.
