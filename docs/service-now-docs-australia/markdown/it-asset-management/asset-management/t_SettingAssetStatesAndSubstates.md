# Set asset states and substates

Use asset states and substates to track assets accurately and at a detailed level.

## Before you begin

Role required: asset

## About this task

Good asset information helps you with reporting, controlling assets, and lowering costs. For example, recording missing items using the **State** and **Substates** fields enables you to run reports and analyze the information. You can use this information to lower costs.

**Tip:** You shouldn’t modify state values. If the state values are supported and defined by the process, you can modify substates.

Some of the substate values are available with more than one state. For example, the substate **Pending disposal** is available with the state **In stock**, **In transit**, and **Retired**. The combination of the **State** and the **Substate** fields provide the correct asset tracking information. For example, an asset that is **In stock** and **Pending disposal** indicates that the asset is no longer used and is in the stockroom waiting to be disposed of.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Asset** &gt; **Portfolios** &gt; **All Assets**.

2.  Select an asset.

3.  Edit the **State** and **Substate** fields.
