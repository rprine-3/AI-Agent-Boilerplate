## Before you begin

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Inventory** &gt; **Transfer Orders** and open the transfer order.

2.  In the Transfer Order Lines related list, open the transfer order line.

3.  In the Transfer Order Line Tasks related list, open the current open task.

    The task name reflects the current stage, for example, **Ready for fulfillment**.

4.  Review the task details and select **Close Task**.


## Result

-   The current task closes with a status of Closed Complete.
-   The next task in the sequence opens automatically.
