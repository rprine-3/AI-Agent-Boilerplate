# Consume consumable assets

To consume consumable assets, they must have a state of **In Stock** and a substate of **Available**.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, asset, or itil\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Asset** &gt; **Portfolios** &gt; **Consumables**.

2.  Click the **Display Name** of a consumable asset with a state of **In Stock** and a substate of **Available**.

3.  Click **Consume**.

4.  Enter the **Quantity** to consume.

5.  In **Asset**, click the lookup icon and select the asset associated with the consumable.

    For example, a mouse tracked as a consumable asset can be associated with a non-consumable asset such as a computer.

6.  In **User**, click the lookup icon and select a user associated with the consumable.

7.  Click **OK**.

    On the **Consumable** form, the **Quantity** field shows the reduced number. The Consumables list contains two records for the consumable in the specific stockroom: one with a state and substate of **In Stock** and **Available** \(if you did not consume the entire quantity\), and one with a state of **Consumed**. If a consumable is not in the process of being transferred to a different stockroom and information in the data record is the same, similar records merge automatically. After a consumable is consumed, the record remains in the system for reporting purposes.
