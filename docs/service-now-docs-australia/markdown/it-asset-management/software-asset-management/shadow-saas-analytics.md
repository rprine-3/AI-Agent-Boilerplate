# SaaS detection report

Use the SaaS detection report to discover and manage all SaaS applications accessed via a browser and configured within the ServiceNow® Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\) product. The SaaS applications that can be managed through this report can be paid or free ones.
