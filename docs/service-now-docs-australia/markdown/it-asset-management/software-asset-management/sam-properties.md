Enables setting up a threshold limit to show the count of software asset records on the License operations view. SAM administrator can set the value of the threshold limit as required.Value is set to **5000000**. If there are less than five million records, then the exact count of software installation records is shown. If there are more than five million records, then the count is shown as 5000000+.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select the default Subgroup setting for the weekly run of reconciliationcom.snc.samp.recon.subgroup

</td><td>

Determines the secondary grouping for rights and software installations during reconciliation.

 Except for `None`, group and subgroup values must be different.

 Values \(default is **None**\):

-   **Company**
-   **Cost Center**
-   **Country**
-   **Department**
-   **Region**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Run reconciliation with all available custom license metricscom.snc.samp.recon.enablecustommetrics

</td><td>

Enables custom license metrics when running reconciliation. If you have a custom license metric configured, it is not applied when this property is set to **No**. The default is **Yes**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable debugging of reconciliation results. Note that enabling debugging will have an impact on performance.com.snc.samp.debug

</td><td>

Enables debugging of reconciliation results to troubleshoot a result. The default is **No**.Additionally, this property also triggers logging for on-premise import debugging.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Automatically create software models for all 'licensable' productscom.snc.samp.automaticsmrcreation

</td><td>

Automatically creates a software model, in a non-compliant state, for any unlicensed installations, subscriptions, or options \(of licensable products\) in the Product Results list that don’t have an entitlement.The new software model and results are used to show the unlicensed count in the License Position Report.

 **Note:** For more information on automatically creating software models, see [Automatic creation of software models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/duplicate-sw-models.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Automatically create software model results for unlicensed products during software asset reconciliationcom.snc.samp.unlicensed\_smr\_creation

</td><td>

Disables software model result creation for unlicensed software models. Software model results continue to be created for software models that have valid entitlements. The default value is **False**. You can modify the value using system properties configuration. When the property is set to **True**, the software model results get created for software models that don’t have entitlements or have installs requiring action.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select the level of aggregation for reconciling licenses for Oracle databases and WebLogic servers on VMware com.snc.samp.oracle.reconlevel

 **Note:** This property is available only if you have activated the Software Asset Management publisher pack for Oracle.

 **Note:** This property supports domain separation using the domain separation application properties for Software Asset Management. See [Set up domain-specific reconciliation properties for Oracle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/define-application-properties-oracle.md) for more details.

</td><td>

Level of aggregation that is used for reconciling Oracle Database and WebLogic Server licenses on VMware virtualization technology. Software Asset Management supports the following aggregation levels:-   **ESX**: The **ESX** aggregation level considers all processor cores on the ESX host.
-   **ESX cluster** \(default value\): The **ESX cluster** aggregation level considers all processors on every ESX server within a cluster.
-   **vCenter\(s\)**: The **vCenter\(s\)** aggregation level considers all processor cores on every ESX server.

If you select this aggregation level, licensing calculations are based on the ESXi version that you’re using in your VMware virtual environment. See [Oracle Database and WebLogic Server licensing in soft-partitioned environments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/oracle-licensing-soft-partitioned-environments.md) for more information on the supported ESXi versions.

Use host affinity for reconciling licenses for Oracle databases and WebLogic servers on VMware at the vCenter\(s\) aggregation levelcom.snc.samp.oracle.hostaffinityenabled

 **Note:** This property is available only if you have activated the Software Asset Management publisher pack for Oracle.

 **Note:** This property supports domain separation by using the domain separation application properties for Software Asset Management. See [Set up domain-specific reconciliation properties for Oracle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/define-application-properties-oracle.md) for more details.

</td><td>

Enables the Software Asset Management application to account for VM-Host affinity rules when reconciling Oracle Database and WebLogic Server licenses within VMware vCenter Server instances. This property is applicable only if you set the aggregation level for Oracle reconciliation to **vCenter\(s\)** in the **Select the level of aggregation for reconciling licenses for Oracle databases and WebLogic servers on VMware** property.VM-Host affinity rules enable you to specify the physical ESXi hosts on which your virtual machines can run. If provisions are made for VM-Host affinity rules in your Oracle license agreement, you can lower your licensing obligations by accounting for these rules when licensing your Oracle Database and WebLogic servers.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server for Virtual Datacenters license cost optimization threshold**Note:** This property is available only if you have activated the Software Asset Management publisher pack for IBM.

</td><td>

Determines whether you should use RHEL Server or RHEL for Virtual Datacenters licenses for your RHEL deployment.

 The default threshold value is 3.2. This value is based on the ratio of the current RHEL Server subscription list price to the current RHEL for Virtual Datacenters subscription list price. If your entitlements contain different pricing for these products, you can calculate this value by dividing your RHEL for Virtual Datacenters subscription price by your RHEL Server subscription price.

 See [Software Asset Management for Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/rhel-publisher-pack.md) for more information about how you can use this threshold value to determine the most optimal license type for your RHEL deployment.

 Based on the current list price of each license type, the default cost ratio value is 4.59. If your entitlements contain different pricing for these license types, you can modify this value by dividing the average price of your Microsoft Windows Server Datacenter Edition licenses by the average price of your Microsoft Windows Server Standard Edition licenses.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td><td>

Determines whether it’s more cost-effective to license the physical hosts or virtual machines \(VMs\) within your Microsoft SQL Server clusters based on the cost ratio between Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition licenses with Software Assurance and Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition licenses with Software Assurance.

 Based on the current list price of each license type, the default cost ratio value is 0.25. If your entitlements contain different pricing for these license types, you can modify this value by dividing the price of your Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition licenses with Software Assurance by the price of your Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition licenses with Software Assurance.

**Note:** This property is available only if you have activated the Software Asset Management publisher pack for Microsoft.

</td><td>

Determines whether it’s more cost effective to use licenses with or without Microsoft Software Assurance on your Microsoft SQL Server clusters. The Software Asset Management application makes this determination based on the cost ratio between Microsoft SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance and without Software Assurance.

 Based on the current list price of each license type, the default cost ratio value is 1.25. If your entitlements contain different pricing for these license types, you can modify this value by dividing the price of your Microsoft SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance by the price of your Microsoft SQL Server licenses without Software Assurance.
