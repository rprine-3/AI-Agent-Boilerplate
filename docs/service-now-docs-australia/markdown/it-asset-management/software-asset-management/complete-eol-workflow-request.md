# Complete the end of life workflow request for your software product

Perform all the tasks that are required to remove the end of life \(EOL\) software products from your asset inventory.

## Before you begin

Before you proceed with removing the EOL software, you must start an EOL workflow request. For details, see [Create an end of life workflow request for your software products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/manage-eol-risk.md).

If you set the **Action** field to **Remove EOL Software** in the Decide on IT strategy task, you must perform these software EOL tasks.

Role required: sam\_user, users with an itil role to whom a task is assigned

## About this task

To close an EOL request, you must complete and close all the tasks required to complete the workflow. The following procedure explains how to close the EOL request, when you set the **Action** field to **Remove EOL Software** in the Decide on IT strategy task. You can apply the same approach to close the EOL request for the following possible values in the **Action** field in the Decide on IT strategy task:

-   Upgrade
-   Purchase support
-   Move to Azure
-   Accept risk

Additionally, the EOL workflow can be completed using the Software End of Life Flow in the Flow Designer application. You can customize the Software End of Life Flow according to your requirement by creating a copy of the flow and customizing the copy that you have created.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Software Asset Analytics** &gt; **Lifecycle management**.

2.  On the Lifecycle management dashboard, open the End of life \(EOL\) products page by selecting the **Upcoming end of life product lifecycles in next 18 months** report or the **Current and past end of life product lifecycles** report.

3.  From the list of available EOL products, select the product for which you want to complete the EOL workflow.
