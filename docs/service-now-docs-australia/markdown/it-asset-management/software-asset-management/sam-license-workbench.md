# Software license usage

Review reconciliation results in a simplified workbench view.

The License Workbench lets you forecast the needs of your organization by trending the number of rights consumed against the number of active rights purchased. You can stay in compliance by purchasing additional rights before software consumption surpasses the number of rights owned.

Workbench features include:

-   Color-coded compliance banner
-   Financial calculations on card
-   Publisher pinning functionality \(user specific, saved\)
-   Sort card functionality
-   Active filtering
-   Card drill down to Product Results list
-   Keyboard control
-   Group and subgroup reconciliation information, if applicable

\[Omitted image "license-workbench.png"\] Alt text: License Workbench showing all publishers, publishers out of compliance, and pinned publishers in different tabs.

Pinned publishers are listed in the **Pinned Publishers** tab. The list of pinned publishers is saved on a per-user basis.\[Omitted image "sam-pin-publisher.png"\] Alt text: Pin Publisher icon pins a publisher that appears in the Pinned Publishers tab.

|Tab|Description|
|---|-----------|
|All Publishers|List of all publishers.|
|Publishers Out of Compliance|List of all publishers where status is not compliant.|
|Pinned Publishers|User-specific saved list of publishers that have been grouped.|

## Publisher workbench navigation tree

Drill down on a specific publisher, product, software model, or license metric in the workbench navigation tree to view the calculation and compliance information from the latest reconciliation results.

The navigation tree features are:

-   Filter products \(active filtering, including collapsed items\)
-   Compliance toggle switch
-   Expand and collapse tree links
-   Software model compliance icons

\[Omitted image "software-model-results.png"\] Alt text: Publisher Workbench navigation tree showing publishers and their product results

By default, the navigation tree on the publisher license overview page is collapsed. When expanded, it's grouped by publisher.

Publisher: Product Results related lists:

-   [Software Model Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_ViewSWModelResults.md)
-   Licensed Installs
-   Unlicensed Installs \(SAP: Unlicensed Users or Unlicensed Engines\)
-   Unlicensed Subscriptions \(Subscription-based software\)
-   Removal Candidates

Software Model Results related lists:

-   License Metric Results
-   Remediation Options: The **Rights Needed By** tab is not visible for the Resource Value Unit \(RVU\) IBM license metric. Rights are not used by individual devices, as the Resource Value Unit \(RVU\) license metric is licensed at the product level.

    **Note:** For more details on the remediation options, see [View software model results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_ViewSWModelResults.md).

-   Licensed Installs
-   Unlicensed Installs \(SAP: Unlicensed Users\)
-   Unlicensed Subscriptions \(Subscription-based software\)
-   Unlicensed Consumptions \(Consumption-based software models\)
-   Unlicensed Options \(Oracle only\)
-   Removal Candidates
-   Purchase Orders \(only when the Procurement \(com.snc.procurement\) plugin is active\)

License Metric Results related list:

-   Rights Used By: Not visible for the Resource Value Unit \(RVU\) IBM license metric. The Resource Value Unit \(RVU\) license metric is licensed at the product level; it is calculated based on the total consumption of the product in your enterprise.

    **Note:** Four additional fields are visible in the Rights Used By related list if you have cloud installations.

-   Licensed Installs
-   Installs Used \(SAP: System Users\)
-   Downgrades/Upgrades
-   Licensed Subscriptions
-   Cloud Special Rights: This tab is available only if you have cloud installations on cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure. This tab is a subset of the Rights Used By tab and displays fields pertaining to cloud installations. For detailed descriptions on the Cloud Special Rights fields, refer to the Rights Used By tab.
