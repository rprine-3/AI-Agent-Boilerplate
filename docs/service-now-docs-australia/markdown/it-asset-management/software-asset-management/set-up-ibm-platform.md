</table>5.  Set up the connection timeout.

    Use one of the following options to set up the connection timeout:

    -   **glide.http.outbound.max\_timeout.enabled system property**: The ServiceNow AI Platform **glide.http.outbound.max\_timeout.enabled** system property enables you to specify the number of seconds that RESTMessageV2 and SOAPMessageV2 APIs wait for a response from a synchronous call. You can configure this system property by opening a new tab or window and then navigating to **System Properties** &gt; **All Properties** &gt; **glide.http.outbound.max\_timeout.enabled**. If this system property is set to **true** or is not available on your ServiceNow instance, your instance uses a default timeout value of 30 seconds. If this system property is set to **false**, your ServiceNow instance uses a default timeout value 600 seconds. See [Available system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/r_AvailableSystemProperties.md) for more information on this system property.
    -   **Connection timeout field**: The **Connection timeout** field on the HTTP\(s\) Connection form enables you to specify the number of seconds that your ServiceNow instance waits to establish the given connection.

        **Important:** This option is applicable only in the San Diego and later releases. In the Rome and earlier releases, you must set up the connection timeout using only the **glide.http.outbound.max\_timeout.enabled** system property.

        Application of the **Connection timeout** field is dependent on your **glide.http.outbound.max\_timeout.enabled** system property configuration. If the system property is set to **false**, your ServiceNow instance honors the value that is specified in the **Connection timeout** field.

        **Note:** If the **Connection timeout** field is empty, your ServiceNow instance uses a default connection timeout value of 300 seconds.

        If the system property is set to **true** or is not available on your ServiceNow instance, your instance ignores the value that is specified in the **Connection timeout** field. Instead, your instance uses a default connection timeout value of 30 seconds.

6.  Configure additional attributes for the connection.

    Select the **Attributes** tab and then fill in the fields.

    \[Omitted image "ibm-ilmt-connection-form-attributes-tab.png"\] Alt text: Attributes tab on the HTTPs Connection form.
