# Oracle Database options and management packs

You can use the Software Asset Management publisher pack for Oracle to track licensing positions for your Oracle Database options and management packs. The Licensable Oracle Options \[samp\_oracle\_option\_set\] table provides the complete list of database options and management packs that you can create software models for.

You must manage licensing for your Oracle Database options and management packs separately from your Oracle Database servers. Separate software models and entitlements are required for each of your database servers, database options, and management packs, thereby providing a more comprehensive view of your Oracle license compliance position.

For example, Oracle DB Server 12c R1 Enterprise with the Partitioning option requires two separate software models and entitlements.

</table>To track and measure usage for your Oracle Database options and management packs, request and install the Data Collection for Oracle Global Licensing and Advisory Services application from the ServiceNow Store. See [Request Data Collection for Oracle Global Licensing and Advisory Services \(GLAS\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/request-data-collection-oracle-glas-app.md) for detailed instructions.

**Important:** If you are activating the Software Asset Management application for the first time in the San Diego and later releases, the Data Collection for Oracle Global Licensing and Advisory Services application is required for discovering and measuring the usage of your database options and management packs.

If you are activating the Software Asset Management application for the first time in the Rome and earlier releases or you are upgrading an existing instance of the Software Asset Management application from the Rome and earlier releases to the San Diego and later releases, you can continue using the existing patterns for discovering and measuring the usage of your database options and management packs. However, ServiceNow recommends that you use the Data Collection for Oracle Global Licensing and Advisory Services application instead, as the application provides enhanced capabilities that address additional use cases.

After you install the application, the SAM - Evaluate database option usage from Oracle GLAS data scheduled job runs weekly or on-demand to retrieve usage data for both the Oracle database options and management packs that are installed in your Oracle environment and the Oracle features that are associated with them. The Software Asset Management application can then include this data in the Oracle reconciliation process to help you determine the license compliance positions of your database options and management packs, which are reported separately from the license compliance positions of your Oracle Database servers.

**Note:** For more information on how usage data for your Oracle features can help you determine the license compliance of your database options and management packs, see [Feature mapping for Oracle Database options and management packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/oracle-feature-option-mapping.md).

Oracle Database options and management packs follow the Oracle Database server lifecycle and are displayed in the License usage view \(Software Asset Workspace\) or License Workbench \(Software Asset Management classic application\). However, the following remediation options are not available for database options and management packs:

-   Remove Unallocated Installs
-   Remove Unlicensed Installs

## Supported Oracle Database options and management packs

The Software Asset Management publisher pack for Oracle supports the following database options and management packs based on whether you are using the existing discovery and usage measurement patterns or the Data Collection for Oracle Global Licensing and Advisory Services application to track and measure usage for your database options and management packs.

Request the Data Collection for Oracle GLAS application from the ServiceNow Store so that you can track and measure usage for your Oracle Database options and management packs.
-   **[Feature mapping for Oracle Database options and management packs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/oracle-feature-option-mapping.md)**  
The Software Asset Management application automatically maps discovered Oracle features to the Oracle Database options and management packs that they’re associated with. These mappings can help you determine the usage and license compliance of your database options and management packs.
-   **[Unreported Database Options Usage report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/oracle-unreported-database-options-usage-report.md)**  
You can use the Unreported Database Options Usage report to gain visibility into the Oracle Database options and management packs that are being used on undiscovered database instances. Although you cannot track usage for these database options and management packs, this report can help you determine any potential licensing implications that are associated with them.
