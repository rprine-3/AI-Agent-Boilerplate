# Overlapping usage view

Use the Overlapping usage view in Software Asset Workspace to get insights into the feature level usage and rationalize your SaaS and Single sign-on \(SSO\) applications.

The Overlapping usage view displays reports showing the spend on your applications based on application category - SaaS or spend detection. You can also view the list of applications grouped by categories based on the main function of the software application, such as video conferencing, project management, and email marketing. This list of applications includes the following details:

-   Spend
-   Usage
-   Total number of subscriptions
-   Reclamation candidates

Access the Overlapping usage view by navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Overlapping usage**.

**Note:** Request the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management Integrations application from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/) to view the Overlapping usage view.

**Note:** The Overlapping usage dashboard supports domain separation when Domain Extension Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\) and Domain Support \(com.snc.pa.domain\_support\) plugins are activated. To filter the data, select a domain from the Domain drop-down list.

## Creating demand to rationalize software applications

Creating demands enables you to take meaningful action against any redundant software you discover. You can discontinue software, reduce software usage, migrate users to approved software, or take other actions.

**Note:** The PPM Standard plugin \(com.snc.financial\_planning\_pmo\) must be installed to create demands.

Select **Create demand** to rationalize software applications. For more information, see [Create demand to rationalize software applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/soft-asset-demand.md).
