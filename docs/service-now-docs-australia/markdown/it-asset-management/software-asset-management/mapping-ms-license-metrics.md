# License metrics for Microsoft products

A detailed description of the license metrics that can be used with Microsoft products.

## Microsoft products and Software Asset Management license metrics

**Note:** The support for Per Processor license metric for Windows Server is applicable for Zurich patch 4 and Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 3.2.0 version onwards. If you have already upgraded to Zurich, you can install the Software Asset Management manually.

A server licensing rule \(for Workgroup, Standard, or Enterprise editions\) is required for every operating system environment on which that edition pf SQL Server software or any of its components, such as Analysis Services, is running.

 A Processor license is required for each processor installed on each operating system environment running SQL Server or any of its components, such as Analysis Services.

</td><td>

Core based licensing:

1.  Count the total number of physical cores in the server. Multiple the number of cores by the appropriate core factor to determine the total number of licenses required for the server.

**Note:** The core factor used depends on the processor type deployed and a minimum of four core licenses is required for each physical processor on a physical server.

2.  To license individual VMs using the Per Core model, you must purchase a core license for each v-core \(or virtual processor, virtual CPU, virtual thread\) allocated to the VM, subject to a four core license minimum per VM.

For licensing purposes, a v-core maps to a hardware thread. When licensing individual VMs, core factors do not apply.

Use license metric as Server \(per Server\) for Server Licensing and User/Device CAL for CAL licensing. The new purchases for SQL Server Enterprise will be based only on the Per Core licensing model.
