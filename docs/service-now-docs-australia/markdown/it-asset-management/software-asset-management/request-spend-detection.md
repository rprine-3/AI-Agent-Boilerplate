# Request Software Spend Detection

Request Software Spend Detection to track, analyze, and optimize software spending. To access Software Spend Detection, enable the Software Asset Management - Spend Detection \(com.sn\_sam\_spend\) plugin. This plugin includes demo data.

## Before you begin

Before you can request Software Spend Detection, you must sign the Software Spend Detection legal agreement. For more information about the Software Spend Detection legal agreement, contact your ServiceNow account representative.

To use Software Spend Detection, you must activate the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin on your ServiceNow instance. For more information about activating Software Asset Management Professional, see [Request Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmt.md).

You must also install the [Software Asset Workspace](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/f3a752821b4f221084105282604bcb32) \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) app from the ServiceNow Store.

Software Spend Detection works with or without AI. To use AI-powered classification and normalization, install the [ServiceNow Otto for Software Asset Management \(SAM\)](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/869d23661b646a50a85b16db234bcbab) \(sn\_now\_assist\_sam\) app from the ServiceNow Store. Without this app, Software Spend Detection uses the machine learning pipeline. For details, see [AI-powered Software Spend Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/spend-detection-ai-enhancements.md).

**Note:** Software Spend Detection is not supported for on-premises users hosting their own ServiceNow instance.
