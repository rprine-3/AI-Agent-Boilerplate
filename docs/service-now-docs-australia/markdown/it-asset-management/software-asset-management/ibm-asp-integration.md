# Client Value Acceleration \(CVA\) integrations for IBM

Integrate the Software Asset Management publisher pack for IBM with authorized Software Asset Management providers to track and manage IBM licenses across virtualized VMware vSphere and Nutanix environments, and IBM LPAR infrastructures. These integrations help you to track and manage IBM licensing directly without integrating with theIBM License Metric Tool \(ILMT\) or BigFix Inventory.

The CVA Program is a license verification program that allows clients who contract with Authorized SAM Providers \(ASPs\) to report on their IBM license usage independently. For more information on the CVA Program, refer to the [IBM CVA Program](https://www.ibm.com/about/software-licensing/us-en/sam/cva_program) page.

**Important:** As of January 1, 2025, IBM has withdrawn its IBM Authorized SAM Provider \(IASP\) Program and replaced it with the CVA Program. If you're an existing IASP Program user, contact your IBM representative to upgrade to the new CVA agreement and migrate to the CVA Program.

The IBM publisher pack supports integrations with the following ASPs:

-   Anglepoint \(through the Anglepoint Elevate platform\)
-   Deloitte
-   EY
-   KPMG

To integrate with an ASP, you must request and install the IBM License Compliance for Software Asset Management application from the ServiceNow® Store. This application provides the core functionality and license metrics that are required for tracking and managing IBM licensing directly. If you are integrating with Anglepoint, you must also request and install Anglepoint's IBM Licensing for Software Asset Management application from the ServiceNow® Store. This application enables you to store IBM software information from Anglepoint.

After you install the necessary applications, you must retrieve the IBM software discovery catalog from the ASP that you are integrating with. This catalog, which is maintained separately by each ASP, is a centralized repository of IBM software information that discovery tools, such as the ServiceNow® Discovery application, can use to identify the IBM software that is discovered in your environment. After you retrieve the catalog, you must upload it to your ServiceNow instance.

On successful upload, you can use the ServiceNow Discovery application to run a discovery for your IBM software. The Discovery application uses the uploaded catalog to identify any IBM software that is discovered in your environment. It then sends this data to the ASP for comprehensive software classification and bundling.

After your discovered IBM software is properly classified and bundled, the ASP sends this data back to your ServiceNow® instance. The Software Asset Management application can then use the processor value unit \(PVU\), resource value unit \(RVU\), and virtual processor core \(VPC\) license metrics to reconcile this data so that you can track your IBM software usage and optimize your licensing costs. For more information on the PVU and RVU license metrics, see [IBM processor value unit \(PVU\) and resource value unit \(RVU\) licenses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/ibm-pvu-rvu-licensing.md). For more information on the VPC license metric, see [IBM virtual processor core \(VPC\) licenses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/ibm-virtual-processor-core-licensing.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can integrate the IBM publisher pack with an ASP, you must complete the following prerequisites:

-   Complete all prerequisites for participating in the CVA Program. For more information on these prerequisites, refer to the How it works section of [CVA Program Verification](https://www.ibm.com/about/software-licensing/us-en/sam/cva_program).
-   Request and install the IBM License Compliance for Software Asset Management application from the ServiceNow® Store. See [Request the IBM License Compliance for Software Asset Management application for Authorized Software Asset Management Provider \(ASP\) integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/request-ibm-license-compliance-sam-application.md) for detailed instructions.
-   Enable the **Use ServiceNow Software Asset Management and Discovery for IBM license compliance** \(**com.snc.samp.ibm.use\_samp\_ibm\_licensing**\) Software Asset Management property. See [Software Asset Management properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-properties.md) for more information on this property.
-   Activate the Discovery \(com.snc.discovery\) plugin on your ServiceNow instance. See [Request Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/t_ActivateTheDiscoveryPlugin.md) for detailed instructions.
-   Activate the File-based Discovery \(com.snc.discovery.file\_based\_discovery\) plugin on your ServiceNow instance. See [File-based Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/file-based-discovery.md) for more information on file-based Discovery.
-   Request and install the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/). See [Discovery patterns used by ITOM Visibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/c_MappingPatternsCustomization.md) for more information on Discovery and Service Mapping patterns.
-   If you want to use domain separation for the integration, activate the Domain Support - Domain Extensions Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\) plugin on your ServiceNow instance. See [Domain separation plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/domain-sep-plugin.md) for detailed instructions.
-   Download the IBM software discovery catalog from the ASP.
-   If you want to track and manage IBM licensing in public cloud environments, configure one or more for the following services to automatically scan for and update the CMDB with cloud infrastructure changes every 30 minutes:
    -   For public clouds hosted by AWS, configure the AWS Config service. See [Configure AWS Config event notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/aws-config-service-cloud-mgt.md) for detailed instructions.
    -   For public clouds hosted by Microsoft Azure, configure the Microsoft Azure Alert service. See [Configure the Microsoft Azure Alert service to auto-update the CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/microsoft-azure-alert-driven-discovery.md) for detailed instructions.
    -   For public clouds hosted by Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\), configure the Google Cloud Logging service. See [Configure the Google Cloud Logging service to auto-update the CMDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/gcp-stackdriver-service.md) for detailed instructions.
