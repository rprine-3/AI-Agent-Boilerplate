# Oracle Database licensing in multitenant architectures

The Software Asset Management application supports licensing rules for Oracle databases in multitenant architectures.

The Oracle multitenant architecture simplifies database management by enabling you to consolidate multiple pluggable databases \(PDBs\) into a single container database \(CDB\). With a CDB, you can track, provision, clone, manage resources for, and upgrade multiple PDBs simultaneously. This multitenant architecture is supported on Oracle Database version 12c Release 1 \(12.1\) and later.

To run an Oracle database in a multitenant architecture, you must purchase and manage licenses for both Oracle Database and the Oracle Multitenant option. In most cases, Oracle Multitenant option licenses must be purchased and managed separately from Oracle Database licenses. However, Oracle Database Cloud Service Enterprise Edition - High Performance \(DBCS EE-HP\), Oracle Database Cloud Service Enterprise Edition - Extreme Performance \(DBCS EE-EP\), and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Service \(ExaCS\) do not require a separate license for the Oracle Multitenant option, as it is already included in the database license. For more information on Oracle Database licensing, see [Software Asset Management publisher pack for Oracle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/oracle-publisher-pack.md).

## Oracle Multitenant option licensing

The Oracle Multitenant option supports both the Named User Plus and Per Processor license metrics. The Named User Plus license metric licenses all users and physical devices that access a user-created PDB. The Per Processor license metric licenses the processor cores on all physical hosts that are running a user-created PDB. For more information on these license metrics, see [Oracle license metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/oracle-publisher-pack.md).

**Important:** Oracle Multitenant option licensing accounts for user-created PDBs only. It does not account for proxy PDBs or seed PDBs.

You can determine whether Oracle Multitenant option licensing is required for your database deployment based on the following criteria:

-   The Oracle Database version and edition of your PDBs and CDBs.
-   The number of user-created PDBs within each database instance that is running on the database installation.

**Important:** This version and edition of Oracle Database supports up to 252 user-created PDBs per database instance. If a database instance contains more than 252 user-created PDBs, Software Asset Management creates removal candidates for the additional PDBs. You must remove the additional PDBs to maintain compliance.
