# Create SAP users, roles, and authorizations

Create the SAP user, roles, and authorization objects required for the Software Asset Management integration with the central and satellite SAP systems.

## Before you begin

The SAP transport files must be imported into the central system before configuring users and roles.

Role required: SAP Basis administrator

## About this task

The Software Asset Management integration requires a dedicated SAP user with separate roles for the central system and each satellite system. Central system roles control background job scheduling and service access. Satellite system roles control RFC execution and table display access.

## Procedure

1.  Create a user ID `S_SERVICENOW` in your SAP system.

    If the user already exists, remove the current authorizations and set up new authorizations with central and satellite system permissions.

2.  Create a central system role.

    1.  Navigate to transaction code **PFCG**.

    2.  On the Role Maintenance page, enter a role name in the **Role** field.

        For example, `Z_SNOW_CTR`.

    3.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the role and save.

    4.  Add authorization object `S_SERVICE` and add external service name `/NOW/SAMP//NOW/SAMP_USER_DETAILS_WSDL`.

    5.  Add authorization object `S_BTCH_ADM` and select the **N \(No administrator authorization\)** option in the **Activities** field.

    6.  Add authorization object `S_BTCH_JOB`, select **RELE \(Release Jobs\)** in the **Activities** field, and leave the **JOBGROUP** field empty.

    7.  If the central system is a SAP S/4HANA system, add authorization object `S_PROGNAM` and the following values in the corresponding fields.

        -   **P\_ACTION** — `BTCSUBMIT`
        -   **P\_PROGNAM** — `/NOW/SAMP_USER_PROG_BCKJOB_RUN`

3.  Create a satellite system role.

    1.  Navigate to transaction code **PFCG**.

    2.  On the Role Maintenance page, enter a role name in the **Role** field.

        For example, `Z_SNOW_CLT`.

    3.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the role and save.

    4.  Add authorization object `S_RFC` and fill in the following values for the fields.

4.  Assign the central system role to the `S_SERVICENOW` user in the central system, and the satellite system role to the same user in each satellite system.

    |Authorization object|Description|
