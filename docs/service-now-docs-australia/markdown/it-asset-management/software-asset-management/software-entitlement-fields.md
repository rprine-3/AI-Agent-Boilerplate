# Software entitlement fields

Software Entitlement form and related list field descriptions.

## Software Entitlement form

**Note:** From the Australia release, the Database option column no longer exists in the Software Entitlement \[alm\_license\] and the Override License Cost \[samp\_override\_license\_cost\] tables. If you customized your form view prior to the Australia release to include the database option column, then you get to see the Database option in the software entitlement form.

The list view for software entitlements shows the total number of software entitlement records for your organization based on the value specified in the **SAM Workspace License operations list count limit** system property \(**sn\_sam\_workspace.sam\_license\_operations\_list\_count**\). The default value for the record count is set to **5000000**. However, the SAM administrator can set the value for the count in the system property as required. If there are less than five million records, then the exact count is shown. If there are more than five million records, then the count is shown as 5000000+. For more information on this system property, see [Software Asset Management properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-properties.md).

<table id="table_zql_nkm_11b"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="row_fzb_lss_mfb"><td>

Display name

</td><td>

Automatically generated name based on the software model display name.

</td></tr><tr id="row_h4t_kss_mfb"><td>

Asset tag

</td><td>

Serial number and the bar code used for tracking the asset.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Publisher part number

</td><td>

Publisher part number \(PPN\) from the Software Product Definitions lookup list of predefined software that may have already been purchased.

 You can edit this field in existing entitlements.

 When you select a publisher part number, you may encounter a message: `Many underlying software models are being created. These might be part of suite components, downgrade rights or next version. Please validate on completion`. The message appears only if there are greater than or equal to 50 suite components for the software model and if any of the following conditions are met:

-   A software model doesn’t exist for any suite component
-   A software model doesn’t exist for any downgrade right
-   A software model doesn’t exist for the next version

 **Note:** If a software model exists for the publisher part number, the **Software model** field is automatically populated. Otherwise, the software model is automatically created for you directly from this form. If there are multiple software models created with the same discovery map conditions, the software model must be selected manually.

</td></tr><tr id="row_p5g_kss_mfb"><td>

Software model

</td><td>

The software model to match the entitlement.

 **Note:** A warning message is shown if the publisher part number isn’t associated with the publisher and product for the software model. You can either change the software model, or save the entitlement as is.

 You can edit this field in existing entitlements.

</td></tr><tr id="row_af1_3ss_mfb"><td>

Agreement type

</td><td>

Based on the agreement type that you select, downgrade rights are automatically generated.

**Note:** If you select any of the following agreement types, the status of the entitlement is Compliant even if you have unlicensed installations:

-   **Enterprise Agreement**
-   **Enterprise Enrollment**
-   **Enterprise Subscription Agreement**
-   **Enterprise Subscription Enrollment**
-   **Enterprise License Agreement \(ELA\)**
-   **Enterprise Term License Agreement \(ETLA\)**
-   **Server and Cloud Enrollment \(SCE\)**
-   **Unlimited License Agreement \(ULA\)**

</td></tr><tr id="row_cdm_jss_mfb"><td>

License type

</td><td>

The type determines whether the rights grant full access to the software or if they’re being upgraded from a previous version of the software.

 The following are the various license types:

-   Perpetual
-   Perpetual + Software Assurance
-   Software Assurance
-   Subscription
-   Step-up
-   Subscription Step-up
-   Add-on
-   From SA

**Note:** After you upgrade to the Australia release and a content update is performed, if the content update changes the license type of a specific PPN from Step-up to Subscription Step-up, all entitlements associated with that PPN will be updated to Subscription Step-up entitlements.

 The default value for SaaS entitlements is **Subscription**.

 For more information about the license types and their impact on software reconciliation, see [Impact of different license types on software reconciliation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/license-types-impact-reconciliation.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Metric group

</td><td>

This field is automatically populated based on the **Software Model** field. Each metric group has a set of license metrics that are specific to the software publisher.**Note:** If this field is set to **Consumption** or **Subscription**, the **License type** field is automatically set to **Subscription**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

License metric

</td><td>

License metric for the license group that the software license is counted against when reconciliation is run. The options for license metric change based on the **Metric group** field.For more information, see [Software license metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/c_SAMLicenseMetrics.md).

 **Note:**

-   The default value for SaaS entitlements is **User Subscription**.
-   For SaaS Consumption, the spend in the License Metric Results \(samp\_license\_metric\_result\) gets calculated for the current subscription period only, which isn't the total cost of the entitlement. For example, if the Purchased rights are 100, the Unit cost is $1, the License type is Subscription, the Subscription period is Monthly, and the Start date and End date are set to a period of 2 months, then the Total cost would be $200. But since the consumption is reconciled for the current subscription period, the spend in the License Metric Results shows as $100.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Unlimited license

</td><td>

Indicates that the entitlement being created is an unlimited license.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Subscription period

</td><td>

Billing frequency for your software subscription. The options are **Monthly**, **Quarterly**, **Annually**, and **Entire Subscription Period**. The **Entire Subscription period** option indicates that you’re required to pay only after throughout the entire duration of your subscription.If you select **Monthly**, **Quarterly**, or **Annually**, you must specify the time period during which the subscription is valid in the **Start date** and **End date** fields. If you select **Entire Subscription Period**, only the **Start date** field is required.

 This field appears only if you select **Subscription**, **Subscription Step-up**, **Add-on**, or **From SA** from the License type list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Start date

</td><td>

Start date of your subscription, maintenance entitlement, SA service, add-on capability, or From SA service.This field appears only if you select **Subscription**, **Perpetual + Maintenance**, **Maintenance**, **Perpetual + Software Assurance**,**Software Assurance**, **Step-up**, **Subscription Step-up**, **Add-on**, or **From SA** from the License type list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

End date

</td><td>

End date of your subscription, maintenance entitlement, SA service, add-on capability, or From SA service.After the end date is reached, the maintenance flag is cleared and the state is retired if **Software Assurance** was specified as the **License type**.

 This field appears only if you select **Subscription**, **Perpetual + Maintenance**, **Maintenance**, **Perpetual + Software Assurance**,**Software Assurance**, **Step-up**, **Subscription Step-up**, **Add-on**, or **From SA** from the License type list.

</table>## Contracts tab

When [importing software entitlements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/view-entitlement-import-errors.md), use the **Contract number** column on the downloadable template to link the contracts to the entitlements. Since the **Contract number** is a reference field, the system first searches for matches to existing contracts, so enter existing contract numbers. If no matching contract number is found, entitlement import errors are generated.

You should be able to create the contract from the error, enabling for the creation of the entitlement and the appearance of the contract on the entitlement form in the Contracts related list. You can also skip the contract creation process and still create the entitlement, but without a contract.
