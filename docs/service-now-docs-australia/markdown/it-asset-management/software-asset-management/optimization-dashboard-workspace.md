# Optimization and savings dashboard in workspace

Use the Optimization and savings dashboard to view actual and potential cost savings for your software assets. In addition, view the recommended licensing optimizations for third-party software publishers, including Microsoft, Red Hat, Adobe, and SAP. Use this information to downgrade or reclaim licenses so that you can optimize your licensing costs.

**Note:** You can use the Domain filter to narrow your results based on the domain that you select. The default value for the Domain filter is **global**. You can select a domain at any given time for widgets to reflect the selected domain. If you clear the selected domain, it defaults back to **global**.

The Domain filter appears on the screen only if the following plugins are installed:

-   Domain Support - Domain Extensions Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\)
-   Performance Analytics - Domain Support \(com.snc.pa.domain\_support\)

You can access the Optimization and savings dashboard by navigating to **Software asset** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Software asset analytics** &gt; **Optimization and savings**.

View the licensing optimizations for a publisher by selecting the publisher from the **Publisher** drop-down list.
