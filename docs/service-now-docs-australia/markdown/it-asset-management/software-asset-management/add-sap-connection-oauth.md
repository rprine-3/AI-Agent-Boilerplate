# Establish an SAP connection using OAuth 2.0

Create a connection profile to establish a connection between your SAP system and your ServiceNow instance using OAuth 2.0 authentication.

## Before you begin

Before establishing a connection between SAP and your ServiceNow instance, make sure that the following conditions are met:

-   Verify if your SAP system network is accessible to external applications like ServiceNow.
-   If external connections are blocked, install a MID Server. A MID Server enables communication and data movement between a ServiceNow instance and external applications or data sources. For instructions, see [Installing the MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server-installation.md).

If you already have a MID Server installed in the network and connected to your ServiceNow instance, this SAP connection automatically uses it.
