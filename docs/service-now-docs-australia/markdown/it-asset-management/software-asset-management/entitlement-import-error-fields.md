-   A software model does not exist for any downgrade right
-   A software model does not exist for the next version

 **Note:** If a software model exists for the publisher part number, the **Software model** field is automatically populated. Otherwise, the software model is automatically created for you directly from this form. If there are multiple software models created with the same discovery map conditions, the software model must be selected manually.
