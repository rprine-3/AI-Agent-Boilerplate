# Discovered inventory dashboard

View your licensable discovered software and devices on the Discovered inventory dashboard in the Software asset analytics view of Software Asset Workspace.

Discovered inventory dashboard enables you to view all your licensable discovered software and devices. This dashboard also provides an insight into software products with multiple and potentially older versions that can result in security and compliance risk.

You can filter the count of installations based on a publisher or product. Select any report to see more information on software installations.

You can access the Discovered inventory dashboard by navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Software asset analytics** &gt; **Discovered inventory**.
