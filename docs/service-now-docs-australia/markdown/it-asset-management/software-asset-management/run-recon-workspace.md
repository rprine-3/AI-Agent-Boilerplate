# Run software reconciliation in the workspace

Reconciliation is run as a scheduled job \(default is weekly\), but you can also run reconciliation manually to reconcile software products in the Software Asset Workspace environment on-demand.

## Before you begin

Reconciliation is run for products that have software entitlements or software installs. Grouping and subgrouping are supported so you can narrow the compliance results.

When running reconciliation manually, allow enough time for the process to complete. For faster results, narrow the scope by selecting specific publishers.

Role required: sam\_user or sam\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Run Reconciliation dialog box from either of the two ways:

    -   **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Software asset overview** &gt; **Run Reconciliation**
    -   **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **License usage** &gt; **Run Reconciliation**
    \[Omitted image "run-recon-workspace.png"\] Alt text: Run reconciliation process \[Omitted image ""\] Alt text:

    **Note:** If domain separation is enabled on your instance, then the Domain filter drop-down appears in the Run Reconciliation dialog box.

2.  Select a particular publisher for which compliance should be calculated.

    You can also select all publishers.

3.  To narrow results further, select a group or subgroup.

    Available group and subgroup values include None, Country, Department, Company, Region, and Cost Center.

4.  Select **Run Reconciliation**.

    The reconciliation process may take some amount of time to complete. Once reconciliation is complete, the reconciliation results are shown in the **Reconciliation** tab.
