# Software model fields

Software Model form and related list field descriptions.

After you fill a software entitlement with the correct PPN, a software model is automatically created. The tabs on the Software Model form, such as Suite Components, Suite Parents, Software Product Lifecycles, Metric Attributes, Downgrade Rights, Product Lifecycles for all Versions, and so on, are populated automatically. However, you can manually add or update the software model details based on your requirements.

## Details tab

This list shows the details of a software model such as the status of the model, product details, licensing, conditions, and product catalog information.

<table id="table_isl_g4z_4hb"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Display name

</td><td>

Name of the model. The system property **glide.cmdb\_model.display\_name.shorten** controls how software model display names are generated. Users with the admin role can configure this property. The default format is publisher + product + version + edition + platform + language.

 If the **Platform** or **Language** fields aren't set to **Anything**, the values are appended.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

Status of the model. The options are **In Production**, **Retired**, and **Sold**.

</td></tr><tr class="sub-head"><td colspan="2">

Product Details section

</td></tr><tr><td>

Publisher

</td><td>

Publisher of the software. You can use the lookup list provided.**Note:** Publisher is a reference to the company \[core\_company\] table. Only companies that you’re using internally are shown.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Product

</td><td>

Software product name. The same lookup list provided on the Software Discovery Models form. You can create a custom product from the lookup list, if desired.**Note:** If the relationship between the software publisher \[samp\_sw\_publisher\] and company \[core\_company\] tables isn’t correct, products for that publisher may not be shown.

 If the publisher and product don’t exist, you can [Add a custom software product in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_AddACustomProduct.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Version condition

-   **is anything**

This field is automatically set to **is anything**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Version

</td><td>

Version of the software product.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Edition condition

</td><td>

Condition qualifiers for the **Edition** field.-   **starts with**
-   **is**
-   **is anything**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Edition

</td><td>

Edition of the software product to use when searching for the normalized discovery model.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Discovery map

</td><td>

A set of conditions that determine which software discovery models get mapped to the software models. Purchased rights are only applied to software discovery models that meet the condition. This matching is important for reconciliation. Discovery models with predefined suites are indicated in the **Suite defined** field. A value of **Yes** indicates that the discovery model is a suite parent.

You can use the discovery maps provided, or you can choose to specify the condition information directly instead. A user with the sam\_admin role can choose to create a custom discovery map.

When you select a discovery map, you may encounter a message: `Many underlying software models will be created. These might be part of suite components, downgrade rights or next version. Please validate on completion`. The message appears only if there are greater than or equal to 50 suite components for the software model and if any of the following conditions are met:

-   A software model doesn’t exist for any suite component
-   A software model doesn’t exist for any downgrade rights
-   A software model doesn’t exist for the next version

 **Note:** If you change the discovery map in an existing software model, a warning message appears. The warning message informs you that the downgrade rights on the software model and on the related entitlements also change. For example, if you change the discovery map on a software model from DMAP1 to DMAP2, and save the software model, then all the downgrade rights associated with DMAP1 are removed from the software model and the downgrade rights associated with DMAP2 are populated. However, if the value in the **Agreement type** field in the Software Entitlement form layout is **Generic**, the downgrade rights for that entitlement don't change.

 You can verify which discovery models get mapped to the software model by selecting the **Show Matching Discovery Models** related link in Software Asset Management classic. View the same results in the Software Asset Workspace, by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **Licensing** &gt; **Software models**. Select a software model and then select the **Matching Discovery Models** related list.

If the **Publisher** and **Product** fields are empty, the values are automatically populated according to the discovery map.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Next version

</td><td>

Reference to another software model of the same manufacturer, which represents the next version of the product. The next version is defined on the discovery map and is part of the content service. The next version is populated on the software model in either of the two ways:

-   When you create a software model or update the discovery map on a software model, a business rule is triggered when you select **Save**. The next version is populated if the discovery map has a next version defined for it.
-   If the content service has the next version specified for the associated discovery map on an existing software model, the next version is populated when the schedule job **SAM- Create downgrades/upgrades for a software entitlement** runs.

**Note:** The next version is populated only after the **SAM- Create downgrades/upgrades for a software entitlement** scheduled job runs weekly.


 However, if you entered a value in the **Next version** field, that value isn’t overridden.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Product classification

</td><td>

The official United Nations Standard Products and Services Code \(UNSPSC\) classification.From this release, product classifications have been enhanced with a comprehensive set of UNSPSC codes available via the Content Service library. Updates to the UNSPSC codes will also be available via the bi-weekly Content Service library update.

Conditions section

</td></tr><tr><td>

Condition name

</td><td>

Name of the condition that you want to define for the software model.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Software install condition

</td><td>

Condition to account for only specific software installations during reconciliation. Installs that do not meet the required software install conditions will be included in the reconciliation process. However, these installs are likely to be flagged as unlicensed unless there is another software model that meets the required software install conditions. For example, if you have purchased Microsoft Visual Studio and set up software installation conditions for using Visual Studio only to consume licenses in your non-production environment. You need to create separate software install conditions for each component model under Visual Studio.**Note:** If you clear the **License under management** option, the software installations that meet the specified software install conditions are excluded from reconciliation instead.

 In the Software Asset Management classic application, you can add multiple software install conditions to a single software model using the following options:

-   **Add Filter Condition**: Enables you to specify all the conditions that a software installation must meet to be included in reconciliation.
-   **Add "OR" Clause**: Enables you to specify any of the conditions that a software installation can meet to be included in reconciliation.

 In the Software Asset Workspace, you can add multiple software install conditions to a single software model using the following options:

-   **or**: Enables you to specify any of the conditions that a software installation can meet to be included in reconciliation.
-   **and**: Enables you to specify all the conditions that a software installation must meet to be included in reconciliation.
-   **+ New condition set**: Enables you to specify additional sets of conditions that a software installation can meet to be included in reconciliation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Subscription condition**Note:** This field appears only on subscription-based software models, including hybrid software models that contain both software subscriptions and on-premise software installations.

</td><td>

Condition to account for only groups of subscriptions during reconciliation. Only the subscriptions that meet the specified subscription conditions are included in reconciliation. For example, you can set a subscription condition to reconcile subscriptions from only a specific geographic location or business department. **Note:** If you clear the **License under management** option, the subscriptions that meet the specified software conditions are excluded from reconciliation instead.

In the Software Asset Management classic application, you can add multiple subscription conditions to a single software model using the following options:

-   **Add Filter Condition**: Enables you to specify all the conditions that a subscription must meet to be included in reconciliation.
-   **Add "OR" Clause**: Enables you to specify any of the conditions that a subscription can meet to be included in reconciliation.

In the Software Asset Workspace, you can add multiple subscription conditions to a single software model using the following options:

Certified

</td><td>

Option to indicate if the product associated to this software model is approved or unapproved by TRM.

 When a enterprise architect adds a product to the TRM library, the product is flagged as either approved or unapproved. When a software model is created for an approved product, this check box is automatically selected.

 If you create a software model for an unapproved product, the software model is designated as restricted. During the reconciliation process, any software installations associated with unapproved products are identified as removal candidates.

 If you activate the Application Portfolio Management - TRM \(com.snc.apm\_trm\) plugin for software models that exist, this check box may or may not be selected depending on whether the product is approved.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Restricted software

</td><td>

Option for restricting software.Restricted software identifies software that you shouldn’t install in your environment \(inappropriate software, or software with vulnerabilities, for example\).

If the removal candidates don't exist, a scheduled job runs nightly that creates removal candidates for restricted software.

</td><td>

Option to license the configuration items \(CIs\) that the software is installed on, based on conditions that you specify on the software model, such as software install conditions. If any of the associated client access records are unlicensed due to insufficient rights, all CIs remain unlicensed.If you disable this option, only the CIs that have been added to your client access records are licensed. See [Add a software client access record in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_AddAClientAccessRec.md) for detailed instructions on how to add CIs to your client access records.

If you enable this option after you have already added CIs to your client access records, those CIs are deleted from your records and then subsequently licensed based on the conditions that you specify on the software model.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Database option**Note:** This field appears only on Oracle Database software models.

</td><td>

Oracle database option or management pack. Each option or pack requires a separate software model. The database option is an identifier for software models.

 This field is shown when creating software models that meet the following conditions:

-   The **Publisher** is **Oracle**.
-   The **Product** is **DB Server**.

Apply to subscriptions

</td><td>

Option to apply this software model to only subscription-based software suites. If you don’t enable this option, you can apply this software model to only software suites with installed software.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Auto-generate client access for allocations. **Note:** This field appears only on Oracle Database Server software models.

 **Important:** To use this option, you must request the Data Collection for Oracle Global Licensing and Advisory Services \(GLAS\) application from the ServiceNow Store. For details, see [Request Data Collection for Oracle Global Licensing and Advisory Services \(GLAS\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/request-data-collection-oracle-glas-app.md).

</td><td>

Option to automatically generate and manage client access records for Oracle Database Server. If you enable this option, the Software Asset Management application generates and manages client access records based on your latest Oracle Database Server Named User Plus entitlements, the users, and devices that the associated rights are allocated to, and the Oracle database instances that are supported by these users and devices. The Software Asset Management application generates a separate client access record for each supported database instance. If you disable this option after the Software Asset Management application has automatically generated client access records for Oracle Database Server, those client access records are no longer managed and updated automatically. You must manage and update those client access records manually to keep them accurate and upto date.

 If you enable this option and already have existing client access records for Oracle Database Server, all automatically generated client access records are managed and updated automatically again. However, you must continue to manage and update all manually generated client access records.
