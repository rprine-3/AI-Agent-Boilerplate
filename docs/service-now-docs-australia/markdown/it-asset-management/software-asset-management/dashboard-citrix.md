# Software Publisher Analytics dashboard for Citrix in Software Asset Management classic

View compliance analysis results for Citrix on the Software Publisher Analytics dashboard in the Software Asset Management classic application.

Access the Software Publisher Analytics dashboard by navigating to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Publisher Overview**.

**Note:** The add-on Citrix publisher pack \(com.sn\_samp\_citrix\) [plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmt.md) must be installed to view the Citrix dashboard tab.

A discovery process is required for Citrix data to be collected. For ServiceNow Discovery, a user with the admin role must create a [Discovery schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/t_CreateADiscoverySchedule.md) to run on the Citrix Delivery Controller for communication with the Citrix License Server.

The dashboard is updated whenever a new reconciliation result is available. You can save charts in PNG or JPG format.
