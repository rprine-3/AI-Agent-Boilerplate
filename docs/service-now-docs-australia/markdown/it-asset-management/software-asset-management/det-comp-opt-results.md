# Evaluate Microsoft 365 compliance and optimization results

Evaluate Microsoft 365 compliance and optimization results to find actual and potential cost savings and recommended licensing optimizations.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin or sam\_user

The discovery of Microsoft 365 must be complete to evaluate the software compliance. For more information about using Discovery and Microsoft SCCM together, see [Discovery and SCCM together](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/c_DiscoveryAndSCCMTogether.md).

The usage of Microsoft 365 plans must be available from both Microsoft certified APIs and Microsoft SCCM to evaluate the software optimization.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **License operations**.

2.  In the left pane, select **Licensing** &gt; **Software entitlements**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  Create entitlements for Microsoft 365 by selecting the correct Publisher Part Number \(PPN\) to verify compliance.

    For more information about creating entitlements, see [Create entitlements in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
