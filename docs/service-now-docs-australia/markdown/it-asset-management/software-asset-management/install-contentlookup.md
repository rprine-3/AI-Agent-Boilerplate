# Install Content library portal for Software Asset Management

Install the Content library portal store application to view the data stored in the Software Asset Management Content Service.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   The Content library portal application requires the following plugins. Ensure that these plugins are activated before you install the Content library portal application.
    -   **Required ServiceNow plugins**
        -   **Activate Software Asset Management Professional Master Workspace \(com.sn\_samp\_master\_ws\) plugin**

            This plugin will internally activate the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.sn\_samp\_master\) plugin and Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application.

            -   The Software Asset Management Professional \(com.sn\_samp\_master\) plugin loads the following Software Asset Management Professional plugins in one step:

                -   Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin
                -   All publisher pack add-on plugins
                -   Software Asset Management UI Components \(com.sn\_samp\_workbench\)
                To enable SaaS License Management, you must request the Software Asset Management — SaaS License Management Integrations \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) plugin separately from the ServiceNow Store.

            -   The Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application is required to use the Software Asset Workspace, the new user interface of the Software Asset Management application.
        -   **AI Search plugin \(com.glide.ais\)**

            Activates AI search functionality.


**Note:** If you have installed Software Asset Management Professional \(com.sn\_samp\_master\) plugin, you can view data stored in the Software Asset Management Content service. If you have installed both Software Asset Management Professional \(com.sn\_samp\_master\) and Hardware Asset Management Professional \(com.sn\_hamp\) plugins, you can view both Software Asset Management and Hardware Asset Management data stored in the Content service. For more information about installing Content lookup portal for Hardware Asset Management, see [Install Content lookup to view Hardware Asset Management data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/content-lookup-ham.md).
