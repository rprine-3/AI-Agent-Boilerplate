# Configure an OAuth client in SAP

Register and configure an OAuth 2.0 client in SAP using the system user created for OAuth authentication, to enable secure data exchange with your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

A system user for OAuth authentication must exist in SAP before configuring the OAuth client. For details, see [Create a system user for OAuth authentication in SAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-system-user-oauth-sap.md).

SAP Role required: SAP Basis administrator

## About this task

Use transaction code **SOAUTH2** to register the OAuth client and define the grant types, redirect URI, and scopes required for the integration.

## Procedure

1.  Open transaction code **SOAUTH2** in your SAP system and select **Create**.

2.  In the **Client ID** field, select the system user created for OAuth authentication.

    For example, `OAUTH_USER`. For information on creating a system user, see [Create a system user for OAuth authentication in SAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-system-user-oauth-sap.md).

3.  Enter a description for the OAuth client, then select **Next**.
