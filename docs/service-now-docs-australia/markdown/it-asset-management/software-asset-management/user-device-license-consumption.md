# User device license consumption fields

SAM managers can view the client access license \(CAL\) usage details for Microsoft Windows Server in the User Device License Consumption table and create CAL records.

The User Device License Consumption \[samp\_user\_device\_license\_consumption\] table is populated with the CAL usage logging data for the Windows Server. The data is accessed from ServiceNow Discovery.

To learn more about Microsoft usage access logging for CAL, see [Microsoft User Access Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/user-access-logging/manage-user-access-logging).

For more information on Microsoft specific license metrics, see [Supported Microsoft 365 license types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/supported-microsoft-365-license-types.md).
