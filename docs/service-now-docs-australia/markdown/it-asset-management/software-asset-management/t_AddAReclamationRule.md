# Add a software reclamation rule

Add a reclamation rule to aggregate usage records and to identify unused software.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin

## About this task

If you select the **Notify user** option in the reclamation rule, then the user has a chance to respond with approval during the process of reclamation. If no response is received during a specified period, the software rights are automatically reclaimed. If the user still wants to keep the software installation, it becomes the responsibility of the manager to approve or decline the removal.

For information on creating a reclamation rule for SCCM products, see [Create a reclamation rule to import Microsoft SCCM usage data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-reclamation-rule-sccm.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Reclamation Rules**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:** You can edit the software members of the Software Products list after the reclamation rule is created.

</td><td>

When selected, software products that have installations on devices but don’t have usage records in the usage table are also reclaimed based on the following rules:

-   Usage is available for the selected product \(at least one usage record\) within the time period of the reclamation rule.
-   For the **Last Used Date** reclamation type, the install must be created greater than the **Last used before** value.
-   For the **Total Usage Time** reclamation type, the install date must be greater than the **Aggregate usage by** value.

</table>4.  Select **Submit**.

    After the reclamation rule is created, add software products to the reclamation rule. You can also add a custom software product.

    Additionally, you can specify filter conditions on software products that are suite parents. For details on adding a custom software product, see [Add a custom software product in Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_AddACustomProduct.md). For details on filter conditions, refer to [Software reclamation rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sw-reclamation-rules.md).

5.  Select **Edit** in the Software Products related list to add software products.

    When you add a product that is also a suite parent, all the suite components automatically get added and appear in the Software Product related list. The **Parent** field is automatically populated for all the suite components but it's empty for the suite parent.

    Additionally, when a product is added to the related list, the product process related list appears as well as any product processes \(if already present in the system\) for the parent and suite products.

6.  If a product process doesn’t exist for the software product, you can add a custom product process.

    1.  Select **New** in the Product Process related list.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        **Note:** The Product Process related list appears only when you select a software product with a product process.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Product|Software product.|
        |File name|File name of the software product. The file name is required for the SCCM Usage to pull data.|
        |Platform|Platform of the software product.|

    3.  Select **Save**.

    **Note:** The Product Process related list is displayed only when a software product with a product process is selected.

7.  If you selected **SAP Named User** from the Applies to list, specify the SAP transaction codes that must be active to help prevent reclamation.

    **Note:** This step is applicable to only the SAP publisher.

    Not all specified transaction codes must be active to help prevent reclamation. The minimum number of transaction codes that must be active is based on the value of the **Minimum transaction codes required** field.

    1.  From the SAP Transaction Codes related list, select **Edit...**.

    2.  On the Edit Members form, select a transaction code from the Collection list or from the SAP Transaction Codes List.

        The Collection list displays all available transaction codes. The SAP Transaction Codes List displays only the transaction codes that must be active to help prevent reclamation.

    3.  Select the right and left arrow icons to move the transaction code between the lists.

    4.  Select **Save**.
