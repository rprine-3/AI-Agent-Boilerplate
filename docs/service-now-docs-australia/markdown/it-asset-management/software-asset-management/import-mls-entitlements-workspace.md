# Import Microsoft entitlements from a Microsoft License Statement \(MLS\) in the Software Asset Workspace

Import entitlements from an MLS using the Software Asset Workspace.

Role required: sam\_user or sam\_admin

## Procedure

1.  From your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **Software asset** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace**.

    The Software Asset Workspace launches in a new tab, displaying the Software asset overview.

2.  On the Software asset overview, select **Create entitlement**.

    The Create new entitlement dialog box opens.

3.  In the dialog box, select **Import multiple entitlements from an Excel file** and then select **Next**.

    The dialog box closes and then the Create New Entitlement Import form opens in a new tab.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
