# Unlimited software licenses

Unlimited software licenses help you to create entitlements with unlimited allocations and unlimited rights, allowing you to license any number of software installations with no true-up cost.

A sam\_admin or sam\_user role can specify an entitlement as an unlimited license which allows for unlimited allocations \(user or device allocations\) and does not classify the license metric results as non-compliant.

While creating or importing an entitlement, you can select the **Unlimited license** check box on the Software Entitlement page or on the Import Entitlement page.

## Considerations for unlimited licenses

-   Reconciliation process takes unlimited licenses into account where the software installations match and are licensed. Unlimited license is given priority over fixed amount license​
-   License metric results are generated separately for unlimited licenses.
-   An unlimited license perpetual entitlement can be associated to only one unlimited license maintenance entitlement.
-   Unit cost is equal to the total cost.
-   Downgrade rights are supported for unlimited licenses.
-   **Purchased rights**, **Active rights**, and **Allocations available** fields are not displayed for an unlimited license on the Software Entitlement page.

## Supported license metrics and license types

The following license metrics are supported across all metric groups for unlimited licenses:

-   Per User
