# Software Asset Management Content Service

Opt in to the Software Asset Management Content Service to share unnormalized software installation data from your organization with ServiceNow® to improve the normalization process.

The Software Asset Management Content Service is an IT Asset Management \(ITAM\) shared service that provides users with continual software recognition improvements. By sharing unnormalized software installation data with ServiceNow, you receive automatic content updates based on your unique software installation footprint. For more information on content updates, see [Content updates for Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-content-updates.md).

The Software Asset Management Content Service transfers data between your organization and ServiceNow through a Content Data Service \(CDS\) instance. In commercial deployments, data is transferred through a CDS instance that is deployed in a commercial data center. In National Security Cloud \(NSC\) Department of Defense \(DOD\) Impact Level 5 \(IL5\) deployments, data is transferred through a CDS instance that is deployed in an NSC DOD IL5 data center.

**Note:** Data for your NSC DOD IL5 deployments can be transferred only from ServiceNow to your organization. It cannot be transferred from your organization to ServiceNow. Since you cannot share any unnormalized software installation data with ServiceNow, you must manually create a software content request for any software product that you want to add to the Software Asset Management Content Library. After the software product is added to the Content Library, the Software Asset Management application can begin normalizing the corresponding software installations that are discovered in your NSC DOD IL5 deployments. See [Create IT Asset Management content request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/asset-management/create-itam-content-request.md) for instructions on how to create a software content request.

No personally identifiable information is shared with ServiceNow. However, please note the exception for custom software products, as described in the Software Asset Management Content Service asset data types table below.

Data that is shared using the Software Asset Management Content Service remains secure and is properly disposed of after review, following the same ServiceNow privacy policies, procedures, tools, and techniques that are used to secure ServiceNow instances. The selection of data types that are shared with ServiceNow is configurable by your organization. In addition, data is never packaged and shipped to other ServiceNow customers.

This new content improves your normalization hit ratios, which enable you to manage your software assets better. By default, you aren’t opted in to the Content Service. For information on how to opt-in, see [Enable sharing information with Software Asset Management content service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_EnableSAMContentService.md).

If you want to exclude any software discovery models, custom software products, or custom publisher part numbers from being shared with ServiceNow, select the **Exclude from content service** check box on the Software Discovery Model, Custom Software Product, or Custom Part Number form.

The normalization process acts only on active publishers, products, and rules. Obsolete rules aren’t used. You can deactivate any Normalization Library content version at any time.

Data sharing for Software Discovery Models, Software Model Lifecycles, Part Numbers and Discovery Maps, Processor Names, and Product License Exception Rules is automatically enabled after opting in. If you don't want to share a type of asset data, select the toggle button next to the type of data on the Content Service Setup page and then select **Save**.

Software Discovery Models

</td><td>

Model created to classify and reduce duplication of software installs when new installs are identified. Only Software Discovery Models with the following statuses are transferred:

-   Match not found
-   Publisher normalized
-   Partially normalized
-   Manually normalized
-   Normalized

**Note:** Only the Discovery models whose status is Normalized and Version is empty are transferred.


**Note:** To improve the accuracy of machine learning predictions, software discovery models normalized by machine learning are transferred.

</table>## Opting out

You can opt out at any time from the Content Service Setup page.

When you opt out, your company no longer contributes to the improvement of the normalization process. You still receive content updates, but the updates may be less applicable because they aren't informed by your company's unique software installation footprint that exists within your environment and CMDB.

Your company can rejoin the Software Asset Management Content Service at any time.

-   **[Content updates for Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-content-updates.md)**  
The Software Asset Management Content Service provides content updates to your instance twice every week that you can use to normalize your data.
