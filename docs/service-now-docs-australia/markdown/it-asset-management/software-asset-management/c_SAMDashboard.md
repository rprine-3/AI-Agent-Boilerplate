# Software Asset Management dashboard

View true-up costs, optimization results, and compliance trend charts on the Software Asset Management dashboard.

**Note:** The Software Asset Management dashboard is no longer available for new Australia users who have activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin or upgraded to Australia without activating the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia.

-   If you activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia but didn't activate the Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\), you have access to this dashboard.
-   If you activated the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application after upgrading to Zurich, you won’t be able to access this dashboard from the **Software Asset** navigation menu in your instance. You can however access this dashboard from the **Dashboards** navigation menu.

The Software Asset Management dashboard tab is accessed by navigating to **Software Asset** &gt; **Overview** and selecting **Software Asset Management** from the dashboard list. Select an element within a report to see more information, or add and move widgets as needed.

Results are updated daily, or whenever a new reconciliation result is available, and can be refreshed by selecting the **Refresh** icon for each result. You can also save charts in PNG or JPG formats.

The graphs show important statistics about the software being tracked. In the Overview and Optimization tabs, you can filter by publisher, product, department, and country to narrow the results.
