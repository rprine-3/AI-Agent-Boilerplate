# Oracle Infrastructure report

You can use the Oracle Infrastructure report to gain visibility into your Oracle infrastructure. This report includes information about the Oracle databases and WebLogic Server editions that you’re running and the configuration items that are supporting them.

**Note:** The Oracle infrastructure report is domain separated.

You can view the Oracle Infrastructure report in both the Software Asset Management classic application and the Software Asset Workspace.

To view this report in the Software Asset Management classic application, navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **View/Run** on your ServiceNow instance. At the top of the Reports page, select **All**. From the list of all available reports, locate and select **Oracle infrastructure report**.

To view this report in the Software Asset Workspace, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** on your ServiceNow instance. After the Software Asset Workspace launches, navigate to **License usage** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **Oracle infrastructure report**.
