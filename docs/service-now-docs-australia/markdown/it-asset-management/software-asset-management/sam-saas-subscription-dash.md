# Office 365 &amp; Adobe Cloud dashboard in Software Asset Management classic

View compliance analysis results related to Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Cloud License Management in Software Asset Management classic.

**Note:** The Office 365 &amp; Adobe Cloud dashboard is no longer available for new Australia users who have activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin or upgraded to Australia without activating the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia.

-   If you activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia but didn't activate the Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\), you have access to this dashboard.
-   If you activated the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application after upgrading to Australia, you won’t be able to access this dashboard from the **Software Asset** navigation menu in your instance. You can however access this dashboard from the **Dashboards** navigation menu.

Access the dashboard by navigating to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Office 365 &amp; Adobe Cloud**.

You can filter by **Subscription Software Models** or **Subscription Publisher** using filter lists.

**Note:** The Subscription Publisher filter list always includes Microsoft and Adobe even when only one subscription publisher pack is active.

The dashboard is updated whenever a new reconciliation result is available. You can save charts in PNG or JPG format.

## Adobe

You can manage Adobe subscription information with Adobe I/O authentication integration.

**Note:** The add-on Adobe publisher pack \(com.sn\_samp\_adobe\) [plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmt.md) must be installed to view Adobe subscription reporting.

Only Adobe software products that are recognized as subscription software are shown. [Adobe integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/adobe-cloud-integration.md) must be set up to view compliance information.
