# Software model results license metric results fields

Software model results License Metric Results form and related list field descriptions. You can access this form through the License Metric Results related list in your software model results.

## License Metric Results form

Two license metric results are generated if a software model has two entitlements, one with a perpetual SA license type and the other with a subscription license type. One license metric result where active maintenance is true and the other where the active maintenance is false. In such a scenario, two license position reports are generated, one with active maintenance true and the other one with active maintenance false.

 **Note:** **Allocated not in use** reflects rights that are wasted because the user or device for which these rights have been allocated do not have the software installed.
