# Use Software Asset Management with Contract Management Pro

Leverage advanced contract life cycle capabilities after a contract has been signed using the Obligation Management \(sn\_cm\_obligation\) and the ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro in Contract Management Pro \(sn\_cm\_gen\_ai\) plugin.

\[Omitted video\] Description: This video describes seamless integration between Contract Management Professional \(CM Pro\) and Software Asset Management Enterprise, enabling advanced contract lifecycle capabilities after a contract has been signed.

Integrating the Software Asset Management and Contract Management Pro applications provides access to the following post-signature contract data and workflows within the Software Asset Workspace:

-   **Obligation Management:** Use the Contract Management Pro application's Obligation Management feature within the Software Asset Workspace. If you have the required roles assigned, you can create an obligation record. This record defines specific instructions and obligation tasks required to fulfill the contract obligation. For more information about the Contract Management Pro application's Obligation Management feature, see [Obligation Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/cncore-obligation-management.md). For more information about creating and managing obligation tasks in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Manage obligation tasks in the Software Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/manage-obligation-tasks-software-asset-workspace.md).
-   **Renewal Management:** Receive proactive notifications and actionable insights regarding upcoming contract renewals.
-   **Metadata and obligation extraction:** Streamline contract management by extracting the key contract metadata and obligations from an uploaded signed contract document using the manage contract repository agentic workflow. You must install the ServiceNow Otto for Contract Management Pro \(sn\_cm\_gen\_ai\) plugin. You must also activate the generative AI skills to use the manage contract repository agentic workflow. For more information about installing the plugin and enabling the skills, see [Configure the manage contract repository agentic workflow for Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/configure-manage-contract-repository-agentic-workflow.md). For more information about extracting the key contract metadata and obligations from assigned contract, see [Use manage contract repository agentic workflow in the Software Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/manage-contract-repository-workflow.md).
