# Software Asset Management for Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Use the Software Asset Management publisher pack for IBM to track and optimize licensing for your Red Hat Enterprise Linux \(RHEL\) products.

## Required plugins and applications for Red Hat Enterprise Linux

To manage licenses for your RHEL products, request and activate the Software Asset Management Professional for IBM plugin \(com.sn\_samp\_ibm\) from the Now Support service portal. See [Request Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmt.md) for more information on how to request and activate this plugin.

You must also request and install the CMDB CI Class Models application from the ServiceNow Store. This application contains the tables that store RHEL data on your ServiceNow instance and is required for RHEL reconciliation.

The ServiceNow® Discovery application uses the Red Hat Virtualization \(RHV\) discovery pattern to locate RHV components. To enable the discovery of these resources, you must install the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.
