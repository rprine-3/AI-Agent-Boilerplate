# Content lookup portal for Software Asset Management

The Content lookup portal gives you visibility into the data stored in the Content Library as part of the IT Asset Management Content Service via an intuitive user interface.

The Content Library is a repository of software product names and all additional information such as software product lifecycle dates, discovery maps, and publisher part numbers \(PPNs\). This information is stored in different tables in the Content Library. For more details on the Content Service, see [Software Asset Management Content Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/c_SAMContentService.md).

The Content library portal application is available in the ServiceNow Store. After you install the application, verify that the AI Search \(com.glide.ais\) plugin is activated. For details on installing the Content library portal application, see [Install Content library portal for Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/install-contentlookup.md).

The Content lookup portal enables you to do the following:

-   Search for a speciﬁc software publisher, product, Discovery Map, life cycle, and PPN.
-   View the entire list of software publishers, products, lifecycles, PPNs, and Discovery Maps in the Content Service.
-   View additional details related to software products such as software version, and software product life cycles.
-   View the days remaining for the next content update.

Access the Content lookup portal by navigating to **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Content lookup**.

**Note:** After installing the Content library portal application, when you access Content lookup portal for the first time, the charts aren’t populated on the page due to the absence of historical data. To load the charts, execute the Historical Data Collection jobs. For details, see the [Historical Data Collection job](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2229665) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

On the Content lookup portal, you can view the information based on the applications that are installed.

-   If only the Software Asset Management Professional application is installed and you have the sam\_user role, you can view the following tabs showing the data stored in the Software Asset Management Content Service:
    -   Software Overview
    -   Software Publishers
    -   Software Products
    -   Software DMAPs
    -   Software Lifecycles
    -   Software PPNs
-   If both Software Asset Management Professional and Hardware Asset Management applications are installed and you have both sam\_user and asset roles, you can view both software and hardware content tabs. For more information about the Hardware Asset Management Content lookup portal, see the [Content lookup portal for Hardware Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/content-lookup-ham.md).

The Content lookup portal uses the AI search functionality and helps you to search for a specific software publisher, product, Discovery Maps, life cycles, and PPNs.

After you enter your search criteria in the search bar, the search results are listed with the most relevant matches at the top. Using the Filters section, you narrow down the result further.

Based on your search criteria, the information in the Content Service is pulled from multiple tables, such as:

-   Software Products \[samp\_sw\_product\]
-   Discovery Maps \[samp\_sw\_entitlement\_definition\]
-   Software Product Definitions \[samp\_sw\_product\_definition\]
-   Software Publishers \[samp\_sw\_publisher\]
-   Software Product Lifecycles \[sam\_sw\_product\_lifecycle\]

Select the search result that matches your criteria to display the details page along with the related lists. The details page opens in read-only mode. For example, if you select the Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Enterprise product result, the Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Enterprise page appears with the related lists such as software version, software life cycle data, and PPN.
