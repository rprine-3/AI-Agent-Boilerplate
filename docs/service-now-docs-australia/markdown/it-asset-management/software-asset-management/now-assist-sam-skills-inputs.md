# Skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for Software Asset Management \(SAM\)

Get a quick overview of the skill inputs and triggers for ServiceNow Otto for Software Asset Management \(SAM\). By configuring the inputs or triggers for a skill, you can determine how and when a skill is used.

Depending on the selected skill, you can configure the inputs or triggers. These settings determine how and when a skill is used. An input identifies the data that is used for a skill, such as the table and fields that are used to generate a publisher summary. A trigger initiates an action, such as when the system generates a publisher summary.

## Publisher compliance summarization skill

For the publisher compliance summarization skill, select the triggers that determine when a publisher compliance summary is generated. You can also select the properties that control how a publisher compliance summary is displayed. To display the publisher compliance summary, you need to select the **Display** toggle button on the Choose where to display page while configuring ServiceNow Otto for SAM. For details on the **Display** toggle button, see [Configuring ServiceNow Otto for Software Asset Management \(SAM\) skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/configure-now-assist-sam.md).

The following table lists the triggers that determine when a publisher compliance summary is generated and how a publisher compliance summary is displayed.

|Trigger|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|User triggered|Publisher compliance summary that is generated when the agent manually triggers the skill by selecting **Summarize** in the Publisher details page.|

The following table lists the inputs for the publisher compliance summarization skill.

|Input|Description|

|Software Lifecycle Report \[sam\_sw\_product\_lifecycle\_report\]|Product life-cycle details for all the software products that are installed in your environment.|
|Dashboards|Dashboards include Discovered inventory, Normalization and content, and Health check.|

The Publisher compliance summarization skill is available by default in the Australia release. No additional plugin or store app activation is required.

## Product compliance summarization skill

For the product compliance summarization skill, select the triggers that determine when a product compliance summary is generated. You can also select the properties that control how a product compliance summary is displayed. To display the product compliance summary, you need to select the **Display** toggle button on the Choose where to display page while configuring ServiceNow Otto for SAM. For details on the **Display** toggle button, see [Configuring ServiceNow Otto for Software Asset Management \(SAM\) skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/configure-now-assist-sam.md).

</table>## Error log summarization skill

The Error log summarization skill transforms raw and cluttered application logs into clean, structured error summaries through systematic analysis. The skill identifies error patterns and classifies failure types such as API, code, infrastructure, database, and configuration. It traces root causes through stack traces and extracts key technical details while filtering out irrelevant log information. This skill also processes complex log traces that contain multiple errors, timeouts, exceptions, and system failures. It provides concise, actionable error summaries that enable faster debugging and issue resolution. The skill handles various log formats and error patterns across different technology stacks, making it essential while dealing with production incidents.

The following table lists the trigger for the Error log summarization skill.

<table id="table_err_log_sum_trig"><thead><tr><th>

</table>## Error resolution recommendation skill

The Error resolution recommendation skill synthesizes the error summary that is produced by the Error log summarization skill with available knowledge resources to generate prioritized, step-by-step resolution guidance. The skill correlates identified errors with knowledge base articles, historical solutions, support cases, and web search results to recommend the most effective troubleshooting approach. The skill consolidates information from multiple sources, removes redundant steps, and sequences actions from quick fixes to comprehensive solutions based on failure type, system impact, and resolution probability.

</table>## Product match reviewer skill

The Product match reviewer skill is triggered after the Software normalization skill only when the Software normalization skill can’t find the correct product match. The Product match reviewer skill helps you confirm the correct product by analyzing search results and matching them to a predicted product name.

</table>## Spend transaction software classification skill

The Spend transaction software classification skill first identifies whether each imported spend transaction is a software purchase. If the transaction is classified as software, then the skill extracts the raw publisher and raw product details using the vendor name, transaction description, and GL account columns. Transactions that the skill classifies as non-software skip the extraction step for raw publisher and raw product and are not passed to the Spend transaction software normalization skill.

</table>## Spend transaction software normalization skill

The Spend transaction software normalization skill matches software spend transactions to existing publisher and product records to enable accurate spend reporting and license position tracking. The skill uses AI search to normalize the raw publisher and raw product derived by the Spend transaction software classification skill. When the skill finds a reliable match in existing publisher and product records, it populates the publisher and product fields on the spend transaction record. If no reliable match exists, the transaction remains unnormalized.

The following table lists the trigger for the Spend transaction software normalization skill.

|Trigger|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Auto-triggered|The skill normalizes the raw publisher and raw product after the Spend transaction software classification skill identifies a transaction as software.
