6.  In the skill guided setup, configure the use cases and other mappings for the Contract obligation extraction and Contract metadata extraction skills.

    For more information on configuring contract metadata extraction skill, see [Configuring contract metadata extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/cncore-conf-metadata-extraction.md).

    **Note:** For the Contract metadata extraction skill, complete the [creation of use case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/cmpro-na-usecase-me.md), [mapping use case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/cmpro-na-usecase-mappings-me.md), and [enable notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/cncore-config-notf-na-metadata.md) setup.

    For more information on configuring Contract obligation extraction skill, see [Configuring contract obligation extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/employee-service-management/cncore-conf-obligation-extraction.md).

    **Note:** On the use case mapping page, the **Contracts created from contract request** check box is visible only if the Contracts core \(sn\_cm\_core\) plugin is installed. If you have the Contracts core \(sn\_cm\_core\) plugin installed, it means you're already availing the contract pre-signature capabilities. You must clear the **Contracts created from contract request** check box.

    If the Contracts core \(sn\_cm\_core\) plugin is not installed, this check box will not be displayed.

7.  In the Define access page, select **Save and continue**.

8.  In the Review and activate page, select **Activate**.


## Result

When a software contract record is created, the **Initiate contract extraction** button is displayed on the contract form.
