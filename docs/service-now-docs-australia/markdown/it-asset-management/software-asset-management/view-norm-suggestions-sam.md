View normalization suggestion records that are created for discovery models. You can accept or reject these suggestions.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sam\_admin: accepts or rejects the normalization suggestions.
-   sam\_user: views normalization suggestions.

The records are contained in the Normalization Suggestions \[samp\_normalization\_suggestions\] table.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Discovery** &gt; **Normalization Suggestions** For details on the normalization suggestion fields, see [Normalization suggestions for discovery models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/normalization-suggestions.md).

    **Note:** Suggested field values that differ from actual field values are indicated by a blue dot.

2.  Select **Accept** to make the suggested changes to the discovery model, or click **Reject** to keep the existing settings.

    **Note:** Only the sam\_admin role can accept or reject the normalization suggestions. For more details on accepting or rejecting suggestions, see [Normalization suggestions for discovery models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/normalization-suggestions.md).
