# Reclamation rules for SaaS and SSO applications

Reclaim unused SaaS and Single sign-on \(SSO\) subscriptions to reduce your total software costs.

Reclamation rules define the minimum amount of time for which a subscription must be used. If the subscription doesn't have any activity within a specified time limit, it's added to the list of reclamation candidates.

For each direct integration, the user activity is defined differently. Only one of the listed activities is required to occur within the specified time limit, not all of them.

**Warning:** Make sure that users don't lose access to their files when their account is reclaimed. Users can't stop their account from being reclaimed unless the **Notify user** check box is selected on the reclamation rule.

Automatic reclamation is unavailable for some SaaS applications. For these applications, update or remove licenses manually from the application's admin portal.

User loginIf event reporting add-on is available on the user's account, the integration tracks user's last activity. For the list of activities, see [Event Reporting Reference](https://smartsheet-platform.github.io/event-reporting-docs/).

</td><td>

Yes

</td><td>

Based on the Smartsheet licensing model in use:-   Legacy model: Removes the user from your organization account.
-   User-based subscription model \(USM\): Downgrades the user from a paid Member seat to a free seat type:
    -   Users whose domain matches your organization's domain are downgraded to contributor.
    -   Users whose domain doesn't match your organization's domain are downgraded to guest.

Downgrading a user preserves their data and sheet access on the Smartsheet portal. If a downgraded user does not own any sheets and has no sheets shared with them, Smartsheet automatically deactivates that user.
