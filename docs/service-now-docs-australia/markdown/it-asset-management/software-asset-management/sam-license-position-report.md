# Software license compliance position

The Software Asset Management License Position report shows compliance details for each software model in a single list.

You can view and export the software model compliance list for your environment to understand your license position.

Two license metric results are generated if a software model has two entitlements, one with a perpetual SA license type and the other with a subscription license type. One license metric result where active maintenance is true and the other where the active maintenance is false. In such a scenario, two license position reports are generated, one with active maintenance true and the other one with active maintenance false.

A single license position report is generated if there are any unlicensed installations. A single license position report is also generated if there are any unlicensed subscriptions. If both are present, two license position reports are generated.
