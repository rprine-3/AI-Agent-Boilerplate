</table>4.  Select **Save**.

    The removal candidate record is created. If you selected the **Bulk Reclamation** check box, perform the following sub steps to add software installations, before proceeding to the next step. If you didn't select the **Bulk Reclamation** check box, proceed to the next step.

    1.  Select **Edit** in the Software Installation related list.

    2.  In the Edit Members page, move the software installations from the Collection box to the Software Installation List box.

        Only the software installations that are assigned to the specified user appear in the Collection box.

    3.  Select **Save**.

        The software installation you added appears in the Software Installations related list. The state of the removal candidate moves from **Attention Required** to **Ready** and a name is generated in the **Name** field. Continue to select **Edit** to add more software installations. If you decide to remove all software installations, then the state reverts back to **Attention Required** and the name no longer appears in the **Name** field. For the name to be generated and for the removal candidate to be in **Ready** state, at least one software installation must be selected in the removal candidate form.

5.  Select **Reclaim**.

    Once your software installation is reclaimed and removed from your system, the Software Installation column becomes empty. You can refer to the following fields on the Software installation related list to give you insights into the history of the reclaimed software installation.

    -   Display name
    -   Product
    -   Publisher
    -   Software model
    You may select any action button on the form to further configure the removal candidate. Action buttons are dependent on the removal candidate's justification and state.
