# License operations view

Use the License operations view in Software Asset Workspace to manage software asset operations. These operations include management of licenses, contracts, discovery, client access, resource value, user subscriptions, content suggestions, software asset success, cloud cost simulation, SAM implementation, IBM ASP, IBM ILMT V2 integrations, and engineering apps integrations.

You can access the License operations view by navigating to **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **License operations**.

The list view for the software assets on the License operations view shows the total number of records for your organization based on the value specified in the system property **SAM Workspace License operations list count limit** \(**sn\_sam\_workspace.sam\_license\_operations\_list\_count**\). The default value for the record count is set to **5000000**. However, the SAM administrator can set the value for the count in the system property as required. If there are less than five million records, then the exact count is shown. If there are more than five million records, then the count is shown as 5000000+.
