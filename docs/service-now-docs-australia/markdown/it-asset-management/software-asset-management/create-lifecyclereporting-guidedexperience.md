# Create a comprehensive lifecycle report using a guided experience

Use a guided experience to improve your lifecycle data completeness.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin or sam\_user

## About this task

This playbook is divided into four stages:

-   Getting ready
-   Engage content service
-   Use built-in tools
-   Finalize report

Each stage has one or more than one activity that you need to perform. Activities are typically performed sequentially. You can go back to those activities to complete them later.

    For a description of each field, see [SAM Success Goal Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-success-goal-details.md).

11. Select **Save** to move to the next page.

    Users with the sam\_admin role have two options. They can create a success activity task and assign it to themselves for immediate completion, or they can assign the task to subject matter experts, such as Product Owners, who can provide guidance on the appropriate values and parameters. While sam\_admins have the technical permissions to create lifecycle average records, they may not have the domain expertise to determine the correct values for specific products.

22. Select **New** in the Create lifecycle averages success activities page.

23. On the form, fill in the fields.
