</table>## Software product results

You can access Software Models, Unlicensed Installs, and Removal candidates related lists from a product result record.

A product result for a licensable product is generated after reconciliation even if there are no software models defined for the product.

**Note:** A Software Model Results record is only created when a software model or entitlement exists for the product.

For licensable products, a software model is automatically created for any unlicensed installs, subscriptions, or options in the Product Results list that do not have an entitlement by default. See [properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-properties.md) to change the **com.snc.samp.automaticsmrcreation** property setting. You can also set the **com.snc.samp.automaticsmcreation** property to have a software model created automatically for not-licensable products, if desired.

To view more information about a specific software product result, select an entry from the Product Results list. Refer to the following table for field descriptions.
