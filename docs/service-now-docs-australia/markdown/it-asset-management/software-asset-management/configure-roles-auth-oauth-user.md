# Configure roles and authorizations for the OAuth user

Create a role in SAP and assign the required authorization objects to the OAuth system user to support OData service access and background job execution for integration with the Software Asset Management application.

## Before you begin

The OAuth client must be configured in SAP before assigning roles to the OAuth user. See [Configure an OAuth client in SAP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/configure-oauth-client-sap.md).

SAP Role required: SAP Basis administrator

## About this task

Use transaction code **PFCG** to create a role and assign the authorization objects that grant the OAuth user access to OData services, background job scheduling, and OAuth scope management.

## Procedure

1.  Open transaction code **PFCG** in your SAP system.

2.  Enter a role name in the **Role** field and select **Create Single Role**.

    For example, `OAUTH_ROLE`.

3.  Add authorization object `S_SERVICE` and select the external service name `TADIR Service` in the **Type** field.

7.  Add authorization object `S_PROGNAM` and the following values in the corresponding fields.

    -   **P\_ACTION** — `BTCSUBMIT`
    -   **P\_PROGNAM** — `/NOW/SAMP_USER_PROG_BCKJOB_RUN`
    \[Omitted image "sap-config-oauth-prognam.png"\] Alt text: Adding authorization object for background jobs in SAP

8.  Save the role and assign it to the OAuth system user.

    For example, `OAUTH_USER`.


## Result

The OAuth user has the required authorizations to access OData services, run background jobs, and manage OAuth scopes for the integration.

## What to do next

Create an OAuth 2.0 SAP connection on your ServiceNow instance. For more information, see [Establish an SAP connection using OAuth 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/add-sap-connection-oauth.md).
