# Software Asset Management publisher pack for IBM

Use the Software Asset Management publisher pack for IBM to track and optimize licensing for your IBM software products. You can also use the publisher pack to track and optimize licensing for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Virtual Datacenters products.

To use the IBM publisher pack, activate the Software Asset Management Professional for IBM \(com.sn\_samp\_ibm\) [plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/t_RequSoftwareAssetMgmt.md).

The IBM publisher pack supports the following license metrics:

-   Authorized User
-   Authorized User Value Unit
-   Employee User Value Unit
-   External User Value Unit
-   Per Device
-   Per Named User
-   Per Processor
-   Per User
-   Processor Value Unit \(PVU\)
-   Resource Value Unit \(RVU\)
-   Virtual Processor Core \(VPC\)

**Important:** The PVU, RVU, and VPC license metrics are supported only if you integrate the IBM publisher pack with the IBM License Metric Tool \(ILMT\), BigFix Inventory, or a Software Asset Management provider that is authorized to participate in the IBM Client Value Acceleration \(CVA\) Program. For more information on ILMT and BigFix Inventory integrations, see [IBM License Metric Tool \(ILMT\) and BigFix Inventory integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/ibm-ilmt-bigfix-inventory-integration.md). For more information on Authorized SAM Provider \(ASP\) integrations, see [Client Value Acceleration \(CVA\) integrations for IBM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/ibm-asp-integration.md).

For more information on the supported IBM license metrics, see [Software license metrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/c_SAMLicenseMetrics.md).

**Important:** The IBM publisher pack is available as part of the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin. The publisher pack includes all capabilities that are required for tracking and managing both full capacity and sub-capacity PVU and RVU licenses for your IBM products. It does not require the legacy IBM PVU Process Pack to track and manage IBM PVU licenses. See [iBM PVU Process Pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/c_IBMPVUProcessPack.md) for more information on the legacy process pack.

When you run a discovery using a discovery tool such as the ServiceNow Discovery application, the discovery tool locates the IBM software installations in your environment and then imports the associated data into your ServiceNow instance. The Software Asset Management application compares this data against your IBM software entitlements to automatically reconcile your IBM software products, including products in complex server licensing scenarios.

**Important:** You must use different discovery tools based on the license metric that you are using for reconciliation, and if applicable, the type of IBM integration that you are using with the publisher pack:

-   **PVU and RVU license metrics**

    To reconcile your IBM software products using the PVU or RVU license metrics, you must use one of the following discovery tools:

    -   If you are integrating with the ILMT or BigFix Inventory, you must connect to these discovery tools using either version 1 or version 2 of the integration APIs.
    -   If you are integrating with a Software Asset Management provider that is authorized to participate in the IBM CVA Program, you must use the ServiceNow Discovery application in conjunction with the IBM License Compliance for Software Asset Management application.

-   **VPC license metric**

    To reconcile your IBM software products using the VPC license metric, you must use one of the following discovery tools:

    -   If you are integrating with the ILMT or BigFix Inventory, you must connect to these discovery tools using version 2 of the integration APIs.
    -   If you are integrating with a Software Asset Management provider that is authorized to participate in the IBM CVA Program, you must use the ServiceNow Discovery application in conjunction with the IBM License Compliance for Software Asset Management application.
-   **All other supported license metrics**

    To reconcile your IBM software products using any other supported license metric, including user-based license metrics like Authorized User and External User Value Unit, you can use any other discovery tool.


-   **[Supported IBM license types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/supported-ibm-license-types.md)**

You can use an IBM License Metric Tool \(ILMT\) or BigFix Inventory integration to create a connection between your IBM servers and the ServiceNow AI Platform. Use this connection to import data into your ServiceNow instance so that you can track and optimize licensing for your IBM software products.
-   **[Client Value Acceleration \(CVA\) integrations for IBM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/ibm-asp-integration.md)**  
Integrate the Software Asset Management publisher pack for IBM with authorized Software Asset Management providers to track and manage IBM licenses across virtualized VMware vSphere and Nutanix environments, and IBM LPAR infrastructures. These integrations help you to track and manage IBM licensing directly without integrating with theIBM License Metric Tool \(ILMT\) or BigFix Inventory.
