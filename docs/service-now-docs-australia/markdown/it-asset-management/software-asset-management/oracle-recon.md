# Oracle reconciliation

Oracle reconciliation keeps your Oracle license positions accurate and up-to-date without requiring manual calculations. Reconciliation runs weekly or on-demand.

When you run an Oracle reconciliation, Software Asset Management determines the **Rights Used By** and **Rights Needed By** allocations for the named users, physical devices, and physical hosts that are accessing or running an Oracle product. You can use this information to keep your Oracle products in compliance.

**Note:** Any allocations that you make on a physical host are considered valid. Software Asset Management marks these allocations as **Allocated in use** in the license workbench. Any allocations that you make on a virtual host, such as a virtual machine \(VM\), are considered invalid. Software Asset Management marks these allocations as **Allocated not in use**.

For Oracle database and WebLogic server licensing on VMware virtualization technology, you can select the level of aggregation for your reconciliation calculation using the **Select the level of aggregation for reconciling licenses for Oracle databases and WebLogic servers on VMware** property. You can also enable Software Asset Management to account for VM-Host affinity rules during Oracle reconciliation using the **Use host affinity for reconciling licenses for Oracle databases and WebLogic servers on VMware at the vCenter\(s\) aggregation level** property. See [Software Asset Management properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-properties.md) for information on these properties.
