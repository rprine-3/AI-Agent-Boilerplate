# Health check

Use the Health check dashboard to view the results of the health scan that is performed on the configurations in your Software Asset Management application.

To access the Health check dashboard, navigate to **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Success portal** &gt; **Health check**.

**Important:** Ensure that you’ve activated the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application and installed the ITAM Health Check application from [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/88804de177a94110ce3b5a11fe5a99c4/2.0.4?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%26q%3DITAM%2520health%2520check&sl=sh) to view the Health check dashboard. You must have the scan\_user and sam\_admin role to access this dashboard and view the health score data.

If you are on the Rome or the San Diego releases, you must execute the full scan to view the results in the base system scan dashboard. For details on executing a full scan, see [Execute full scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/hs-execute-full-scan.md).

Select **Domain** and choose a domain to view the health check results.

You can also perform a scan for a suite by selecting **Execute Scan**. Verify the scan result to act accordingly. For more information, see [.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/run-healthcheck.md)
