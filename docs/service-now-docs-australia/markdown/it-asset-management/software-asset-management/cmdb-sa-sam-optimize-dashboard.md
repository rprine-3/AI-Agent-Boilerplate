# Manage SAM advisor scope in CMDB success advisor

Manage the scope of your advisor for Software Asset Management \(SAM\) by editing the software products in CMDB success advisor to support your targeted SAM outcomes.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin or sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

Control which software products are included in the SAM advisor dashboard in CMDB success advisor. Add or remove individual software products, or select every product for a publisher at once.

## Procedure

1.  On the SAM advisor dashboard, select **Edit dashboard scope**.

2.  Review your previously selected software products, shown as already selected in the Edit dashboard scope dialog box.

    |Action|Result|
    |------|------|
    |Select **Select all** for an expanded publisher.|Adds every available software product for that publisher to your selection.|
    |Select the check box next to an individual software product.|Adds that software product to your selection.|
    |Select **Remove** next to a product in the selected products list.|Removes that software product from your selection.|

    **Note:** Only software products with a licensable product type that are flagged for reporting are available for selection. You can select up to 200 software products by default.

3.  Select **Save** to apply the changes.

    **Note:** If you save without making any changes to the selection, no confirmation message appears.


## Result

The SAM dashboard in CMDB success advisor is updated to reflect the data based on the software product selection. A confirmation message summarizes the software products added or removed. Dashboard metrics refresh once daily when the **CMDB Advisor - SAM Daily Data Collection** scheduled job runs. The scheduled job invokes the **CMDB success advisor data collection for SAM** Performance Analytics job to recalculate the pre-aggregated indicators used throughout the dashboard. For more information about Performance Analytics jobs, see [Collecting indicator scores](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_ClctData.md). Changes to your software product selection appear in the dashboard metrics after this job's next run, not immediately.
