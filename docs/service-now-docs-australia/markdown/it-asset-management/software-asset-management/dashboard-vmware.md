# Software Publisher Analytics dashboard for VMware in Software Asset Management classic

View compliance analysis results related to VMware on the Software Publisher Analytics dashboard in the Software Asset Management classic application.

Access the Software Publisher Analytics dashboard by navigating to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Publisher Overview**.

**Note:** The add-on VMware publisher pack \(com.sn\_samp\_vmware\) plugin must be installed to view the VMware dashboard tab.

The dashboard is updated whenever a new reconciliation result is available. You can save charts in PNG or JPG format.

## VMware dashboard

Information from VMware vCenter software is discovered and used for VMware reconciliation. Discovery uses these probes and populates these tables:

-   [vCenter probe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/vcenter-probes.md) VMware — vCenter ESX Hosts License
-   VMware Discovered License Key \[samp\_vmware\_license\_key\] and VMware Discovered License Key Consumption \[samp\_vmware\_license\_key\_usage\] tables

**Note:** The add-on VMware publisher pack \(com.sn\_samp\_vmware\) plugin must be installed to view the VMware dashboard tab.
