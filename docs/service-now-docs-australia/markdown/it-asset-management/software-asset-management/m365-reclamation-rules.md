If these individual subscriptions show low usage, Software Asset Management recommends reclaiming the low usage subscriptions.

-   **Low usage**

For example, if Office 365 individual subscriptions or subscriptions suites show low usage, Software Asset Management recommends reclaiming the low usage subscriptions.

-   **Downgrade**

For example, if an Office 365 E5 subscription including advanced features and capabilities with Power BI isn't being used, Software Asset Management recommends switching to a downgraded Office 365 E3 subscription.

-   Consolidate

 **Note:** The Overlapping and Consolidate use cases are applicable to all Microsoft 365 integration subscriptions.

</td><td>

-   **Overlapping**

For example, both Microsoft 365 E3 and Office 365 E3 subscriptions exist, leading to unnecessary duplicate access to Office applications and additional services already included in Microsoft 365 E3. Software Asset Management recommends reclaiming the Office 365 E3 subscriptions and using the Microsoft 365 E3 subscriptions instead.

-   **Low usage**

For example, if Microsoft 365 individual subscriptions or subscriptions suites show low usage, Software Asset Management recommends reclaiming the low usage subscriptions.

-   **Downgrade**

For example, if a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription including advanced features and capabilities with Power BI isn't being used, Software Asset Management recommends switching to a downgraded Microsoft 365 E3 subscription.

-   **Consolidate**

For example, if Office 365 Enterprise E5, Windows, and EMS subscriptions exist, Software Asset Management recommends using a single license such as Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 to cover these multiple products at a lower cost.
