# Software Asset Management publisher pack for Microsoft

The Software Asset Management publisher pack for Microsoft helps you track your license compliance position using Microsoft licensing metrics.

**Important:** To use the publisher pack, activate the Software Asset Management Professional for Microsoft plugin \(com.snc.samp.microsoft\).

Microsoft offers a wide variety of products that span from database servers to subscription services. Each Microsoft product follows its own licensing model, which can make it hard to track your license compliance position. With the Software Asset Management publisher pack for Microsoft, you can accurately track your license compliance position for Microsoft products. Reconciliation identifies licenses that are out of compliance and provides a list of remediation options. For more information, see [Software reconciliation for compliance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/c_SAMReconciliation.md).

To learn more about Microsoft licensing models, see [Microsoft licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing).

Set up ServiceNow Discovery to identify Microsoft installations on your network. For more information, see [Data collected by ITOM Visibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/data-collected-by-itom-visibility.md).

## Licensing models

The Software Asset Management publisher pack for Microsoft supports the following licensing models.

-   Per User
-   Per Device
-   Per Core
-   Per Core \(with CAL\)
-   User CAL
-   Device CAL
-   Server \(per instance\)
-   Server \(per server\)
-   Per Processor
-   User Subscription
-   Software Assurance

For more information, see [Supported Microsoft license types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/supported-microsoft-license-types.md).

If a PPN with a P+SA license type lacks a version assignment, a software model with the exact version is automatically applied. This automatic version assignment occurs both when creating an entitlement and when importing entitlements from a Microsoft License Statement \(MLS\). This automatic action correctly applies Microsoft assurance benefits to an entitlement. For details on the upgrade history of an entitlement, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **License operations** &gt; **Software entitlements** &gt; **Upgrade history**.

The **SAMP - Update generic PSA entitlements** fix script automatically updates the existing P+SA entitlements with version as anything, with the specific version, and applies the appropriate licensing terms.

## Permission types

The Software Asset Management publisher pack for Microsoft supports the following permission types to access data through Microsoft APIs. You can select the appropriate type of permission for your application to access data correctly and securely.

-   **Delegated type permission**

    These permissions enable the application to access data on behalf of a signed-in user, which means the application can access only the data that a signed-in user has access to.

-   **Application type permission**

    These permissions enable the application to access data without a signed-in user. The application can access any data that the permission is associated with.
