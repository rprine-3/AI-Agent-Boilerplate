# Link consumption rules to entitlements

After you've created a consumption rule, you must link the rule to one or more entitlements.

## Before you begin

Consumption rules aren't supported for the following license metrics:

-   IBM RVUs
-   IBM UVUs
-   Workday
-   Employee

The Entitlement Consumption Rules related list on the entitlement form doesn’t appear for these license metrics.

Role required: sam\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **License operations**.

2.  Open the entitlement to which you want to link the consumption rule.

3.  Select the Entitlement Consumption Rules related list.

4.  Select **New**.

    The Create New Entitlement Consumption Rule page opens.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Software entitlement**|The software entitlement to which you’re linking the consumption rule.|
    |**Consumption rule**|The consumption rule that you want to link this entitlement to.|
