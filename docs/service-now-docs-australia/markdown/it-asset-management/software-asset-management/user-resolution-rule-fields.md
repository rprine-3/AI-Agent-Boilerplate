# User resolution rule fields

Fields on the User Resolutions Rules page help you create a rule to map the **User** field in the Software Subscription \[samp\_sw\_subscription\] table to an associated user in the User \[sys\_user\] table within the ServiceNow AI Platform.

<table id="table_cn2_pzs_xcc"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Display name

</td><td>

Name of the user resolution rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Active

</td><td>

Option for enabling the user resolution rule. If this check box is cleared, this rule isn't applied to resolve user subscriptions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

Category of the integration profile that the user resolution rule applies to.-   **SaaS**
-   **SSO**

By default, this field value is set to **SaaS**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source table

</td><td>

Table that contains subscription records.Select **Software Subscription \[samp\_sw\_subscription\]**.

This field appears only when **SaaS** is selected from **Category**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Look up table

</td><td>

This field is automatically set to **User**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Applies to

</td><td>

One or multiple integration profiles to which the user resolution rule applies to.This field appears only when **SaaS** is selected from **Category**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Source field

</td><td>

A field in the Software Subscription \[samp\_sw\_subscription\] table used for lookup against the User \[sys\_user\] table, such as User principal name and External user id.As other columns might not contain sufficient data, select either **User principal name** or **External user id**.

This field appears only when **SaaS** is selected from **Category**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Look up field

</td><td>

The field against which you want to match the Source field value. For example, if you select **User principal name** in **Source field** and **Email** in **Look up field**, Software Asset Management tries to match these two fields. The match must be exact. If it isn’t, you can change the value to **User ID** in **Look up field**.

**Note:** User resolution rules created for non-indexed Look up fields in the sys\_user table are automatically marked as inactive. This applies to both manually created and AI-generated user resolution rules.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apply transform on input

</td><td>

Option to apply transformations to the **Source field** value.-   **None**: The **Source field** value is matched exactly with the **Lookup field** value.
-   **Remove domain**: If you have selected **Email** in **Look up field**, the first part of the email address \(before the @ symbol\), which is the User ID or name, is matched with the Source field value.
-   **Replace domain**: When you have selected **Email** in **Look up field** and you want to replace the domain name, that is, the second part of the email address \(after the @ symbol\). For example, replace `example.com` with `exampletest.com`.
-   **Run script**: This option is available only to administrators for updating the script.

</td></tr><tr><td>

New domain

</td><td>

The new domain that you want to add after the @ symbol when **Email** is selected in **Look up field**.This field appears only when **Replace domain** is selected from **Apply transform on input**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Script

</td><td>

**Important:** This field is available only to administrators.

 If the mapping still fails after replacing or removing the domain or the logic is complex, the script can be updated to achieve the desired result.
