Assignment Group

Name of the user group to which license is allocated. Software licenses are allocated to all the members of this assignment group based on the availability of unallocated licenses for the software entitlement.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

Status of the group allocation to the software model. When a group allocation is created, this field is automatically set to **New**. When the group allocation record is saved and the Software Asset Management application allocates licenses, the **Status** field value is automatically updated based on the availability of unallocated licenses. Possible values are:-   **Not allocated**: None of the group members are allocated to the software entitlement.
-   **Fully allocated**: All the members from the user group are allocated to the software entitlement.
-   **Partially allocated**: A partial number of group members are allocated to the software model.

Active

</td><td>

Option to indicate if the user group allocation to the software entitlement is active. When a group allocation is created, the **Active** field value is empty. When the record is saved, the **Active** field value gets updated. Possible values are:-   **true**: The allocation record is active and users from the assignment group are allocated to the software entitlement.
-   **false**: The allocation record is inactive and the users from the assignment group aren't allocated to the software entitlement. When a user group is changed to inactive, the group allocation record is marked as inactive and the **Allocated Quantity** field value is updated.
