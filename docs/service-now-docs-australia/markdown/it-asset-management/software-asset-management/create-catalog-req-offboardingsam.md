# Create a catalog request to reclaim assets

Create a catalog request to efficiently reclaim software assets when an employee leaves an organization or moves to a different role.

2.  In the Service Catalog page, enter `Reclaim asset` in the **Search catalog** field on the right-hand side of the page.

3.  Select **Reclaim Asset**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Fields|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |Requested by|The role of the person, such as HR, manager, or employee, who creates this catalog request.|
    |Requested for|Name of the person for who you are submitting the catalog request.|
