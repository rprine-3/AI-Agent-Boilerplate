# Software asset overview

Enhance your software asset management experience by using the modernized and user-friendly software asset overview view. The software asset overview is a simplified and intuitive environment that helps you use the application more effectively by reducing complexity.

Use the software asset overview view to:

-   Gain insights into key metrics such as compliance trends, true-up costs, potential savings, normalization rates.
-   Execute routine tasks such as running reconciliation or creating entitlements.
-   Get actionable insights into your software assets via alerts and notifications.
-   Sort by product or publisher to narrow down your results.
-   Filter by Published status to view reports and dashboards only related to the software products that you manage in a phase-wise implementation of Software Asset Management.

    **Note:** The Published status filter is shown only when the system property com.snc.samp.manage.published.products is enabled on your ServiceNow instance. By default, this filter is set to **Published** and the following reports show details of published products:

    -   Publishers out of compliance
    -   Products out of compliance
    -   Over-licensed amount
    -   Total true-up cost
    -   Top 5 publishers true-up cost
    -   Software spend
    However, you can also view reports related to the products that aren't published by setting this filter to **Unpublished**. To view reports related to all the products, clear the Published status filter.

Select any widget to view detailed information. All the widgets are updated whenever a new reconciliation result is available.

To narrow down your results, you can filter the workspace by publisher or product.

**Note:** If you select more than one publisher in the filter and then select the **Publishers out of compliance** widget, all non-compliant publishers are listed. The same is true for products.
