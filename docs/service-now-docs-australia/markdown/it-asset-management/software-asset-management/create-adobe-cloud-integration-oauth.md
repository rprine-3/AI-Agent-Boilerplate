# Create an Adobe Cloud integration profile using OAuth

Create an Adobe Cloud integration profile on your ServiceNow instance by using OAuth credentials to track your software subscriptions and to determine your license compliance.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin, sam\_integrator

Activate the following plugins:

-   Software Asset Management Professional for Adobe \(com.sn\_samp\_adobe\)

</table>3.  In the Process configuration section, view the required user roles or API permissions to minimize security risks and optimize SaaS licenses.

    **Note:**

    The **Download subscriptions** check box is selected by default and you can't clear it.

    For more information about the required roles and scopes, see [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/adobe-cloud-integration.md) table.

4.  Select **Submit**.

    The **Connection &amp; Credential** field appears on the form and is automatically set to **sn\_sam\_saas\_int.Adobe\_OAuth**.

5.  Select the preview icon \[Omitted image "preview-icon.png"\] beside the **Connection &amp; Credential** field to open the Connection &amp; Credential Aliases record.

6.  Select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

7.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Connection Name|Name of the Adobe Cloud connection.|
    |Connection URL \(Instance URL\)|URL for the connection. This field is automatically set to `https://<Instance Name>.adobelogin.com`. For more information about the steps to get the URL, see Step 9 in [Create a project and add APIs using OAuth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-adobe-cloud-oauth.md).|
    |OAuth Client ID|Client ID that you generated while [creating an Adobe Cloud OAuth credential](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-adobe-cloud-oauth.md).|
    |OAuth Client Secret|Client Secret that you retrieved while [creating an Adobe Cloud OAuth credential](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-adobe-cloud-oauth.md).|
    |OAuth Redirect URL|`https://<instance_name>/oauth_redirect.do`, where the instance name is the name of your ServiceNow instance.|
    |Organization ID|Adobe Cloud Organization ID that you find while [creating an Adobe Cloud OAuth credential](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/create-adobe-cloud-oauth.md).|

8.  Select **Create and Get OAuth Token**.

    **Note:** For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/adobe-cloud-integration.md) table.

9.  On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.


## Result

Adobe subscription data is pulled into Software Asset Management when the **SAM - Import Adobe User Subscriptions** scheduled job runs. When the subscription data is pulled, the **SAM - Optimize Adobe Subscriptions** scheduled job runs monthly to optimize the Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions. If complete subscription data isn't getting pulled accurately into the Software Asset Management application, see [Determine and verify Adobe subscription information in your ServiceNow instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/verify-adobe-info.md).

This job completion results in the following:

-   An optimization candidate that consolidates three \(configurable\) or more Single App or individual product subscriptions and recommends Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps when it isn't installed.
-   A reclamation candidate that reclaims Single App or individual product subscriptions with dual licenses when Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps is installed.

    Let's say, a user is subscribed to Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps and also consumes licenses for Single App or individual products such as Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Photoshop. In this dual license scenario, the Software Asset Management application recommends reclaiming the licenses for Single App or individual product subscriptions.

-   A reclamation candidate that reclaims three \(configurable\) or more Single App or individual product subscriptions that are actively used and an optimization candidate that recommends assigning Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps.

    Let's say, a user is subscribed to Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop and uses all these products actively. In this scenario, the Software Asset Management application recommends reclaiming the licenses for these individual product subscriptions and recommends using Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps.

-   A reclamation candidate that reclaims Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps when less than three \(configurable\) individual products are actively used and an optimization candidate that recommends assigning Single App or individual product subscriptions that are actively used.

    Let's say, a user is subscribed to Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps but is using less than three individual Creative Cloud products actively. In this scenario, the Software Asset Management application reclaims the Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps license and recommends assigning these individual product subscriptions that are actively used.


## What to do next

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/create-child-alias-saas.md).

View the subscription data by navigating to **All** &gt; **SaaS License** &gt; **All User Subscriptions**. You can check the status of the **SAM - Import Adobe User Subscriptions** job by navigating to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Job Results**.

You can also view information about your Adobe subscriptions, compliance, and costs on the [Office 365 &amp; Adobe Cloud dashboard in Software Asset Management classic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-saas-subscription-dash.md).

After creating an integration profile, view information about the profile in the Software Asset Workspace by navigating to **License operations** &gt; **User subscription** &gt; **Direct integration profiles**. You can select an integration profile to view the following related lists:

-   Software Models
-   Unrecognized Subscription Identifiers
-   Scheduled Jobs
-   Scheduled Job Results
-   Software Subscriptions
-   Subscription Identifier Exclusion Rule
-   Subscription User Exclusion Rule

After creating an integration profile, you can define subscription exclusion rules to keep certain subscriptions from license cost calculations. For more information, see [Subscription exclusions for SaaS and SSO applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/saas-license-management/subscription-exclusions.md).
