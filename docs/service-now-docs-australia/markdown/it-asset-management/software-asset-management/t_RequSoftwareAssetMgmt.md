# Request Software Asset Management

The ServiceNow® Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin requires a separate subscription. This plugin includes demo data. Depending on your environment, you may choose to request one or more related plugins.

## Before you begin

To purchase a subscription or load demo data after activation, contact your ServiceNow account manager. Within a few days, the account manager can activate the plugin and load any demo data on the production and non-production instances of your organization.

If you do not have an account manager, decide to delay activation until after your purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a non-production instance at no extra charge, you can use this procedure to submit a plugin activation request through the ServiceNow® Now Support Service Portal.

**Warning:** If you upgrade to the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin from the Software Asset Management plugin \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\), then you cannot revert to the Software Asset Management plugin \(com.snc.software\_asset\_management\).

Role required: admin
