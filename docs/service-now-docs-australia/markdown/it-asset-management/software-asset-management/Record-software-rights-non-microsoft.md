# Create maintenance entitlements in Software Asset Management classic

Define license details, for all publishers other than Microsoft, to manage all your software license maintenance needs such as start and end dates of your contracts and software upgrades.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Licensing** &gt; **Software Entitlements**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the Software Entitlement form, fill in the mandatory fields and select **Maintenance** in the **License type** field.

    For a detailed description of all the fields, refer to [Software entitlement fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/software-entitlement-fields.md).

    If the **Next Version** field is populated in the software model that the maintenance entitlement is associated with and the metric group selected in the maintenance entitlement is **Common**, then the maintenance entitlement is updated with the next version of the software model. Next version is applicable only for the **Common** metric group.

4.  Right-click the form header and select **Save**.

    **Note:** If you purchase a perpetual entitlement and associate only some of the rights of that entitlement with a maintenance entitlement, your perpetual entitlement is automatically split into two entitlements. For example, you purchased a perpetual entitlement with 50 active rights \(E1\). You associate 20 of these rights with 20 rights of a maintenance entitlement. Your E1 perpetual entitlement is now automatically split into two entitlements: one perpetual entitlement \(E1\) with 20 active rights \(and 50 purchase rights\) associated with 20 rights of the maintenance entitlement \(M1\) and another perpetual entitlement \(E2\) with 30 active rights without any maintenance association and no purchased rights.

5.  Perform additional configurations on your new maintenance entitlement record.

    For a detailed description, see [Software entitlement fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/software-entitlement-fields.md).

    You can't add user or device allocations for maintenance entitlements.

    1.  Enter information pertaining to finance such as the vendor from which the asset was purchased, the invoice number, in the **Financial** tab.

    2.  Enter information relating to contracts such as the lease contracts, the expiration date of the warranty in the **Contracts** tab.

    3.  Link related perpetual entitlements to your maintenance entitlement from the **Related Entitlements** tab.

        1.  Select the **Related Entitlements** tab.
        2.  In the **Related Entitlement** field of the Related Entitlements list, double-click **Insert a new row...**.
        3.  When prompted, search for and select the related perpetual entitlement that you want to link and then click the Save \(\[Omitted image "save-icon.png"\] Alt text: Save icon.\) icon.
        4.  Double-click the corresponding **Active rights** field.
        5.  When prompted, enter the number of rights that you want to grant to the related perpetual entitlement and then click the Save \(\[Omitted image "save-icon.png"\] Alt text: Save icon.\) icon.
        6.  Click **Save** on the Software Entitlement form header.
        To remove the relationship between the perpetual and maintenance entitlement, remove the entitlement from the Related Entitlements list.

        If the entitlement has split and you've deleted the maintenance entitlement, the perpetual entitlement is not removed.

    4.  View the downgrade rights for the software model associated with the maintenance entitlement in the **Downgrade Rights** related list.

    5.  To manage license keys, and specify which licenses keys are allocated to entitlements, click the **License Keys** related list

    6.  To track the cost of your software over its lifecycle, click the **Expense Lines** related list.

    7.  To view the history of all maintenance entitlements that you have purchased, click the**Entitlement History** related list.

        For example, if you purchased two maintenance entitlements, M1 \(which is now retired\) and M2 \(currently in use\), the Entitlement History related link displays both M1 and M2.

    8.  To view the history of the newly upgraded software model related to your entitlement and the previous software model, click the **Upgrade History** related list.

6.  Click **Update**.
