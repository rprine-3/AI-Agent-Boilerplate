# Engineering License Overview dashboard

Monitor and gain insights into your engineering applications license position and usage by viewing product usage reports in the Engineering License Overview dashboard.

**Note:** The Engineering License Overview dashboard is no longer available for new Australia users who have activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin or upgraded to Australia without activating the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia.

-   If you activated the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.snc.samp\) plugin prior to Australia but didn't activate the Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\), you have access to this dashboard.
-   If you activated the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application after upgrading to Zurich, you won’t be able to access this dashboard from the **Software Asset** navigation menu in your instance. You can however access this dashboard from the **Dashboards** navigation menu.

The Engineering License Overview dashboard displays reports on normalized products and publishers that belong to engineering applications such as AutoCAD, GIS.

Access the Engineering License Overview Dashboard by navigating to **Software Asset** &gt; **Engineering License Overview**.

To narrow your results based on products or publishers across all tabs, use the filter in the left-hand corner of the dashboard. Only products and publishers that belong to engineering applications and are listed in the Engineering Application License \[samp\_eng\_app\_license\] table appear in the filter. If no product or publisher is selected, the tabs display the cumulative data for all products and publishers that belong to engineering applications.

The **Overview**, **License Usage Summary**, and **Denial Summary** tabs are updated daily or whenever a new reconciliation result is available. You can save charts in PNG or JPG formats for viewing them locally and for sharing.

## Overview tab

This tab gives an overview of the high-level metrics of all engineering applications. You can filter the results in this tab by various date options.

**Note:** The Date filter is not applicable to **Current Spend** and **Potential Savings**.
