# Indicators used in the CMDB success advisor for SAM dashboard

Indicators enable viewing of high-level metrics that highlight data quality, completeness, and licensing compliance issues across software installs and their related configuration items \(CIs\).

## CMDB success advisor for SAM dashboard indicators

-   **Software installs**

    Total number of software installs from the Software Install \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table that are in the selected scope and associated with a normalized software product, grouped by discovery source.

-   **Installs by**

    Software installs from the Software Install \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table, grouped by a selectable dimension. Options include software publisher \(default\), normalized software product, the CI class of the CI hosting the install, or discovery source.

-   **Software installs by normalization status**

    Software installs from the Software Install \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table, grouped by normalized software product and the CI class of the CI hosting the install. Installs are further grouped by the normalization status recorded on the associated Software Discovery Model.

-   **Software installs missing edition**

    Total number of software installs from the Software Install \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table where the associated Software Discovery Model doesn't have an edition value populated.

-   **Software installs missing version**

    Total number of software installs from the Software Install \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table where the associated Software Discovery Model doesn't have a version value populated.

-   **Server installs missing cloud license**

    Total number of software installs on CIs where a cloud provider is populated and a cloud license type isn't populated. The count is limited to a defined set of qualifying software products that require cloud license tracking.

-   **Installs by CI install status**

    Software installs from the Software Install \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table, grouped by the install status of the CI hosting the install. On instances where the CSDM Activation plugin \(com.snc.cmdb.csdm.activation\) is active, this card is named **Installs by life cycle stages**, and installs are grouped by life cycle stage instead.

-   **CIs missing environment**

    Total number of CIs with a software install in the selected scope that don't have an environment value populated.

-   **CIs missing assigned to**

    Total number of CIs with a software install in the selected scope that aren't assigned to a specific user.

-   **Server CIs missing CPU attributes**

    Total number of CIs with a software install in the selected scope that are missing key CPU attributes needed for accurate license calculations.

-   **CIs not updated in the last 30 days**

    Total number of CIs with a software install in the selected scope that haven't been updated in the last 30 days.

-   **CIs not updated in the last 60 days**

    Total number of CIs with a software install in the selected scope that haven't been updated in the last 60 days.

-   **CIs not updated in the last 90 days**

    Total number of CIs with a software install in the selected scope that haven't been updated in the last 90 days.

-   **Duplicate CIs**

    Total number of software installs on CIs identified as duplicates, where the CI has an active follow-on de-duplication task in the Reconcile Duplicate Task \[reconcile\_duplicate\_task\] table. Counts are limited to installs of selected software products.

-   **Virtual machines without host CI relationships**

    Total number of software installs on Windows Server or Linux Server virtual CIs missing a Virtualized by::Virtualizes relationship to a host CI, scoped to selected SAM products. The check is limited to VMware ESX Server and Microsoft Hyper-V virtual infrastructure. Missing relationships can create gaps in licensing compliance tracking.

-   **Virtual CIs with incorrect host CI relationships**

    Total number of Virtualized by or Member of relationships for virtual server CIs, limited to VMware ESX Server and Microsoft Hyper-V virtual infrastructure. Relationship health analysis flags these relationships as incorrect or suggested for removal. On the KPI Details page, this indicator appears under the heading Incorrect infrastructure relationships.

-   **Install status distribution matched**

    Virtual server software installs where the install status, or life cycle stage, of the virtual server CI matches that of its related host CI.

-   **Install status distribution mismatched**

    Virtual server software installs where the install status, or life cycle stage, of the virtual server CI doesn't match that of its related host CI.


**Note:** Relationship-based indicators require the **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Compliance Processor** scheduled job to have run. If the job is inactive, the dashboard displays a message indicating that relationship data is incomplete, with an option to run the job. Metrics in the Virtual CI relationships section may be incomplete as a result.
