# Monitoring CMDB data quality using dashboard metrics in CMDB success advisor for SAM

The CMDB success advisor for Software Asset Management \(SAM\) dashboard enables CMDB administrators to identify and address data quality issues specific to software installs and their related configuration items \(CIs\) in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

**Important:** Charts display up to the top 10 values. Any remaining values are grouped into an **Others** category. When you select a segment or count on a chart from a CMDB success advisor dashboard, the KPI Details page opens. On the page, you can analyze how a specific metric trends over time. Additionally, the Remediation actions panel appears when remediation actions are available for that card. Use the panel to improve the quality of CMDB. To learn more, see [KPI Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/kpi-details.md) and [Improving CMDB data quality for SAM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/cmdb-sa-sam-remediation.md).

If the Performance Analytics data collector exceeds its row limit during data processing, a notification banner appears on the dashboard indicating that some metrics could not be loaded. For more information, see [Data collector Performance Analytics properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/pa-dc-props.md).

## Access the dashboard

To open the dashboard, select **View insights** for SAM on the CMDB success advisor landing page. See [Access CMDB success advisor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-sa-access.md).

**Note:** The CMDB success advisor for SAM dashboard is available only after the setup process is complete. For more information, see [CMDB success advisor for SAM setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/cmdb-sa-sam-config-settings.md).

</table>## Dashboard features

The dashboard provides clear, consolidated insights into software install data quality and CI accuracy. Use the dashboard to identify and resolve data quality issues within the CMDB through dedicated sub-tabs, filters, indicators, and visual reports.

Targeted CMDB metrics focus remediation efforts. Regularly monitor these metrics and follow suggested remediation actions to systematically improve CMDB data quality over time.

The dashboard header displays a **Last updated** timestamp reflecting the most recent completed run of the SAM data collector job.

**Important:** The dashboard data is filtered based on the Software publishers, Software products, CI class categories, and CI classes filters. See [Filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/cmdb-sa-sam-dashboard.md).

CMDB data quality insights generated by AI

</td><td>

Displays an AI-generated summary of CMDB data quality for SAM outcomes and lists the top 5 issues with guided remediation actions.Issues are ranked primarily by the percentage of CIs or CI classes that each issue affects, not by severity, within five categories, in this order: **Data integrity**, **CI attributes**, **Install attributes**, **Install status** \(or **Life cycle stage** on instances where the CSDM Activation plugin is active\), and **Virtual CI relationships**. Foundational data integrity issues, such as duplicate CIs and stale CIs, are evaluated first because they can inflate the counts behind other issues.

A percentage gap of more than 15 points between issues in the same category can change their default order. A percentage gap of more than 40 points between issues in different categories can also change their default order. For the reasoning behind the ranking and recommendations, see [Summarize CMDB readiness with the ServiceNow Otto skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/na-cmdb-skill-summ-rdy.md).

Select **View reasoning** to open the Reasoning popover, which explains the ranking and includes a **Learn more** link to the same topic.

**Note:** Available only when the summarize CMDB readiness skill is configured. See [Configure the summarize CMDB readiness skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/na-cmdb-config-summ-rdy.md).

</table>## Filters

Filters enable narrowing the data shown in charts and metrics based on software publisher, software product, CI category, or CI class.

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|Software publishers|List|Filters data based on the selected software publishers.|
|Software products|List|Filters data based on the selected software products. Narrows to the software products available for the selected publishers.|
|CI class categories|List|Filters data based on CI category. Only available when the CMDB CI Class Models plugin \(sn\_data\_model\_nav\) is active and you have read access to CI class data.|
|CI classes|List|Filters data based on CI class. Only available if you have read access to CI class data.|

**Note:** Filters cascade: narrowing the Software publishers selection narrows the available Software products, CI class categories, and CI classes options.

Select **Reset filters** to clear all filter selections and restore the dashboard to its default view.

**Note:** You need the pa\_viewer role to use the filters, including **Reset filters**.

</table>## Virtual CI relationships

Displays key metrics related to CI relationships that connect virtual machine installs to their host infrastructure. Accurate mappings enable licensing compliance.

**Note:** Run the **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Compliance Processor** scheduled job to populate virtual machine host relationship data. If the job is inactive, the dashboard displays a `Relationship data incomplete` alert with a **Run job** action. The dashboard metrics update after the **CMDB Advisor - SAM Daily Data Collection** scheduled job runs.
