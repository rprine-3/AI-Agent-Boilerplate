# Exploring Software Asset Management

The Software Asset Management application's user interface is enhanced to make it more user friendly and intuitive, allowing you to better manage your software installations.

Beginning with the ServiceNow AI Platform Australia release, we will provide limited support for the Software Asset Management classic user interface. While it will remain active in your instance, including when you upgrade to a new ServiceNow AI Platform release, we encourage you to move to the new workspace experience.

The Software Asset Management application's core functionality remains the same in both the user interfaces.

## Using the Software Asset Workspace

The Software Asset Management application is available with activation of the new Activate all Software Asset Management Professional plugins including Software Asset Workspace \(com.sn\_samp\_master\_ws\). Activating this plugin automatically activates the Activate all Software Asset Management Professional plugin \(com.sn\_samp\_master\) and the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application . After the new plugin is activated, you can't access the classic user interface.

For releases prior to Australia, if you activated the older Software Asset Management Professional plugin \(com.sn\_samp\_master\), the Software Asset Workspace is available with activation of the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\). After the Software Asset Workspace Workspace plugin is activated, you can't revert to the classic Software Asset Management application.

**Note:** After the Software Asset Workspace is activated, the menus in the classic Software Asset Management application are hidden for the features that have been moved to the Software Asset Workspace.

For detailed information on configuring and using the Software Asset workspace, refer to [Configuring Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/Config-sam-workspace.md) and [Software Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-workspace.md).

## Using the classic Software Asset Management application

To continue using the classic Software Asset Management application, you need to activate the Software Asset Management Professional \(com.sn\_samp\_master\) plugin.

If you later decide to use the Software Asset Workspace, you need to activate theSoftware Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application.

For detailed information on configuring and using the classic Software Asset Management application, refer to [Configuring Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/Config-sam-workspace.md) and [Using Software Asset Management Core UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/using-sam-classic.md).

## Menus that continue to reside in Software Asset Management classic

Even after you activate the Software Asset Workspace \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) store application, the following menus continue to remain in the classic framework:
