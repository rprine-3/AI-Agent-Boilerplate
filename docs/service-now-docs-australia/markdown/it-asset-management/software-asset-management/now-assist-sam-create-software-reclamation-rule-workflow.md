# ServiceNow Otto for Software Asset Management \(SAM\) AI agent collection to create software reclamation rule

Use the Create software reclamation rule agentic workflow to automatically create reclamation rules by identifying software products that lack reclamation rules but are viable candidates.

## Create software reclamation rule overview

Use the Create software reclamation rule agentic workflow to streamline and automate the creation of reclamation rules. Create reclamation rule without having to manually review a product’s utilization and spend thereby improving license utilization, faster turnaround, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced user satisfaction.

## Role masking

Roles required: sam\_admin.

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

## Create software reclamation rule agentic workflow

Automating the creation of reclamation rules helps SAM managers to scale their reclamation efforts by automatically identifying and suggesting reclamation rules for overlooked software.

To start the agentic workflow, you must have the sam\_admin role.

The Create reclamation rule agentic workflow can be initiated from the following pages:

-   Software asset overview page
-   Publisher details page
-   License operations page

Depending on the page, the sam\_admin role is on, follow the steps mentioned in the following table:

</table>The AI agent initiates a series of checks assessing factors such as the usage of the product with regard to spend and utilization, among other metrics. After the checks are completed, the AI agent provides you with details such as the name of the reclamation rule name, the assignment group with which the reclamation rules will get created. You’re then asked if you would like to create the reclamation rule with the given details or if you want to modify any parameters such as assignment group in the reclamation rule. Mention any modifications that you want; or else confirm that you want to go ahead with the creation of the reclamation rule. After you confirm, the reclamation rule gets created along with the name of the product and a link to the reclamation rule. The Activity tab in the reclamation rule record gets updated with the relevant work notes.
