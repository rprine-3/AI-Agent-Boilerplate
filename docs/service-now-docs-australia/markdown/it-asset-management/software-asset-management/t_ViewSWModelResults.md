# View software model results

View compliance information for software model results from the Product Results list after reconciliation is run.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_user

## About this task

You can view License Metric Results, Remediation Options, Licensed Installs, Unlicensed Installs, and Removal Candidates related lists for a software model result from a Product Result record. When the [Procurement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/c_Procurement.md) application \(com.snc.procurement\) is active, you can also create and view purchase orders directly from the Remediation Options form. More remediation options include automatically create and remove allocations, remove unallocated installs, and remove unlicensed installs.

For example, if the status of a product result shows that it isn’t compliant, you can drill down on the product result to view software model details. These details can include the number of unlicensed installs and the true-up cost to become compliant. Further, you can drill down on the software model result to view the license metric result, which is based on the entitlements for the product.

License metric result information includes rights owned and rights used as well as the license allocation breakdown so you can determine your options to become compliant. The Remediation Options related list shows the number of rights needed and calculates the cost of those rights for you, based on the license metric.

You can use the dashboard field action \[Omitted image "SAMdashboardIcon.png"\] icon on the Software Model Results form to view the Rights Owned vs Rights Used chart to forecast when additional licenses are needed.

**Note:** Software model results \(SMRs\) aren’t generated for software models for Oracle Database options without associated software entitlements. However, you can set the system property **com.snc.samp.unlicensed\_smr\_creation** to **True** to create SMRs for these models even if there are no entitlements.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Reconciliation** &gt; **Historical Results** and select a reconciliation result.

2.  On the Reconciliation Result form, select a Product Results record to view the product result details.

3.  In the Software Model Results related list, open a record to view the software model result details.

**Create Purchase Order** **Note:** The **Create Purchase Order** button creates a [purchase order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/t_CreateAPurchaseOrderLineItem.md) but is only shown when rights needed is greater than 0, and Procurement is active.

The **Create Purchase Order** button remains active until the purchase order has finished processing. Therefore, to avoid the creating a duplicate purchase order for the same item, wait to run reconciliation again until after the purchase order has finished processing.

</td><td>

When a purchase order is created, the status of any Purchase Rights remediation options for the same software model result are then set to Void.Purchase order fields **Part number**, **Metric group**, **License metric**, and **Ordered quantity** are automatically populated with the content from the remediation option.

 **Metric group** and **License metric** fields are added to the purchase order form so the entitlement can be automatically created when the order is complete.

 A notification is shown if at least one active purchase order line item exists for the software model.

 Once a purchase order is created, the **Purchase order** field, containing the purchase order reference, is added to the remediation option.
