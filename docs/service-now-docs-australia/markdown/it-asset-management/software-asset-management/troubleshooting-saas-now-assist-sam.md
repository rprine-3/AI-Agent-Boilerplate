## About this task

**Note:** The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection.

Starting with the Australia Patch 4 release, AWS Claude is the default model provider for the Error resolution recommendation and Error log summarization generative AI skill.

ServiceNow Otto for SAM generates the troubleshooting guidance for all SaaS and SSO integrations by enabling dynamic debug-level logging for flow actions and validating connections. The troubleshooting guidance is available for both current and new SaaS integrations.
