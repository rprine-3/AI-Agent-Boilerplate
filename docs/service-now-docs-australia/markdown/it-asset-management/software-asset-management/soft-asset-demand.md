# Create demand to rationalize software applications

Create demands to rationalize SaaS and SSO applications by discontinuing software subscriptions, reducing software usage, and migrating users to approved software.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin or sam\_user

**Note:** The sam\_admin and sam\_user roles must have the it\_demand\_user role to create demand.

The PPM Standard \(com.snc.financial\_planning\_pmo\) plugin must be installed to create demands.

The Software Asset Management application includes the following demand actions that are ready for you to use:

-   Discontinue after expiration
-   Migrate to approved product
-   Discontinue immediately
-   Reclaim licenses
-   No action

## About this task

Use the Overlapping usage view to drive SaaS and SSO application rationalization by viewing the feature level usage of each application. For more information, see [Overlapping usage view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/app-ration.md).

## Procedure

2.  Select the **Application feature usage** tab.

3.  Select the application in a category for which you want to create a demand.

4.  Select **Create demand**.

    The **Create demand** option is available only when you select an application that you want to create a demand for.
