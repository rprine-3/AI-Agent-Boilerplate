# Create a reclamation rule to import Microsoft SCCM usage data

To import your Microsoft SCCM data, create a reclamation rule for the product that you want the usage information for.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin

## About this task

A software product must have a product process, which consists of a filename, that is required for SCCM Usage to pull data. When adding a software product to a reclamation rule, any product processes associated with the software product are shown in the **Product Process** related list. Product processes are stored in the Software Product Process \[samp\_sw\_product\_process\] table.

If a product process doesn’t exist for a software product, you can create a custom one on the form. Product processes are stored in the Custom Product Process \[samp\_custom\_product\_process\] table.

Some software products may not include a product process, but new product processes are added twice every week through the content library updates.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Reclamation Rules** and select **New**.

2.  On the Reclamation Rule form, create a new record \(see table for field descriptions\).
