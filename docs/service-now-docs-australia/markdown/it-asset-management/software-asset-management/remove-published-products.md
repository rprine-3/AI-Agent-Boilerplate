# Remove published software products

Remove published software products that you no longer manage or report on as part of your Software Asset Management implementation.

## Before you begin

To be able to remove software products from the list of published software products, make sure that either the **com.snc.samp.manage.published.products** system property or the **com.snc.samp.manage.published.products** application property is enabled on your ServiceNow instance.

**Note:** The application property is domain-specific and available only on a ServiceNow instance that has domain separation activated for Software Asset Management. For more information, see [Domain separation and Software Asset Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/domain-separation-software-asset-management.md) and [Set the domain-specific property to publish your software products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/set-domain-specific-publish.md).

Role required: sam\_admin
