# Create a software removal candidate in workspace

Removal candidates reclaim software resources in your environment. They are created automatically from reclamation rules or can be created manually.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin or sam\_user

## About this task

Software reclamation is integrated with Workflow and Client Software Distribution to automate the process of uninstalling software from devices and reclaiming software rights. However, you can also create a removal candidate manually. The following steps are for manually creating a removal candidate.

Starting from the Australia release, the reclamation workflow can also be completed using the Software Reclamation Flow in the Flow Designer application with additional error handling functionality.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software asset** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace**.

2.  Select **License usage**.

3.  Select the **Removal candidates** tab.

4.  Select **New** to open the Create New Removal Candidate page.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</table>6.  Select **Save**.

    The removal candidate record is created. If you selected the **Bulk Reclamation** check box, the state of the removal candidate changes to **Attention Required**. Perform the following sub steps to add software installations before proceeding to the next step. If you didn't select the **Bulk Reclamation** check box, proceed to the next step.

    1.  Select **New** in the Software Installation related list.

    2.  Select a software installation and select **Save**.

        The software installation you added appears in the Software Installations related list. The state of the removal candidate moves from **Attention Required** to **Ready** and a name is generated in the **Name** field. Continue to select **New** to add more software installations. If you decide to remove all software installations, then the state reverts back to **Attention Required** and the name no longer appears in the **Name** field. For the name to be generated and for the removal candidate to be in **Ready** state, at least one software installation must be selected in the removal candidate form.

7.  Select **Reclaim**.

    Once your software installation is reclaimed and removed from your system, the Software Installation column becomes empty. You can refer to the following fields on the Software installation related list to give you insights into the history of the reclaimed software installation.

    -   Display name
    -   Product
    -   Publisher
    -   Software model
    You may select any action button on the form to further configure the removal candidate. Action buttons are dependent on the removal candidate's justification and state.
