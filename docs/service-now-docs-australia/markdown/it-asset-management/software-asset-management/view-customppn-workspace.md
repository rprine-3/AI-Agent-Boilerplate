# View publisher part number \(PPN\) suggestions in workspace

View Content Service suggestions for your custom PPNs and DMAPS in the Software Asset Workspace.

## Before you begin

PPN suggestions are available only if a corresponding match is found for your custom PPN in the Content Service. The PPN suggestion records are stored in the Part number suggestions \[samp\_sw\_part\_number\_suggestion\] table.

For information on custom part numbers, see [Custom publisher part numbers \(PPN\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/customppn-swap.md) and [Add a custom part number](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/sam-add-custom-part-number.md).

Role required: sam\_admin.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Software asset** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **License operations**.

    You can also view the part number suggestions from the **License Usage** view by navigating to the Publisher details page and the **Progress indicators** section.

2.  Select **Part number suggestions** from the Content suggestions list view.

3.  Open a suggestion record to view the Part number suggestion page.

    You can view the custom PPN details in the top part of the Part number suggestion page. The second half of the page contains the suggested part number details. All the entitlements where the custom PPN is used appear in the **Impacted entitlements** tab. All the software models where the custom DMAP is used appear in the **Impacted software models** tab. If no impacted software models exist, then this tab doesn't appear.

4.  Select **Accept** or **Reject**.

    -   **Accept**: The Content Service PPN and DMAP replace the custom PPN and DMAP. In the impacted entitlement, the Content Service PPN is replaced. Similarly, the Content Service DMAP is replaced on the software model.
    -   **Reject**: The status of this record changes to rejected and you continue to use the custom PPN.
